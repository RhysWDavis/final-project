[[Solomon Caesar Malan]]

CATEGORIES: 1812 births, 1894 deaths, People from Geneva, British orientalists, Kartvelian studies, Alumni of St Edmund Hall, Oxford

Solomon Caesar Malan (April 22, 1812 – November 25, 1894) was a British divine and orientalist.  By birth a Swiss descended from an exiled French family, Malan was born in Geneva, where his father, Dr Henri Abraham César Malan (1787–1864) enjoyed a great reputation as a Protestant divine.
From his earliest youth he manifested a remarkable faculty for the study of languages, and when he came to Scotland as tutor in the marquis of Tweeddale's family at the age of 18 he had already made progress in Sanskrit, Arabic and Hebrew. In 1833 he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford; and English being almost an unknown tongue to him, he petitioned the examiners to allow him to do his paper work of the examination in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Latin or Greek, rather than in English.
But his request was not granted. After gaining the Boden and the Pusey and Ellerton scholarships, he graduated 2nd class in Literae humaniores in 1837. He then proceeded to India as classical lecturer at Bishop's College, Calcutta, to which post he added the duties of secretary to the Bengal branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; and although compelled by illness to return in 1840, laid the foundation of a knowledge of Tibetan and Chinese.
After serving various curacies, he was presented in 1845 to the living of Broadwindsor, Dorset, which he held until 1886 During this entire period he continued to augment his linguistic knowledge; he was able to preach in Georgian, on a visit which he paid to Nineveh in 1872. His translations from the Armenian, Georgian and Coptic were numerous. He applied his Chinese learning to the determination of important points connected with Chinese religion, and published a vast number of parallel passages illustrative of the Book of Proverbs.
In 1880 the University of Edinburgh conferred upon him the honorary degree of D.D.
No modern scholar, perhaps, has so nearly approached the linguistic omniscience of Mezzofanti; but, like Mezzofanti, Dr Malan was more of a linguist than a critic. He made himself conspicuous by the vehemence of his opposition to Westcott and Hort's text of the New Testament, and to the transliteration of Oriental languages, on neither of which points did he have the general support of scholars. His extensive and valuable library, some special collections excepted, was presented by him in his lifetime to the Indian Institute at Oxford. He died at Bournemouth. His life has been written by his son.

[[Cutting fluid]]

CATEGORIES: Coolants, Metalworking, Lubricants, Petroleum products, Oils

Cutting fluid is a type of coolant and lubricant designed specifically for metalworking and machining processes. There are various kinds of cutting fluids, which include oils, oil-water emulsions, pastes, gels, aerosols (mists), and air or other gases. They may be made from petroleum distillates, animal fats, plant oils, water and air, or other raw ingredients. Depending on context and on which type of cutting fluid is being considered, it may be referred to as cutting fluid, cutting oil, cutting compound, coolant, or lubricant.
Most metalworking and machining processes can benefit from the use of cutting fluid, depending on workpiece material. Common exceptions to this are machining cast iron and brass, which are machined dry.
The properties that are sought after in a good cutting fluid are the ability to:

Creative nonfiction (also known as literary nonfiction or narrative nonfiction) is a genre of writing that uses literary styles and techniques to create factually accurate narratives. Creative nonfiction contrasts with other nonfiction, such as technical writing or journalism, which is also rooted in accurate fact, but is not primarily written in service to its craft. As a genre, creative nonfiction is still relatively young, and is only beginning to be scrutinized with the same critical analysis given to fiction and poetry.

CATEGORIES: Machine tools, Metalworking tools

A shaper is a type of machine tool that uses linear relative motion between the workpiece and a single-point cutting tool to machine a linear toolpath. Its cut is analogous to that of a lathe, except that it is (archetypally) linear instead of helical. (Adding axes of motion can yield helical toolpaths, as also done in helical planing.) A shaper is analogous to a planer, but smaller, and with the cutter riding a ram that moves above a stationary workpiece, rather than the entire workpiece moving beneath the cutter. The ram is moved back and forth typically by a crank inside the column; hydraulically actuated shapers also exist.

The McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, or the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence, was an exchange of letters (14 July 1915 to 30 January 1916)http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS094.pdf p.8 during World War I, between the Sharif of Mecca, Husayn bin Ali, and Sir Henry McMahon, British High Commissioner in Egypt, concerning the political status of lands under the Ottoman Empire. The Arab side was already looking toward a large revolt (which did not happen)against the Ottoman Empire; the British encouraged the Arabs to revolt and thus hamper the Ottoman Empire, which had become a German ally in the War after November 1914.http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS094.pdf p.7 
The letters declared that the Arabs would revolt in alliance with the United Kingdom, and in return the UK would recognize Arab independence. Later, the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement between France and UK was exposed showing that the two countries were planning to split and occupy parts of the promised Arab country.

[[Gaston Frommel]]

Gaston Frommel (born November 25, 1862, Altkirch, France died May 17, 1906, Geneva), French theologian, professor of theology in the University of Geneva from 1894 to 1906.
An Frenchman by birth, his family fled Alsace under German occupation in 1870 and he spent the rest of his life in Switzerland. He may best be described as continuing the spirit of Vinet amid the mental conditions marking the end of the 19th century.
Like Vinet, he derived his philosophy of religion from a peculiarly deep experience of the Gospel of Christ as meeting the demands of the moral consciousness; but he developed even further than Vinet the psychological analysis of conscience and the method of verifying every doctrine by direct reference to spiritual experience. Both made much of moral individuality or personality as the crown and criterion of reality, believing that its correlation with Christianity, both historically and philosophically, was most intimate. But while Vinet laid most stress on the liberty from human authority essential to the moral consciousness, the changed needs of the age caused Frommel to develop rather the aspect of man's dependence as a moral being upon God's spiritual initiative, "the conditional nature of his liberty." "Liberty is not the primary, but the secondary characteristic" of conscience; "before being free, it is the subject of obligation." On this depends its objectivity as a real revelation of the Divine Will.
Thus he claimed that a deeper analysis carried one beyond the human subjectivity of even Kant's categorical imperative, since consciousness of obligation was "une experience imposée sous le mode de l'absolu." By his use of imposée Frommel emphasized the priority of man's sense of obligation to his consciousness either of self or of God. Here he appealed to the current psychology of the subconscious for confirmation of his analysis, by which he claimed to transcend mere intellectualism. In his language on this fundamental point he was perhaps too jealous of admitting an ideal element as implicit in the feeling of obligation. Still he did well in insisting on priority to self-conscious thought as a mark of metaphysical objectivity in the case of moral, no less than of physical experience. Further, he found in the Christian revelation the same characteristics as belonged to the universal revelation involved in conscience, viz., God's sovereign initiative and his living action in history. From this standpoint he argued against a purely psychological type of religion (agnosticisme religieux; as he termed it)--a tendency to which he saw even in A Sabatier and the symbolofidéisme of the Paris School—as giving up a real and unifying faith. His influence on men, especially the student class, was greatly enhanced by the religious force and charm of his personality. Finally, like Vinet, he was a man of letters and a penetrating critic of men and systems.

[[Constituent assembly]]

CATEGORIES: Constituent assemblies, Constitutional conventions

A constituent assembly (sometimes also known as a constitutional convention or constitutional assembly) is a body or assembly of representatives composed for the purpose of drafting or adopting a constitution. As the fundamental document constituting a state, a constitution cannot normally be modified or amended by the state's normal legislative procedures; instead a constituent assembly, the rules for which are normally laid down in the constitution, must be set up. A constituent assembly is usually set up for its specific purpose, which it carries out in a relatively short time, after which the assembly is dissolved. A constituent assembly is a form of representative democracy.
Unlike forms of constitution-making in which a constitution is unilaterally imposed by a sovereign lawmaker, the constituent assembly creates a constitution through “internally imposed” actions, in that members of the constituent assembly are themselves citizens, but not necessarily the rulers, of the country for which they are creating a constitution.Id. at 125    As described by Columbia University Social Sciences Professor Jon Elster:
 
 Constitutions arise in a number of different ways.  At the non-democratic extreme of the spectrum, we may imagine a sovereign lawgiver laying down the constitution for all later generations.  At the democratic extreme, we may imagine a constituent assembly elected by universal suffrage for the sole task of writing a new constitution.  And there are all sorts of intermediate arrangements.Axel Hadenius, ed., Democracy’s Victory and Crisis, Ch 7: Ways of constitution-making by Jon Elster (p. 123); Cambridge University Press, 1997. 431 pp 9780521573115

After holding the pastorate at Aubenas in the Ardèche from 1864 to 1868 he was appointed professor of reformed dogmatics in the theological faculty of Strasbourg. His markedly French sympathies during the war of 1870 led to his expulsion from Strassburg in 1872. After five years' effort he succeeded in establishing a Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris, L'Ecole de Paris (today: Institut de théologie protestante de Paris) with Eugène Ménégoz and became professor and then dean. In 1886 he became a teacher in the newly founded religious science department of the École des Hautes Etudes of the Sorbonne.
Among his chief works were:
These works show Sabatier as "at once an accomplished dialectician and a mystic in the best sense of the word."

Metalworking is the process of working with metals to create individual parts, assemblies, or large-scale structures. The term covers a wide range of work from large ships and bridges to precise engine parts and delicate jewelry. It therefore includes a correspondingly wide range of skills, processes, and tools.  
Metalworking is a science, art, hobby, industry and trade. Its historical roots span cultures, civilizations, and millennia. Metalworking has evolved from the discovery of smelting various ores, producing malleable and ductile metal useful for tools and adornments. Modern metalworking processes, though diverse and specialized, can be categorized as forming, cutting, or joining processes. Today's machine shop includes a number of machine tools capable of creating a precise, useful workpiece.

Paul Sabatier (August 3, 1858 – March 4, 1928), was a French clergyman and historian who produced the first modern biography of St. Francis of Assisi. He is the brother of Auguste Sabatier.
He was born at St. Michel de Chabrillanoux in the Cévennes, and was educated at the faculty of theology in Paris.  In 1885 he became vicar of St Nicolas, Strasbourg, but in 1889, declining an offer of preferment which was conditional on his becoming a German subject, he was expelled.
For four years he was pastor of St. Cierge in the Cévennes and then devoted himself entirely to historical research. He had already produced an edition of the Didache, and in November 1893 published his important Life of Francis of Assisi. This book gave a great stimulus to the study of medieval literary and religious documents, especially of such as are connected with the history of the Franciscan Order. In 1908 he delivered the Jowett Lectures on Modernism at the Passmore Edwards Settlement, London.
Paul Sabatier's Life of St. Francis of Assisi was placed upon the Index of Forbidden Books by the Catholic Church because of the unreliable retelling of the saint's story.
In 1919, Sabatier became professor of Protestant theology at Strasbourg.

[[Coilgun]]
CATEGORIES: Artillery by type, Electric motors, Magnetic propulsion devices, Non-rocket spacelaunch

A coilgun (or Gauss gun, in reference to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who formulated mathematical descriptions of the magnetic effect used by magnetic accelerators) is a type of projectile accelerator consisting of one or more coils used as electromagnets in the configuration of a linear motor that accelerate a ferromagnetic or conducting projectile to high velocity. In almost all coilgun configurations, the coils and the gun barrel are arranged on a common axis.
Coilguns generally consist of one or more coils arranged along a barrel, so the path of the accelerating projectile lies along the central axis of the coils. The coils are switched on and off in a precisely timed sequence, causing the projectile to be accelerated quickly along the barrel via magnetic forces. Coilguns are distinct from railguns, as the direction of acceleration in a railgun is at right angles to the central axis of the current loop formed by the conducting rails. Also, railguns usually require the use of sliding contacts to pass a large current through the projectile or sabot but coilguns do not necessarily require sliding contacts. Whilst some simple coilgun concepts can use ferromagnetic projectiles or even permanent magnet projectiles, most designs for high velocities actually incorporate a coupled coil as part of the projectile.

President Abraham Lincoln was forced to divert several regiments of militia and volunteer troops from following up after the Battle of Gettysburg to control the city. The rioters were overwhelmingly working-class men, primarily ethnic Irish, resenting particularly that wealthier men, who could afford to pay a $300 ([tpl]Inflation|US|300|1863|fmt=eq[/tpl]) commutation fee to hire a substitute, were spared from the draft."The Draft in the Civil War", u-s-history.com.William Bryk, "The Draft Riots, Part II", New York Press blogpost, August 2, 2002. 
Initially intended to express anger at the draft, the protests turned into a race riot, with white rioters, mainly but not exclusively Irish immigrants, attacking blacks wherever they could be found. At least 11 blacks are  estimated to have been killed. The conditions in the city were such that Major General John E.

[[Eugène Rambert]]

CATEGORIES: 1830 births, 1886 deaths, Swiss writers

Eugène Rambert (April 6, 1830 – November 21, 1886), was a Swiss author.
He was born at Sâles near Swiss Clarens, the eldest son of a Vaudois schoolmaster, from whom he received his education. When in 1845 his father lost his post owing to the religious disputes, Rambert became a teacher in Paris, and later a tutor in England and at Geneva. When the family's fortunes improved, Rambert was able to pursue his studies for the ministry, but he was more attracted by literature, and in 1845 became professor of French literature at the academy of Lausanne, and in 1860 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, where he remained till 1881, when he again became professor at Lausanne.
His principal work, Les Alpes suisses (5 vols., 1866–1875; republished with large additions, according to his own scheme, in 6 volumes, 1887–1889), is a mine of miscellaneous information on the subject. He also published several volumes of poetry, as well as a volume entitled Écrivains nationaux (1874, republished 1889), and biographies of the pietist Alexandre Vinet (1875), of the poet Juste Olivier (1879) and of the artist Alexandre Calame (1883).
Rambert's Dernières Poesies were edited (1903) by Henri Warnery, whose Eugène Rambert (Lausanne, 1890) contains a critical estimate.

[[Juste Olivier]]

CATEGORIES: 1807 births, 1876 deaths, Swiss poets

Juste Daniel Olivier (1807 - January 7, 1876), Swiss poet, was born near Nyon in the canton of Vaud; he was brought up as a peasant, but studied at the college of Nyon, and later at the academy of Lausanne.
Though originally intended for the ministry, his poetic genius (foreshadowed by the prizes he obtained in 1825 and 1828 for poems on Marcos Botzaris and Julia Alpinula respectively) inclined him towards literary studies. He was named professor of literature at Neuchâtel (1830), but before taking up the duties of his post made a visit to Paris, where he completed his education and became associated with Sainte-Beuve, especially from 1837 onwards. He professed history at Lausanne from 1833 to 1846, when he lost his chair in consequence of the religious troubles.
He then went to Paris, where he remained till 1870, earning his bread by various means, but being nearly forgotten in his native land, to which he remained tenderly attached. From 1845 till 1860 (when the magazine was merged in the Bibliothèque universelle) Olivier and his wife wrote in the Revue suisse the Paris letter, which had been started by Sainte-Beuve in 1843, when Olivier became the owner of the periodical. After the war of 1870 he settled down in Switzerland, spending his summers at his beloved Gryon, and died at Geneva on 7 January 1876.
Besides some novels, a semi-poetical work on the Canton of Vaud (2 vols., 1837-1841), and a volume of historical essays entitled Etudes d'histoire nalionale (1842), he published several volumes of poems, Deux Voix (1835), Chansons lointaines (1847) and its continuation Chansons du soir (1867), and Sentiers de montague (Gryon, 1875).
His younger brother, Urbain Olivier, was also a writer.

It was common in much of Europe.
The system of appanage has greatly influenced the territorial construction of France and the German states and explains the structure of the flags of many provinces of France.[tpl]Clarify|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Appanage also describes the funds given by the state to certain royal families — the annual income, for instance, given to the Swedish and Danish Royal Families. For the Mongols, khubi (share) refers to appanage in the Middle Ages.

Kenneth Whyld (6 March 1926 – 11 July 2003) was a British chess author and researcher, best known as the co-author (with David Hooper) of The Oxford Companion to Chess, the standard single-volume chess reference work in English.
Whyld was a strong amateur chess player, taking part in the British Chess Championship in 1956 and winning the county championship of Nottinghamshire. He subsequently made his living in information technology while writing books on chess and researching its history.
As well as The Oxford Companion to Chess, Whyld was the author of other reference works such as Chess: The Records (1986), an adjunct to the Guinness Book of Records and the comprehensive The Collected Games of Emanuel Lasker (1998). He also researched more esoteric subjects, resulting in works such as Alekhine Nazi Articles (2002) on  articles in favour of the Nazi Party supposedly written by world chess champion Alexander Alekhine, and the bibliographies Fake Automata in Chess (1994) and Chess Columns: A List (2002).
From 1978 until his death in 2003, Whyld wrote the "Quotes and Queries" column in the British Chess Magazine.
Shortly after Whyld's death, the Ken Whyld Association was established with the aim of compiling a comprehensive chess bibliography in database form and promoting chess history.
Whyld's library was later sold to the Musée Suisse du Jeu, located on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland (as reported in number 152 of EG).

A refracting or refractor telescope is a type of optical telescope that uses a lens as its objective to form an image (also referred to a dioptric telescope). The refracting telescope design was originally used in spy glasses and astronomical telescopes but is also used for long focus camera lenses. Although large refracting telescopes were very popular in the second half of the 19th century, for most research purposes the refracting telescope has been superseded by the reflecting telescope which allows larger apertures. A refractor's magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the optical tube by the focal length of the eyepiece.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northern-stars.com/tel_magnification.htm|title=Telescope Calculations|publisher=Northern Stars|accessdate=2013-12-20[/tpl]

[[Optical telescope]]

CATEGORIES: Telescopes, Dutch inventions

An optical telescope is a telescope that gathers and focuses light, mainly from the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, to create a magnified image for direct view, or to make a photograph, or to collect data through electronic image sensors.
There are three primary types of optical telescope:
A telescope's light gathering power and ability to resolve small detail is directly related to the diameter (or aperture) of its objective (the primary lens or mirror that collects and focuses the light).  The larger the objective, the more light the telescope collects and the finer detail it resolves.
People use telescopes and binoculars for activities such as observational astronomy, ornithology, pilotage and reconnaissance, and watching sports or performance arts.

Ernest Augustus I (5 June 1771 – 18 November 1851) was King of Hanover from 20 June 1837 until his death. He was the fifth son and eighth child of George III, who reigned in both the United Kingdom and Hanover. As a fifth son, initially Ernest seemed unlikely to become a monarch, but Salic Law, which barred women from the succession, applied in Hanover and none of his older brothers had legitimate male issue. Therefore, he became King of Hanover when his niece, Victoria, became Queen of the United Kingdom, ending the personal union between Britain and Hanover that had existed since 1714.
Ernest was born in England, but was sent to Hanover in his adolescence for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces in Wallonia against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. In 1799, he was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale. Although his 1815 marriage to the twice-widowed Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz met with the disapproval of his mother, Queen Charlotte, it proved a happy relationship. By 1817, King George III had only one legitimate grandchild, Princess Charlotte of Wales, and when she died in childbirth, Ernest was the senior son to be both married and not estranged from his wife. This gave him some prospect of succeeding to the British throne. However, both of his unmarried older brothers quickly married, and King George's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, fathered the eventual British heir, Princess Victoria of Kent (later Queen Victoria).
Ernest was active in the House of Lords, where he maintained an extremely conservative record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet and had fathered a son by his sister, Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom. Before Victoria succeeded to the British Throne, it was rumoured that Ernest intended to murder her and take the Throne himself. When King William IV died on 20 June 1837, Ernest ascended the Hanoverian Throne. Hanover's first ruler to reside in the kingdom since George I, he had a generally successful fourteen-year reign, but excited controversy when he dismissed the Göttingen Seven (including the two Brothers Grimm) from their professorial positions for agitating against his policies.

[[Stalemate]]
CATEGORIES: Chess terminology, Chess rules

Stalemate is a situation in the game of chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal move. The rules of chess provide that when stalemate occurs, the game ends as a draw (i.e. having no winner).
During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game. In more complicated positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive. Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems.
The outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 19th century. Before this standardization, its treatment varied widely, including being deemed a win for the stalemating player, a half-win for that player, or a loss for that player; not being permitted; and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn.
Some regional chess variants have not allowed a player to play a stalemating move. In different versions of suicide chess, another chess variant, stalemate may or may not be treated as a draw.
The word stalemate is also used for a metaphor when a conflict has reached an impasse and resolution seems difficult or impossible (i.e. a no-win situation).

The Battle of Carthage was the main engagement of the Third Punic War between the Punic city of Carthage in Africa and the Roman Republic. It was a siege operation, starting sometime  between 149 and 148 BC, and ending in spring 146 BC with the sack and complete destruction of the city of Carthage.
After a Roman army under Manius Manilius landed in Africa in 149 BC, Carthage surrendered and handed over hostages and arms. However, the Romans demanded the complete surrender of the city, and surprisingly to the Romans the city refused, the faction advocating submission overturned by one in favor of defense.
The Carthaginians manned the walls and defied the Romans, a situation which lasted for two years. In this period, the 500,000 Carthaginians inside the wall transformed the town into a huge arsenal. They produced about 300 swords, 500 spears, 140 shields and 1,000 projectiles for catapults daily.Appian of Alexandria, The Punic Wars, "The Third Punic War"
The Romans elected the young but popular Scipio Aemilianus as consul, a special law being passed to lift the age restriction. Scipio restored discipline, defeated the Carthaginians at Nepheris, and besieged the city closely, constructing a mole to block the harbor.
In spring 146 BC, the Romans broke through the city wall but they were hard-pressed to take the city. Every building, house and temple had been turned into a stronghold and every Carthaginian had taken up a weapon. The Romans were forced to move slowly, capturing the city house by house, street by street and fighting each Carthaginian soldier who fought with courage born of despair. Eventually after hours upon hours of house-to-house fighting, the Carthaginians surrendered. An estimated 50,000 surviving inhabitants were sold into slavery. The city was then leveled. The land surrounding Carthage was eventually declared ager publicus, and it was shared between local farmers, and Roman and Italian ones.
Before the end of the battle, a dramatic event took place: 900 survivors, most of them Roman deserters, had found refuge in the temple of Eshmun, in the citadel of Byrsa, although it was already burning. They negotiated their surrender, but Scipio Aemilianus expressed that forgiveness was impossible either for Hasdrubal, the general who defended the city, or for the defectors. Hasdrubal then left the Citadel to surrender and pray for mercy (he had tortured Roman prisoners in front of the Roman armyAppian, Punica 118). At that moment Hasdrubal's wife allegedly went out with her two children, insulted her husband, sacrificed her sons and jumped with them into a fire that the deserters had started.Appian of Alexandria,The Punic Wars, "The Third Punic War"
The deserters too then hurled themselves into the flames, upon which Scipio Aemilianus began weeping. He recited a sentence from Homer's Iliad,Homer: Iliad; book 6 a prophecy about the destruction of Troy, that could be applied now to Carthage's end. Scipio declared that the fate of Carthage might one day be Rome's.Polybius: Histories, Book XXXVIII, Excidium Carthaginis, 7–8 and 20–22. English translation and comments by W. R. Patton. Loeb classical library, 1927, pp. 402–409 and 434–438.Online text of Polybius Histories In the words of Polybius:

It has been maintained as a tourism booster for the city since.  Since then, the term "Conch Republic" has been expanded to refer to "all of the Florida Keys, or, that geographic apportionment of land that falls within the legally defined boundaries of Monroe County, Florida, northward to 'Skeeter's Last Chance Saloon' in Florida City, Dade County, Florida, with Key West as the nation's capital and all territories north of Key West being referred to as 'The Northern Territories'."A brief history of the Conch Republic
While the protest that sparked the creation of the Conch Republic (and others which have occurred since then) have been described by some as "tongue-in-cheek", they were motivated by frustrations over genuine concerns. The original protest event was motivated by a U.S. Border Patrol roadblock and checkpoint which greatly inconvenienced residents and was detrimental to tourism in the area.

[[Has-a]]

CATEGORIES: Object-oriented programming, Relational algebra

In database design and object oriented program architecture, has-a is a relationship where one object (often called the composited object) "belongs" to (is a part or member of) another object (called the composite type), and behaves according to the rules of ownership. In simple words, has-a relationship in an object is called a member field of an object. Multiple has-a relationships will combine to form a possessive hierarchy. This is contrasted with an Is-a relationship which constitutes a different kind of hierarchy (subtyping). The decision whether the most logical relationship for an object and its subordinate is not always clearly has-a or is-a. Confusion over such decisions have necessitated the creation of these metalinguistic terms.  A good example of the has-a relationship is containers in the C++ STL.

[[Alexander Ewing]]

CATEGORIES: 1814 births, 1873 deaths, People from Aberdeen, Bishops of Argyll and The Isles

Alexander Ewing (25 March 1814 – 22 May 1873) was a Scottish church leader.[tpl]cite book |title=Scottish Episcopal Clergy, 1689-2000 |last=Bertie |first=David M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=T & T Clark |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-567-08746-8 |page=251[/tpl]
He was born of an old Highland family in Aberdeen, Scotland. In October 1838 he was admitted to deacon's orders, and after his return from Italy he took charge of the episcopal congregation at Forres, and was ordained a presbyter in the autumn of 1841. In 1847 he was consecrated bishop of the newly united Diocese of Argyll and The Isles, the duties of which position he discharged till his death. In 1851 he received the degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford.
Though hampered by poor health, he worked cheerfully, and his personal charm and Catholic sympathies gradually won him a prominent position. In theological discussion he was tolerant, and attached little importance to ecclesiastical authority and organization. His own theological position had close affinity with that of Thomas Erskine of Linlathen and Frederick Denison Maurice; but his opinions were independent. The trend of his teaching is only to be gathered from fragmentary publications—letters to the newspapers, pamphlets, special sermons, essays contributed to the series of Present Day Papers, of which he was the editor, and a volume of sermons entitled Revelation considered as Light.
Besides his strictly theological writings, Ewing was the author of the Cathedral or Abbey Church of Iona (1865), the first part of which contains drawings and descriptive letterpress of the ruins, and the second a history of the early Celtic church and the mission of St Columba.
Ewing's daughter Margaret Nina married Alexander Crum printer and MP in 1863.

John McLeod Campbell (May 4, 1800 – February 27, 1872) was a nineteenth-century Scottish minister and Reformed theologian. In the opinion of one German church historian, contemporaneous with Campbell, his theology was a highpoint of British theology during that century.Otto Pleiderer, The Development of Theology in Germany since Kant and its Progress in Great Britain since 1825, Macmillian and Co., New York, New York, 1890, p. 382.  "I regard their (Thomas Erskine of Linlathen's and John Mcleod Campbell's) ideas as the best contribution to dogmatics which British theology has produced in the present century." James B. Torrance ranked him highly on the doctrine of the atonement, placing Campbell alongside Athanasius of Alexandria and Anselm of Canterbury.James B. Torrance, Scottish Journal of Theology, #26, 1973, p. 295. Campbell took his cue from his close reading of the early church fathers, the historic Reformed confessions and catechisms, John Calvin, Martin Luther's commentary on Galatians, and Jonathan Edwards' works.On this the reading of the The Whole Proceedings..., shows how widely read Campbell really was, particularly with regard to Reformed theology outside of the Westminster Standards. That he continued reading widely may be seen in his dialogue in On the Nature of the Atonement with past theologians like Martin Luther, John Owen, Jonathan Edwards, and contemporary theologians like Pye Smith, George Payne, Thomas Jenkyns, Thomas Chalmers, and others.

U.S. Route 46 (US 46) is an east–west U.S. Highway completely within the state of New Jersey, running for [tpl]convert|75.34|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl], making it the shortest signed, non-spur U.S. Highway. The west end is at an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80) and Route 94 in Columbia, Warren County on the Delaware River. The east end is in the middle of the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River in Fort Lee, Bergen County while the route is concurrent with I-95 and US 1-9. Throughout much of its length, US 46 is closely paralleled by I-80. US 46 is a major local and suburban route, with some sections built to or near freeway standards and many other sections arterials with jughandles. The route runs through several communities in the northern part of New Jersey, including Hackettstown, Netcong, Dover, Parsippany-Troy Hills, Wayne, Clifton, Ridgefield Park, Palisades Park, and Fort Lee. The road has been ceremonially named the United Spanish-American War Veterans Memorial Highway.
What is now US 46 was originally designated as three separate routes. Pre-1927 Route 5 was created in 1916 to follow the road from Delaware to Denville, pre-1927 Route 12 in 1917 to follow the route between Hackettstown and Paterson, and pre-1927 Route 10 in 1917 to run between Paterson and Edgewater. In 1927, Route 6 was legislated to run from Delaware east to the George Washington Bridge, replacing portions of Routes 5 and 12 and paralleling the former Route 10, which itself became Route 5 and Route 10N, the latter being shortly removed from the state highway system. In 1936, US 46 was designated to run from US 611 in Portland, Pennsylvania east to the George Washington Bridge. The route replaced Pennsylvania Route 987 to the Delaware Bridge over the Delaware, and from there followed Route 6 across New Jersey. In 1953, the Route 6 designation was removed from US 46 in New Jersey, and later that year, the route was realigned to end at US 611 in Columbia, New Jersey, replacing a part of Route 94. US 611 had been brought into New Jersey by two new bridges over the Delaware River, following a freeway between them that became a part of I-80. By 1969, US 611 was aligned back into Pennsylvania, and US 46’s western terminus remained as an interchange with I-80 and Route 94.

[[Wired intelligence]]

CATEGORIES: Robotics

The term wired intelligence refers to a robot that has no programmed microprocessor.  Instead, the robot has a particular connection of wires and analog electronics between its sensors and motors that gives it seemingly intelligent actions.  These actions can be complex enough to create a quadruped robot that seeks out the brightest light source.
The groundwork for these theories is laid in "Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology" by Valentino Braitenberg.

Route 162 is an unsigned [tpl]convert|0.70|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long state highway in Lower Township, New Jersey, United States. The highway's designation consists entirely of a bridge on Seashore Road (County Route 626), which is known as Relocated Seashore Road. The southern terminus of the highway is an intersection with County Routes 641 and 626 in Lower Township. After crossing the Cape May Canal, Route 162 terminates at an intersection with County Routes 603 and 626 in Lower Township. Route 162 and County Route 626 date back to the 1850s, when local businessmen and county financial Richard Holmes put together the Cape May Turnpike. The turnpike was chartered in 1854, but construction did not begin until 1857, with completion in April of the next year. The turnpike however, caused a lot of controversy, and struggled to live. For many years, railroads were proposed, becoming possible competition for Holmes, who did not appreciate the idea. The railroad was constructed in 1863, just nine years after the charter of the turnpike syndicate.
Route S4C was designated by the New Jersey Legislature in 1929 as a spur of Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9), beginning at Bennett and running south on Seashore Road and Broadway, past Sunset Boulevard to the Delaware Bay. Route S4C was never taken over by the state. However, when the United States Army Corps of Engineers built the Cape May Canal during World War II, Seashore Road was chosen as one of two roads to cross the canal. (The other was Route 4, now Route 109). The Army Corps built a low level bridge close to the pre-canal alignment. The New Jersey Department of Transportation built a higher bridge in 1971 on a new alignment.

[[Foetus (band)]]

CATEGORIES: J. G. Thirlwell, Musical groups established in 1981, Australian post-punk groups

Foetus is the primary musical outlet of J. G. Thirlwell. Until 1995 the band underwent various name changes, all including the word foetus. Monikers adopted at different times include Foetus Under Glass, You've Got Foetus On Your Breath and Scraping Foetus Off The Wheel. After 1995 the name permanently became Foetus, though the related project The Foetus Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1997 and continues.
Thirlwell acts as the sole instrumentalist, vocalist, songwriter and producer for all Foetus works and as such is the only member of the band. Other artists may occasionally collaborate with Thirlwell on Foetus works but are not considered members of Foetus. Thirlwell is solely responsible for the musical output of the band.
J. G. Thirlwell has many side-projects, in which he frequently goes by the name Clint Ruin. One such grouping is Wiseblood with former Swans member Roli Mosimann. The material tends toward the realm of the darkest and most sexual Foetus songs, with Mosimann's Swans lineage showing in the slow, crushing pacing of many tracks. Thematically, Wiseblood's lyrics center around the misanthropic exertion of power, typically via murder, sex or assault. Wiseblood existed on-and-off from the mid-1980s through early 1990s.

The Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station was a highway bridge over the Delaware River in the community of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station). Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when the new one upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|5000|1914[/tpl][/tpl] today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route 6 in 1927 and U.S. Route 46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|275000|1932[/tpl][/tpl] today) before accepting the sale. This amount was a far cry from the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|60000|1932[/tpl][/tpl] today) and $50,000 (equal to $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|50000|1932[/tpl][/tpl] today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route 6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered toll-free for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Although Reverend Darlington was still alive to see all this transpire, the Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April 3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.

CATEGORIES: 68k Macintosh computers, Macintosh desktops, Macintosh LC series, Macintosh case designs

The Macintosh LC (meaning low-cost color) is Apple Computer's product family of low-end consumer Macintosh personal computers in the early 1990s. The original Macintosh LC was released in October 1990 and was the first affordable color-capable Macintosh. Due to its affordability and Apple II compatibility the LC was adopted primarily in the education and home markets. Together with the Mac IIsi, it introduced built-in audio input on the Mac. The "LC" name was subsequently used for a line of low-end Macintosh computers for several years and spanned the 68k to PowerPC transition.

Palo Duro Canyon is a canyon system of the Caprock Escarpment located in the Texas Panhandle near the city of Amarillo, Texas, United States.TPWD: Palo Duro Canyon As the second largest canyon in the United States, it is roughly [tpl]convert|60|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long and has an average width of [tpl]convert|6|mi|abbr=on[/tpl], but reaches a width of [tpl]convert|20|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] at places. Its depth is around [tpl]convert|820|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], but in some locations it can increase up to [tpl]convert|997|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Palo Duro Canyon (from the Spanish meaning "hard wood")'Palo Duro Canyon Park web site' has been named "The Grand Canyon of Texas" both for its size and for its dramatic geological features, including the multicolored layers of rock and steep mesa walls similar to those in the Grand Canyon. 
The canyon was formed by the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River, which initially winds along the level surface of the Llano Estacado of West Texas, then suddenly and dramatically runs off the Caprock Escarpment.  Water erosion over the millennia has shaped the canyon's geological formations.
Notable canyon formations include caves and hoodoos. One of the best known and the major signature feature of the canyon is the Lighthouse Peak. A multiuse, six-mile round trip loop trail is dedicated to the formation. The middle portion of the trail can be hot with little shade, and hikers should take plenty of water.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/060609/loc_447973076.shtml|title=Logan G.

The Battle of Yarmouk ([tpl]lang-ar|معركة اليرموك[/tpl], also spelled Yarmuk, Yarmuq or, in Greek, Hieromyax, Ἱερομύαξ, or Iermouchas, Ιερμουχάς) was a major battle between the Muslim Arab forces of the Rashidun Caliphate and the armies of the Eastern Roman Empire. The battle consisted of a series of engagements that lasted for six days in August 636, near the Yarmouk River, along what is today the border between Syria and Jordan, south-east of the Sea of Galilee. The result of the battle was a complete Muslim victory which ended Byzantine rule in Syria. The Battle of Yarmouk is regarded as one of the most decisive battles in military history,[tpl]Harvnb|Walton|2003|p=30[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Nicolle|1994|p=6[/tpl] and it marked the first great wave of Islamic conquests after the death of prophet Muhammad, heralding the rapid advance of Islam into the then Christian Levant.
In order to check the Arab advance and to recover lost territory, Emperor Heraclius had sent a massive expedition to the Levant in May 636. As the Roman army approached, the Arabs tactically withdrew from Syria and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmouk plains close to Arabia where, after being reinforced, they defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army.
The battle is also considered to be one of Khalid ibn al-Walid's greatest military victories. It cemented his reputation as one of the greatest tacticians and cavalry commanders in history.[tpl]Harvnb|Nicolle|1994|p=19[/tpl]

[[Reflecting telescope]]
CATEGORIES: Telescopes, Telescope types, 1663 introductions

A reflecting telescope (also called a reflector) is an optical telescope which uses a single or combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image. The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century as an alternative to the refracting telescope which, at that time, was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration. Although reflecting telescopes produce other types of optical aberrations, it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives. Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors. Reflecting telescopes come in many design variations and may employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position. Since reflecting telescopes use mirrors, the design is sometimes referred to as a "catoptric" telescope.

In other traditions, as in Theosophy, it is believed to be connected with the pineal gland. According to this theory, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland. Dr. Rick Strassman has theorized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of DMT (dimethyltryptamine), an entheogen which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.[tpl]cite book |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule.

Service was primarily to small-to-medium sized cities and towns where larger aircraft might not be economical to operate and also to larger markets to either provide additional capacity or more frequent flights than could be justified using mainline aircraft.  Beginning in July, 2009, the Northwest Airlink trade name was phased out, and replaced by the Delta Connection trade name, for Delta Air Lines as part of the Delta/Northwest merger.

This treaty was independently formulated under the administration of the Republican Warren G. Harding, who had defeated the Democratic candidate, James M. Cox, in the 1920 presidential election. Cox had supported the contentious clauses of the Treaty of Versailles that established a League of Nations.

[[United Express]]

United Express is the brand name for the regional branch of  United Airlines, under which eleven individually owned regional airlines operate short and medium haul feeder flights. Mainline carriers often use regional airlines to operate services in order to increase frequency, serve routes that would not sustain larger aircraft, or for other competitive reasons. They primarily connect smaller cities with United's domestic hub airports and focus cities, although they offer some point-to-point service such as Sacramento to Eureka.
On October 1, 2010, UAL Corporation and Continental Airlines merged to form United Continental Holdings, the holding company for the newly merged United Airlines. As Continental and United merged, Continental Connection and Continental Express has gradually adopted the United Express brand name, bringing the number of operators to twelve and the number of aircraft to over 550. The first aircraft painted into the new United Express livery was an Embraer ERJ-145 operated by ExpressJet.
As of November 30, 2011, after United had received its Single Operating Certificate following its merger with Continental Airlines, nearly 550 aircraft fly under the United Express brand.
On July 1, 2010, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. announced that Colgan Air would be merged into Mesaba Airlines. In September 2010, SkyWest, Inc., announced the merger of Atlantic Southeast Airlines and ExpressJet which will make ExpressJet the largest United Express carrier post merger.

The Treaty of Rapallo was an agreement signed at the Hotel Imperiale in the Italian town of Santa Margherita Ligure on 16 April, 1922 between Germany and Russia under which each renounced all territorial and financial claims against the other following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and World War I.
The two governments also agreed to normalise their diplomatic relations and to "co-operate in a spirit of mutual goodwill in meeting the economic needs of both countries".
It was a spinoff of the Genoa Conference, which included Germany and the Soviet Union. It had broken down when France demanded that the Soviets assume the prewar debt incurred by the tsarist regime and on immediate reparations by the Germans to the USSR. The German and Russian delegates quietly slipped away and met at Rapallo.  
The Treaty was negotiated by Georgi Chicherin, foreign minister of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, and his German counterpart Walther Rathenau. Ratifications were exchanged in Berlin on January 31, 1923. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on September 19, 1923.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 19, pp. 248-252.  The treaty did not include secret military provisions; however secret military cooperation soon followed.Gordon H. Mueller, "Rapallo Reexamined: A New Look at Germany's Secret Military Collaboration with Russia in 1922," Military Affairs (1976) 40#3 pp 109-117 in JSTOR
A supplementary agreement signed in Berlin on November 5 extended the treaty to cover Germany's relations with Soviet republics of Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and the Far Eastern Republic. Ratifications were exchanged in Berlin on October 26, 1923, and the supplementary protocol was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on July 18, 1924.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 26, pp. 388-394.
The agreement was reaffirmed by the Treaty of Berlin, 1926.

The Locarno Treaties were seven agreements negotiated at Locarno, Switzerland, on 5–16 October 1925 and formally signed in London on 1 December, in which the First World War Western European Allied powers and the new states of Central and Eastern Europe sought to secure the post-war territorial settlement, and return normalizing relations with defeated Germany (which was, by this time, the Weimar Republic). Ratifications for the Locarno treaties were exchanged in Geneva on 14 September 1926, and on the same day they became effective. The treaties were also registered in the League of Nations Treaty Series on the same day.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 54, pp. 290–301.
Locarno divided borders in Europe into two categories: western, which were guaranteed by Locarno treaties, and eastern borders of Germany with Poland, which were open for revision, thus leading to German renewed claims to the Free City of Danzig and Polish territories approved by the League of Nations including the Polish Corridor, and Upper Silesia.Gustav Stresemann during the Locarno negotiations.

Galileo's ship refers to two physics experiments, a thought experiment and an actual experiment, by Galileo Galilei, the famous 16th and 17th century physicist, astronomer, and philosopher. The experiments were created to argue the idea of a rotating Earth as opposed to a stationary Earth around which rotated the Sun and planets and stars.
An argument that was in the air at the time was that if the earth were rotating, there would be detectable effects on the trajectories of projectiles or falling bodies.

[[Conflict theories]]

CATEGORIES: Sociological theories, Social philosophy, Theories of history, Sociocultural evolution, Identity politics, Sociology index

Conflict theories are perspectives in sociology that emphasize the social, political, or material inequality of a social group, that critique the broad socio-political system, or that otherwise detract from structural functionalism and ideological conservativism. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class conflict, and generally contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro level analysis of society. Karl Marx is the father of the social conflict theory, which is a component of the 4 paradigms of sociology. Certain conflict theories set out to highlight the ideological aspects inherent in traditional thought. Whilst many of these perspectives hold parallels, conflict theory does not refer to a unified school of thought, and should not be confused with, for instance, peace and conflict studies, or any other specific theory of social conflict.

The Westminster Confession of Faith is a Reformed confession of faith. Drawn up by the 1646 Westminster Assembly as part of the Westminster Standards to be a confession of the Church of England, it became and remains the "subordinate standard" of doctrine in the Church of Scotland, and has been influential within Presbyterian churches worldwide.
In 1643, the English Parliament called upon "learned, godly and judicious Divines",  to meet at Westminster Abbey in order to provide advice on issues of worship, doctrine, government and discipline of the Church of England. Their meetings, over a period of five years, produced the confession of faith, as well as a Larger Catechism and a Shorter Catechism.  For more than three centuries, various churches around the world have adopted the confession and the catechisms as their standards of doctrine, subordinate to the Bible.
The Westminster Confession of Faith was modified and adopted by Congregationalists in England in the form of the Savoy Declaration (1658).  Likewise, the Baptists of England modified the Savoy Declaration to produce the Second London Baptist Confession (1689).  English Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists would together (with others) come to be known as Nonconformists, because they did not conform to the Act of Uniformity (1662) establishing the Church of England as the only legally approved church, though they were in many ways united by their common confessions, built on the Westminster Confession.

William Ashley "Billy" Sunday (November 19, 1862 – November 6, 1935) was an American athlete who, after being a popular outfielder in baseball's National League during the 1880s, became the most celebrated and influential American evangelist during the first two decades of the 20th century.William G. McLoughlin, Jr., Billy Sunday Was His Real Name (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1955), xvii: "By 1917 he was considered by many the greatest revivalist in American history, perhaps the greatest since the days of the apostles."
Born into poverty in Iowa, Sunday spent some years at the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home before working at odd jobs and playing for local running and baseball teams. His speed and agility provided him the opportunity to play baseball in the major leagues for eight years, where he was an average hitter and a good fielder known for his base-running.
Converted to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left baseball for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his skills as a pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist before the advent of electronic sound systems. He also made a great deal of money and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely played a significant role in the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.
Despite questions about his income, no scandal ever touched Sunday. He was sincerely devoted to his wife, who also managed his campaigns, but his three sons disappointed him. His audiences grew smaller during the 1920s as Sunday grew older, religious revivals became less popular, and alternative sources of entertainment appeared. Nevertheless, Sunday continued to preach and remained a stalwart defender of conservative Christianity until his death.

[[Flying boat]]

CATEGORIES: Flying boats, Seaplanes and flying boats

A flying boat is a fixed-winged seaplane with a hull, allowing it to land on water. It differs from a float plane as it uses a purpose-designed fuselage which can float, granting the aircraft buoyancy. Flying boats may be stabilized by under-wing floats or by wing-like projections (called sponsons) from the fuselage. Flying boats were some of the largest aircraft of the first half of the 20th century, exceeded in size only by bombers developed during World War II. Their advantage lay in using water instead of expensive land-based runways, making them the basis for international airlines in the interwar period. They were also commonly used for maritime patrol and air-sea rescue.
Following World War II, their use gradually tailed off, partially because of the investments in airports during the war. In the 21st century, flying boats maintain a few niche uses, such as for dropping water on forest fires, air transport around archipelagos, and access to undeveloped or roadless areas. Many modern seaplane variants, whether float or flying boat types, are convertible amphibian aircraft where either landing gear or flotation modes may be used to land and take off.

[[Adam of Saint Victor]]

CATEGORIES: Christian religion-related songwriters, Medieval composers, 1146 deaths, Christian mystics, Year of birth unknown

Adam of Saint Victor (died 1146)It was previously believed that he died late 12th century (e.g. 1192 http://archive.org/stream/newinternational01gilm#page/101/mode/1up), but that is now believed to be false was a prolific poet and composer of Latin hymns and sequences. He is believed to have sparked the expansion of the poetic and musical repertoire in the Notre Dame school with his strongly rhythmic and imagery-filled poetry.
The first reference to him is from 1098, in the archives of Notre Dame Cathedral, where he was first a subdeacon, and later a precentor. He left the cathedral for the Abbey of Saint Victor around 1133, probably because of his attempts at imposing the Rule of St Augustine at the cathedral.
Adam probably had contact with a number of important theologians, poets, and musicians of his day, including Peter Abelard and Hugh of St Victor, and he may have taught Albertus Parisiensis.
Adam of St Victor’ surviving works are sequences for liturgical use, not theological treatises.These texts were gradually rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Thirty-seven of his hymns were published in the Elucidatorium Ecclesiasticum of Jodocus Clichtovaeus, a Catholic theologian of the 16th century. The remaining seventy hymns were preserved in the Abbey of Saint Victor until its dissolution during the French Revolution. They were then transferred to the Bibliothèque Nationale, where they were discovered by Léon Gautier, who edited the first complete edition of them (Paris, 1858).The critical edition of these texts is Jean Grosfillier, ed, Les sequences d’Adam de Saint-Victor: Étude littéraire (poétique et rhétorique). Textes et traductions, commentaires, Bibliotheca Victorina 20, (Turnhout: Brepols, 2008), pp252-481. They are now fully translated in Adam of Saint-Victor, Sequences. Introduction, Text, Translation, and Notes by Juliet Mousseau, Dallas Medieval Texts, (Leuven: Peeters, 2011). In addition, Hugh Feiss, On Love, (2010), p71, argues that three additional Marian sequences seem likely to be by Adam of St Victor. The Latin text is in Bernadette Jollès, ed, Quatorze proses du XIIe siècle à louange de Marie, (Turnhout: Brepols, 1994). Around 47 sequences by Adam survive. In a practice that developed from the ninth century onwards, these are poems composed to be sung during the mass, between the Alleluia and the gospel reading. The sequence therefore bridges the Old Testament or epistle readings and the gospel, both literarily and musically.Boyd Taylor Coolman and Dale M Coulter, eds, Trinity and creation: a selection of works of Hugh, Richard and Adam of St Victor, (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), p182.

[[List of topics characterized as pseudoscience]]
CATEGORIES: Fringe science, Pseudoscience, Scientific skepticism, Science-related lists

This is a list of topics that have, at one point or another in their history, been characterized as pseudoscience by academics or researchers. These characterizations were made in the context of educating the public about questionable or potentially fraudulent or dangerous claims and practices - efforts to define the nature of science, or humorous parodies of poor scientific reasoning.  Criticism of pseudoscience, generally by the scientific community or skeptical organizations, involves critiques of the logical, methodological, or rhetorical bases of the topic in question.[tpl]sfn|Pollak|2002[/tpl] Though some of the listed topics continue to be investigated scientifically, others were only subject to scientific research in the past and today are considered refuted but resurrected in a pseudoscientific fashion. Other ideas presented here are entirely non-scientific, but have in one way or another infringed on scientific domains or practices.  Many adherents to or practitioners of the topics listed here dispute their characterization as pseudoscience.
Each section summarizes the pseudoscientific aspects of that topic.

In demonology, and according to Johann Weyer and his Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, Pruflas is a Great Prince and Duke of Hell that has twenty-six legions of demons under his command. He causes men to commit quarrels, discord, and falsehood, and should be never admitted into any place, but if conjured, he gives truthful, generous answers to the conjurer's questions.
He is depicted as a flame outside the Tower of Babel, where he uses to reside, and sometimes his head is seen as that of a hawk.

[[Finite geometry]]
CATEGORIES: Finite geometry, Combinatorics

A finite geometry is any geometric system that has only a finite number of points.
The familiar Euclidean geometry is not finite, because a Euclidean line contains infinitely many points. A geometry based on the graphics displayed on a computer screen, where the pixels are considered to be the points, would be a finite geometry. While there are many systems that could be called finite geometries, attention is mostly paid to the finite projective and affine spaces because of their regularity and simplicity.  Other significant types of finite geometry are finite Möbius or inversive planes and Laguerre planes, which are examples of a general type called Benz planes, and their higher-dimensional analogs such as higher finite inversive geometries.
Finite geometries may be constructed via linear algebra, starting from vector spaces over a finite field; the affine and projective planes so constructed are called Galois geometries.  Finite geometries can also be defined purely axiomatically. Most common finite geometries are Galois geometries, since any finite projective space of dimension three or greater is isomorphic to a projective space over a finite field (that is, the projectivization of a vector space over a finite field). However, dimension two has affine and projective planes that are not isomorphic to Galois geometries, namely the non-Desarguesian planes.  Similar results hold for other kinds of finite geometries.

[[Julian Solís]]

CATEGORIES: 1957 births, Living people, Puerto Rican boxers, Bantamweight boxers, World boxing champions, World bantamweight boxing champions, World Boxing Association champions, People from San Juan, Puerto Rico

Julian Solís (born 7 January 1957) is a former boxer from Puerto Rico. He was born in the San Juan area of Río Piedras, but because of the closeness of his birthplace to Caguas, he often trained at the Bairoa Gym in Caguas. His training base, however, was the Caimito Gym. 
A former WBA Bantamweight champion, Solis is the only world champion in a family that produced two other world-class boxers: brother Enrique was outpointed by WBA Featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza, and brother Rafael was knocked out in five rounds by WBC Super featherweight champion Héctor Camacho in 1983. 
Solis began his professional boxing career in 1975, outpointing Ray Negron in four on 11 November. He won his first five fights in Puerto Rico, and then had his first international fight in December 1975, when he beat Juan Gómez in St. Maarten by a knockout in round two.  On 12 February 1978, he met fringe contender Nivio Nolasco, outpointing him over ten rounds, and travelled to the Dominican Republic, where on 15 March he outpointed Leopoldo Frias also in ten rounds. With a record of 12-0 and 5 knockouts, he returned to the Dominican Republic, where he challenged Julio Soto Solano on 16 October for the "Latin American Bantamweight title", winning the regional belt by outpointing Solano over 12 rounds. 
In 1979, he won four fights, including one over Julio C. Saba knocked out in eight rounds in Buenos Aires.  Solis continued on his travels in 1980.  He retained the Latin American title with a 12th round knockout of future world title challenger Edgar Roman in Venezuela, won a fight in South Africa, and challenged the WBA Bantamweight champion Jorge Luján in Miami on 29 August, winning on points.
For his first defence, Solis returned to Miami, but he lost the belt and his undefeated record to Jeff Chandler on November 14 when he was knocked out in the fourteenth round.  After beginning 1981 with a win, he met Chandler again on 25 July, at Atlantic City, New Jersey. This time Chandler did the job in half the time, knocking out Solis in the seventh round. His next fight, with Kiko Bejines (later to die in a boxing related accident) in Los Angeles, also resulted in a seventh round knockout defeat.
Solis started 1982 by winning two fights in San Juan and another one in Chile. By 1983, he was a popular performer in televised fights, often held in small Puerto Rican cities. He won four fights in Puerto Rico that year, and drew in Panama with the Number One ranked Super bantamweight, Bernardo Checa. In 1984, he won three fights, including a ten round decision over future world champion Kenny Mitchell on the 8 December undercard of the Azumah Nelson - Wilfredo Gómez WBC Featherweight championship bout in San Juan.  In 1985, Solis fought only once, outpointing David Campo.  He began 1986 by losing on points to Mike Ayala over ten rounds on 2 March in San Antonio. Solis and his handlers felt he had been robbed of a victory by the judges in this fight, feeling that Solis had done enough to win. They filed a complaint with the Texas state athletic commission, but in vain, as the officials reviewed a tape of the fight and decided the result should stand.
Solis fought on from this point, but he only won six of his last fifteen bouts before retiring in 1992. True to his globe-trotting style, only two of those bouts were in Puerto Rico, and he visited Italy, South Korea, South Africa once again, Miami and various American states. Among the boxers he faced during the last part of his career were future world Bantamweight champion Mauricio Stecca, former world Bantamweight champion Calvin Grove, Seung-Hoon Lee and Pedro Decima.
Solis retired with a record of 41 wins, 13 losses and 1 draw, with 22 knockouts. He remains active as a public figure in Puerto Rico, participating in charity exhibitions here and there.

CATEGORIES: Track gauges, Track geometry

Track gauge is a technical term used in rail transport to define the spacing of the rails on a railway track and is measured between the inner faces of the load-bearing rails.
All vehicles on a network must have running gear that is compatible with the track gauge, and in the earliest days of railways selection of a proposed railway's gauge was a key issue.
As the dominant parameter determining interoperability, it is still frequently used as a descriptor of a route or network.
There is a distinction between the nominal gauge and actual gauge at some locality, due to divergence of track components from the nominal. Railway engineers use a device to measure the actual gauge, and this device is also referred to as a track gauge.

Te Kooti's War was among the last of the New Zealand wars, the series of 19th century conflicts between the Māori and the colonising European settlers. It was fought in the East Coast region and across the heavily forested central North Island between New Zealand government military forces and followers of spiritual leader Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki. 
The conflict was sparked by Te Kooti's return to New Zealand after two years of internment on the Chatham Islands, from where he had escaped with almost 200 Māori prisoners of war and their families. Te Kooti, who had been held without trial on the island for two years, told the government he and his followers wished to be left in peace and would fight only if pursued and attacked. But two weeks after their return to New Zealand, Te Kooti's party found itself being pursued by a force of militia, government troops and Māori volunteers and routed them in an ambush, seizing arms, ammunution, food and horses. The engagement was the first in what became a four-year guerrilla war, involving more than 30 expeditions[tpl]cite book | last = Belich | first = James | authorlink =James Belich (historian) | title =The New Zealand Wars | publisher =Penguin | year = 1986| location =Auckland | page =216 | isbn =0-14-027504-5[/tpl] by colonial and Māori troops against Te Kooti's dwindling number of warriors.
In early 1870 Te Kooti gained refuge from Tūhoe tribes, which consequently suffered a series of damaging raids in which crops and villages were destroyed, as other Māori iwi were lured by the promise of a ₤5000 reward for Te Kooti's capture. Te Kooti was finally granted sanctuary by the Māori king in 1872 and moved to the King Country, where he continued to develop rituals, texts and prayers of his Ringatū faith. He was formally pardoned by the government in February 1883 and died in 1893.

[[Chinese tea culture]]

CATEGORIES: Tea culture by country, Tea ceremony

Chinese tea culture refers to the methods of preparation of tea, the equipment used to make tea and the occasions in which tea is consumed in China. The terms chayi, 茶藝 ("Art of Tea") and "Tea Ceremony" have been used, but the term 茶文化 ("Tea Culture") includes more than just the ceremony. Also "culture" is easier to translate into English than the Chinese term 藝 ("art").
Tea culture in China differs from that of Europe, Britain or Japan in such things as preparation methods, tasting methods and the occasions for which it is consumed. Even now, in both casual and formal Chinese occasions, tea is consumed regularly. In addition to being a drink, Chinese tea is used in traditional Chinese medicine and in Chinese cuisine.

CATEGORIES: 1983 films, New Zealand films, Films set in New Zealand, British Empire war films, English-language films, 1980s drama films, Films directed by Geoff Murphy, Films shot in New Zealand

Utu is a 1983 New Zealand movie directed and co-written by Geoff Murphy. Anzac Wallace, who had done little acting up until that point, takes the starring role of Te Wheke, a warrior who sets out to get vengeance after British forces kill his people. The cast also includes Bruno Lawrence and Kelly Johnson. Sometimes described as "a Maori Western", Utu was reputed to have one of the largest budgets for a New Zealand film up until that time.
The film screened out of competition at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1522/year/1983.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Forbidden Relations |accessdate=2009-06-22|work=festival-cannes.com[/tpl] and became the second most successful local movie released in New Zealand to that date. Positive reviews in America, including a rave review from Pauline Kael, helped win Murphy directing work in Hollywood.
Partly inspired by events from Te Kooti's War, the film tells of a Māori soldier setting out to get utu, or vengeance, on his former allies after the British army destroys his home village and kills his uncle. The film is set in the 1870s.
In 2013, partly thanks to the longtime existence of an alternative cut of the film aimed at international audiences, which Geoff Murphy had never been happy with, he completed work on a restored and recut version. Utu Redux, as it is known, premiered at the Wellington International Film Festival on 26 July 2013.

[[Peijaiset]]

In Finland, peijaiset (in dialectical forms peijahaiset, peijaat or peijaajaiset)[tpl]cite book|title=Kielitoimiston sanakirja|publisher=KOTUS|location=headword "peijaiset"|accessdate=14 January 2012|language=Finnish[/tpl] is a Finnish word that in its modern usage often refers to the celebrations following a successful elk hunt (or the hunting season), but may mean celebrating also other things that have come to an end (figurative references to "pejaiset" over e.g. bankrupt companies occur in newspapers). Traditionally, it referred to burials, but also to other celebrations in some dialects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=1095|title=Pidetäänkö peijaiset?|last=Länsimäki|first=Maija|date=30 October 2001|work=Helsingin Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=14 January 2013[/tpl] 
Karhunpeijaiset is a celebration after a bear hunt. A bear was never "hunted"; it was merely brought down. A single man could claim to have hunted and killed a bear, but in a community effort, the bear simply died. The ceremony was always a much more elaborate affair than the most influential member of the community would have merited. In eastern Finland it would have copious mourners and wailers, and the people would address the bear as a relative or as the son of a god. Its flesh was not eaten — that would have been cannibalism — or, if it was, an elaborate show was made to symbolically render the meat into that of another animal, e.g. venison. The bear's head was usually mounted on the top of a young tree, or on a pike. Carrion-eaters would then eat it, leaving only the skull, which would then become an object of veneration. A courtyard would also be cleared around the skull. Traditionally, only bears were sanctified thus.[tpl]fact|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Sometimes the ceremony was held as a sacred marriage rather than a burial. In such cases the bear was either propped up inside a frame or strapped to a cross. With all due ceremony, the chosen bride would marry the bear.[tpl]fact|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Nowadays peijaiset usually means the festivities ending a successful hunt or hunting season, usually only for moose and bear. On many occasions these include making a meal of the latest kill for hunters in the evening.[tpl]fact|date=January 2013[/tpl]

[[River dolphin]]
CATEGORIES: River dolphins

River dolphins are a nontaxonomic category including five living species and one recently extinct species of dolphin that reside in freshwater rivers and estuaries. They inhabit areas of Asia and South America. All members of the group were formerly classified in the cetacean superfamily Platanistoidea, but molecular studies show that river dolphins do not form a clade. Four species live in fresh water rivers, as did the recently extinct fifth species, the baiji or Chinese river dolphin. The sixth species, the La Plata dolphin, lives in saltwater estuaries and near-shore marine environments. However, it is scientifically classed with South American river dolphins rather than in the oceanic dolphin family. Conversely, Sotalia fluviatilis is classified with marine dolphins even though it is only found within the Amazon Basin.

Gavialidae is a family of reptiles within the order Crocodilia.  Gavialidae has conventionally consisted of only one surviving species, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), which is native to India. Many extinct species are also known. The false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) has usually been thought to be a member of the family Crocodylidae based on several characters including skull morphology, but has sometimes been viewed as a member of this family due to general similarities in morphology and habit. However, numerous molecular studies have consistently shown that the two species are very closely related, supporting the view that they are in fact in the same family.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1016/j.ympev.2007.02.005[/tpl]
Gavialids are large semiaquatic reptiles, resembling crocodiles, but with a much thinner snout. The thin snout is used to catch fish, as gavialids lack the jaw strength to capture the large mammalian prey favoured by crocodiles and alligators of similar size.[tpl]cite book |editor=Cogger, H.G. & Zweifel, R.G.|author= Magnusson, William E.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 229–230|isbn= 0-12-178560-2[/tpl]

[[Earl of Lichfield]]
CATEGORIES: Earldoms in the Peerage of England, Extinct earldoms in the Peerage of England, Earldoms in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, Anson family

Earl of Lichfield is a title that has been created three times in British history. 
The first creation, in the Peerage of England, was in December 1645 by King Charles I for Charles Stewart (1639–1672). Before that, Lord Bernard Stewart, youngest son of Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, was to be created Earl of Lichfield by Charles I for his actions at the battles of Newbury and Naseby but died before the creation could be implemented. Charles Stewart, the son of Bernard's younger brother George, who had been killed at the Battle of Edgehill, was instead created Earl of Lichfield in December 1645, soon after the Battle of Rowton Heath. Charles Stewart's cousin, who held the titles of Duke of Richmond and Earl of Lennox through the first Duke of Lennox's eldest son James, died aged eleven in 1660 with Charles Stewart as his heir. The 1st Earl of Lichfield of the 1645 creation thus succeeded as 3rd Duke of Richmond and 6th Duke of Lennox.Money 1881, pp. 187–188 In that same year he was created Hereditary Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Hereditary Great Admiral of Scotland, and Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset. On 15 April 1661 he was invested with the Order of the Garter.Dictionary of National Biography, p. 73 He married Frances Teresa Stuart, the celebrated beauty and alleged former mistress of King Charles II. In disgrace with the king, Charles was sent into exile as ambassador to Denmark, where he drowned on 12 December 1672. All of the English and Scottish titles that had been bestowed upon the male heirs became extinct.
The second creation, in the Peerage of England, came in 1674 when King Charles II bestowed the titles of Baron Spelsbury, Viscount Quarendon and Earl of Lichfield upon Sir Edward Lee, 5th Baronet, of Quarendon (1663–1716) in anticipation of his marriage to the king's illegitimate daughter Charlotte Fitzroy, whose mother was Barbara Villiers. The wedding took place in 1677. The Lee Baronetcy, of Quarendon in Buckinghamshire, had been created in the Baronetage of England in 1611 for Henry Lee. He was the cousin and heir of Henry Lee of Ditchley.
The 1st Earl of Lichfield from the Lee family was succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son, George Henry Lee, who became the 2nd Earl and 6th Baronet. He constructed the stately home of Ditchley in Oxfordshire. On his death the titles passed to his son George Henry Lee, the 3rd Earl. He represented Oxfordshire in the House of Commons and served as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners from 1762 to 1772. He died childless and was succeeded by his uncle, the 4th Earl. He was also childless. On his death in 1776 all his titles became extinct. 
The third creation, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, came in 1831 in favour of Thomas Anson, 2nd Viscount Anson (1795–1854), a landowner and Whig politician who served as Master of the Buckhounds from 1830 to 1834 and as Postmaster General from 1835 to 1841. He was the eldest son of Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson, who in 1806 had been created Baron Soberton, of Soberton in the County of Southampton, and Viscount Anson, of Shugborough and Orgreave in the County of Stafford, both in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. 
The Anson family is descended from George Anson, Member of Parliament for Lichfield from 1770 to 1789. Born George Adams, he was the son of Sambrooke Adams and his wife Janette Anson, sister of the famous naval commander George Anson, 1st Baron Anson. In 1773, on the death of his uncle Thomas Anson (brother of Lord Anson), he succeeded to the substantial estates accumulated by his uncle Lord Anson, including the Anson family seat of Shugborough Hall in Staffordshire. The same year he assumed by Royal license the surname of Anson in lieu of Adams. His eldest son was Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson who represented Lichfield in the House of Commons as a Whig from 1789 to 1806 until he was raised to the peerage as Baron Soberton and Viscount Anson - see above - in 1806. He was succeeded in these titles by his eldest son, the 2nd Viscount, who in 1831 was created Earl of Lichfield, of Lichfield in the County of Stafford, in William IV's coronation honours. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the 2nd Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Lichfield and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Staffordshire. The titles descended from father to son until the death of his grandson, the 4th Earl, in 1960. He was succeeded by his grandson, the 5th Earl, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas William Arnold Anson, Viscount Anson (1913–1958), eldest son of the 4th Earl. Known professionally as Patrick Lichfield, he was a successful photographer. 
[tpl]As of|2010[/tpl] the titles are held by the 6th Earl, only son of the 5th Earl and Lady Leonora Grosvenor, daughter of the 5th Duke of Westminster. He succeeded as the 6th Earl of Lichfield upon his father's death on 11 November 2005. The 6th Earl married in December 2009 Lady Henrietta Conyngham, daughter of Henry Conyngham, 8th Marquess Conyngham.The Times announcement[tpl]cite news |url=http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/marriages/111082/the-earl-of-lichfield-and-lady-henrietta-conyngham |title=The Earl of Lichfield and  Lady Henrietta Conyngham - Marriages Announcements |author= |date=2010-01-27 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher= |accessdate=2012-04-26[/tpl] They have one son, Thomas Ossian Patrick Wolfe Anson, Viscount Anson (b. 20 May 2011).[tpl]cite news |url=http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/births/133768/lichfield |title=LICHFIELD - Births Announcements - Telegraph Announcements |author= |date=2011-05-26 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher= |accessdate=2012-04-26[/tpl]
Several other members of the Anson family have also gained distinction. Sir George Anson, younger brother of the 1st Viscount Anson, was a General in the Army and represented Lichfield in the House of Commons. He was the father of 1) Talavera Vernon Anson (1809–1895), an Admiral in the Royal Navy, and 2) Thomas Anson, a cricketer. William Anson, younger brother of the 1st Viscount Anson, was created a Baronet in 1831 (see Anson Baronets for more information on this branch of the family). The Very Reverend Frederick Anson (1779–1867), younger brother of the 1st Viscount Anson, was Dean of Chester. He was the father of 1) Frederick Anson, Canon of Windsor, and 2) George Edward Anson, private secretary to Prince Albert. The Honourable George Anson, second son of the 1st Viscount Anson, was a prominent soldier and politician. The Honourable Augustus Anson, third son of the 1st Earl, was a Member of Parliament and recipient of the Victoria Cross. The Right Reverend the Honourable Adelbert Anson, fourth and youngest son of the 1st Earl, was a clergyman and served as Bishop of Qu'Apelle in Canada. The Honourable Sir George Augustus Anson (1857–1947), second son of the 2nd Earl, was a courtier and Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army.  
The courtesy title of the eldest son and heir apparent of the Earl is Viscount Anson.
The family seat of the Ansons is Shugborough Hall, Staffordshire, which is about 15 miles from the city of Lichfield. Admiral Anson, the 1st Earl of Lichfield and others are buried at St Michael and All Angels Church in Colwich, a short distance from Shugborough Hall. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Earl and other Ansons of Shugborough after 1854 were buried at St Stephen's Church in Great HaywoodMemorial Inscriptions of Great Haywood, Staffordshire: St Stephen's Churchyard, accessed 1 October 2012 until the 5th Earl decided to return to the Anson vault at Colwich.

Tram stops share most characteristics of bus stops, but because trams operate on rails, they often include railway platforms, especially if stepless entries are provided for accessibility. However, trams may also be used with bus stop type flags and with mid-street pavements as platforms, in so-called street running operation.

The town was established on a crossing of the River Avon and is believed to have existed as some form of settlement since before Roman times. It was a royal vill, and probably a royal hunting lodge,[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=4GafAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22alfred%22chippenham+%22hunting+lodge%22&q=hunting+lodge | title=In Search of the Dark Ages | author=Michael Wood | publisher=BBC | year=1981 | page=111 | isbn=0-56-317835-3[/tpl] under Alfred the Great. The primary school, King's Lodge School, gets its name from this tradition.
The town continued to grow when the Great Western Railway arrived in 1841, and while historically a market town the economy has changed to that of a commuter town.
Chippenham is twinned with La Flèche in France and Friedberg in Germany.
The town's motto is Unity and Loyalty.

[[Pendolino]]
CATEGORIES: Pendolino, Rolling stock of Italy, Italian inventions, Historical innovative rolling stock

Pendolino (from Italian pendolo  [tpl]IPA-it|ˈpɛndolo|[/tpl] "pendulum", and -ino, a diminutive suffix) is an Italian family of tilting trains used in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland, Russian Federation, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, Switzerland, China and shortly in Romania and Poland. Based on the design of the Italian ETR 401 and the British Advanced Passenger Train, it was further developed and manufactured by Fiat Ferroviaria, which was taken over by Alstom in 2000.
The idea of a tilting train became popular in the 1960s and 1970s when various rail operators, impressed by the high-speed rail services being introduced in France and Japan, wondered how they could similarly speed up travel without building a dedicated parallel rail network (as those two countries were doing). By tilting, the train could go around curves designed for slower trains at higher speeds without causing undue discomfort to passengers.

[[Game tree]]

CATEGORIES: Combinatorial game theory, Trees (graph theory)

In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game and whose edges are moves. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation.
The diagram shows the first two levels, or plies, in the game tree for tic-tac-toe. The rotations and reflections of positions are equivalent, so the first player has three choices of move: in the center, at the edge, or in the corner. The second player has two choices for the reply if the first player played in the center, otherwise five choices. And so on.
The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.
Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using the minimax algorithm or its variants. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of "pathological" game trees [tpl]cite journal |last=Nau |first=Dana | year=1982 |title=An investigation of the causes of pathology in games |journal= Artificial Intelligence |volume=19 |pages=257–278 |doi=10.1016/0004-3702(82)90002-9[/tpl] (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.
Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player's alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player's moves.

[[Astronomical seeing]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical imaging, Observational astronomy, Observing the Moon, Speckle imaging

Astronomical seeing refers to the blurring and twinkling of astronomical objects such as stars caused by turbulent mixing in the Earth's atmosphere varying the optical refractive index. The astronomical seeing conditions on a given night at a given location describe how much the Earth's atmosphere perturbs the images of stars as seen through a telescope.
The most common seeing measurement is the diameter (technically full width at half maximum or FWHM) of the seeing disc (the point spread function for imaging through the atmosphere). The point spread function diameter (seeing disc diameter or "seeing") is a reference to the best possible angular resolution which can be achieved by an optical telescope in a long photographic exposure, and corresponds to the diameter of the fuzzy blob seen when observing a point-like star through the atmosphere. The size of the seeing disc is determined by the astronomical seeing conditions at the time of the observation. The best conditions give a seeing disk diameter of ~0.4 arcseconds and are found at high-altitude observatories on small islands such as Mauna Kea or La Palma.
Seeing is one of the biggest problems for Earth-based astronomy: while the big telescopes have theoretically milli-arcsecond resolution, the real image will never be better than the average seeing disc during the observation. This can easily mean a factor of 100 between the potential and practical resolution. Starting in the 1990s, new adaptive optics have been introduced that can help correct for these effects, dramatically improving the resolution of ground based telescopes.
The image fluctuations seen when looking at the bottom of a lake on a windy day are caused by refractive index fluctuations, but in the case of a lake they do not result from turbulent mixing.

Mauna Kea ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɔː|n|ə|_|ˈ|k|eɪ|.|ə[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|m|aʊ|n|ə|_|ˈ|k|eɪ|.|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-haw|ˈmɔunə ˈkɛjə|lang[/tpl]) is a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaii. Standing [tpl]convert|13,803|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level, its peak is the  highest point in the U.S. state of Hawaii. However, much of Mauna Kea is below sea level; when measured from its oceanic base, its height is [tpl]convert|10100|m|-2|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl]—more than twice Mount Everest's base-to-peak height of [tpl]convert|11980|to|15260|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl]. Mauna Kea is about one million years old, and thus hundreds of thousands of years ago it passed the most active shield stage of life. In its current post-shield state, its lava is more viscous, resulting in a steeper profile. Late volcanism has also given it a much smoother appearance than its neighboring volcanoes: contributing factors include the construction of cinder cones, the decentralization of its rift zones, the glaciation on its peak, and the weathering effects of the prevailing trade winds. Mauna Kea last erupted 4,600 years ago.  According to the USGS, as of January 2012, the Volcanic Alert Level is "Normal".[tpl]cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/about/volcanoes/hawaii/maunakea.php|title=Volcano Information – Mauna Kea|publisher=USGS|accessdate=December 14, 2012[/tpl]
In Hawaiian mythology, the peaks of the island of Hawaii are sacred, and Mauna Kea (which means "white mountain" in Hawaiian[tpl]cite book|last1=Pukui|first1=Mary Kawena|last2=Elbert|first2=Samuel H.|title=Hawaiian dictionary|year=1986|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-0703-0|page=242[/tpl]) is one of the most sacred. An ancient law allowed only high-ranking tribal chiefs to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living on the slopes of Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the mountain's ecology. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophylla–Myoporum sandwicense (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks and an Acacia koa–Metrosideros polymorpha (or koa–[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōhi[tpl]okina[/tpl]a) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.
With its high altitude, dry environment, and stable airflow, Mauna Kea's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation, and one of the most controversial. Since the creation of an access road in 1964, thirteen telescopes funded by eleven countries have been constructed at the summit. The Mauna Kea Observatories are used for scientific research across the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light to radio, and comprise one of the world's largest telescope facilities of their type. In April 2013, the Thirty Meter Telescope project was approved, and will be the largest telescope ever built.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Massive-telescope-to-be-built-in-Hawaii/tabid/1160/articleID/294296/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Massive telescope to be built in Hawaii| date=April 15, 2013[/tpl] Their construction on a "sacred landscape", replete with endangered species and ongoing cultural practices, continues to be a topic of debate and protest. Studies are underway to determine their effect on the summit ecology, particularly on the rare Wēkiu bug.

An alligator is a crocodilian in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae. The two living  species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis). In addition, several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains. Alligators first appeared during the Oligocene epoch about 37 million years ago.The Paleobiology Database: Alligatoridae
The name "alligator" is probably an anglicized form of [tpl]lang|es|el lagarto[/tpl], the Spanish term for "the lizard", which early Spanish explorers and settlers in Florida called the alligator.

The Head Start Program is a program of the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provides comprehensive early childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families. The program's services and resources are designed to foster stable family relationships, enhance children's physical and emotional well-being, and establish an environment to develop strong cognitive skills. The transition from  preschool to elementary school imposes diverse developmental challenges that include requiring the children to engage successfully with their peers outside of the family network, adjust to the space of a classroom, and meet the expectations the school setting provides.[tpl]cite journal | authors = McWayne, C.

[[Buckram]]

CATEGORIES: Woven fabrics

Buckram is a stiff cloth, made of cotton, and still occasionally linen, which is used to cover and protect books.  Buckram can also be used to stiffen clothes.  Modern buckrams have been stiffened by soaking in a substance, usually now pyroxylin, to fill the gaps between the fibres.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A261055 |title=Buckram |publisher=BBC h2g2|accessdate=2008-03-21[/tpl]
In the Middle Ages, "bokeram" was fine cotton cloth, not stiff.  The etymology of the term is uncertain; the commonly mentioned derivation from BokharaDonald King in Jonathan Alexander & Paul Binski (eds.), Age of Chivalry: Art in Plantagenet England, 1200–1400, p157, Royal Academy/Weidenfeld & Nicholson, London 1987. is, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, uncertain.
Millinery buckram is different from bookbinding buckram. It is impregnated with a starch, which allows it to be softened in water, pulled over a hat block, and left to dry into a hard shape. White buckram is most commonly used in hatmaking, though black is available as well. Millinery buckram comes in three weights: baby buckram (often used for children's and dolls' hats), single-ply buckram, and double buckram (also known as "theatrical crown"). 
American-made Buckram book cloth is a poly-cotton base cloth coated in aqueous acrylic. It was designed to withstand heavy use in libraries and offers strength, moisture resistance and mildew resistance. Buckram is available in different grades. 
In the US, F grade buckram is offered in 15 glossy colors. It meets specifications for use in textbooksManufacturing Standards and Specifications for Textbooks as developed by NASTA (National Association of State Textbook Administrators) in consultation with the AAP (Association of American Publishers) and the BMI (Book Manufacturers' Institute) and exceeds performance specifications for library binding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lbibinders.org/0838984840_LBIguide.pdf|title=Buckram|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090219060123/http://lbibinders.org/0838984840_LBIguide.pdf|archivedate=2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Buckram|url=http://www.lbsbind.com/fabric_cover_materials/buckram.php|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090406005001/http://www.lbsbind.com/fabric_cover_materials/buckram.php|archivedate=2009[/tpl]ANSI/NISO/LBI Z39.78-2000

The North–South divide is broadly considered a socio-economic and political divide. Generally, definitions of the North include the United States, Canada, developed parts of Europe, and East Asia. The South is made up of Africa, Latin America, and developing Asia including the Middle East. The North is home to four of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and all members of the G8. 
"The North" mostly covers the West and the First World, along with much of the Second World. While the North may be defined as the richer, more developed region and the South as the poorer, less developed region, many more factors differentiate between the two global areas.  95% of the North has enough food and shelter.[tpl]cite book|last=Mimiko|first=Oluwafemi|title=Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business|year=2012|publisher=Carolina Academic|location=Durham, N.C.|page=47[/tpl] Similarly, 95% of the North has a functioning education system. In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has enough food and shelter. It “lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports.”  
In economic terms, the North—with one quarter of the world population—controls four fifths of the world income. 90% of the manufacturing industries are owned by and located in the North.[tpl]cite book|last=Mimiko|first=Oluwafemi|title=Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business|year=2012|publisher=Carolina Academic|location=Durham, D.C.|page=47[/tpl]  Inversely, the South—with three quarters of the world populations—has access to one fifth of the world income. It serves as a source for raw material, for the North, “eager to acquire their own independent resource bases…subjected large portions of the global South to direct colonial rule” between 1850 and 1914.[tpl]cite book|last=Steger|first=Manfred|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford|page=31[/tpl]  As nations become economically developed, they may become part of the "North", regardless of geographical location, while any other nations which do not qualify for "developed" status are in effect deemed to be part of the "South".Therien, Jean-Philippe.

Père David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus), also known as the milu ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|麋|鹿[/tpl]|p=mílù[/tpl]) or elaphure, is a species of deer that is currently extinct in the wild—all known specimens are found only in captivity. This semiaquatic animal prefers marshland, and is native to the subtropics of China. It grazes mainly on grass and aquatic plants. It is the only extant member of the genus Elaphurus. Based on genetic comparisons, Père David's deer is closely related to the deer of the genus Cervus, leading many experts to suggest merging Elaphurus into Cervus,[tpl]cite journal|last=Pitra|first=C.|coauthors=Fickel, J.; Meijaard, E.; Groves, C.|title=Evolution and phylogeny of old world deer|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=1 December 2004 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=880–895 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2004.07.013 |url=http://arts.anu.edu.au/grovco/pitra%20deer.pdf |accessdate=18 April 2013 |pmid=15522810[/tpl] or demoting Elaphurus to a subgenus of Cervus.[tpl]cite book|last=Geist|first=V. |authorlink=Valerius Geist |title=Deer of the World: their Evolution, Behaviour and Ecology |year=1998 |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |isbn=0811704963 |page=81 |edition=1st[/tpl]

[[Carbon paper]]
CATEGORIES: Stationery, Paper products

Carbon paper (originally carbonic paper) was originally paper coated on one side with a layer of a loosely bound dry ink or pigmented coating, bound with wax, used for making one or more copies simultaneously with the creation of an original document when using a typewriter or a ballpoint pen.  The manufacture of carbon paper was formerly the largest consumer of montan wax.  In 1954 the Columbia Ribbon & Carbon Manufacturing Company filed a patent for what became known in the trade as solvent carbon paper: the coating was changed from wax-based to polymer-based.  The manufacturing process changed from a hot-melt method to a solvent-applied coating or set of coatings.  It was then possible to use polyester or other plastic film as a substrate, instead of paper, although the name remained carbon paper.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2872340?dq=solvent+carbon+columbia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LB08UpqBPeKW0AWSkYCQAw&ved=0CG8Q6AEwCA |title=Transfer element and method of making the same'' 1959 Patent app. (via Google search) |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23[/tpl]

[[Jordan curve theorem]]
CATEGORIES: Theorems in topology

In topology, a Jordan curve is a non-self-intersecting continuous loop in the plane, and another name for a Jordan curve is a simple closed curve. The Jordan curve theorem asserts that every Jordan curve divides the plane into an "interior" region bounded by the curve and an "exterior" region containing all of the nearby and far away exterior points, so that any continuous path connecting a point of one region to a point of the other intersects with that loop somewhere. While the statement of this theorem seems to be intuitively obvious, it takes quite a bit of ingenuity to prove it by elementary means. More transparent proofs rely on the mathematical machinery of algebraic topology, and these lead to generalizations to higher-dimensional spaces. 
The Jordan curve theorem is named after the mathematician Camille Jordan, who found its first proof. For decades, mathematicians generally thought that this proof was flawed and that the first rigorous proof was carried out by Oswald Veblen. However, this notion has been challenged by Thomas C. Hales and others.

CATEGORIES: Places in Hong Kong, Beaches of Hong Kong, Hong Kong geography-related lists

Hong Kong has a long coastline that is full of twists and turns with many bays and beaches. Many of them are well sheltered by mountains nearby, as Hong Kong is a mountainous place. As a result, large waves seldom appear at the bays, making them suitable for swimming.
However, with the increasing development and urbanisation of Hong Kong, water quality has worsened resulting in the closure of several beaches previously suitable for swimming.  These include Approach Beach, Ting Kau Beach, Anglers' Beach, Gemini Beaches, Hoi Mei Wan Beach, Casam Beach and Lido Beach in Tsuen Wan. In 2011, Lido Beach, Casam Beach, Approach Beach and Hoi Mei Wan Beach were reopened following an improvement in water quality."Four beaches in Tsuen Wan to reopen with improved water quality", Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Press Release, June 13, 2011
About half of the beaches suitable for swimming in Hong Kong are managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), and are officially referred to as gazetted beaches. A number of other beaches are privately owned or not gazetted, but are nonetheless publicly accessible.

Sir Herbert Nigel Gresley (19 June 1876 – 5 April 1941)biography accessed 15 November 2007 was one of Britain's most famous steam locomotive engineers, who rose to become Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). He was the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives in Britain, including the LNER Class A1 and LNER Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific engines.  An A1 pacific, Flying Scotsman, was the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service, and an A4, number 4468 Mallard, still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world (126 mph).
Gresley's engines were considered elegant, both aesthetically and mechanically.  His invention of a three-cylinder design with only two sets of Walschaerts valve gear, the Gresley conjugated valve gear, produced smooth running and power at lower cost than would have been achieved with a more conventional three sets of Walschaerts gear.

Synthetic geometry (sometimes referred to as axiomatic geometry or even pure geometry) is the study of geometry without the use of coordinates. According to Felix Klein,[tpl]harvnb|Klein|1948|loc=p. 55[/tpl]
 
 Synthetic geometry is that which studies figures as such, without recourse to formulas, whereas analytic geometry consistently makes use of such formulas as can be written down after the adoption of an appropriate system of coordinates.

A defining characteristic of synthetic geometry is the use of the axiomatic method to draw conclusions and solve problems, as opposed to analytic and algebraic geometries, where one would use analysis and algebraic techniques to obtain these geometric results.

[[Discipline]]

CATEGORIES: Training, Behavior modification

In its natural sense, discipline is systematic instruction intended to train a person, sometimes literally called a disciple, in a craft, trade or other activity, or to follow a particular code of conduct or "order". Often, the phrase "to discipline" carries a negative connotation. This is because enforcement of order–that is, ensuring instructions are carried out–is often regulated through punishment. 
Discipline is a course of actions leading to certain goal or ideal. A disciplined person is one that has established a goal and is willing to achieve that goal at the expense of his or her individuality.
Discipline is the assertion of willpower over more base desires, and is usually understood to be synonymous with self control. Self-discipline is to some extent a substitute for motivation, when one uses reason to determine the best course of action that opposes one's desires. Virtuous behavior is when one's motivations are aligned with one's reasoned aims: to do what one knows is best and to do it gladly. Content behavior, on the other hand, is when one does what one knows is best, but must do it by opposing one's motivations.[tpl]cite book |last=Fowers |first=Blaine J. |year=2008 |title=From Continence to Virtue: Recovering Goodness, Character Unity, and Character Types for Positive Psychology |work=Theory & Psychology |volume=18, |issue=5 |pages=629–653[/tpl] Moving from content to virtuous behavior requires training and some self-discipline.

The Reference Daily Intake or Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) is the daily intake level of a nutrient that is considered to be sufficient to meet the requirements of 97–98% of healthy individuals in every demographic in the United States (where it was developed, but has since been used in other places).
The RDI is used to determine the Daily Value (DV) of foods, which is printed on nutrition facts labels in the United States and Canada, and is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada respectively.

The Chinese white dolphin (Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis chinensis; [tpl]zh|t=中華白海豚|p=Zhōnghuá bái hǎitún[/tpl]) is a humpback dolphin species, one of 80 cetacean species. An adult is white or pink and may appear as an albino dolphin to some. Uniquely, the population along the Chinese coast has pink skin,WWF Hong Kong and the pink colour originates not from a pigment, but from blood vessels which were overdeveloped for thermoregulation. The body length is [tpl]convert|2|to|3.5|m|abbr=on[/tpl] for adults [tpl]convert|1|m|abbr=on[/tpl] for infants. An adult weighs [tpl]convert|150|to|230|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Chinese white dolphins live up to 40 years, as determined by the analysis of their teeth.
These dolphins inhabit the waters of Southeast Asia and breed from South Africa to Australia. There are two subspecies, with Sumatra, one of the Indonesian islands, as the dividing line between the Chinese and the Western subspecies, Sousa chinensis plumbea. The two subspecies differ in color and dorsal fin size. The subspecies found in Southeast Asia has pinkish white skin and a larger dorsal fin, but lacks the fatty hump of South African and Australian relations.
At birth, the dolphins are black. They change to grey, then pinkish with spots when young. Adults are white.

The Kola Peninsula (from [tpl]lang-se|Guoládat[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ru|Ко́льский полуо́стров[/tpl], Kolsky poluostrov) is a peninsula in the far northwest of Russia. Constituting the bulk of the territory of Murmansk Oblast,2007 Atlas of Murmansk Oblast, p. 2The area of the peninsula is [tpl]convert|100000|km2|sp=us[/tpl]; vs. Murmansk Oblast's total area of [tpl]convert|144900|km2|sp=us[/tpl]. it lies almost completely to the north of the Arctic Circle and is bordered by the Barents Sea in the north and the White Sea in the east and southeast. The city of Murmansk is the most populous human settlement on the peninsula, with a population of over 300,000 as of the 2010 Census.[tpl]ru-pop-ref|2010Census[/tpl]
Despite the peninsula's northerly location, its proximity to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, but also results in high winds due to the temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea. Summers are rather chilly, with the average July temperature of only [tpl]convert|+11|C[/tpl]. The peninsula is covered by taiga in the south and tundra in the north, where permafrost limits the growth of the trees resulting in landscape dominated by shrubs and grasses. The peninsula supports a small variety of mammals, and its rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established to protect the population of Common Eider, is located in the Kandalaksha Gulf.
While the north of the peninsula was already settled in the 7th–5th millennium BCE, the rest of its territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BCE, when various peoples started to arrive from the south. However, by the 1st millennium CE only the Sami people remained. This changed in the 12th century, when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula's game and fish riches. Soon after, the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic, and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands. No permanent human settlements, however, were established by the Novgorodians until the 15th century.
The Novgorod Republic lost control of the peninsula to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1471, but the Russian migration did not stop. Several new settlements were established during the 16th century, and the Sami and Pomor people were forced into serfdom. In the second half of the 16th century, the peninsula became a subject of dispute between the Tsardom of Russia and the Kingdom of Denmark–Norway, which resulted in the strengthening of the Russian position. By the end of the 19th century, the indigenous Sami population had been mostly forced north by the Russians and the Komi and Nenets people who migrated here to escape a reindeer disease epidemics in their home lands. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (now Murmansk) was founded and quickly became the largest city on the peninsula.
The Soviet period saw a rapid increase of the population, although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its strategic position and the discovery of the vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage, including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting.
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease. Between 1989 and 2002, Murmansk Oblast lost almost a quarter of its population; and almost 100,000 more between 2002 and 2010. Nevertheless, the economy rebounded somewhat in the first decade of the 2000s and the peninsula remains the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia.

Captured by Israel during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, many of the villagers fled the fighting. Those few hundred who managed to remain or to return were subsequently transferred out of the village by the Israel Defense Forces to the West Bank or to other Arab towns in the newly established Israel on three separate occasions in January and February 1949.
A shrine for the Sheikh Abu Hajar Azraq and the remains of a small domed building are still standing. Archaeological remains include cisterns and domestic wells which supplied the village with drinking water from nearby springs.

Az-Zeeb or al-Zib ([tpl]lang-ar|الزيب[/tpl]) was a Palestinian Arab village located [tpl]convert|13.5|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] north of Acre on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Mentioned in the Bible by its ancient name Achzib, evidence of human settlement at the site dates back to the 18th century BCE. By the 10th century BCE, it was a propersous and fortified Phoenician town. Conquered by the Assyrian empire in the 8th century BCE, it was subsequently ruled by the Persian empire. During the rule of the Roman empire in Palestine, it was known as Ecdippa. Arab geographers were referring to it as az-Zeeb by the early Middle Ages.
The Crusaders established a fortress named Casal Humberti there in 1099 and there are descriptions of it and the village of az-Zeeb by Arab chroniclers in the 12th and 13th centuries, just prior to and during the rule of the Mamluks in the region. Incorporated into the Ottoman empire in the early 16th century, by its end it formed part of the subdistrict of Akka. Its inhabitants cultivated various crops and raised livestock on which they paid taxes to the Ottoman authorities.
At the time of the British Mandate in Palestine, most the families in az-Zeeb made their living from fishing and agriculture, particularly fruit cultivation. Just before the official end to Mandate rule on May 14, 1948, az-Zeeb was attacked by captured by the Haganah's Carmeli Brigade. The town was depopulated and razed to the ground. The Israeli localities of Sa'ar and Gesher HaZiv were established on the village lands in 1948 and 1949. A domed mosque from the village has since been restored and serves as a tourist site, and the house of the last mukhtar is now a museum.

CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in Peru, Populated places in the Ica Region

Nazca (sometimes spelled Nasca) is a city and system of valleys on the southern coast of Peru. It is also the name of the region's largest existing town in the Nazca Province, and the name applied to the Nazca culture that flourished in the area between 100 BC and AD 800. This culture was responsible for the Nazca Lines and the ceremonial city of Cahuachi; they also constructed an impressive system of underground aqueducts, named Puquios, that still function today.
Nazca is the capital of the Nazca Province located in the Ica District of the Ica region of Peru.
On November 12, 1996, at 11:59 a.m. local time (16:59 GMT) there was an earthquake of magnitude 6.4 with its epicenter at 7.7 km into the sea, which almost completely destroyed the city of Nasca and its surroundings. Because it occurred during the day, there were only 14 fatalities, but 1,500 people were injured and around 100,000 left homeless. Almost all old brick houses were destroyed, but within 12 years Nasca has been completely rebuilt.
Since 1997, Nazca has been the location of a major Canadian gold mining operation. The people who were living on the land for the last 2000 years did not have a property title to the land, so they were displaced without legal problems. Since then, there have been attempts to legalize poor citizens' ownership of their land and their fixed property, in response to Hernando de Soto's research on the poor.

Among his many travels were explorations of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron, as well as the Humber River watershed in today's Toronto. In 1629, during the Anglo-French War, he betrayed his friend and patron. Not long after, Brûlé was killed by the Bear tribe of the Huron people.

The Arkansas River (Pawnee: Kícka ) is a major tributary of the Mississippi River. The Arkansas generally flows to the east and southeast as it traverses the US states of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The river's initial basin starts in the Western United States in Colorado, specifically the Arkansas River Valley, where the headwaters derive from the snowpack in the Collegiate Peaks. Then it flows east into the Midwest via Kansas, and finally into the South through Oklahoma and Arkansas.

The mountain was named after local homesteader Josiah "Uncle Si" Merritt. It was made famous in the show Twin Peaks, which was filmed in North Bend.
Only about a 45-minute drive from Seattle, the mountain is a favorite outdoor destination for residents of Puget Sound. Between 80,000 and 100,000 hikers visit the mountain annually. The land is owned by the state of Washington and has been designated a Natural Resources Conservation Area.

Schtonk! (1992) is a satirical German film, retelling the hoax of the Hitler Diaries.
Subtitled Der Film zum Buch vom Führer ("The film accompanying the Führer's book"), the film is a grotesque farce about the events when, in 1983, German Stern magazine began to publish, with great fanfare, the 60 volumes of the alleged diaries of Adolf Hitler – which two weeks later turned out to be entirely fake.
The film is widely considered a hilarious tale, making fun not only of the events and characters who were involved in the hoax, and who are only thinly disguised in the film, but also of the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past.
The film is co-written and directed by Helmut Dietl and, among his many respected comedies, is frequently considered his best. Dietl researched the scandal for two years and has been quoted as having to leave out several real events from the film because they were too outrageous.
The title is a bow to Charlie Chaplin's classic The Great Dictator, in which the Führer repeatedly uses "Schtonk!" as an expression of disgust – the word has no meaning in German but resembles Stunk (pronounced as shtoonk), a colloquial expression for a scuffle or altercation.

Merrill Church Meigs (November 25, 1883 - January 26, 1968) was the executive of the Chicago Herald and Examiner in the 1920s.  Inspired to become a pilot by Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean, he became a booster of Chicago as a world center of aviation.
He gave flying lessons to President Harry S. Truman.
Meigs (pronunciation: "Megz" - rhymes with "eggs") was the son of Church Paddleford Meigs and Julianna S. (Burrell) Meigs. He grew up on a farm near Malcom, Iowa, where he was more interested in the mechanical devices used to raise crops than actually farming.  In 1901, he took a job as a salesman for the  J.I. Case Threshing Machine Company in Racine, Wisconsin.  Within a year, he was in charge of the company's sales for South America.  Despite not having graduated from high school, Meigs was allowed to enroll at the University of Chicago, where he played football under Amos Alonzo Stagg and also played baseball and water polo.  While at the college, he would also be the campus correspondent for the Chicago Herald and Examiner, of which he would become the executive later in his life.
As head of the Chicago Aero Commission, Meigs insisted that in addition to Midway Airport (then called Municipal Airport) and O'Hare Field (then called Orchard-Douglas), the city needed an airfield within ten minutes of the Loop.  It opened in December 1948 and was renamed Meigs Field in his honor the following year.
Meigs retired in 1962 and became a consultant to the newspaper industry.
He died at age 84.

[[Nonprobability sampling]]

CATEGORIES: Sampling techniques, Market research

Sampling is the use of a subset of the population to represent the whole population.  Probability sampling, or random sampling, is a sampling technique in which  the probability of getting any particular sample may be calculated.  Nonprobability sampling does not meet this criterion and should be used with caution. Nonprobability sampling techniques cannot be used to infer from the sample to the general population.
The advantage of nonprobability sampling is its lower cost compared to probability sampling. However, one can say much less on the basis of a nonprobability sample than on the basis of a probability sample. Of course, research practice appears to belie this claim, because many analysts draw generalizations (e.g., propose new theory, propose policy) from analyses of nonprobability sampled data. One must ask, however, whether those published works are publishable because tradition makes them so, or because there really are justifiable grounds for drawing generalizations from studies based on nonprobability samples.
Some embrace the latter claim, and assert that while probability methods are suitable for large scale studies concerned with representativeness, non-probability approaches are more suitable for in-depth qualitative research in which the focus is often to understand complex social phenomena (e.g., Marshall 1996; Small 2009). These assertions raise an interesting question—how can one understand a complex social phenomenon by drawing only the most convenient expressions of that phenomenon into consideration? What assumption about homogeneity in the world must one make to justify such assertions? Alas, research indicates only one situation in which a non-probability sample can be appropriate—if one is interested only in the specific cases studied (for example, if one is interested in the Battle of Gettysburg), one does not need to draw a probability sample from similar cases (Lucas 2014a).
Still, some use nonprobability sampling. Examples of nonprobability sampling include:
Even studies intended to use probability sampling sometimes end up using nonprobability samples because of characteristics of the sampling method. For example, using a sample of people in the paid labor force to analyze the effect of education on earnings is to use a non-probability sample of persons who could be in the paid labor force. Because the education people obtain could determine their likelihood of being in the paid labor force, technically the sample in the paid labor force is a nonprobability sample for the question at issue. In such cases results are biased.
The statistical model one uses can also render the data a non-probability sample. For example, Lucas (2014b) notes that several published studies that use multilevel modeling have been based on samples that are probability samples in general, but nonprobability samples for one or more of the levels of analysis in the study. Evidence indicates that in such cases the bias is porrly behaved, such that inferences from such analyses are unjustified.
These problems occur in the academic literature, but they may be more common in non-academic research. For example, in public opinion polling by private companies (or other organizations unable to require response), the sample can be self-selected rather than random. This often introduces an important type of error: self-selection bias. This error sometimes makes it unlikely that the sample will accurately represent the broader population. More important, this error makes it impossible to establish that the sample represents the broader population. Volunteering for the sample may be determined by characteristics such as submissiveness or availability. The samples in such surveys should be treated as non-probability samples of the population, and the validity of the findings based on them is unknown and cannot be established.

[[Jean Goldkette]]

John Jean Goldkette (18 March 1893–March 24, 1962) was a jazz pianist and bandleader born in France.Ted Gioia: The History of Jazz, Oxford University Press 2011, p. 83 Goldkette spent his childhood in Greece and Russia, and emigrated to the United States in 1911.
He led many jazz and dance bands, of which the best known was his Victor Recording Orchestra of 1924–1929, which included, at various times, Bix Beiderbecke, Hoagy Carmichael, Chauncey Morehouse, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Bill Rank, Eddie Lang, Frankie Trumbauer, Pee Wee Russell, Steve Brown, Joe Venuti, and arranger Robert Ginzler among others. Vocalists included the Keller Sisters and Lynch. In his Jazz Masters of the Thirties, Rex Stewart, a member of Fletcher Henderson's band at the time, writes that the Goldkette band's innovative arrangements and strong rhythm made it the best dance band of its day and "the first original white swing band in jazz history".
Jean Goldkette was also the Music Director for the Detroit Athletic Club for over 20 years, and co-owned the legendary Graystone Ballroom with Charles Horvath, who also performed with the Goldkette Victor Band in its early years. He owned his own entertainment company, 'Jean Goldkette's Orchestras and Attractions, working out of the still-standing Book-Cadillac Hotel in Detroit. He co-wrote the song "It's the Blues (No. 14 Blues)" which was recorded in Detroit, Michigan and released on Victor.
In 1927, Paul Whiteman, the controversially self-proclaimed "King of Jazz," hired away most of Goldkette's better playersGoldkette on The Red Hot Jazz Archive Retrieved 19 June 2013. due to Goldkette not being able to meet the payroll for his top-notch musicians. Goldkette later helped organize McKinney's Cotton Pickers and Glen Gray's Orange Blossoms, which became famous as the Casa Loma Orchestra. In the 1930s he left jazz to work as a booking agent and classical pianist. In the mid-1930s, Jean filed for bankruptcy, showing over $200,000 in debts, and only $.40 in assets.
In 1939, he organized the American Symphony Orchestra which debuted at Carnegie Hall. He married Lee McQuillen, a native of New York City. Frankie Laine worked as Goldkette's librarian, and lived with the Goldkettes while in New York. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
He moved to California in 1961, and the following year died in Santa Barbara, California, of a heart attack, aged 69. He took a taxi to the hospital by himself, and died that same day.  He is buried in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

In 1931 Redman left to form his own band and was replaced by Benny Carter. The Cotton Pickers disbanded in 1934, unable to make money during the Depression. Manager of the band was Jean Goldkette (who arranged for the group to record "Birmingham Bertha" for him in July 1929, released on Victor under his own name).
A New McKinney's Cotton Pickers was organized in the early 1970s by David Hutson, using the original Don Redman arrangements. They recorded several albums and featured original banjoist Dave Wilborn, who was believed to have been the only surviving original member at the time.
McKinney's Cotton Pickers' performance of "Milenberg Joys" was used as the theme tune of Robert Parker's 1980s radio series Jazz Classics in Digital Stereo.

[[Sinc filter]]

CATEGORIES: Signal processing, Digital signal processing, Filter theory, Filter frequency response

In signal processing, a sinc filter is an idealized filter that removes all frequency components above a given cutoff frequency, without affecting lower frequencies, and has linear phase response. The filter's impulse response is a sinc function in the time domain, and its frequency response is a rectangular function.
It is an "ideal" low-pass filter in the frequency sense, perfectly passing low frequencies, perfectly cutting high frequencies; and thus may be considered to be a brick-wall filter.
Real-time filters can only approximate this ideal, since an ideal sinc filter (aka rectangular filter) is non-causal and has an infinite delay, but it is commonly found in conceptual demonstrations or proofs, such as the sampling theorem and the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula.
In mathematical terms, the desired frequency response is the rectangular function:
the normalized sinc function.
As the sinc filter has infinite impulse response in both positive and negative time directions, it must be approximated for real-world (non-abstract) applications; a windowed sinc filter is often used instead. Windowing and truncating a sinc filter kernel in order to use it on any practical real world data set destroys its ideal properties.

CATEGORIES: 1895 births, 1969 deaths, American jazz drummers, People from Springfield, Ohio

William McKinney (17 September 1895 - 14 October 1969) was an American jazz drummer who led a series of musical groups, most notably McKinney's Cotton Pickers.
William "Bill" McKinney was born in Cynthiana, Kentucky. He worked as a drummer in a circus band, then after serving in the United States Army in World War I settled in Springfield, Ohio where he took over leadership of the Synco Jazz Band. After hiring drummer Cuba Austin, McKinney worked as leader and business manager. After touring the U.S. Midwest, they got a residency at the Arcadia Ballroom in Detroit, Michigan in 1926. In Detroit they were heard by bandleader and music promoter Jean Goldkette, who arranged a more lucrative home base for the band in Detroit's Greystone Hotel Ballroom. The band was renamed "McKinney's Cotton Pickers" (see also).
After the band broke up in 1934 during the Great Depression, McKinney for a time led and played with a dance band in Boston, From 1937 on McKinney managed a Detroit Cafe with a dance floor and live bands who McKinney booked; he also booked bands for other locations on the side.
Bill McKinney retired in the 1950s and spent his last years in his childhood hometown of Cynthiana.

[[Isle of Sheppey]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of Kent, History of Kent, Islands of England, Swale

The Isle of Sheppey is an island off the northern coast of Kent, England in the Thames Estuary, some [tpl]convert|46|mi[/tpl] to the east of London. It has an area of [tpl]convert|36|sqmi[/tpl]. The island forms part of the local government district of Swale. Sheppey is derived from the ancient Saxon "Sceapige", meaning isle of sheep, and even today the extensive marshes which make up a considerable proportion of the island provide grazing for large flocks of sheep. The island, like much of north Kent, comprises London Clay and is a plentiful source of fossils. The land mass referred to as Sheppey comprises three main islands: Sheppey, the Isle of Harty and the Isle of Elmley (it was once known as the Isles of Sheppey before the channels separating them silted up), but the marshy nature of the land to the south of the island means that it is so crossed by channels and drains as to consist of a multitude of islands. The ground is mainly low-lying, but at the Mount near Minster rises to [tpl]convert|250|ft|m|0|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level.
Some Sheppey inhabitants like to call themselves Swampies, a term that began as, and for some people remains, an insult; for others it has become a term of endearment or a phrase for reinforcing identity. The family names "Shippee" and "Shippey," found predominantly in New England, derives from those whose ancestors were from the Isle of Sheppey.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

Tribonian or Tribonianos (Τριβωνιανός trivonia'nos, c. 485?–547) was the jurist who, during the reign of the Emperor Justinian I, supervised the revision the legal code of the Roman Empire.Roman Jurisprudence.
Tribonian was born in Side, in Pamphylia, around the year 500."We can only guess at the date of his birth....Tribonian attained the quaestorship in 529, so he was presumably born before 500, perhaps in the last fifteen years of the fifth century." Tony Honoré, Tribonian 41 (1978). He was well educated and practiced law before the court of the praetorian prefect.Id. at 44.  Justinian made Tribonian "magister officiorum" (Master of Offices), although it is not clear when,Id. at 45 and then appointed him quaestor (Minister of Justice) in September 529.Tony Honoré, "Tribonian" in The Oxford Classical Dictionary 1549 (Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth eds. 3rd rev. ed 2003).
In 528, before he was appointed quaestor, Tribonian was named by Justinian as one of the commissioners charged with preparing the new imperial legal code, the Codex Justinianus (Code of Justinian, Justinian's Code), which subsequently was issued on April 7, 529.Honoré, supra note 2 at 44-46. In 530, after Tribonian had become quaestor, it was natural for Justinian to put him in charge of the next major law reform project: compiling and harmonizing the writings of classical Roman jurists. (In 532 he was removed as quaester due to the charges made by his enemies, but he continued to work on the codification.Id. This was one result of the Nika rioting. See Honoré, supra note 2 at 48.) Justinian's main objects in creating this harmonized compilation of juristic writings were to: 1) shorten litigation (by clarifying the law), and 2) create a syllabus to be used at the law schools in Beirut (Berytus) and Constantinople.Tony Honoré, "Justinian's Codification" in The Oxford Classical Dictionary 803, 804 (Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth eds. 3rd rev. ed 2003). For a lengthier discussion of the purpose of the second Commission, see Honoré, supra note 2 at 48-50. During the same period, Tribonian also was charged with carrying out another aspect of Jusinian's reformation of legal education and codification—creating a text book for first year law students by updating the Institutes of Gaius (jurist). Both the Digest (Roman law) and the new Institutes were promulgated in December of 533.Honoré, "Justinian's Codification, supra note 8.
In 534, Justinian decided that so many new laws had been passed, and so many older ones harmonized, since the publication of his first Code in 529, a second edition was needed.  Hence, the  Codex repetitae praelectionis was published, entirely superseding the edition of 529, the text of which has been lost.Id. Tribonian was officially restored to his post as quaestor in 535 and continued in that position until his death in 541 or 542.Honoré, supra note 5. Tribonian continued to help draft new laws for Justinian; these, and the later new laws, or Novellae Constitutiones of Justinian, came to be seen during the Renaissance as combining with the other Justinianic compilations noted above—the Codex Justinianus the Digest (Roman law), and theInstitutes—to comprise the Corpus Juris Civilis or "body of the civil law".
Tribonian died in 542 of a disease, perhaps the plague.See Honoré, supra note 2 at 61-64 for a detailed sifting of the evidence. Tribonian's career is summarized by his noted modern biographer, Tony Honoré, in this way: "...he was Justinian's minister for legislation and propaganda for nearly twelve years...In these years the three volumes of the Corpus Juris Civilis and most of the surviving legislation of Justinian's reign were produced. He drafted about three-quarters of the surviving constitutions of Justinian's reign. He planned and directed the work of the Second Law Commission, which produced the Digest (Roman law), the Institutes and the Second "Codex Iustinianus."Honoré, supra note 8 at 69.

[[Zhao Yun]]

Zhao Yun (died 229), courtesy name Zilong, was a military general who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve Liu Bei and had since accompanied Liu on most of his exploits — from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217–219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period, participating in the first of Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions, until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life had been highly dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei.

Jiang Wei (202–264), courtesy name Boyue, was a military general and regent of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period. He originally served Shu's rival state, Cao Wei, as a middle-level military officer, but defected to the Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W2NmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA136&dq=a+native+of+kansuh+temperament+humble#v=onepage&q=a%20native%20of%20kansuh%20temperament%20humble&f=false|title=Gu jin xing shi zu pu|author=Herbert Allen Giles|year=1898|publisher=B. Quaritch|location=|page=136|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-15[/tpl] leaving his mother in Wei. After that, Jiang Wei took part in military campaigns against his native state. He joined Zhuge Liang's first Northern Expedition against Wei in 228, and was made an army commander. Zhuge Liang had always considered Jiang Wei a resourceful and capable general, and Jiang received light-speed promotions during the regency of Zhuge Liang and of Zhuge Liang's successors Jiang Wan and Fei Yi to eventually become Fei Yi's chief assistant. He succeeded Fei Yi after the latter's death in 253, but did not wield full power as his predecessor did, as he was only in charge of military affairs — and was therefore arguably a regent.
Jiang Wei revived Zhuge Liang's campaigns against Wei (which Jiang Wan and Fei Yi had largely abandoned) and made a number of incursions against Wei — one in coordination with Eastern Wu's regent Zhuge Ke - but each had to be abandoned due to inadequate food supplies or due to battlefield losses, and these campaigns greatly drained Shu's resources. In 263, a Wei army, led by Deng Ai and Zhong Hui, conquered Shu. Jiang Wei tried to restore Shu by persuading Zhong Hui to rebel against the Wei regent Sima Zhao, and Zhong agreed. However, the revolt failed because Zhong Hui's own soldiers turned against him and both Zhong and Jiang Wei were killed in action.

He allied himself with Yuan Shu in 190 when warlords from eastern China formed a coalition to oust Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord who held the puppet Emperor Xian in his power. Although he controlled neither many troops nor much land, Sun Jian's personal bravery and resourcefulness were feared by Dong Zhuo, who placed him among Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and Liu Biao as the most influential men at that time. After the coalition disbanded in the next year, China fell into massive civil war. In 191, Sun Jian was killed in battle during an offensive campaign against Liu Biao.
Sun Jian was also the father of Sun Quan, one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms era who eventually established the Eastern Wu state and declared himself its first emperor in 229, whereupon Sun Jian was given the posthumous title "Emperor Wulie" (武烈皇帝).

Early in his career, he fought in several battles under the banner of Sun Ce (Sun Quan's elder brother and predecessor) and later under Sun Quan. Although he had been noted for his bravery, he was still deemed as nothing more than a "mere warrior" for his lack of literacy skills. Later, with encouragement from Sun Quan, Lü Meng took up scholarly pursuits to improve himself, gradually becoming a learned and competent military leader. In 217, he succeeded Lu Su as the frontline commander of Sun Quan's forces in Jing Province. Two years later, in a carefully calculated military operation, Lü Meng led an invasion of Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, swiftly and stealthily capturing all the lands from Liu's general Guan Yu, who was captured and executed after his defeat.

Nervous tissue is the main component of the two parts of the nervous system; the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS), and the branching peripheral nerves of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which regulates and controls bodily functions and activity. It is composed of neurons, or nerve cells, which receive and transmit impulses, and  neuroglia, also known as glial cells or more commonly as just glia (from the Greek, meaning glue), which assist the propagation of the nerve impulse as well as providing nutrients to the neuron.
Nervous tissue is made up of  different types of nerve cells, all of which having an axon, the long stem-like part of the cell that sends action potential signals to the next cell.
Functions of the nervous system are sensory input, integration, control of muscles and glands, homeostasis, and mental activity.

[[Legal tender]]
CATEGORIES: Business law, Money, Monetary reform, Currency

Legal tender is a medium of payment allowed by law or recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation. Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  The origin of the term "legal tender" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word "extend" (to hold outward).Definition of tender as verb, in Merriam-Webster. Retrieved July 13, 2009.
Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, debit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency.
In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept that legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal.
The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred, would not be effective.

[[Tit for tat]]

CATEGORIES: Non-cooperative games, Altruism

Tit for tat is an English saying meaning "equivalent retaliation". It is also a highly effective strategy in game theory for the iterated prisoner's dilemma. The strategy was first introduced by Anatol Rapoport in Robert Axelrod's two tournaments,The Axelrod Tournaments held around 1980. Notably, it was (on both occasions) both the simplest strategy and the most successful.[tpl]cite book|title=Game theory: a critical text|author=Shaun Hargreaves Heap, Yanis Varoufakis|page=191|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-25094-3[/tpl]
An agent using this strategy will first cooperate, then subsequently replicate an opponent's previous action. If the opponent previously was cooperative, the agent is cooperative. If not, the agent is not. This is similar to superrationality and reciprocal altruism in biology.

[[Systematic sampling]]

CATEGORIES: Sampling (statistics), Sampling techniques

Systematic sampling is a statistical method involving the selection of elements from an ordered sampling frame. The most common form of systematic sampling is an equal-probability method. In this approach, progression through the list is treated circularly, with a return to the top once the end of the list is passed. The sampling starts by selecting an element from the list at random and then every kth element in the frame is selected, where k, the sampling interval (sometimes known as the skip): this is calculated as:
where n is the sample size, and N is the population size.
Using this procedure each element in the population has a known and equal probability of selection. This makes systematic sampling functionally similar to simple random sampling. It is however, much more efficient (if variance within systematic sample is more than variance of population).[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Systematic sampling is to be applied only if the given population is logically homogeneous, because systematic sample units are uniformly distributed over the population. The researcher must ensure that the chosen sampling interval does not hide a pattern. Any pattern would threaten randomness. 
Example: Suppose a supermarket wants to study buying habits of their customers, then using systematic sampling they can choose every 10th or 15th customer entering the supermarket and conduct the study on this sample.
This is random sampling with a system. From the sampling frame, a starting point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter are at regular intervals. For example, suppose you want to sample 8 houses from a street of 120 houses. 120/8=15, so every 15th house is chosen after a random starting point between 1 and 15. If the random starting point is 11, then the houses selected are 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 101, and 116.
If, as more frequently, the population is not evenly divisible (suppose you want to sample 8 houses out of 125, where 125/8=15.625), should you take every 15th house or every 16th house? If you take every 16th house, 8*16=128, so there is a risk that the last house chosen does not exist. On the other hand, if you take every 15th house, 8*15=120, so the last five houses will never be selected. The random starting point should instead be selected as a noninteger between 0 and 15.625 (inclusive on one endpoint only) to ensure that every house has equal chance of being selected; the interval should now be nonintegral (15.625); and each noninteger selected should be rounded up to the next integer. If the random starting point is 3.6, then the houses selected are 4, 20, 35, 50, 66, 82, 98, and 113, where there are 3 cyclic intervals of 15 and 4 intervals of 16.
To illustrate the danger of systematic skip concealing a pattern, suppose we were to sample a planned neighbourhood where each street has ten houses on each block. This places houses No. 1, 10, 11, 20, 21, 30... on block corners; corner blocks may be less valuable, since more of their area is taken up by streetfront etc. that is unavailable for building purposes. If we then sample every 10th household, our sample will either be made up only of corner houses (if we start at 1 or 10) or have no corner houses (any other start); either way, it will not be representative.
Systematic sampling may also be used with non-equal selection probabilities. In this case, rather than simply counting through elements of the population and selecting every kth unit, we allocate each element a space along a number line according to its selection probability. We then generate a random start from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and move along the number line in steps of 1.
Example: We have a population of 5 units (A to E). We want to give unit A a 20% probability of selection, unit B a 40% probability, and so on up to unit E (100%). Assuming we maintain alphabetical order, we allocate each unit to the following interval:
 A: 0 to 0.2
 B: 0.2 to 0.6 (= 0.2 + 0.4)
 C: 0.6 to 1.2 (= 0.6 + 0.6)
 D: 1.2 to 2.0 (= 1.2 + 0.8)
 E: 2.0 to 3.0 (= 2.0 + 1.0)
If our random start was 0.156, we would first select the unit whose interval contains this number (i.e. A). Next, we would select the interval containing 1.156 (element C), then 2.156 (element E). If instead our random start was 0.350, we would select from points 0.350 (B), 1.350 (D), and 2.350 (E).

The Western Zhou period (1046–771 BC) was the first half of the Zhou dynasty of ancient China.  It began when King Wu of Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty at the Battle of Muye.
The dynasty was successful for about seventy-five years and then slowly lost power. The former Shang lands were divided into hereditary fiefs which became increasingly independent of the king. In 771, barbarians drove the Zhou out of the Wei River valley; afterwards that real power was in the hands of the king's nominal vassals.

Scarface is a 1983 American crime drama film directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. A remake of the 1932 film of the same name, Scarface tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing, and rises up to become a powerful drug kingpin. The film also features Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Steven Bauer, and Michelle Pfeiffer.
The initial critical response to Scarface was mixed, with criticism over excessive violence, frequent strong language and graphic hard drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. Contemporary reviews have been more positive, and screenwriters and directors such as Martin Scorsese have notably praised the movie. It is now considered a classic within the mob film genre and has resulted in many cultural references such as in comic books and video games.

The Platte River [tpl]IPAc-en|p|l|æ|t[/tpl] (Pawnee: Kíckatusʾ) is a major river in the state of Nebraska and is about [tpl]convert|310|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long. Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River, it flows for over [tpl]convert|1050|mi|km[/tpl]. The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River, which in turn is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Platte over most of its length is a muddy, broad, shallow, meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islands—a braided stream. These characteristics made it too difficult for canoe travel, and it was never used as a major transportation route by European-American trappers or explorers.
The Platte is one of the most significant tributary systems in the watershed of the Missouri, draining a large portion of the central Great Plains in Nebraska and the eastern Rocky Mountains in Colorado and Wyoming. The river valley played an important role in the westward expansion of the United States, providing the route for several major emigrant trails, including the Oregon, California, Mormon and Bozeman trails. The first Europeans to see the Platte were French explorers and fur trappers about 1714; they first called it the Nebraskier (Nebraska), a transliteration of the name given by the Otoe people, meaning "flat water".

Most of the ethnic Germans are descendants of Soviet Volga Germans who were collectively deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan on Stalin's order when Hitler invaded Soviet-annexed eastern Poland and the Soviet Union proper in 1941. Until the 1950s, many were interned in labor camps, often merely because they were Germans. The population of Karaganda fell by 14% from 1989-1999; it was once Kazakhstan's second largest city after Almaty.  One hundred thousand people have since emigrated to Germany. There is also a smaller concentration of ethnic Poles.
It is the home city of Kazakh World War II hero Nurken Abdirov. A statue in Abdirov's honor is located in the center of the city.

He was also the leader of the Democratic Party of Albania twice, from 1991 to 1992 and then again from 1997 to 2013. To date, Berisha is the longest-serving democratically-elected leader and the only President of Albania elected to a second term.
Berisha was already a prominent intellectual in 1990 when, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, he called for the abolition of the one-party state and transition to democracy.  A former secretary of the committee of the Party of Labor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Tirana, he abandoned his career as a cardiologist and university professor to become the leader of the Democratic Party in the 1990s. From 1992, after the fall of communism, he served as the President of Albania until his government collapsed in 1997 in the wake of the collapse of notorious pyramid schemes. From 1997 to 2005, Albania was governed by the Socialist Party (PS) for two mandates, while he stayed in opposition.
In 2005, the Democratic Party won the general elections, and he became the Prime Minister after his coalition formed the new government. In 2009, he was re-elected Prime Minister, after the Democrats obtained a narrow win in the general elections but were forced into a coalition with the Socialist Movement for Integration (LSI) through not winning enough seats on its own for the first time since the start of multi-party democracy in 1991.

[[Breed]]

CATEGORIES: Domesticated animals, Breeding, Zoological nomenclature

A breed is a specific group of domestic animals or plants having homogeneous appearance, homogeneous behavior, and other characteristics that distinguish it from other animals or plants of the same species and that were arrived at through selective breeding. Despite the centrality of the idea of "breeds" to animal husbandry, no scientifically accepted definition of the term exists.The state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Barbara Rischkowsky and Dafydd Pilling. Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. 2007  A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.The Genetics of Populations. Jay L Lush. Iowa State University Press. 1994 The term is distinguished from landrace, which refers to a naturally occurring regional variety of domestic (and sometimes feral) animal through uncontrolled breeding.
When bred together, animals of the same breed pass on these predictable traits to their offspring, and this ability—known as "breeding true"—is a  requirement for a breed. Plant breeds are more commonly known as cultivars. The offspring produced as a result of breeding animals of one breed with other animals of another breed are known as crossbreeds or mixed breeds. Crosses between animal or plant variants above the level of breed/cultivar (species, subspecies, botanical variety, even different genera) are referred to as hybrids.Banga, Surinder S.

Kai Tak Airport [tpl]airport codes|HKG|VHHH[/tpl] was the international airport of Hong Kong from 1925 until 1998. It was officially known as Hong Kong International Airport from 1954 to 6 July 1998, when it was closed and replaced by the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok, 30 km to the west. It is often known as Hong Kong Kai Tak International Airport, or simply Kai Tak, to distinguish it from its successor which is often referred to as Chek Lap Kok Airport. In 2013, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal was opened on the site of the former airport's runway.
With numerous skyscrapers and mountains located to the north and its only runway jutting out into Victoria Harbour, landings at the airport were dramatic to experience and technically demanding for pilots.[tpl]cite news|last=Wong|first=Hiufu|title=Breathtaking photos of Hong Kong airport glory days|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/11/travel/hong-kong-kai-tak-airport/|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=12 June 2013[/tpl] The History Channel program Most Extreme Airports ranked it as the 6th most dangerous airport in the world.Most Extreme Airports; The History Channel; 26 August 2010
The airport was home to Hong Kong's international carrier Cathay Pacific, as well as regional carrier Dragonair, freight airline Air Hong Kong and Hong Kong Airways. The airport was also home to the former RAF Kai Tak.

[[Woodcreeper]]
CATEGORIES: Dendrocolaptinae, Higher-level bird taxa restricted to the Neotropics

The woodcreepers (Dendrocolaptinae) comprise a subfamily of sub-oscine passerine birds endemic to the Neotropics. They have traditionally been considered a distinct family Dendrocolaptidae, but most authorities now place them as a subfamily of the ovenbirds (Furnariidae).  They superficially resemble the Old World treecreepers, but they are unrelated and the similarities are due to convergent evolution. The subfamily contains around 57 species in 15 to 20 genera.
Woodcreepers range from 14 to 35 centimetres in length.[tpl]cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Willis, Edwin O.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 163|isbn= 1-85391-186-0[/tpl] Generally brownish birds, the true woodcreepers maintain an upright vertical posture, supported by their stiff tail vanes.  
They feed mainly on insects taken from tree trunks.  However, woodcreepers often form part of the core group at the center of flocks attending army ant swarms. Woodcreepers are arboreal cavity-nesting birds; 2–3 white eggs are laid and incubated for about 15 to 21 days.
These birds can be difficult to identify in that they tend to have similar brown upperparts, and the more distinctive underparts are hard to see on a bird pressed against a trunk in deep forest shade. The bill shape, extend/shape of spots/streaks, and call are useful aids to determining species.

CATEGORIES: Newspapers published in Hong Kong, Chinese-language newspapers (Traditional Chinese), Free daily newspapers, Publications established in 2002, 2002 establishments in Hong Kong

Metropolis Daily ([tpl]zh|t=都市日報[/tpl]) is the Hong Kong edition of Metro (Metro International), which publishes free newspapers around the world with 25 editions in 16 countries in 14 languages. It is the first free newspaper in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong version was first launched on April 15, 2002; it is distributed for free in the racks located in 49 Mass Transit Railway (MTR) stations except the Airport Station.
According to the Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations in September 2002, the daily circulation of the newspaper was 302,197 copies, making it the third largest daily newspaper in Hong Kong. The paper is distributed from Monday to Friday (except for public holidays), by hand or from the newspaper stands in 49 MTR stations and 11 other key central locations, such as big shopping malls owned by MTR Corporation Limited like Paradise Mall, Telford Plaza, and Luk Yeung Galleria (綠楊坊 Pinyin: lǜ yáng fāng). Since it is free of charge and easily accessible, many people like to get one on their way to school or work. The paper attracts a younger generation of readers with a great purchasing power likewise, therefore many advertisers are interested in promoting their products on Metropolis Daily. The operating costs of the paper are mainly covered by the classified advertisements in the newspaper. 
However, the influence of the paper is not yet significant. Though around one tenth size of other newspapers printing local first-hand news reported by fresh journalists, its main news sources are actually the television, radio news, press releases and wired news. As one Metropolis' reporter said, "Nobody seems to know that we made an exclusive story."
The paper is in Chinese in most parts, together with an English international section. According to Metropolis, the paper can be read in a "19-minute commute" as the articles inside are usually short and laconic; readers can scan through the paper so quickly that they can grab a brief understanding of the news within minutes. Although the paper is a tabloid, i.e. a minute-sized newspaper giving the stories in a condensed form, it includes many sections, which make the paper very rich in contents. 
These sections include: 
Readers can read the on-line edition of Metropolis all over the world by simply registering as users at its official site, and it is totally free. Besides, there is also a club called "Club Metro" offering discounts in films, sports and travel to its members. Readers can enjoy these benefits once they have joined the club. There are 700,000 worldwide members in this club.

CATEGORIES: Mountains of Tajikistan, Seven-thousanders

Ismoil Somoni Peak (Tajik: Қуллаи Исмоили Сомонӣ, Qullai Ismoili Somonī; Russian: пик Исмаила Самани pik Ismaila Samani) is the highest mountain in Tajikistan and in the former Russian Empire and later in the Soviet Union, named after Ismail Samani, the ancestor of the Samanid dynasty.
When the existence of a peak in the Soviet Pamir Mountains higher than Lenin Peak was first established in 1928, the mountain was tentatively identified with Garmo Peak; but as the result of the work of further Soviet expeditions, it became clear by 1932 that they were not the same, and in 1933 the new peak, in the Akademiya Nauk Range, was named Stalin Peak (Pik Stalina, пик Сталина), after Joseph Stalin. In 1962, the name was changed to Communism Peak (Tajik: Пики Коммунизм, Piki Kommunizm; Russian: пик Коммуни́зма, Pik Kommunizma), and in 1998 to its current name.
The first ascent was made 9 September 1933 by the Soviet mountaineer Yevgeniy Abalakov.The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia. Communizma Peak

Tyranni (suboscines) is a clade of passerine birds that includes more than 1,000 species, the large majority of which are South American. It is named after the type genus Tyrannus.
These have a different anatomy of the syrinx musculature than the oscines (songbirds of the larger suborder Passeri), hence its common name of sub-oscines. The available morphological, mt and nDNA sequence, and biogeographical data, as well as the (scant) fossil record, agrees that these two major passerine suborders are evolutionarily distinct clades.

This is a list of metropolitan areas in Europe, with their population according to five different sources. The list includes metropolitan areas that have a population of over 1 million.
List includes metropolitan areas according only studies of ESPON, Eurostat, United Nations, OECD and "CityPopulation Studies". For this reason some metropolitan areas, like Italian Genoa Metropolitan Area (population is over 1.510.000 as of 2012 according "CityRailway" Official Report), aren't included in this list, with data by other statistic survey institutes.
Figures in the first column come from the ESPON project, "Study on Urban Functions", which defines cities according to the concept of a functional urban area (core urban area defined morphologically on the basis of population density, plus the surrounding labour pool defined on the basis of commuting). Figures in the second column come from Eurostat's Urban Audit and correspond to Larger Urban Zones (LUZ). Figures in the third column come from the UN's World Urbanization Prospects and correspond to urban areas. Figures in the fourth column come from the OECD Territorial Reviews and correspond to "metropolitan regions". Figures in the last column come from the citypopulation.de website and correspond to urban agglomerations. Further information on how the areas are defined can be found in the source documents. These figures should be seen as an interpretation, not as conclusive fact.

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary computation

In computer science, evolutionary computation is a subfield of artificial intelligence (more particularly computational intelligence) that involves continuous optimization and combinatorial optimization problems. Its algorithms can be considered global optimization methods with a metaheuristic or stochastic optimization character and are mostly applied for black box problems (no derivatives known), often in the context of expensive optimization.
Evolutionary computation uses iterative progress, such as growth or development in a population. This population is then selected in a guided random search using parallel processing to achieve the desired end. Such processes are often inspired by biological mechanisms of evolution.
As evolution can produce highly optimised processes and networks, it has many applications in computer science.

The Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste ("Universal Encyclopaedia of Sciences and Arts") was a 19th-century German encyclopaedia published by Johann Samuel Ersch and Johann Gottfried Gruber, therefore also known as the "Ersch-Gruber." One of the most ambitious encyclopaedia projects ever, it remained uncompleted.
It was designed and begun in 1813 by Professor Ersch to satisfy the wants of Germans, only in part supplied by foreign works. It was stopped by the war until 1816, when Professor Gottlieb Hufeland joined, but he died on November 25, 1817, while the specimen part was at press. The first volume appeared in Leipzig in 1818. The editors of the different sections at various times were some of the best-known men of learning in Germany, including Gruber, M.H.E. Meier, Hermann Brockhaus, W. Müller and A.G. Hoffmann of Jena. Naturalist Eduard Poeppig wrote most of the articles on the Americas.[tpl]Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Poeppig, Eduard|year=1900[/tpl]
The work is divided into three sections: 
All articles bear the authors' names, and those not ready in time were placed at the end of their letter. By 1889 the encyclopaedia had reached 167 volumes when it was abandoned. The article about Greece alone covered 3,668 pages, spanning eight volumes. Section 1 was completed, but section 2 only up to the entry Ligatur, and section 3 up to Phyxios.

Saimaa is a lake in southeastern Finland. At approximately [tpl]convert|4400|km2[/tpl], it is the largest lake in Finland, and the fourth largest natural freshwater lake in Europe. It was formed by glacial melting at the end of the Ice Age. Major towns on the lakeshore include Lappeenranta, Imatra, Savonlinna, Mikkeli, Varkaus, and Joensuu. The Vuoksi River flows from Saimaa to Lake Ladoga. Most of the lake is spotted with islands, and narrow canals divide the lake in many parts, each having their own names (major basins include Suur-Saimaa, Orivesi, Puruvesi, Haukivesi, Yövesi, Pihlajavesi, and Pyhäselkä).
In places in the Saimaa basin (an area larger than the lake), "there is more shoreline here per unit of area than anywhere else in the world, the total length being nearly [tpl]convert|15000|km[/tpl]. The number of islands in the region, 14,000, also shows what a maze of detail the system is."[tpl]cite web|last=Hamalainen|first=Arto|title=Saimaa – Finland's largest lake|publisher=Virtual Finland|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080214225230/http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25710&LAN=ENG|date=November 2001|archivedate=14 February 2008|url=http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25710&LAN=ENG[/tpl]
The Saimaa Canal from Lappeenranta to Vyborg connects Saimaa to the Gulf of Finland. Other canals connect Saimaa to smaller lakes in Eastern Finland and form a network of waterways. These waterways are mainly used to transport wood, minerals, metals, pulp and other cargo, but also tourists use the waterways.

Kirkkonummi ([tpl]IPA-fi|ˈkirkːoˌnumːi[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sv|Kyrkslätt[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sv|tɕyrkslɛt|pron[/tpl]) is a municipality of [tpl]formatnum: [tpl]Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Kirkkonummi[/tpl][/tpl] inhabitants ([tpl]#time: j F Y|[tpl]Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|sourcedate[/tpl] [/tpl]) in southern Finland. The literal meaning of the words "Kirkkonummi" and "Kyrkslätt" in English is "church moor".
The municipality is located just outside the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, bordering the city of Espoo in the east. Other neighbouring municipalities are Vihti and Siuntio. The distance from the municipal centre to central Helsinki is some [tpl]convert|30|km|-1[/tpl]. Kirkkonummi also has excellent train and bus connections to other parts of the Greater Helsinki area, and many of its inhabitants commute daily to Helsinki.
The municipality covers an area of [tpl]convert|[tpl]Infobox Finnish Municipality/total area|Kirkkonummi[/tpl]|km2[/tpl] of which [tpl]convert|[tpl]Infobox Finnish Municipality/waters area|Kirkkonummi[/tpl]|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] is water. The population density is [tpl]convert|[tpl]Infobox Finnish Municipality/population density|Kirkkonummi|round=2[/tpl]|PD/km2[/tpl]. Over the recent years, Kirkkonummi has faced the highest population growth rate in the country, over 3% per annum.
Major population centres in Kirkkonummi include the municipal centre, Masala, Veikkola, Kantvik and the Upinniemi naval garrison area. In addition to these, there are dozens of smaller villages. Geographically, Kirkkonummi has two famous peninsulas, namely Porkkala and Upinniemi, the latter one of which houses a major Finnish naval base. Porkkala is also on one of the main bird migration routes in the Baltic Sea region. Additionally, Kirkkonummi has a large central plains area, through which a railway goes from Helsinki to Turku as well as extensive lake areas, much of which is relatively untouched wilderness.
Kirkkonummi has been populated from the Stone Age to the present day as evidenced by the very first Stone Age rock paintings found in Finland that are located by lake Vitträsk in the central lake region of Kirkkonummi. Incidentally, these paintings were found by the famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius himself. The southern half of the municipality was leased to the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1956 for use as a naval base as part of the peace settlement that ended the hostilities between the Soviet Union and Finland during World War II. Signs of this time include concrete bunkers, other fortifications and the remains of an airbase.
Other places of interest located in Kirkkonummi include the medieval stone church in the municipal centre, the wooden church in the village of Haapajärvi as well as the Hvitträsk manor designed by Finnish architects Eliel Saarinen, Herman Gesellius and Armas Lindgren.

Porkkala ([tpl]lang-sv|Porkala[/tpl]) is a peninsula in the Gulf of Finland located at Kirkkonummi (Kyrkslätt) in Southern Finland. 
The peninsula had great strategic value, as coastal artillery based there would be able to reach more than halfway across the Gulf of Finland. If the same power controlled the Estonian coast, on the opposite side of the gulf, it would then be able to block Saint Petersburg's naval access to the Baltic Sea. The distance to Estonia at the closest point is only [tpl]convert|36|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl].  Porkkala is furthermore located only [tpl]convert|30|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] from Helsinki, the Finnish capital, and a foreign power based there would be able to exert significant pressure on the Finnish government.
Nowadays the coasts of the peninsula are popular bird watching areas during spring migration as the Arctic geese and other waterfowl are on their passage.

The University of Hong Kong (informally known as HKU or Hong Kong University) is a public research university located in Pokfulam, Hong Kong.
Founded in 1911 during the British Colonial era, it is the oldest tertiary institution in Hong Kong. The university was originally established in order to compete with other Great Powers that had opened higher learning institutions in China at the beginning of the twentieth century. The Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, established in 1887, evolved to be the medical faculty, one of its first three faculties alongside Arts and Engineering. Academic life at the university was disrupted by the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong; however, following the end of the Second World War, the university underwent expansion with the founding of further departments and faculties.
Today, HKU is organised into 10 academic faculties. It exhibits strength in scholarly research and education of humanities, law, political sciences, biological sciences and medicine, and is the first team in the world which successfully isolated the corona virus, the causative agent of SARS,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_27b/en/|title= WHO-SARS Update 12 (SARS virus close to conclusive identification, new tests for rapid diagnosis ready soon)|quote=Scientists at Hong Kong University had previously announced, on 21 March, the isolation of a new virus that was strongly suspected to be the causative agent of SARS.

An armónico is a guitar-like instrument. It is a hybrid between the Spanish guitar and the Cuban tres. Formally known as trilina, the armónico has seven strings, two of which form a doubled string.  That's six courses, five with one string, and one with two strings.  
Counting from the lowest-pitched, the first three strings, E, A and D, are tuned an octave higher than the equivalent strings on a guitar with standard tuning. The fourth string, G, is doubled as well as also being an octave higher than on a guitar. The remaining two, B and E, are at the same pitch as a standard guitar. http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/a.htm
The armónico was invented by the famous Cuban composer/performer Compay Segundo who loved the instrument as it allowed him to exploit the possibilities of both the guitar and the tres.".[tpl]cite web | title = Compay Segungo's Biography | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | url = http://www.last.fm/music/Compay+Segundo/+wiki[/tpl]

These are bulbul-like birds of open forest or thorn scrub, but whereas that group tends to be drab in colouration, fairy-bluebirds are sexually dimorphic, with the males being dark blue in plumage, and the females duller green.
These species eat fruit, especially figs, and possibly some insects. They lay two to three eggs in a tree nest.

[[Australasian treecreeper]]
CATEGORIES: Birds of Australia, Climacteridae, Bird families

There are 7 species of Australasian treecreeper in the passerine bird family Climacteridae. They are medium-small, mostly brown birds with patterning on their underparts, and all are endemic to Australia-New Guinea. They resemble, but are not closely related to, the Holarctic treecreepers. The family is one of several families identified by DNA-DNA hybridisation studies to be part of the  Australo-Papuan songbird radiation. There is some molecular support for suggesting that their closest relatives are the large lyrebirds.
As their name implies, treecreepers forage for insects and other small creatures living on and under the bark of trees, mostly eucalypts, though several species also hunt on the ground, through leaf-litter, and on fallen timber. Unlike the Holarctic treecreepers they do not use their tail for support when climbing tree trunks, only their feet.
Australasian treecreepers nest in holes in trees. The species in the family hold breeding territories, although the extent to which they are defended and last varies. Some species, such as the Red-browed Treecreeper and the Brown Treecreeper are cooperative breeders, others, like the White-throated Treecreeper are not.  The cooperative breeders form groups or a single breeding pair as well as up to three helpers, which are usually the young males of previous pairings. Helpers assist with the construction of the nest, feeding of the incubating female and feeding and defending the young.

Luyten's Star (GJ 273) is a red dwarf in the constellation Canis Minor located at a distance of approximately [tpl]Convert|12.36|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl] from the Sun. It has a visual magnitude of 9.9, making it too faint to be viewed with the unaided eye. It is named after Willem Jacob Luyten, who, in collaboration with Edwin G. Ebbighausen, first determined its high proper motion in 1935.
This star is approximately a quarter the mass of the Sun and has 35% of the Sun's radius. Luyten's Star is at the maximum mass at which a red dwarf star can be fully convective. That is, most if not all of the star forms an extended convection zone. It has a stellar classification of M3.5V, with the V luminosity class indicating this is a main sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The projected rotation rate of this starThis is denoted by v sin i, where v is the rotational velocity at the equator and i is the inclination to the line of sight. is too low to be measured, but is no greater than 1 km/s. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is a relatively cool 3,150 K, giving the star the characteristic red-orange hue of an M-type star.

The Cuban Revolution (1953–1959) or the revolution on Cuba was an armed revolt conducted by Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement and its allies against the government of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista. The revolution began in July 1953, and finally ousted Batista on 1 January 1959, replacing his government with a revolutionary socialist state. The Movement organization later reformed along communist lines, becoming the Communist Party in October 1965."Cuba Marks 50 Years Since 'Triumphant Revolution'". Jason Beaubien. NPR. 1 January 2009. Retrieved 9 July 2013. The Communist Party, now headed by Castro's brother Raúl, continues to govern Cuba today.
The Cuban Revolution had great domestic and international repercussions; in particular, it reshaped Cuba's relations with the United States, which continues an embargo against Cuba as of 2014. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Castro's government began a program of nationalization and political consolidation that transformed Cuba's economy and civil society. The revolution also heralded an era of Cuban intervention into foreign military conflicts, including the Angolan Civil War and Nicaraguan Revolution.

The al-Dawayima massacre describes the killing of civilians by the Israeli army (IDF) that took place in the Palestinian Arab town of al-Dawayima on October 28, 1948 during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The incident occurred after the town was captured by the IDF's 89th Commando Battalion during Operation Yoav. The battalion, whose first commander was Moshe Dayan, was composed of former Irgun and Lehi forces. They encountered only "light resistance" from the villagers, whose core clan, the Ahdibs, traced their ancestry to the conquest of Palestine by Umar ibn Khattab in the 7th century.Morris, 2004, p. 469. Dawayima was situated a few kilometres west of Hebron. At the time, it had a population of 6,000 since some 4,000 Palestinian Arab refugees had taken refuge in the village prior to the massacre.UN Doc.

The ocelot ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|s|əl|ɒ|t[/tpl]; Leopardus pardalis), also known as the dwarf leopard, is a wild cat distributed extensively over South America including the islands of Trinidad and Margarita, Central America, and Mexico. It has been reported as far north as Texas.Ocelot. The Animal Files. Retrieved on 2012-04-10.

The ocelot is similar in appearance to a domestic cat. Its fur resembles that of a clouded leopard or jaguar and was once regarded as particularly valuable. As a result, hundreds of thousands of ocelots were once killed for their fur. The feline was classified a "vulnerable" endangered species from 1972 until 1996, and is now rated "least concern" by the 2008 IUCN Red List.

[[Laestadian Lutheran Church]]

CATEGORIES: Evangelical denominations in North America, Laestadianism, Lutheran denominations in North America, Religious organizations established in 1973, Lutheran denominations established in the 20th century

The Laestadian Lutheran Church (LLC) is a religious Christian movement, its teachings based on the Bible and the Lutheran Confessions.  From June 9, 1973, the organisation was named the Association of American Laestadian Congregations (AALC), before the association changed its name in 1994 in order better to convey its spiritual heritage. [tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], the Laestadian Lutheran Church has 29 member congregations in the United States and Canada, with highest concentrations of members in Minnesota, Washington, Arizona, Michigan in the United States and in Saskatchewan, Canada; the congregations are served by 68 ministers, nearly all of them lay preachers.
In Northern Europe, the association's sister organizations are the Conservative Laestadians' Central Association of the Finnish Associations of Peace ([tpl]lang|fi|Suomen rauhanyhdistysten keskusyhdistys[/tpl]) in Finland, the Sveriges fridsföreningarnas centralorganisation in Sweden, and the Estonian Lutheran Association of Peace ([tpl]lang|ee|Eesti Luterlik Rahuühendus[/tpl]).
The main teaching among them is of Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection. The work of Jesus Christ continues in this world as the work of the Holy Spirit. The Laestadian Lutheran Church teaches of God's kingdom and need for repentance and the forgiveness of sins. The church holds, in accord with the Lutheran Confessions, that the Bible is the highest guide and authority for Christian faith, doctrine, and life. The norms in the congregation such as refraining from birth-control, make-up, and dancing, are some of the things members do not feel are right to do as a child of God.
The Laestadian Lutheran Church takes its name from Martin Luther and Lars Levi Laestadius.  Laestadius was a Lutheran pastor who served in northern Sweden from 1825 to 1861. The movement reached North America with Finnish immigrants in the 1860s. Congregations were first formally organized in Cokato, Minnesota, in 1872 and Calumet, Michigan, in 1873. The Laestadian movement in North America has suffered a number of schisms since 1890. The subjects of disagreement have mainly been the understanding of justification, God's congregation, and the sacraments. The last division occurred in 1973 and resulted in the establishment of the Laestadian Lutheran Church.

[[Solomon and Saturn]]

CATEGORIES: Anglo-Saxon paganism, Anglo-Saxon runes, Old English poems, Riddles, Cronus-Saturn

Solomon and Saturn is the generic name given to four Old English works, which present a dialogue of riddles between Solomon, the king of Israel, and Saturn, identified in two of the poems as a prince of the Chaldeans. 
On account of earlier editorial tendencies, the two poetical works, Solomon and Saturn I and Solomon and Saturn II, have often been read as a single, continuous poem. They are considered some of the most enigmatic and difficult poems of the Old English corpus.

[[Republicanism in the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Republicanism in the United Kingdom, Republicanism by country

Republicanism in the United Kingdom is a movement which seeks to remove the British monarchy and replace it with a republic that has a non-hereditary head of state. The method by which the head of state should be chosen is not agreed upon, with some favouring an elected president, some an appointed head of state with little power, and others supporting the idea of leaving the political system as it is but without a monarch.
A republican government was briefly established in the mid-17th century, after the Parliamentarian victory in the English Civil War. The main lobby group in the United Kingdom that campaigns for the abolition of monarchy is Republic, but support for the monarchy remains high. Peaceful expression of republican views is legal in the United Kingdom.

The Winchester Mystery House is a mansion in San Jose, California which was once the personal residence of Sarah Winchester, the widow of gun magnate William Wirt Winchester. The property and mansion have been claimed to be haunted—including by Winchester herself—since construction commenced in 1884. Under Winchester's day-to-day guidance, its "from-the-ground-up" construction proceeded around the clock, without interruption, until her death on September 5, 1922, at which time work immediately ceased.A Mystery House, Frommer's San Jose, retrieved Oct. 30, 2006.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] The cost for such constant building has been estimated at about US $5.5 million (equivalent to over $75 million in 2012).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/videogallery.cfm?showvideo=46|title=Winchester Mystery House: Amazing Facts|date=2009-06-27|publisher=Winchester Mystery House, LLC.|accessdate=2013-08-15[/tpl]CPI Inflation Calculator, Bureau of Labor Statistics, retrieved Nov. 19, 2007 It now serves as a tourist attraction.
Though it is possible Sarah Winchester was simply seeking a change of location and a hobby during her lengthy depression, other sources claim that while consulting The Boston Medium, Winchester came to believe her family and fortune were haunted by the ghosts of people who had fallen victim to Winchester rifles, and that only by moving West and continuously building them a house could she appease these spirits.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/sarahwinchester.cfm| title=Sarah Winchester: Woman of Mystery| year=2003| publisher=Winchester Mystery House, LLC| accessdate=16 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Ghost Hunting: True Stories of Unexplained Phenomena from The Atlantic Paranormal Society|chapter=The Winchester Mystery July 2005|year=2007|last1=Hawes|first1=Jason|authorlink1=Jason Hawes|last2=Wilson|first2=Grant|authorlink2=Grant Wilson|last3=Friedman|first3=Michael Jan|authorlink3=Michael Jan Friedman|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4165-4113-4|lccn=2007016062|pages=225-229[/tpl] Located at 525 South Winchester Blvd. in San Jose, California, the Queen Anne Style Victorian mansion is renowned for its size and utter lack of any master building plan.

[[Y-Δ transform]]

CATEGORIES: Electrical circuits, Electric power, Graph operations, Circuit theorems

The Y-Δ transform, also written wye-delta and also known by many other names, is a mathematical technique to simplify the analysis of an electrical network. The name derives from the shapes of the circuit diagrams, which look respectively like the letter Y and the Greek capital letter Δ. This circuit transformation theory was published by Arthur Edwin Kennelly in 1899.A.E. Kennelly, Equivalence of triangles and stars in conducting networks, Electrical World and Engineer, vol. 34, pp. 413–414, 1899.   It is widely used in analysis of three-phase electric power circuits. 
The Y-Δ transform can be considered a special case of the star-mesh transform for three resistors.

William Ernst Trautmann was founding general-secretary of the U.S. Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and one of six people who initially laid plans for the organization in 1904.
He was born to German parents in New Zealand in 1869 and raised in Europe. After completing a brewing apprenticeship in Poland, he worked as a masterbrewer in Germany before being expelled for labor activities. In 1890 he moved to the United States, where he joined the Brewers Union. Trautmann was a key figure in the United Brewery Workers' Union in Milwaukee and the editor of the United Brewery Workers' German-language newspaper, Brauer Zeitung. He was expelled from that union for his participation in the founding IWW convention. In 1905, he joined with other industrial unionists to found the Industrial Workers of the World. Between 1905 and 1912, he mostly worked in the field as an organizer. In 1912, he broke with the IWW leadership over strike tactics and the alleged misuse of funds collected for the "Bread and Roses" strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. In 1913, Trautmann joined the so-called yellow IWW created by the Socialist Labor Party, which later became the Workers' International Industrial Union (WIIU), as a "full-time propagandist."Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 60
In 1922 Trautmann published a novel, Riot, drawing on his experiences as an IWW activist during the Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909 in McKees Rocks (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).

Bath and North East Somerset (commonly referred to as BANES or B&NES) is the district of the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset Council that was created on 1 April 1996 following the abolition of the County of Avon. It is part of the Ceremonial county of Somerset. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath.
Bath and North East Somerset covers an area of [tpl]convert|220|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl], of which two thirds is green belt. It stretches from the outskirts of Bristol, south into the Mendip Hills and east to the southern Cotswold Hills and Wiltshire border. The city of Bath is the principal settlement in the district, but BANES also covers Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Westfield and the Chew Valley.
The area has varied geography including river valleys and rolling hills. The history of human habitation is long but expanded massively during Roman times, and played significant roles in the Saxon era and English civil war. Industry developed from a largely agricultural basis to include coal mining with the coming of canals and railways. Bath developed as a spa resort in Georgian times and remains a major cultural tourism centre having gained World Heritage City status.

On May 20, 1948, the Israeli Carmeli Brigade captured al-Kabri ([tpl]lang-ar|الكابري[/tpl]), a Palestinian Arab village in the northwest corner of the region of the British Mandate of Palestine that was later incorporated into the State of Israel. On March 27, 1948, hundreds of armed villagers and units of the Arab Liberation Army attacked a Jewish convoy near the village, killing forty-nine Jews.  Six Arabs were also killed in the battle.  Two months later the commander of Operation Ben-Ami gave operational orders given that day were to "attack with the aim of capturing, the villages of Kabri, Umm al Faraj and Al-Nahr, to kill the men and and to destroy and set fire to the villages."Benvenisti (2000), pgs. 138-139Morris (2004), p253, 347. Benvenisti states that "the orders were carried out to the letter", while Morris writes that a number of villagers were apparently executed.Benvenisti (2000), pgs. 138-139Morris (2004), p254.
Al-Kabri was captured without any resistance and it was almost immediately depopulated. It was treated particularly harshly due to the villagers involvement with the destruction of the Jewish convoy. According to Walid Khalidi, an 'undisclosed number of villagers were taken prisoner and some were killed' and others were killed during their dispersal in Galilee when it was discovered that they had come from al-Kabri.Walid Khalidi, 'All That Remains'.

The Reverend Friar Thomas Joseph Hagerty (ca. 1862–1920s?) was an American Roman Catholic priest and trade union activist. Hagerty is remembered as one of the founding members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), as author of the influential Preamble to the Constitution of the IWW, and as the creator of "Hagerty's Wheel," a frequently reproduced illustration depicting the interrelation of the IWW's constituent industrial unions.
Hagerty abruptly abandoned the radical movement shortly after the formation of the IWW, adopting the pseudonym "Ricardo Moreno" and working as a Spanish teacher and an oculist. After 1920 Hagerty lived on the streets of Chicago in conditions of dire poverty, eking out a meager existence as a beggar.

David Frank Bellotti (born 13 August 1943) is a Liberal Democrat politician in the United Kingdom who was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Eastbourne constituency from 1990 to 1992.[tpl]Rayment-hc|e|1|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Bellotti first contested the Eastbourne seat at the 1979 general election, subsequently fighting Lewes in the 1983 and 1987 general elections under the Liberal banner. He then won the parliamentary seat of Eastbourne for the Liberal Democrats in the Eastbourne by-election following the assassination of Conservative MP Ian Gow by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Two years later Bellotti was defeated by Nigel Waterson in the 1992 general election in which John Major's Conservative government was re-elected.
He subsequently unsuccessfully contested the East Sussex and Kent South constituency in the 1994 elections to the European Parliament.
David Bellotti returned to local government, regaining a seat on the council. He then became CEO of Brighton & Hove Albion, a position in which he controversially took part in the sale of the club's stadium after their articles of association had been changed, allowing for profit to be made on the sale of the Goldstone Ground. This change was however reversed on the insistence of the Football Association, preventing directors from taking out more than they had invested. Bellotti became reviled by Brighton fans and left the area shortly afterwards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/brighton-rocked-by-civil-war-1360809.html |title=Brighton rocked by civil war |author=Greg Wood |date=29 October 1996 |work= |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=14 December 2009[/tpl]
Following the controversy over Brighton and Hove Albion, members of the Liberal Democrats in Eastbourne deselected him as candidate for the Park ward of East Sussex County Council.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]
After leaving the football club and losing his council seat Bellotti moved to Bath and became election agent for Don Foster MP.

The Hula massacre took place between 31 October and 1 November 1948. Hula (Hule, Hebrew: חולא) was a village in Lebanon 3 km west of Kibbutz Manara, not far from the Litani River. It was captured on October 24 by the Carmeli Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces without any resistance. The women and children were expelled, most of the men aged between 15 and 60 were shot. In total between 35 and 58 men were executed in a house which was later blown up on top of them. Tveit, Odd Karsten (2010) Goodbye Lebanon. Israel's First Defeat. Rimal Publication. Translated by Peter Scott-Hansen. ISBN 978-9963-715-03-9. p.368. Quoting General Dov Yermiya.
Two officers were responsible for the massacre.  One of them, first lieutenant Shmuel Lahis, who served as Company Commander, put on trial in an Israeli military court where he was given a seven-year sentence later reduced on appeal to one year, and was released in 1950.  He received a retrospective presidential amnesty in 1955. He became a lawyer, and later Director General of the Jewish Agency. Many Israelis  opposed to this appointing because of his involvement in the Hula massacre. (Journal of Palestine Studies, vol. VII, no. 4 (summer 1978), no. 28, pp. 143)
At his trial, Lahis put forth the defence that the crime had been committed outside the borders of Israel.  The military court rejected this defence but gave Lahis a postponement so that he could appeal this point to the High Court of Justice.  In the same HCJ case, the Israeli government argued that the HCJ did not have the right to interpret military law.  In February 1949, the HCJ rejected both the claim of Lahis and the claim of the government, allowing the trial to continue.Verdict from The Israeli High Court of Justice, Feb. 2, 1949; the written judgement was not provided until 1959: Shmuel Lahisse versus The Minister of Defense and others, HCJ 27/48. http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/48/270/000/Z01/48000270.z01.pdf

[[Will Bradley]]

CATEGORIES: Swing trombonists, Big band bandleaders, Bell Records artists, Musicians from New Jersey, People from Newton, New Jersey, 1912 births, 1989 deaths

Wilbur Schwictenberg (July 12, 1912 – July 15, 1989) was an American trombonist and bandleader who also performed under the name Will Bradley. He was known for swing and sweet dance music, as well as boogie woogie songs, many of which were written by Don Raye.
Born in Newton, New Jersey, Schwictenberg was one of the premier trombonists on the New York swing scene, and he often participated in jam sessions broadcast on The CBS Saturday Night Swing Club. In 1939 he and drummer Ray McKinley formed a big band, with Schwictenberg taking the professional name of Will Bradley. The Bradley band became well known for boogie-woogie, particularly its hit record, "Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar" with Freddie Slack on piano.via Associated Press. "Will Bradley, 78, Dies; Wrote Boogie-Woogie", The New York Times, July 19, 1989. Accessed November 27, 2007. This record, along with another big-band boogie woogie number, "Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat," and the original version of the classic, "Down the Road a Piece", were all three in the top 10 on the Billboard popular music charts at the same time, in late-1940. "Down the Road a Piece" was recorded with a pared-down trio called the "Will Bradley Trio," made up of McKinley, Doc Goldberg, and Freddie Slack, with guest vocals by songwriter Don Raye.
Will Bradley was one of the first bandleaders who appeared in Soundies, three-minute musical films made for coin-operated "movie jukeboxes." Bradley's films, made in late 1940, were widely distributed and gave the Bradley band valuable exposure. Drummer Ray McKinley did most of the vocals.
In 1942 McKinley left to form his own band and a few months after joined the United States Air Force, where he played in the Glenn Miller Air Force band. Bradley tried to maintain his band, but problems caused by the war forced Bradley to disband. Bradley became a studio musician, and played for many years in the The Tonight Show Band during the Johnny Carson era.

[[Septimania]]

CATEGORIES: Medieval France, Goths

Septimania ([tpl]lang-fr|Septimanie[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-fr|sɛptimani|IPA[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-oc|Septimània[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-oc|septiˈmanjɔ|IPA[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ca|Septimània[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ca|səptiˈmaniə|IPA[/tpl]) was the western region of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis that passed under the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply Gallia or Narbonensis. It corresponded roughly with the modern French region of Languedoc-Roussillon. It passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba in the eighth century before its conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it Gothia or the Gothic March (Marca Gothica).
Septimania was a march of the Carolingian Empire and then West Francia down to the thirteenth century, though it was culturally and politically separate from northern France and the central royal government. The region was under the influence of the people from Toulouse, Provence, and ancient Catalonia. It was part of the cultural and linguistic region named Occitania that was finally brought within the control of the French kings in the early 13th century as a result of the Albigensian Crusade after which it came under French governors. From the end of the thirteenth century it was known as Languedoc and its history is tied up with that of France.
The name "Septimania" may derive from part of the Roman name of the city of Béziers, Colonia Julia Septimanorum Beaterrae, which in turn alludes to the settlement of veterans of the Roman VII Legion in the city. Another possible derivation of the name is in reference to the seven cities (civitates) of the territory: Béziers, Elne, Agde, Narbonne, Lodève, Maguelonne, and Nîmes. Septimania extended to a line half-way between the Mediterranean and the Garonne River in the northwest; in the east the Rhône separated it from Provence; and to the south its boundary was formed by the Pyrenees.

[[Burning Flipside]]
CATEGORIES: Burning Man, Festivals in Texas

Burning Flipside (or Flipside) is an annual alternative arts and performance festival staged in Central Texas near Austin. Modeled on and loosely associated with Burning Man, Flipside is one of several Regional Burns around the USA.
Burning Flipside was started in 1998 by Burning Man participants from Texas. Lasting five days during the Memorial Day weekend, it is significantly smaller than Burning Man, with 2,007 tickets sold in 2007, compared to about 50,000 participants for Burning Man. Participants build a temporary city called Pyropolis; all of the structures in this city are dismantled and removed at the end of the event. The main structure, the "effigy", is burned the last night, as are many other pieces of art around Flipside.
The limited liability company which sells the tickets to Flipside, Austin Artistic Reconstruction, LLC prohibits all commercial use of photographs, video, film or any other medium taken at Burning Flipside without written permission.Burning Flipside Survival Guide, 2008. retrieved on 2010-01-22. Therefore, media from Flipside is inherently non-free content. This prohibition on commercial use of imagery appeared as early as 1999.
Many of the core values of Burning Flipside are borrowed from Burning Man, and Flipside uses the same terms, namely:Terdiman, Daniel. "In Seattle, a spark of Burning Man." CNET News. Retrieved from  on 2010-01-22. Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/5mzDzfWut
Art Installations -- Flipside community members bring art to the event for display, including large free-standing works, fire art, and interactive pieces.
Theme camps -- Groups of participants who build a structure or area for public entertainment with an underlying theme. (Example: Casineaux Camp - A camp with a Casino Theme with real gambling style games, but using donated prizes and fake coins.)
Performances -- Flipside has a number of performance spaces that are used by musicians, theatre groups, DJs, pageants, and interactive performances.
Similar to Burning Man's Black Rock Rangers, the Pyropolis Rangers mediate disputes and maintain security at the event; they wear a similar khaki uniform, and attempt to be non-intrusive to other participants. Unlike Burning Man, however, the event is not regularly patrolled by law enforcement, although they arrive quickly in the event of an emergency.
Flipside has some other differences from Burning Man. Flipside's location is in a private camp area in the wooded, grassy Texas Hill Country, unlike the extremely flat, very dusty dried lake bed in Black Rock Desert where Burning Man is held. The Texas Hill Country features creeks, swimming holes, and tree-covered groves that make camping a more comfortable experience than the harsh high Nevada desert. Flipside is slightly more strict about the vending rule: the only thing sold is ice. The smaller size of the event creates a sense that one could meet everyone, as part of a temporary community that encompasses all the event participants. Almost every participant of Flipside, including the event's organizers, pay to get in regardless of how much time they put in volunteering. The only exceptions Austin Artistic Reconstruction makes are four free tickets: two to the designer of the sticker, and two to the designer of the ticket.
Additionally, unlike Burning Man where the central effigy of a glowing neon man stays essentially unaltered from year to year (with alteration to its base and other design elements), the Flipside effigy changes radically with each event. For example, participants built and burned a 6-armed, cowboy hat-wearing Hanuman effigy in 2004, a rocket ship at the 2005 event, and a chalice at the 2006 event.

Jakob Maria Mierscheid MdB (born 1 March 1933) has been a fictitious politician in the German Bundestag since 11 December 1979. He was then the alleged deputy chairman of the Mittelstandsausschuss (Committee for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses) of the Bundestag in 1981 and 1982. According to his official biography, he was born in Morbach/Hunsrück, a very rural constituency in Rhineland-Palatinate. He is Catholic and a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.
The Mierscheid hoax was said to have been originally introduced as early as in the 1920s by Weimar Social Democrats to avoid paying restaurant bills[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]. He is now a widely known curiosity within the Bundestag and uses Twitter as means of communication.Der Spiegel, 09.04.2009, Die Welt der Phantome, Von Jochen Leffers, 2. Teil: Zwitschern mit Jakob Maria Mierscheid (The World of Phantoms, Twittering with JMM)
In 1983 the party magazine Vorwärts published the still valid ([tpl]As of|2002|lc=on[/tpl]) Mierscheid Law and claimed Mierscheid as the author, demonstrating a correlation between federal election results and West German industrial production.
The Bundestag official web site carries an ostensibly serious 'biography' and a photograph purporting to depict Mierscheid.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/abgeordnete/mierscheid/|title=Abgeordnete: Jakob Maria Mierscheid, SPD|accessdate=2008-07-19|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag[/tpl] In previous versions of the photograph his fashion sense seemed very antiquated and his eyeglasses were added later. The current (2010) image shows a balding man sitting in a chair, facing away from the camera, in the middle of the empty Hall of Representatives. The site lists 615 current names although the actual membership of the Bundestag is only 614. Mierscheid has his own stationery and e-mail address and issues press releases now and then.which are in fact answered by one of the SPD MoPs The picture of Mierscheid at the Bundestag is based on the RTL Samstag Nacht character Karl Ranseier.a fictitious person whose obituary appears in various forms as a running gag
The hoax is paralleled in Germany in a number of other areas, for example Friedrich Nagelmann is a known (fictional) lawyer and Edmund F. Dräcker is a known (fictional) diplomat. Mierscheid, Nagelmann and Dräcker each have a long list of publications which have sometimes really been published in otherwise reputable media (science journals, parliament press) - non-native readers might be fooled here (compare April Fools' Day).
They are used as well as test persons in questionnaires, to allow to distinguish between the real and guessed popularity of certain persons.

[[Decompression party]]

CATEGORIES: Burning Man

[tpl]About|events relating to Burning Man||Decompression (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Decompression[/tpl]
A decompression party, decom or decomp is a local reunion for Burning Man participants to help ease themselves back into everyday society after the "big event". It is not uncommon for Burning Man participants to experience "post-burn blues", and decompression events can help alleviate the feelings of loneliness and separation that can occur. The events provide an opportunity to participants to share feelings, art, performances and memories. As awareness of Burning Man has spread around the world, Decompression events have evolved to welcome newcomers to Burner culture. 
The decompression events can occur anywhere from September to December, and anything afterwards is typically considered a warm-up for the next Burning Man. There has been an official Decompression Party hosted by the Burning Man organization since 1999, but the various Regional networks typically prefer to host their own. The Burning Man organization has since made the term "Decompression" a registered trademark and must conform to a set of rules. The atmosphere at these parties vary, but are typically upbeat and energetic. The decompression parties are sometimes reminiscent of early Burning Man festivals due to their informality and smaller size. They are a related phenomenon to the dead dog parties common at the end of science fiction conventions.
The name comes from an analogy to diving, where decompression refers to a period of time spent by deep sea divers either in decompression chambers or at various depths on their way to the surface henceforth, gradually adjust to surface pressure in order to avoid the bends.

 [[Image:MichiganCopperCountry.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the region.]]
The Copper Country is an area in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States, including all of Keweenaw County, Michigan and most of Houghton, Baraga and  Ontonagon counties.  The area is so named as copper mining was prevalent there from 1845 until the late 1960s, with one mine (the White Pine mine) continuing through 1995. In its heyday, the area was the world's greatest producer of copper.An Interior Ellis Island: Ethnic Diversity and the Peopling of Michigan’s Copper Country, Keweenaw Ethnic Groups.  MTU Archives and Copper Country Historical Collection, J. Robert Van Pelt Library, Michigan Technological University.
The Copper Country is highly unusual among copper-mining districts in that the copper was predominantly in the form of copper metal (native copper) rather than the copper oxides or copper sulfides that form the copper ore at almost every other copper-mining district.  Native Americans mined copper from small pits as early as 3000 B.C.
The Michigan State Geologist Douglass Houghton (later to become mayor of Detroit) reported on the copper deposits in 1841.  The first successful copper mine, the Cliff mine, began operations in 1845, and many others quickly followed.  Mining of the most productive deposit, the Calumet conglomerate, began in 1865.  Mining took place along a belt that stretched about 100 miles southwest to northeast.Walter S. White (1968) The native-copper deposits of northern Michigan, in Ore Deposits of the United States, 1933-1967, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, v.1, p.303-325
While mining continues on a small scale, tourism and logging are now the area's major industries. Popular tourist destinations include the cities of Copper Harbor and Houghton, and the Porcupine Mountains with Lake of the Clouds. Snowmobiling is very popular in the winter, and snowmobile trails are found in most areas.
Large numbers of Finns, Swedes, Danes, Sami and Norwegians emigrated to the Upper Peninsula, especially the Keweenaw Peninsula, to work in the mines.  And they stayed on and prospered even after the copper mines closed.Simon, James and Finney, Patricia, Publication, Access and Preservation of Scandinavian Immigrant Press in North America, Center for Research Libraries, Quebec, Canada, August 10-14, 2008.
Ethnic groups that inhabited the area included: Chinese; Cornish;   Croatians; Finns; French Canadians; Germans; Irish; Italians; Native Americans; Poles; and Slovenes.
The Copper Country is largely rural, and much of it has been designated as state parks or similar designations. These include McLain State Park, Porcupine Mountains State Park, and the Copper Country State Forest.  The Keweenaw National Historical Park includes several important sites relating to the area's copper-mining history.
Institutions of higher education include Finlandia University in Hancock, founded in 1896 as Suomi College, and Michigan Technological University in Houghton, originally established in 1885 as the Michigan School of Mines.  Finlandia University is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, reflecting the spiritual heritage of the region's many Finnish immigrants. Michigan Tech was founded in response to the needs of the copper mines.
The Copper Country averages more snowfall than any part of the USA east of the Mississippi River, and more snowfall than any non-mountainous region of the continental United States.[tpl]cite web|title=Mean Monthly and Annual Snowfall: Conterminous United States|url=http://www.climatesource.com/us/fact_sheets/fact_snowfall_us.html|publisher=Climate Source|accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl]

[[Punk-O-Rama]]
CATEGORIES: Epitaph Records, Punk-O-Rama albums

Punk-O-Rama was a series of ten compilation albums published by Epitaph Records between 1994 and 2005. The first volume was released in 1994, the second in 1996, and the rest annually from 1998 to 2005. The albums included artists from Epitaph's roster as well as from its subsidiary label ANTI- and its partnership labels Hellcat Records and Burning Heart Records. In total the series included 257 songs contributed by 89 different artists.
As its title implied, the series featured mostly punk rock and various punk subgenres such as garage punk, hardcore punk, pop punk, post-hardcore, ska punk, skate punk, and street punk. However, as the series went on and the labels' rosters diversified, the music of the Punk-O-Rama compilations grew to include additional styles of music such as alternative hip hop, alternative rock, digital hardcore, emo, experimental music, garage rock, indie rock, metalcore, psychobilly, and screamo. 
The first four installments had cover art and layout by different artists and designers. C. Martin provided artwork and layout for both the fifth and sixth volumes, though they had differing styles and themes. Nick Pritchard of Metrosea.com provided artwork and layout for the final four volumes of the series, which adopted a more uniform look and style.
Epitaph also organized several Punk-O-Rama tours featuring bands that had contributed to the compilations, such as Agnostic Front, All, The Distillers, Guttermouth, Millencolin, Straight Faced, and the Voodoo Glow Skulls. Occasionally these would be accompanied by special Punk-O-Rama tour sampler CDs that differed from the main. series of compilation albums. In 2003 the label published the DVD Punk-O-Rama: The Videos, Volume 1, including 22 music videos and "The Epitaph Story", a short film relating the history of the label. Though a second volume was never published, the subsequent ninth and tenth albums in the compilation series included DVDs of music videos as well.
In 2006 Epitaph announced the retirement of the Punk-O-Rama brand in favor of a new series titled Unsound,[tpl]cite web|title = Unsound Vol. 1|publisher = Epitaph Records|url = http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/483/Unsound_Vol_1#albdesc|location = Los Angeles|accessdate = 2009-06-12[/tpl] the less genre-specific title being more conducive to the label's expanding roster of musical styles. However, to date only one compilation has been published under the Unsound banner.

Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER), also known as International A.N.S.W.E.R. and the ANSWER Coalition, is a United States-based protest umbrella group consisting of many antiwar and civil rights organizations. Formed in the wake of the September 11th attacks, ANSWER has since helped to organize many of the largest anti-war demonstrations in the United States, including demonstrations of hundreds of thousands against the Iraq War.[ref]

ANSWER characterizes itself as anti-imperialist, and its steering committee consists of socialists, civil rights advocates, and left-wing or progressive organizations from the Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, Filipino, Haitian, and Latin American communities. Many of ANSWER's lead organizers had ties to the International Action Center, and Workers World Party at the time of ANSWER's founding.
ANSWER has faced criticism from other anti-war groups for its affiliations, tactics at demonstrations, and allegedly sectarian approach to joint anti-war work. It also faced criticism from various sources for its claimed anti-Zionist politics.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

Saponification is a process that produces soap, usually from fats and lye. It involves a reaction between a base, usually sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), and an ester group on a compound. Triglycerides are an example, which is an ester of a fatty acid. The triglycerides are hydrolyzed to form the sodium salt of a carboxylate. In addition to soap, such traditional saponification processes produce glycerol.  "Saponifiable substances" are those that can be converted into soap.K. Schumann, K.

It is commonly referred to by its IATA code, which is incorporated in the airport's logo as "Fly XNA".
XNA opened in November 1998 as a replacement airport for commercial traffic previously served by Fayetteville's aging and inadequate Drake Field, which was undersized to serve the rapidly growing Northwest Arkansas region. It is perhaps the smallest airport to see year-round, nonstop daily service to major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC, largely due to the presence of one of the world's largest companies, Wal-Mart, in nearby Bentonville. Envoy Air (the regional carrier for American Airlines) is the major carrier, formerly serving 6 cities, and currently 4 from XNA: Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare, New York's LaGuardia, and Los Angeles. 
As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 547,871 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 530,087 enplanements in 2009, and 549,195 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).

[[Johann Christian Wilhelm Augusti]]
CATEGORIES: 1772 births, 1841 deaths, University of Bonn faculty

Johann Christian Wilhelm Augusti (1772–1841) was a German theologian.
Born at Eschenberga, near Gotha, Augusti was of Jewish descent, his grandfather having been a converted rabbi. He was educated at the gymnasium of Gotha and the University of Jena. At Jena he studied Oriental languages, of which he became professor there in 1803. Subsequently he was professor of theology (1812), and for a time rector, at Breslau. In 1819 he transferred to the University of Bonn, where he was made professor primarius. In 1828 he was appointed chief member of the consistorial council at Koblenz. There he was afterwards made director of the Rhenish Consistory of the Evangelical Church in Prussia. He died at Koblenz.
Augusti had little sympathy with the modern philosophical interpretations of dogma, and he held to the traditional faith. His works on theology (Dogmengeschichte, 1805) are simple statements of fact; they do not attempt a speculative treatment of their subjects. In 1809 he published in conjunction with WML de Wette a new translation of the Old Testament, Grundriss einer historisch critischen Einleitung ins Alte Testament (1806), his Exegetisches Handbuch des Alten Testaments (1797–1800), and his edition of Die Apochryphen des A. T. (1804).
In addition to these, his most important writings are the Denkwürdigkeiten aus der Christlichen Archäologie, 12 vols. (1817–1831), a partially digested class of materials, and the Handbuch der Christ. Archäologie, (1836–1837), which gives the substance of the larger work in a more compact and systematic form.

The Assyrian Church of the East ([tpl]lang-syc|ܥܕܬܐ ܕܡܕܢܚܐ ܕܐܬܘܪܝܐ[/tpl]), officially the Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the EastAn Introduction to the Christian Orthodox Churches, By John Binns, page 28 http://books.google.com/books?id=MOA5vfSl3dwC&pg=PA28&ots=4Xlc7SrvU5&dq=%22Apostolic+Catholic+Assyrian+Church+of+the+East&sig=7lX8LhoY23F3bXoC4K7Q4jsmnSA [tpl]lang-syc|ܥܕܬܐ ܩܕܝܫܬܐ ܘܫܠܝܚܝܬܐ ܩܬܘܠܝܩܝ ܕܡܕܢܚܐ ܕܐܬܘܪܝܐ[/tpl] ʻIttā Qaddishtā w-Shlikhāitā Qattoliqi d-Madnĕkhā d-Āturāyē), is a Syriac Church historically centered in Assyria/Assuristan, northern Mesopotamia. It is one of the churches that claim continuity with the historical Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon – the Church of the East. Unlike most other churches that trace their origins to antiquity, the modern Assyrian Church of the East is not in communion with any other churches, either Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, or Catholic.
Theologically, the church is associated with the doctrine of Nestorianism, leading to the church also being known as a "Nestorian Church", though church leadership has at times rejected the Nestorian label. The church employs the Syriac dialect of the Aramaic language in its liturgy, the East Syrian Rite, which includes three anaphoras, attributed to Saints Addai and Mari, Theodore of Mopsuestia and Nestorius.Cross, F.

The Church of the East developed from the early Assyrian Christian communities in the Assuristan province (Parthian ruled Assyria) of the Parthian Empire, and at its height had spread from its Mesopotamian heartland to as far as China, Central Asia and India. A dispute over patriarchal succession led to the Schism of 1552, resulting in there being two rival Patriarchs. One of the factions that eventually emerged from this split became the modern Assyrian Church of the East, in continuation from the Church of the East, while another became the church now known as the Chaldean Catholic Church, originally called The Church of Athura (Assyria) and Mosul, which eventually entered into communion with the Catholic Church.
A more recent schism in the church resulted from the adoption of the Assyrian Church of the East of the Gregorian Calendar rather than maintaining the traditional Julian calendar that is off by 13 days. The opponents to the reforms introduced formed in 1964 the Ancient Church of the East headquartered in Baghdad and headed since 1968 by a separate Catholicos-Patriarch.
The Assyrian Church of the East is headed by the Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, Mar Dinkha IV, who currently presides in exile in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Below the Catholicos-Patriarch are a number of metropolitan bishops, diocesan bishops, priests, and deacons who serve dioceses and parishes throughout the Middle East, India, North America, Oceania, and Europe (including the Caucasus and Russia)

[[Efficiency]]

CATEGORIES: Economics terminology, Qualities of thought, Heat transfer

Efficiency in general, describes the extent to which time, effort or cost is well used for the intended task or purpose. It is often used with the specific purpose of relaying the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome effectively with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.  "Efficiency"  has widely varying meanings in different disciplines.
The term "efficient" is very much confused and misused with the term "effective".  In general, efficiency is a measurable concept, quantitatively determined by the ratio of output to input.  "Effectiveness", is a relatively vague, non-quantitative concept, mainly concerned with achieving objectives. In several of these cases, efficiency can be expressed as a result as percentage of what ideally could be expected, hence with 100% as ideal case.  This does not always apply, not even in all cases where efficiency can be assigned a numerical value, e.g. not for specific impulse.
A simple way of distinguishing between efficiency and effectiveness is the saying, "Efficiency is doing things right, while Effectiveness is doing the right things."  This is based on the premise that selection of objectives of a process are just as important as the quality of that process.
A slightly broader mode of efficiency that nevertheless remains consistent with the "percentage" definition in many cases is to say that efficiency corresponds to the ratio r=P/C of the amount P of some valuable resource produced, per amount C of valuable resources consumed.This may correspond to a percentage if products and consumables are quantified in compatible units, and if consumables are transformed into products via a conservative process.  For example, in the analysis of the energy conversion efficiency of heat engines in thermodynamics, the product P may be the amount of useful work output, while the consumable C is the amount of high-temperature heat input.  Due to the conservation of energy, P can never be greater than C, and so the efficiency r is never greater than 100% (and in fact must be even less at finite temperatures).

"Punky Reggae Party" is a reggae song by Bob Marley, recorded and released in 1977. Not appearing on any studio album, it was released in 1977 as a 12-inch single in Jamaica only on the Tuff Gong and Black Art labels, as a b-side to the "Jamming" single on the Island label in some countries and was later released as a live single on Babylon by Bus. Subsequently, it appeared on a number of compilations and 'Best of' albums as well as the Deluxe Edition of Exodus and the 2002 CD reissue of Legend. The two versions of the song on the Jamaican 12-inch single were both featured on disc 2 of the Deluxe Edition of Exodus. The version featured on the 2002 CD reissue of Legend is the b-side version from the "Jamming" 12-inch single. There is also a version of the song released as a b-side on the "Jamming" 7-inch single which is much shorter.
The song was written by Bob Marley as a positive response to the release of a cover version of Junior Murvin's "Police and Thieves" by English punk band The Clash, on their first LP. Referring to the party of the title of the song, the lyrics mention several punk and reggae groups: "The Wailers will be there, The Damned, The Jam, The Clash – Maytals will be there, Dr. Feelgood too", Marley often repeated the words "New Wave" during the song.
Sly Dunbar played drums on this track. The drum track was recorded at Joe Gibbs studio.[tpl]cite web|last=Raver|first=Midnight|title=Ten Things You Did Not Know About Sly and Robbie|url=http://midnightraverblog.com/2013/12/24/sly-and-robbie/|publisher=Midnight Raver Blog|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl] 
The song was referred to in the Sublime song "Garden Grove" and the Robyn Hitchcock song "Antwoman."
In 2012, a band called Island Head released an instrumental version of "Punky Reggae Party".  Their version of the song features guitar, synthesizers, saxophone and trumpet instead of vocals.  Island Head (a.k.a. Island Head Musicians), led by drummer/producer Billy Messinetti, also released an album by the same title.

Haxby Hall is an estate in York Road, village of Haxby, York, England. It was built in 1790 on 22 acres (89,000 m²) of land.
In 1950, the owner of the estate, Kenneth Ward, donated the pleasure grounds around the building to the village (which is now part of the City of York), to build the Ethel Ward Memorial Playing Field. The playing field now contains a children's playground, ball playing courts, a scout center, and more. It is also the location of the village fairs and celebrations, and the home of the Haxby football teams, including Haxby United F.C who play in the York and District League.
Haxby Hall itself, now with only 3 acres (12,000 m²) of land, was demolished in 1960, and in 1965 it was replaced by the Haxby Hall Residential Home for the elderly (with accommodations for 52 elderly people), and an adjoining ambulance station.

The First Barbary War (1801–1805), also known as the Tripolitan War or the Barbary Coast War, was the first of two wars fought between the United States and the Northwest African Berber Muslim states known collectively as the Barbary States, nominally under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.dz/books?id=fQJI5cX-klYC&printsec=frontcover&hl=fr&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Wars of the Barbary Pirates | accessdate=27 August 2012 | pages=39[/tpl] These were Tripoli, Algiers, and Tunis, which were quasi-independent entities nominally belonging to the Ottoman Empire, and the independent Sultanate of Morocco. The war was fought because U.S. President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay the high tributes demanded by the Barbary states and because they were seizing American merchant ships and enslaving the crews for high ransoms. It was the first declared war the United States fought on foreign land and seas.

The Barbary Wars were two wars fought at different times over the same reasons  between the United States of America and the Barbary states (the de jure Ottoman Empire possessions of, but de facto independent, Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli) of North Africa in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. At issue was the Barbary pirates' demand for tribute from American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea. If ships of a given country failed to pay, pirates would attack the ships and take their goods, and often enslave crewmembers and hold them for ransom. When Thomas Jefferson became president he refused to pay tribute and sent a United States Naval fleet to the Mediterranean and bombarded the various fortified pirate cities and ultimately extracted concessions of fair passage from their rulers. Both the administrations of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison undertook the actions against the Barbary States at different times. Jefferson led the first, from 1801 to 1805, against pirates' cities in what are today Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria. Madison directed forces for the second war in 1815.

The Game of the Goose or Goose game  is a board game with uncertain origins. Some people connect the game with the Phaistos Disc (because of its spiral shape), others claim that it was originally a gift from Francesco I de' Medici of Florence to King Philip II of Spain sometime between 1574 and 1587,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8pJnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22gioco+dell'oca%22+%22Francesco+de'+Medici%22&dq=%22gioco+dell'oca%22+%22Francesco+de'+Medici%22|title=Scottish Life and Society: Scotland ... - Google Books |publisher=|date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2010-08-20[/tpl] while the latest theories attribute to the Templars the creation of the game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.juegodelaoca.com/Origenes/origenes.htm |title=Origenes del Juego de la Oca: Disco de Phaistos o Templarios |publisher=Juegodelaoca.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19[/tpl] According to these theories the Templars, possibly inspired by other games or discs (as the Phaistos Disc) from the Holy Land, developed a game and a secret or encrypted guide to the Way of St. James, representing each numbered space in the game a different stage in this journey. Furthermore, the hidden messages would not be just in the game but in the monuments, cathedrals and churches along the Way to Santiago de Compostela.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/television/cronicas---siempre-hacia-oeste/700869/ |title=Crónicas - Siempre hacia el oeste, Crónicas - RTVE.es A la Carta |language=[tpl]es icon[/tpl] |publisher=Rtve.es |date=2010-02-21 |accessdate=2012-03-19[/tpl] 
In June 1597 John Wolfe had attested that the game existed in London. It is thought to be the prototype for many of the commercial European racing board games of recent centuries. The game is mostly played in Europe and seen as family entertainment. Commercial versions of the game appeared in the 1880s and 1890s, and feature typical old European characteristics such as an old well and children in clothes from the period.  In the 1960s, the game company CO-5 marketed a variant called Gooses Wild.

[[Foam]]

CATEGORIES: Foams, Colloids

A foam is a substance that is formed by trapping pockets of gas in a liquid or solid. A bath sponge and the head on a glass of beer are examples of foams. In most foams, the volume of gas is large, with thin films of liquid or solid separating the regions of gas.
An important division of solid foams is into closed-cell foams and open-cell foams. In a closed-cell foam, the gas forms discrete pockets, each completely surrounded by the solid material. In an open-cell foam, the gas pockets connect with each other. A bath sponge is an example of an open-cell foam: water can easily flow through the entire structure, displacing the air. A camping mat is an example of a closed-cell foam: the gas pockets are sealed from each other, and so the mat cannot soak up water.
Foams are examples of dispersed media. In general, gas is present in large amount so it will be divided into gas bubbles of many different sizes (the material is polydisperse) separated by liquid regions which may form films, thinner and thinner when the liquid phase is drained out of the system films.[tpl]cite book |last1=Lucassen|first1=J. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first=E.

Thomas Hooker  (July 5, 1586 – July 7, 1647) was a prominent Puritan colonial leader, who founded the Colony of Connecticut after dissenting with Puritan leaders in Massachusetts.  He was known as an outstanding speaker and a leader of universal Christian suffrage.
Called today “the Father of Connecticut,” Thomas Hooker was a towering figure in the early development of colonial New England. He was one of the great preachers of his time, an erudite writer on Christian subjects, the first minister of Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the first settlers and founders of both the city of Hartford and the state of Connecticut, and cited by many as the inspiration for the "Fundamental Orders of Connecticut," cited by some as the world's first written democratic constitution that established a representative government.Following the Rev. Hooker’s sermon in which he declared, “The foundation of authority is laid in the free consent of the people,” the Fundamental Orders were adopted by the colony of Connecticut on January 14, 1639 (by New Style reckoning). While some modern historians dispute the claim that this was the first constitution in the western democratic tradition, neither the Mayflower Compact nor the Narragansett communities agreements established any forms of government. Furthermore, former Connecticut Chief Justice Simeon E. Baldwin upheld the claim in Norris Osborn’s History of Connecticut in Monographic Form, declaring that “never had a company of men deliberately met to frame a social compact for immediate use, constituting a new and independent commonwealth, with definite officers, executive and legislative, and prescribed rules and modes of government, until the first planters of Connecticut came together for their great work on January 14th, 1638-9.” Drafted primarily by Roger Ludlow, it was clearly the first compact between a government and the people to uphold the Rev. Hooker’s proclamation that the foundation of constitutional authority was with the people. Ref: Osborn, Norris Galpin, Editor, History of Connecticut in Monographic Form (States History Co., 1925); Hooker, John, An Account of the Reunion of the Descendants of Rev. Thomas Hooker (The Salem Press, 1890), p. 27; Logan, Walter Seth, Thomas Hooker, the First American Democrat (The Order of the Founders and Patriots of America, 1904), p. 19; Lutz, Donald S., Stephen L. Schechter & Richard B. Bernstein, Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted, p. 24; CT.gov, The Official State of Connecticut Website ; Connecticut, History of the USA www.usahistory.info/New-England/Connecticut.html.
Most likely coming out of the county of Leicestershire, in the East Midlands region, the Hooker family was prominent at least as far back as the reign of Henry VIII. There is known to have been a great Hooker family in Devon (colloquially called Devonshire, in the middle of the southwestern peninsula), well known throughout Southern England. The Devon branch produced the great theologian and clergyman, the Rev. Richard Hooker who, with Sir Walter Raleigh, was one of the two most influential sons of Exeter, the county town of Devon. Family genealogist Edward Hooker linked the Rev. Thomas to the Rev. Richard and the Devon branch. Other Hooker genealogists, however, have traced the Rev. Thomas back to Leicestershire where, in fact, he is said to have been born. Positive evidence linking Thomas to Leicestershire is lacking since the Marefield parish records from before 1610 perished. Any link to the Rev. Richard is likewise lacking since the Rev. Thomas’s personal papers were disposed of and his house destroyed after his death. There remains no evidence giving positive information as to which region Hooker came from, so the issue remains unsettled.Hooker, Edward, “The Origin and Ancestry of Rev.

(originally short for excited dimer) is a short-lived dimeric or heterodimeric molecule formed from two species, at least one of which has completely filled valence shell by electrons (for example, noble gases). In this case, formation of molecule is possible only if such atom is in an electronic excited state. Heteronuclear molecules and molecules that have more than two species are also called exciplex molecules (originally short for excited complex). Excimers are often diatomic and are composed of two atoms or molecules that would not bond if both were in the ground state. The lifetime of an excimer is very short, on the order of nanoseconds. Binding of a larger number of excited atoms form Rydberg matter clusters, the lifetime of which can exceed many seconds.

The Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche, intorno à due nuove scienze), published in 1638 was Galileo's final book and a scientific testament covering much of his work in physics over the preceding thirty years.
After his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,  the Roman Inquisition had banned the publication of any of Galileo's works, including any he might write in the future.[tpl]anchor|_note-publication-ban[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Drake|1978|p=367[/tpl]. See Galileo affair for further details. After the failure of his initial attempts to publish Two New Sciences in France, Germany, and Poland, it was published by Lodewijk Elzevir who was working in Leiden, South Holland, where the writ of the Inquisition was of less consequence (see House of Elzevir).[tpl]cite news |title=The foundation of mechanics |url=http://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n38/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 6, 1914 |accessdate=July 28, 2012[/tpl]
Discourses was written in a style similar to Dialogues, in which three men (Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati) discuss and debate the various questions Galileo is seeking to answer. There is a notable change in the men, however; Simplicio, in particular, is no longer quite as simple-minded and stubborn an Aristotelian as his name implies. His arguments are representative of Galileo's own early beliefs, as Sagredo represents his middle period,  and Salviati proposes Galileo's newest models.

Deficit spending is the amount by which spending exceeds revenue over a particular period of time, also called simply deficit, or budget deficit; the opposite of budget surplus. The term may be applied to the budget of a government, private company, or individual.
Government deficit spending is a central point of controversy in economics, as discussed below.  Much of the discussion is an obsolete argument between two schools of thought, those of Keynes and Hayek based on their theories and policies for the economy of the UK as it existed in the 1930s and those of the classical economists such as the Austrians who preceded them.  The theories and ideas of both  in their application to the United States and the US dollar were superseded in the 1960s by those of John Lindauer (The General Theories of Inflation, Unemployment, and Government Deficits) and George Stigler[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl].

Gary Mark Gilmore (December 4, 1940 – January 17, 1977) was an American criminal who gained international notoriety for demanding the execution of his death sentence for two murders he committed in Utah. After the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a new series of death penalty statutes in the 1976 decision Gregg v. Georgia, he became the first person executed in the United States in ten years.[tpl]cite news|last=Hughes|first=Graham|title=License to Kill|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1979/jun/28/license-to-kill/?pagination=false|accessdate=29 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=28 June 1979[/tpl] These new statutes avoided the problems under the 1972 decision in Furman v.

[[Debt consolidation]]
CATEGORIES: Debt, Credit, Insolvency

Debt consolidation entails taking out one loan to pay off many others. This is often done to secure a lower interest rate, secure a fixed interest rate or for the convenience of servicing only one loan.[tpl]cite book|author=Joan Ryan|title=Personal Financial Literacy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zdWrPiSGXY4C&pg=PA292|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=14 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-8400-5829-4|pages=292–[/tpl]
Debt consolidation can simply be from a number of unsecured loans into another unsecured loan, but more often it involves a secured loan against an asset that serves as collateral, most commonly a house. In this case, a mortgage is secured against the house.   The collateralization of the loan allows a lower interest rate than without it, because by collateralizing, the asset owner agrees to allow the forced sale (foreclosure) of the asset to pay back the loan. The risk to the lender is reduced so the interest rate offered is lower.
Sometimes, debt consolidation companies can discount the amount of the loan. When the debtor is in danger of bankruptcy, the debt consolidator will buy the loan at a discount. A prudent debtor can shop around for consolidators who will pass along some of the savings. Consolidation can affect the ability of the debtor to discharge debts in bankruptcy, so the decision to consolidate must be weighed carefully.
Debt consolidation is often advisable in theory when someone is paying credit card debt.[tpl]cite book|author1=Lois A. Vitt|author2=E. Craig MacBean|author3=Jürg K. Siegenthaler|coauthors=Institute for Socio-Financial Studies|title=Encyclopedia of Retirement and Finance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lc3zy80-h_AC&pg=PA37|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=30 November 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32834-3|pages=37–[/tpl] Credit cards can carry a much larger interest rate than even an unsecured loan from a bank. Debtors with property such as a home or car may get a lower rate through a secured loan using their property as collateral.  Then the total interest and the total cash flow paid towards the debt is lower allowing the debt to be paid off sooner, incurring less interest.

A series of three-letter trade terms related to common contractual sales practices, the Incoterms rules are intended primarily to clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks associated with the transportation and delivery of goods.
The Incoterms rules are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of most commonly used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove altogether uncertainties arising from different interpretation of the rules in different countries. As such they are regularly incorporated into sales contracts[tpl]cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-guide-to-incoterms-2010 | title = ICC Guide to Incoterms® 2010 | accessdate = March 14, 2014 | publisher = ICC[/tpl] worldwide.

[[Ship of Theseus]]

CATEGORIES: Identity paradoxes, Logic, Identity, Theseus, Thought experiments in philosophy

The ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus' paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object which has had all its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late 1st century. Plutarch asked whether a ship which was restored by replacing each and every one of its wooden parts remained the same ship.
The paradox had been discussed by more ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus, Socrates, and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings; and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. There are several variants, notably "grandfather's axe".  This thought experiment is "a model for the philosophers"; some say, "it remained the same," some saying, "it did not remain the same".Rea, M., 1995: "The Problem of Material Constitution," The Philosophical Review, 104: 525-552.

The Battle of Ain Jalut (Ayn Jalut, in Arabic: [tpl]lang|ar|عين جالوت[/tpl], the "Spring of Goliath", or Harod Spring, in Hebrew: [tpl]lang|he|מעין חרוד[/tpl]) took place on 3 September 1260 between Muslim Mamluks and the Mongols in the southeastern Galilee, in the Jezreel Valley, not far from Zir'in. The battle marked the high-water point of Mongol conquests, and was the first time a Mongol advance had ever been permanently beaten back in direct combat on the battlefield.
After previous battlefield defeats, the Mongols had always returned and avenged their loss, ultimately defeating their enemies. The Battle of Ain Jalut marked the first time they were unable to do so. The Mongol Ilkhanate leader Hulagu Khan was not able to advance into Egypt, and the Khanate he established in Persia was only able to defeat the Mamluks once in subsequent expeditions, briefly reoccupying Syria and parts of Galilee for a few months in 1300.

[[Antivirus software]]
CATEGORIES: Antivirus software, Utility software types

Antivirus, anti-virus, or AV software is computer software used to prevent, detect and remove malicious  computer viruses. Most software described as antivirus also works against other types of malware, such as malicious Browser Helper Objects (BHOs), browser hijackers, ransomware, keyloggers, backdoors, rootkits, trojan horses, worms, malicious LSPs, dialers, fraudtools, adware and spyware.lifehacker: The Difference Between Antivirus and Anti-Malware (and Which to Use) Computer security, including protection from social engineering techniques, is commonly offered in products and services of antivirus software companies.[tpl]cite web|title=What is antivirus software?|url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/resources/antivirus-whatis.aspx|publisher=Microsoft[/tpl]  This page discusses the software used for the prevention, detection, and removal of malware threats, rather than computer security implemented by software methods.
A variety of strategies are typically employed. Signature-based detection involves searching for known patterns of data within executable code. However, it is possible for a computer to be infected with new malware for which no signature is yet known; and malware is often modified to change its signature without affecting functionality. To counter such so-called zero-day threats, heuristics can be used. One type of heuristic approach, generic signatures, can identify variants by looking for slight variations of known malicious code in files. Some antivirus software can also predict what a file will do by running it in a sandbox and analyzing what it does to see if it performs any actions which could be malicious.
Antivirus software has some drawbacks. It can impair a computer's performance.[tpl]cite web|title=How Antivirus Software Can Slow Down Your Computer|url=http://www.support.com/blog/post/how-antivirus-software-can-slow-down-your-computer|publisher=Support.com Blog|accessdate=2010-07-26[/tpl] Inexperienced users can be lulled into a false sense of security when using the computer, considering themselves to be totally protected, and may have problems understanding the prompts and decisions that antivirus software presents them with. An incorrect decision may lead to a security breach. If the antivirus software employs heuristic detection, it must be fine-tuned to minimize misidentifying harmless software as malicious (false positive).[tpl]cite web | title=Softpedia Exclusive Interview: Avira 10 | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Avira-s-New-Anti-Malware-Fleet-139829.shtml| work=Ionut Ilascu | publisher=Softpedia | date=14 April 2010  | accessdate=2011-09-11[/tpl] Antivirus software itself usually runs at the highly trusted kernel level of the operating system to allow it access to all potential malicious process and files, creating a potential avenue of attack.[tpl]cite web | title=Norton AntiVirus ignores malicious WMI instructions | url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Norton-AntiVirus-ignores-malicious-WMI-instructions/0,130061744,139163678,00.htm | work=Munir Kotadia | publisher=CBS Interactive | date=21 October 2004  | accessdate=2009-04-05[/tpl]

The Greater Scaup (Aythya marila), just Scaup in Europe, or colloquially "Bluebill" in North America for its bright blue bill, is a mid-sized diving duck though it is larger than the closely related Lesser Scaup. It is a circumpolar species, which means that its range circles one of Earth's poles. It spends the summer months breeding in Alaska, northern Canada, Siberia, and the northernmost reaches of Europe. During the winter, it migrates south down the coasts of North America, Europe, and Japan.
Drake Greater Scaup are larger and have more rounded heads than females; they have a bright blue bill and yellow eyes. They have dark heads with a glossy green tint, white undersides and wings with white on the tips. The females are mostly brown, with white bands located on their wingtips. They have a blue bill that is slightly duller then the drake's.
Greater Scaup nest near water, typically on islands in northern lakes or on floating mats of vegetation. They begin breeding at age two, but start building nests in the first year. The drakes have a complex courtship procedure, which takes place on the return migration to the summer breeding grounds and concludes with the formation of monogamous pairs. Females lay a clutch of six to nine olive-buff colored eggs. The eggs hatch in 24 to 28 days. The down-covered ducklings are able to follow their mother in her search for food immediately after hatching.
Greater Scaup eat aquatic mollusks, plants, and insects, which they obtain by diving underwater. They form large groups, called "rafts", that can number in the thousands. Their main threat is human development, although they are preyed upon by owls, skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and humans. Greater Scaup populations have been declining since the 1980s; however, they are still listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List.

The Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) is a small North American diving duck that migrates south as far as Central America in winter. It is colloquially known as the Little Bluebill or Broadbill because of its distinctive blue bill. The origin of the name scaup may stem from the bird's preference for feeding on scalp – the Scottish word for clams, oysters, and mussels; however, some credit it to the female's discordant scaup call as the name's source. It is apparently a very close relative of the Holarctic Greater Scaup or "bluebill" (A. marila), with which it forms a superspecies.

A vassal or feudatoryHughes, Michael (1992). Early Modern Germany, 1477-1806, MacMillan Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, p. 18. ISBN 0-8122-1427-7. is a person who has entered into a mutual obligation to a lord or monarch in the context of the feudal system in medieval Europe. The obligations often included military support and mutual protection, in exchange for certain privileges, usually including the grant of land held as a fiefdom.F. L. Ganshof, "Benefice and Vassalage in the Age of Charlemagne" Cambridge Historical Journal 6.2 (1939:147-75). The term can be applied to similar arrangements in other feudal societies. In contrast, a fidelity, or fidelitas, was a sworn loyalty, subject to the king.Ganshof 151 note 23 and passim; the essential point was made again, and the documents on which the historian's view of vassalage are based were reviewed, with translation and commentary, by Elizabeth Magnou-Nortier, Foi et Fidélité.

The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was a radical labor union that gained a reputation for militancy in the mines of the western United States and British Columbia. Its efforts to organize both hard rock miners and smelter workers brought it into sharp conflicts – and often pitched battles – with both employers and governmental authorities. One of the most dramatic of these struggles occurred in the Cripple Creek district in 1903–04, and has been called the Colorado Labor Wars. The WFM also played a key role in the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World in 1905, but left that organization several years later.
The WFM changed its name to the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (more familiarly referred to as Mine Mill) in 1916. After a period of decline it revived in the early days of the New Deal and helped found the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1935. The Mine Mill union was expelled from the CIO in 1950 during the post-war red scare for refusing to shed its communist leadership. After spending years fighting off efforts by the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) to raid its membership, Mine Mill and the USWA merged in 1967.

The Second Barbary War (1815), also known as the Algerine or Algerian War, was the second of two wars fought between the United States and the Ottoman Empire's North African regencies of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algeria, known collectively as the Barbary states. The war between the Barbary states and the U.S. ended in 1815; the international dispute would effectively be ended the following year by Great Britain and the Netherlands. The war brought an end to the American practice of paying tribute to the pirate states and helped mark the beginning of the end of piracy in that region, which had been rampant in the days of Ottoman domination (16th–18th centuries). Within decades, European powers built ever more sophisticated and expensive ships which the Barbary pirates could not match in numbers or technology.[tpl]cite book |title=The End of Barbary Terror, America's 1815 War against the Pirates of North Africa  |ref=Leiner, The End of Barbary Terror |last=Leiner |first=Frederic C. |year=2007 |pages=39–50 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2007 |ISBN=978-0-19-532540-9[/tpl]

In marketing and the social sciences, observational research (or field research) is a social research technique that involves the direct observation of phenomena in their natural setting. This differentiates it from experimental research in which a quasi-artificial environment is created to control for spurious factors, and where at least one of the variables is manipulated as part of the experiment.

"When the Levee Breaks" is a blues song written and first recorded by husband and wife Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie in 1929. The song is in reaction to the upheaval caused by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.
It was re-worked by English rock group Led Zeppelin as the last song on their fourth album, released in 1971. The lyrics in Led Zeppelin's version, credited to Memphis Minnie and the individual members of Led Zeppelin, were partially based on the original recording.  Many other artists have also recorded versions of the song or played it live.

[[Industrial unionism]]

CATEGORIES: Labour relations, Syndicalism, Industrial Workers of the World

Industrial unionism is a labor union organizing method through which all workers in the same industry are organized into the same union—regardless of skill or trade—thus giving workers in one industry, or in all industries, more leverage in bargaining and in strike situations. Advocates of industrial unionism value its contributions to building unity and solidarity, many suggesting the slogans, "an injury to one is an injury to all" and "the longer the picket line, the shorter the strike."
Industrial unionism contrasts with craft unionism, which organizes workers along lines of their specific trades, i.e., workers using the same kind of tools, or doing the same kind of work with approximately the same level of skill,Marion Dutton Savage, Industrial Unionism in America, 1922, page 3. even if this leads to multiple union locals (with different contracts, and different expiration dates) in the same workplace.

Tripoli ([tpl]lang-ar|طرابلس[/tpl] / ALA-LC: Ṭarābulus;
 Lebanese Arabic: Ṭrāblos; [tpl]lang-el|Τρίπολις[/tpl] / Tripolis) is the largest city in northern Lebanon and the second-largest city in the country. Situated [tpl]convert|85|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] north of the capital Beirut, it is the capital of the North Governorate and the Tripoli District. Tripoli overlooks the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and it is the easternmost seaport in Lebanon. It holds offshore a string of four small islands, the only surviving islands of Lebanon. The largest of these islands, the Island of Palm Trees, was declared a protected reserve by UNESCO in 1992 for its rich ecosystem of trees, green sea turtles, and exotic birds.
With the history of Tripoli dating back to the 14th century BCE, it is home to the largest fortress in Lebanon (the Citadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles), and continues to be the second largest city (behind Cairo) in Mamluk architectural heritage. In ancient times, it was the center of a Phoenician confederation which included Tyre, Sidon and Arados, hence the name Tripoli, meaning "triple city" in Greek. Later, it was controlled successively by the Assyrian Empire, Persian Empire, Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Caliphate, the Seljuk Empire, Crusader States, the Mamluks, the Ottoman Empire and France. The Crusaders established the County of Tripoli there in the 12th century.
With the formation of Lebanon, Tripoli, once equal in economic and commercial importance to Beirut, was cut off from its traditional trade relations with the Syrian interior and declined in relative prosperity.http://www.mafhoum.com/press10/312P1.htm
The city borders El Mina, the port of the Tripoli District, which it is geographically conjoined with to form the greater Tripoli conurbation.

Port Phillip  (also commonly referred to as Port Phillip Bay or (locally) just The Bay), is a large bay in southern Victoria, Australia; it is the location of Melbourne. Geographically, the bay covers [tpl]convert|1930|km2|acre[/tpl] and the shore stretches roughly [tpl]convert|264|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. Although it is extremely shallow for its size, most of the bay is navigable. The deepest portion is only [tpl]convert|24|m|ft[/tpl], and half the region is shallower than [tpl]convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The volume of the water in the bay is around [tpl]convert|25|km3[/tpl].
Prior to British settlement the area around Port Phillip was divided between the territories of the Wathaurong (to the west), Wurundjeri (north) and Boonwurrung (south and east) Nations.  Its waters and coast are home to seals, whales, dolphins, corals and many kinds of seabirds and migratory waders.
The first British to enter the bay were the crews of [tpl]HMS|Lady Nelson|1798|6[/tpl], commanded by John Murray and, ten weeks later, HMS Investigator commanded by Matthew Flinders, in 1802. Subsequent expeditions into the bay took place in 1803 to establish the first settlement in Victoria, near Sorrento, but was abandoned in 1804. Thirty years later, settlers from Tasmania returned to establish Melbourne, now the state's capital city, at the mouth of the Yarra River in 1835 and Geelong at Corio Bay in 1838. Today Port Phillip is the most densely populated catchment in Australia[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] with an estimated 4.5 million people living around the bay; Melbourne's suburbs extend around much of the northern and eastern shorelines, and the city of Geelong sprawls around Corio Bay, in the bay's western arm.

The Regina Manifesto  was the programme of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and was adopted at the first national convention of the CCF held in Regina, Saskatchewan in 1933.  The primary goal of the "Regina Manifesto" was to eradicate the system of capitalism and replace it with a planned economy of socialism. http://www.saskndp.com/documents/manifest.pdf The CCF was a democratic socialist party founded in 1932 by farmers, workers and socialist groups against the backdrop of the Great Depression.
The Manifesto was largely written by members of the League for Social Reconstruction, particularly Frank Underhill and F.R. Scott, and called for  "a planned and socialized economy in which our natural resources and principal means of production and distribution are owned, controlled and operated by the people". Specifically it called for the nationalization of transportation, communications, electrical power and other services. It called for a planned economy and a national banking system that would be "removed from the control of private profit-seeking interests." It advocated the ability to organize in trade unions and called for a National Labour Code "to secure for the worker maximum income and leisure, insurance covering illness, accident, old age, and unemployment." The Regina Manifesto proposed social service programs such as publicly funded health care, supported peace, promoted co-operative enterprises and vowed that "No C.C.F. Government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the Cooperative Commonwealth."
The Regina Manifesto remained the CCF's official programme until 1956 when, in the face of the strong anti-communist sentiment of the Cold War, it was replaced by the more moderate Winnipeg Declaration which substituted Keynesian economics for socialist remedies.

GoldenEye (1995) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first film in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A817823 | title =The James Bond Films – 1994–2002 | date=10 November 2002| accessdate =22 October 2007 |work=BBC News [/tpl] The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to prevent an arms syndicate from using the GoldenEye satellite weapon against London in order to cause a global financial meltdown.
GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.
The film accumulated a worldwide gross of US$350.7 million, considerably better than Dalton's films, without taking inflation into account.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php | title =Box Office History for James Bond Movies | accessdate =18 October 2007 | work =The Numbers | publisher= Nash Information Service [/tpl] Some critics viewed the film as a modernisation of the series, and felt Brosnan was a definite improvement over his predecessor.[tpl]cite web | title=GoldenEye | publisher=Qnetwork | url=http://www.qnetwork.com/?page=review&id=348 | accessdate=27 April 2007 | author= James Kendrick[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=GoldenEye |work=Variety| author=Todd McCarthy | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904690.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | date= 15 November 1995| accessdate=18 November 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=GoldenEye | publisher=Filmcritic.com | url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/9503ab99be3b464086256275001adc5a?OpenDocument | accessdate=27 April 2007 |author=Christopher Null|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013021650/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/9503ab99be3b464086256275001adc5a?OpenDocument |archivedate = 13 October 2007[/tpl] The film also received award nominations for "Best Achievement in Special Effects" and "Best Sound" from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1995|title=Film Nominations 1995|publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts|accessdate=5 April 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080228220536/http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1995 |archivedate=28 February 2008[/tpl]
The name "GoldenEye" pays homage to James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. While working for British Naval Intelligence as a lieutenant commander, Ian Fleming liaised with the American OSS to monitor developments in Spain after the Spanish Civil War in an operation codenamed Operation Goldeneye. Fleming used the name of his operation for his estate in Oracabessa, Jamaica.

[[Ulrich Molitor]]
CATEGORIES: 1440s births, 1507 deaths, Witch hunting, Demonologists

Ulrich Molitor (also Molitoris) (born c. 1442, died before 23 December 1507) was a legal scholar. He wrote an early treatise on witchcraft, De Lamiis et Pythonicis Mulieribus (Of Witches and Diviner Women), published in 1489[tpl]Citation  | last1 = Robbins | first1 = Rossell  | title = The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology  | publisher = Crown Publishers Inc.  | year = 1959  | isbn = 0-600-01183-6 [/tpl]
when he was Doctor of Laws of Padua and professor at the University of Constance. The work is written in the form of a dialogue.
Molitor was one of the sceptical or "moderate" proponents of witchcraft of his time. 
Although Molitor supported the death sentence for heretics and practitioners of witchcraft, from a moderate point of view for his time he considered that the Sabbaths were an illusion caused by the Devil and not a reality.
He wrote the work to  allay the doubts  held by Archduke Sigismund of Austria regarding the topic. Sigismund had had learned of witchcraft from the Dominican inquisitors, James Sprenger and Heinrich Kramer, who had journeyed to the Tyrol to "root out witchcraft",  but he was unconvinced of their claims;  Sigismund in the dialogue was quick to dismiss evidence that was produced through the use of torture: "For the fear of punishments incites men to say what is contrary to the nature of the facts".
Molitor  often quotes the Bible, Church Fathers and poets. Omnipresent is Molitor's conviction in the power of the devil who acts through the permission of God, to deceive mortals who are thereby culpable. He explained Merlin as a real human being and not, as many authorities commonly believed, the offspring of a devil and a woman.

[[Elasticity (physics)]]
CATEGORIES: Elasticity (physics)

In physics, elasticity (from Greek ἐλαστός "ductible") is the tendency of solid materials to return to their original shape after being deformed.  Solid objects will deform when forces are applied on them.  If the material is elastic, the object will return to its initial shape and size when these forces are removed.
The physical reasons for elastic behavior can be quite different for different materials.  In metals, the atomic lattice changes size and shape when forces are applied (energy is added to the system).  When forces are removed, the lattice goes back to the original lower energy state.  For rubbers and other polymers, elasticity is caused by the stretching of polymer chains when forces are applied.
Perfect elasticity is an approximation of the real world and few materials remain purely elastic even after very small deformations.  In engineering, the amount of elasticity of a material is determined by two types of material parameter.  The first type of material parameter is called a modulus which measures the amount of force per unit area (stress) needed to achieve a given amount of deformation.  The units of modulus are pascals (Pa) or pounds of force per square inch (psi, also lbf/in2). A higher modulus typically indicates that the material is harder to deform.  The second type of parameter measures the elastic limit.  The limit can be a stress beyond which the material is no longer elastic or a deformation beyond which elasticity is lost.
When describing the relative elasticities of two materials, both the modulus and the elastic limit have to be considered.  Rubbers typically have a low modulus and tend to stretch a lot (that is, they have a high elastic limit) and so appear more elastic than metals (high modulus and low elastic limit) in everyday experience.  Of two rubber materials with the same elastic limit, the one with a lower modulus will appear to be more elastic.

Jacob Johan Anckarström (11 May 1762 – 27 April 1792) was a Swedish military officer who was convicted and executed for regicide. He was the son of Jacob Johan Anckarström the Elder. He served as a captain in King Gustav III's regiment between 1778 and 1783. During travels to Gotland, he was accused of slandering the king and fled to Stockholm, where he spent the winter, but was subsequently arrested, brought back and tried in Gotland. Although he was acquitted due to lack of evidence, he later maintained in his confession that this incident sparked his fire of hatred towards the king, fuelled by the contemporary revolutionary movement in Europe.
On 16 March 1792, Gustav III had returned to Stockholm, after spending the day at Haga Palace outside the city, to dine and visit a masquerade ball at the Royal Opera. During dinner, he received an anonymous letter that contained a threat to his life, but as the king had received numerous threatening letters in the past, he chose to ignore the warning.
After dining, he left his rooms to take part in the masquerade. Soon after entering, he was surrounded by Anckarström and his co-conspirators, among them Counts Claes Horn and Adolf Ribbing, who wore black masks and greeted him in French with the words "Bonjour, beau masque" ("Good-day, fine mask"). Anckarström moved in behind the king and fired a pistol-shot into the left side of his back. The murder weapon was loaded with two balls, five shot and six bent nails. The King jumped aside, crying in French "Ah! Je suis blessé, tirez-moi d'ici et arrêtez-le" ("Ah! I am wounded, take me away from here and stop him!"). The king was immediately carried back to his quarters, and the exits of the Opera were sealed. Anckarström was able to flee before the doors were sealed, but left the pistols behind, who were brought around to several gun-smiths the next morning. A gun-smith, who had repaired them for Anckarström, recognised them and identified him as their owner. Anckarström was arrested the same morning and immediately confessed to the murder, although he denied a conspiracy until he was informed that Horn and Ribbing had been arrested and confessed in full.
Anckarström was jailed in a prison not far from the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Today the former prison is an underground restaurant named after the viceroy Sten Sture.
Curiously, the murder had been predicted to the king four years earlier, when he paid an anonymous visit to the celebrated medium of the Gustavian era, Ulrica Arfvidsson. She was often employed by his brother, Duke Charles, and was said to have a large net of informers all over town; she was never suspected to be involved, but she was questioned about the murder.
Gustav III died of his wounds on 29 March, and on 16 April Anckarström was sentenced. He was stripped of his estates and nobility privileges. He was sentenced to be cast in irons for three days and flogged, and his right hand was to be cut off before he was decapitated. The execution took place on 27 April 1792.
In the same year, the Anckarström family changed its surname to Löwenström and donated funds for a hospital as a gift of appeasement. This resulted in the Löwenström Hospital, or Löwenströmska sjukhuset. Living descendants of Anckarström include Ulf Adelsohn and the American actress Alexandra Neil.

It is situated on the north-eastern coast of Lantau Island in the New Territories. The development spans an area of [tpl]convert|650|ha|acre|abbr=off[/tpl], and includes two bays, the Tai Pak Bay (大白灣) and Yi Pak Bay (二白灣). 
DB has a current population of around 18,000 residentsHKR International Limited - Our Businesses - Property Development & Investment - Discovery Bay http://www.hkri.com/icms2/template?series=407&article=5473&leftside1=406&leftside2=5455&menuon=1&submenuon=1 ("As of mid-2011, about 18,000 people (over 50% of them were non-Chinese) resided in the multi-cultural community of Discovery Bay.") with a sizeable community of expatriates from over thirty countries. DB is located 2 km west of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and approximately 12 km west from the nearest point on Hong Kong Island, with the co-ordinates of [tpl]Coord|22|17|44|N|114|00|59|E|type:city_scale:20000[/tpl].
DB currently (April 2009) consists of 14 residential development phases with properties ranging from garden houses to high-rise towers of up to 24 storeys. The development also features a 400-metre-long privately owned beach (accessible to the public but no lifeguards present), four private membership clubs including a golf club and a marina club and a public park (Siena Central Park). The absence of public recreational facilities is a bone of discontent with the residents especially in view of the fact that the developer has an outstanding obligation to provide 300,000 square metres of such facilities as part of the original plan.Audit Department of the Hong Kong Government Report No. 43 of the Director of Audit - Chapter 6: Grant of Land at Discovery Bay and Yi Long Wan, November 2004 http://www.aud.gov.hk/pdf_e/e43ch06_summary.pdf
Though DB is considered in Hong Kong to be a low-density development due to the amount of open spaces (as measured by the plot to development ratio of 0.12), DB is however the second most populous district (after the New Town of Tung Chung) on the sparsely populated Lantau Island. Unlike many other developments in Hong Kong, pets are allowed in DB, whereas other developments generally ban them.

In the social sciences, scaling is the process of measuring or ordering entities with respect to quantitative attributes or traits. For example, a scaling technique might involve estimating individuals' levels of extraversion, or the perceived quality of products. Certain methods of scaling permit estimation of magnitudes on a continuum, while other methods provide only for relative ordering of the entities.

[[Lou Stillman]]

CATEGORIES: American boxing trainers, 1887 births, 1969 deaths

Louis Ingber (1887–1969), better known as Lou Stillman, was a legendary boxing trainer who had a gym in New York City, but whose fame transcended beyond New York and into boxing circles virtually everywhere else. He was also a private detective prior to working as a boxing trainer.
In 1919, Ingber was invited by millionaires Alpheus Geer and Hiram Mallison to manage Stillman's Gym. When Ingber came along, the gym was actually named the Marshall Stillman Athletic Club. In the late 1920s, the gym changed its name. Patrons used to think Ingber's last name was Stillman; because of this, they greeted him as Mr. Stillman. Stillman, described as moody and acid, among other things, by boxing historians and writers, disliked having to correct everyone who called him Mr. Stillman, so eventually he changed his name legally from Louis Ingber to Lou Stillman.
Stillman was famous for keeping his gym as unsanitary as possible: He allowed the public to smoke in a closed-windows atmosphere, and he absolutely required the gym floors to go uncleaned, sometimes for years.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] He said: "The golden age of prizefighting was the age of bad food, bad air, bad sanitation, and no sunlight. I keep the place like this for the fighters' own good. If I clean it up they'll catch a cold from the cleanliness".
Stillman carried a gun around his waist when he was at the gym. He had two guards watching the doors, to make sure everyone paid the 25 cents price to get in and watch the boxers practice.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] He had a sign that read: "Anyone caught stealing will be barred for life". When French dancer Jeanne Lamar showed up at Stillman's to train in 1922, Stillman told her that there were "no facilities for girls" in his gym, but she stood around and used the gym to get in shape anyway. However, Stillman has been also described by historians[tpl]Who|date=March 2009[/tpl] as a person who did not discriminate based on gender.
Many famous people trained there, mainly boxers: Jack Dempsey, Georges Carpentier, Primo Carnera, Fred Apostoli, Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano were some of the famous world champions who trained at Stillman's Gym. One who refused to train there was Gene Tunney, because he complained about the place's sanitation, saying that he would never train there unless the windows were opened. Typical of him, Stillman refused to open the windows.
Stillman retired in 1959 after selling the building, and he joined his daughter in California. He liked painting, and became proficient painting in oils as he spent the last few years of his life at a nursing home in Santa Barbara. He died on August 19, 1969.

[[Tannin (demon)]]

CATEGORIES: Demons in Judaism, Mythical aquatic creatures

In the Bible, Tannin is the Hebrew term for Leviathan or sea dragon (Isaiah 27:1). Sometimes he is compared with Rahab, another sea monster who is especially associated with the Red Sea. Some scholars associated Tannin with Tiamat, as it happened with Rahab.  It is unclear in Jewish literature the differentiation between Tannin, Rahab, and Leviathan, but Tannin and Rahab are more easily confused with one another.  Tannin, as well as Rahab, was a name applied to Egypt after the exodus of the Israelites from that country.
In modern Hebrew the word tannin (תנין) literally means crocodile.

The Donner Party (sometimes called the Donner-Reed Party) was a group of American pioneers who set out for California in a wagon train. Delayed by a series of mishaps, they spent the winter of 1846–47 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada. Some of the emigrants resorted to cannibalism to survive, eating those who had succumbed to starvation and sickness.
The journey west usually took between four and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed by following a new route called Hastings Cutoff, which crossed Utah's Wasatch Mountains and Great Salt Lake Desert. The rugged terrain, and difficulties encountered while traveling along the Humboldt River in present-day Nevada, resulted in the loss of many cattle and wagons, and splits within the group.
By the beginning of November 1846 the emigrants had reached the Sierra Nevada, where they became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee (now Donner) Lake, high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran low, and in mid-December some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the emigrants, but the first relief party did not arrive until the middle of February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train became trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived to reach California.
Historians have described the episode as one of the most spectacular tragedies in Californian history and in the record of western migration.McGlashan, p. 16; Stewart, p. 271.

[[History of the Republic of China]]

CATEGORIES: History of the Republic of China

The History of the Republic of China begins after the Qing dynasty in 1912, when the formation of the Republic of China as a constitutional republic put an end to over 2,000 years of Imperial rule. The Qing dynasty, (also known as the Manchu Dynasty), ruled from 1644–1912. Since its founding after the Xinhai Revolution, (Chinese Revolution) of 1911, the Republic had experienced many trials and tribulations, being dominated by elements as disparate as warlord generals and foreign powers.
In 1928, the Republic was nominally unified under the "Kuomintang" (KMT)—Chinese Nationalist Party—after the Northern Expedition, and was in the early stages of industrialization and modernization when it was caught in the conflicts among the Kuomintang government, the Communist Party of China, (founded 1921), which was converted into a nationalist party,  local warlords and the Empire of Japan. Most nation-building efforts were stopped during the full-scale "Second Sino-Japanese War" / "War of Resistance" against Japan from 1937 to 1945, and later the widening gap between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party made a coalition government impossible, causing the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, in 1946, shortly after the Japanese surrender to the Americans and the Western Allies in September 1945.
A series of political, economic and military missteps led to the KMT's defeat and its retreat to Taiwan (formerly "Formosa") in 1949, where it established an authoritarian one-party state continuing under Generalissimo/President Chiang Kai-shek, that considered itself to be the continuing sole legitimate ruler of all of China, referring to the Communist government or "regime" as illegitimate, a so-called "Peoples' Republic of China" declared in Beijing (Peking) by Mao Tse Tung in 1949, as "mainland China", "Communist China, or "Red China". Although supported for many years, even decades by many nations especially with the support of the United States who established a 1954 Mutual Defense treaty, as the decades passed, since political liberalization began in the late 1960s, the PRC was able after a constant yearly campaign in the United Nations to finally get approval in 1971, to take the seat for "China" in the General Assembly, and more importantly, be seated as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council.  After recovering from this shock of rejection by the world community, after the liberalization at home in the late 1970s from the Nationalist authoritarian government and following the death of Chiang Kai-shek, the Republic of China has transformed itself into a multiparty, representative democracy on Taiwan and even given more representation to those native Taiwanese, whose ancestors predate the 1949 mainland evacuation.

CATEGORIES: Aquila (constellation), Constellations, Equatorial constellations, Constellations listed by Ptolemy

Aquila is a constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for 'eagle' and it represents the bird who carried Zeus/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology.
Aquila lies just a few degrees North of the celestial equator. The alpha star, Altair, is a vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The constellation is best seen in the summer as it is located along the Milky Way. Because of this location along the line of our galaxy, many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders, but they are dim and there are few galaxies.

[[1985 in aviation]]

CATEGORIES: 1985 in aviation

This is a list of aviation-related events from 1985. It remains the worst year in history for aviation disasters: among the crashes were Japan Airlines Flight 123, killing 520 people; Air India Flight 182, killing 329; Arrow Air Flight 1285, killing 256; Aeroflot Flight 7425, killing 200; Iberia Airlines Flight 610, killing 148; Delta Air Lines Flight 191, killing 137; Galaxy Airlines Flight 203, killing 70; and British Airtours Flight 28M, killing 55. A collision between Aeroflot Flight SSSR-65856 and a Soviet Air Forces transport plane kills 94, a hijacking of Egyptair Flight 648 results in 60 fatalities, and various crashes and other incidents kill fewer than 50 people each. August 1985 remains the worst single month for commercial aviation fatalities in history.

Kowloon Walled City was a densely populated, largely ungoverned settlement in New Kowloon, Hong Kong. Originally a Chinese military fort, the Walled City became an enclave after the New Territories were leased to Britain in 1898. Its population increased dramatically following the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during World War II. In 1987, the Walled City contained 33,000 residents within its [tpl]convert|2.6|ha|sqmi|adj=on[/tpl] borders. From the 1950s to the 1970s, it was controlled by Triads and had high rates of prostitution, gambling, and drug use.
In January 1987, the Hong Kong government announced plans to demolish the Walled City. After an arduous eviction process, demolition began in March 1993 and was completed in April 1994. Kowloon Walled City Park opened in December 1995 and occupies the area of the former Walled City. Some historical artefacts from the Walled City, including its yamen building and remnants of its South Gate, have been preserved there.

[[Methemoglobinemia]]
CATEGORIES: Red blood cell disorders, Autosomal recessive disorders

Methemoglobinemia (or methaemoglobinaemia) is a disorder characterized by the presence of a higher than normal level of methemoglobin (metHb, i.e., ferric Fe3+ rather than ferrous Fe2+ haemoglobin) in the blood. Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin that contains ferric Fe3+ iron and has a decreased ability to bind oxygen. However, the ferric iron has an increased affinity for bound oxygen.[tpl]cite web|title=Methemoglobinemia|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/204178-overview|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=25 March 2013[/tpl]   The binding of oxygen to methemoglobin results in an increased affinity of oxygen to the three other heme sites (that are still ferrous) within the same tetrameric hemoglobin unit.  This leads to an overall reduced ability of the red blood cell to release oxygen to tissues, with the associated oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve therefore shifted to the left. When methemoglobin concentration is elevated in red blood cells, tissue hypoxia can occur.

[[Cent (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Equal temperaments, Intervals, Units of measurement

The cent is a logarithmic unit of measure used for musical intervals. Twelve-tone equal temperament divides the octave into 12 semitones of 100 cents each.  Typically, cents are used to measure extremely small finite intervals, or to compare the sizes of comparable intervals in different tuning systems, and in fact the interval of one cent is much too small to be heard between successive notes.
Alexander J. Ellis based the measure on the acoustic logarithms decimal semitone system developed by Gaspard de Prony in the 1830s, at Robert Holford Macdowell Bosanquet's suggestion. Ellis made extensive measurements of musical instruments from around the world, using cents extensively to report and compare the scales employed,Alexander Ellis: On the Musical Scales of Various Nations HTML transcription of the 1885 article in the Journal of the Society of Arts (Accessed September 2008)[tpl]deadlink|date=February 2013[/tpl] and further described and employed the system in his edition of Hermann von Helmholtz's On the Sensations of Tone. It has become the standard method of representing and comparing musical pitches and intervals with relative accuracy.

[[History of the United States (1945–64)]]

CATEGORIES: History of the United States (1945–64)

For the United States of America, 1945 to 1964 was a time of high economic growth and general prosperity. It was also a time of confrontation as the liberal, capitalist United States and its allies politically opposed the Soviet Union and other communist countries; the Cold War had begun. African Americans united and organized, and a triumph of the Civil Rights Movement ended Jim Crow segregation in the South. James T. Patterson, Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974 (1988) pp 771-90 Further laws were passed that made discrimination illegal and helped to secure voting rights.
Early in the period, an active foreign policy was pursued to assist  Western Europe and Asia recover from the devastation of World War II. The United States also sought to contain the expansion of Communism, represented by the Soviet Union and China. An arms race began, and each side attempted to demonstrate their strength through increasingly powerful nuclear weapons. The Soviets formed the Warsaw Pact of communist states to oppose the American-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance.  The U.S. fought a bloody, inconclusive war in Korea and was escalating the war in Vietnam as the period ended.Alan P. Dobson and Steve Marsh, US foreign policy since 1945 (2006) pp 18-29, 76-90
On the domestic front, after a short transition, the economy grew rapidly, with widespread prosperity, rising wages, and the movement of most of the remaining farmers to the towns and cities. Politically, the era was dominated by presidents, Democrats Harry Truman (1945–53), John F. Kennedy (1961–63) and Lyndon Johnson (1963–69), and Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–61). For most of the period, the Democrats controlled Congress; however, they were usually unable to pass as much liberal legislation as they had hoped because of the power of the Conservative Coalition.  The Liberal coalition came to power after Kennedy's assassination in 1963, and launched the Great Society.Alonzo L.

María Guadalupe Vélez de Villalobos (July 18, 1908 – December 13, 1944), known professionally as Lupe Vélez, was a Mexican film actress. Vélez began her career in Mexico as a dancer in vaudeville, before moving to the U.S. Vélez soon entered films, making her first appearance in 1927 in the film The Gaucho. By the end of the decade she had progressed to leading roles. She worked with film directors like D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. DeMille, Victor Fleming and William Wyler among others. With the arrival of talkies, Vélez's career took a turn towards comedy. Her characterization of the temperamental, explosive, rebellious and irreverent Latina woman  gave her enormous popularity. She enjoyed immense popularity among Hispanic audiences and also made some films in Mexico. Some of her most memorable films are Lady of the Pavements (1928), The Wolf Song (1929), Palooka (1933), Laughing Boy (1934), Hollywood Party (1934) and the series of films created especially for her: Mexican Spitfire, in the early 1940s.
Vélez's personal life was often difficult; a five-year marriage to Johnny Weissmuller and a series of romances, were highly publicized. She is often associated with the nicknames "The Mexican Spitfire" and "The Hot Pepper".[tpl]cite book|last=|first=|title=Revista Somos: Katy Jurado:Estrella de Hollywood orgullosamente mexicana: Latinas en Hollywood|publisher=Editorial Televisa S.A de C.V|year=1999|pages= 86|isbn= [/tpl]

James VI and I (19 June 1566 – 27 March 1625) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death. The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciary, and laws, though both were ruled by James in personal union.
He succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother Mary, Queen of Scots, was compelled to abdicate in his favour. Four different regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland, Elizabeth I, who died without issue.By the normal rules of succession James had the best claim to the English throne, as the great-great-grandson of Henry VII. However, Henry VIII's will had passed over the Scottish line of his sister Margaret in favour of that of their younger sister Mary Tudor. In the event, Henry's will was disregarded. Stewart, pp. 159–161; Willson, pp. 138–141. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known as the Jacobean era after him, until his death in 1625 at the age of 58. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, only returning to Scotland once in 1617, and styled himself "King of Great Britain and Ireland".The title was opposed by the English Parliament and was not used on English statutes. James forced the Parliament of Scotland to use it, and it was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, and treaties in both realms. Croft, p. 67; Willson, pp. 249–253. See also: the early history of the Union Flag. He was a major advocate of a single parliament for both England and Scotland. In his reign, the Plantation of Ulster and British colonisation of the Americas began.
At 57 years and 246 days, his reign in Scotland was longer than any of his predecessors. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament. Under James, the "Golden Age" of Elizabethan literature and drama continued, with writers such as William Shakespeare, John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture.Milling, p. 155. James himself was a talented scholar, the author of works such as Daemonologie (1597), True Law of Free Monarchies (1598), and Basilikon Doron (1599). He sponsored the translation of the Bible that was named after him: the Authorised King James Version."James VI and I was the most writerly of British monarchs. He produced original poetry, as well as translation and a treatise on poetics; works on witchcraft and tobacco; meditations and commentaries on the Scriptures; a manual on kingship; works of political theory; and, of course, speeches to parliament ... He was the patron of Shakespeare, Jonson, Donne, and the translators of the "Authorized version" of the Bible, surely the greatest concentration of literary talent ever to enjoy royal sponsorship in England." Rhodes et al., p. 1. Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed "the wisest fool in Christendom", an epithet associated with his character ever since."A very wise man was wont to say that he believed him the wisest fool in Christendom, meaning him wise in small things, but a fool in weighty affairs." Sir Anthony Weldon (1651), The Court and Character of King James I, quoted by Stroud, p. 27; "The label 'the wisest fool in Christendom', often attributed to Henry IV of France but possibly coined by Anthony Weldon, catches James's paradoxical qualities very neatly." Smith, p. 238. Since the latter half of the twentieth century, however, historians have revised James's reputation and have treated him as a serious and thoughtful monarch."Historians have returned to reconsidering James as a serious and intelligent ruler". Croft, p. 6; Lockyer, pp. 4–6; "In contrast to earlier historians, recent research on his reign has tended to emphasize the wisdom and downplay the foolishness." Smith, p. 238.

Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), also known as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), are network security appliances that monitor network and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about this activity, attempt to block/stop it, and report it.
Intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent/block intrusions that are detected.[tpl]cite book|author=Robert C.

A diner is a prefabricated restaurant building characteristic of American life, especially in the Midwest, in New York City, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and in other areas of the Northeastern United States, although examples can be found throughout the United States, Canada and parts of Western Europe. Some people apply the term not only to the prefabricated structures, but also to restaurants that serve cuisine similar to traditional diner cuisine even if they are located in more traditional types of buildings. Diners are characterized by offering a wide range of foods, mostly American, a casual atmosphere, a counter, and late operating hours.  "Classic American Diners" are often characterized by an exterior layer of stainless steel—a feature unique to diner architecture.

Ogopogo or Naitaka ([tpl]lang-sal|n'ha-a-itk[/tpl], "lake demon") is the name given to a cryptid lake monster reported to live in Okanagan Lake, in British Columbia, Canada. Ogopogo has been allegedly seen by First Nations people since the 19th century. The most common description of Ogopogo is a 40 to 50-foot-long ([tpl]convert|40|to|50|ft|disp=output only[/tpl]) sea serpent.
British cryptozoologist Karl Shuker has categorized the Ogopogo as a 'many hump' variety of lake monster, and suggested it may be a kind of primitive serpentine whale such as Basilosaurus. However, because the physical evidence for the beast is limited to unclear photographs and film, it has also been suggested that the sightings are misidentifications of common animals, such as otters, and inanimate objects, such as floating logs.Nickell, 2006

Yaohan Co., LTD. (株式会社ヤオハン Kabushiki Kaisha Yaohan), or Yaohan (Japanese: ヤオハン or 八百半; Chinese: 八佰伴) was a Japanese retail group. The company was founded in 1930 by Ryohei Wada (和田 良平 Wada Ryohei) and incorporated in 1948. Initially a single shop, it later expanded into a major supermarket chain with most retail outlets located in Shizuoka prefecture, south of Tokyo. It was listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange. The store was far more established and notable outside Japan, such that by the time it opened its first store in the Tokyo metropolitan area, the company was already in a state of decline due to accumulated debts from over-expansion.

[[Noise-cancelling headphones]]

CATEGORIES: Audio engineering, Headphones, Noise reduction

Noise-cancelling headphones are headphones that reduce unwanted ambient sounds using active noise control engineering.
Noise cancellation makes it possible to enjoy music without raising the volume excessively. It can also help a passenger sleep in a noisy vehicle such as an airliner. In the aviation environment, noise cancelling headphones increase the signal-to-noise ratio significantly more than passive noise attenuating headphones or no headphones, making hearing important information such as safety announcements easier.[tpl]cite journal | last = Molesworth | first = Brett | coauthors = Burgess, Marion. | title = Improving intelligibility at a safety critical point |  journal = Safety Science | volume = 51 | pages = 11–16 | year = 2013 | publisher = Elsevier | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753512001506 | doi=10.1016/j.ssci.2012.06.006[/tpl] Noise-cancelling headphones can improve listening enough to completely offset the effect of a distracting concurrent activity.[tpl]cite journal | last = Molesworth | first = Brett | coauthors = Burgess, Marion;  Kwon, Daniel | title = The use of noise cancelling headphones to improve concurrent task performance in a noisy environment |  journal = Applied Acoustics | volume = 74 | pages = 110–115 | year = 2013 | publisher = Elsevier | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003682X12001752 | doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2012.06.015[/tpl]. Recognition and recall of audio information improved when 65 dB(A) background noise was blocked by noise-cancelling headphones, and performance was "no different" when listening with the headphones while at the same time working a mathematical puzzle, than while trying to listen to the same audio with neither puzzle nor headphones.
Noise-cancelling headphones use active noise control to cancel the lower-frequency portions of the noise; they depend on more traditional methods such as soundproofing to prevent higher-frequency noise from reaching the ear. This approach is preferred because it reduces the demand for complicated electronic circuitry that would be required for noise cancellation at higher frequencies, where active cancellation is less effective.Reinhard Lerch, Gerhard Sessler, Dietrich Wolf: Technische Akustik: Grundlagen und Anwendungen, Kapitel 14.7.3 Kopfhörer - Hörertypen, Verlag Springer (2008), ISBN 9783540234302, Seite 431 To truly cancel high frequency components (coming at the ear from all directions), the sensor and emitter for the cancelling waveform would have to be adjacent to the user's eardrum, which is not currently technically feasible.

[[New Jersey Route 324]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Gloucester County, New Jersey

Route 324 is an isolated state highway in Logan Township in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The two-lane concrete route runs along the [tpl]convert|1.51|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] alignment of Old Ferry Road from the shore of the Delaware River to a cul-de-sac near the interchange between U.S. Route 322 and U.S. Route 130 in Logan Township. The route does not intersect with any state routes or county routes along its entire alignment.
Route 324 was a former alignment of U.S. Route 322 that served the Bridgeport-Chester ferry between Bridgeport, New Jersey, and Chester, Pennsylvania. The ferry first ran on July 1, 1930, with Route 322 being designated along the ferry and its access road in 1936 from Pennsylvania. The highway and ferry also shared the co-designation of State Highway Route S-44, a spur off State Highway Route 44 in Bridgeport. Route S-44 was decommissioned in the state highway renumbering while Route 322 remained intact until the opening of the Commodore Barry Bridge in February 1974. The ferry made its last run at 8 p.m. on February 1, and closed down for good. Route 322 was realigned onto the Commodore Barry Bridge while the former ferry alignment became Route 324.

Subdivisions include Next Media Interactive. The corporation is known for introducing tabloid-style journalism into Hong Kong and Taiwan that set trends in both markets. Apple Daily was the first newspaper to use the massive graphics, bold headlines and full colour pages now common to all best-selling papers in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Next Media publications are also known for highly academic articles which attract a wide range of readers, including critics. Next Media has often taken a clear and sometimes proactive support for democratic groups in Hong Kong. Some companies with ties to the government of China never advertise in any papers or magazines owned by Next Media.
The bold style of journalism seems to trigger constant troubles with the triads with incidents of criminal damages at the offices of Next Media. Apple Daily and its parent company Next Media are thought to be pioneer of paparazzi and yellow journalism in Hong Kong. A notable incident happened in 2006 when Gillian Chung, a member of singing group Twins, was shot changing clothes at the backstage by spy camera installed by a subsidy magazine of Next Media.

Route 175 is a short, [tpl]convert|2.95|mi|km[/tpl] long state highway in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. The route runs along a former alignment of New Jersey Route 29 before the construction of the John Fitch Parkway in the 1960s. The route begins at Route 29 in the capital city of Trenton, running along Sanhican Road, River Road and West Upper Ferry Road into Ewing Township. The route provides as a frontage road for Route 29 until the intersection with West Upper Ferry Road, where it turns on its own out into rural Ewing Township. For its final stretch, Route 175 heads along the Delaware and Raritan Canal until coming to an end at a merge with Route 29 in Ewing Township.
Route 175 originates as alignment of Route 29, which followed local roads after the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering. It remained Route 29 through the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering and was moved onto the John Fitch Parkway upon its completion in the 1960s. By 1969, the original alignment was designated as Route 175 and both roads have remained the same since.

Fernando Pereira (May 10, 1950–July 10, 1985) was a freelance Dutch photographer, of Portuguese origin, who drowned when French intelligence (DGSE) sabotaged and sank the Rainbow Warrior ship, owned by the environmental organisation Greenpeace on July 10, 1985.
The bombing of the boat had been designed to make the ship unsalvagable. The first smaller bomb bent the shaft, making repair uneconomic. Pereira stayed inside the boat to get his camera and other pieces of equipment. The second, more powerful explosion, designed to sink the boat, caused a huge inrush of seawater and drowned Fernando.
The Rainbow Warrior led a flotilla of yachts protesting against French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia and was about to depart Auckland for a campaign of legal demonstrations in international waters near the French military operational areas at Moruroa Atoll.

It was established as Hong Kong Baptist College with the support of American Baptists, who provided both operating and construction funds and personnel to the school in its early years.
It became Hong Kong Baptist University in 1994 during the presidency of Dr. Daniel Tse Chi-wai, LLD, GBS, CBE, JP, who succeeded the Founding President, Dr. Lam Chi-fung, as the second president of the University in 1971. After 30 years of services to the University, Dr. Daniel Tse Chi-wai retired in 2001 and Prof. Ng Ching-fai, GBS, was appointed as the third president of the University. In 2010, Prof. Albert Chan Sun-chi assumed office as the fourth president of HKBU.
HKBU has five main campuses: Ho Sin Hang Campus (1966), Shaw Campus (1995), Baptist University Road Campus (1998), "Kai Tak Campus" (2005), and Shek Mun Campus (2006) for the College of International Education and the Hong Kong Baptist University Affiliated School Wong Kam Fai Secondary and Primary School. The first three campuses are located in the urban heart of Kowloon Tong, while the Kai Tak Campus is on Kwun Tong Road and the Shek Mun Campus in Shatin.
In 2005, the University established the Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College (UIC) in Zhuhai, China. The College is the first and only tertiary education institution founded through collaboration between a Mainland university and a Hong Kong university. It sets a new model for liberal education in China, aiming to nurture graduates with an international perspective.

CATEGORIES: Felis, Animals described in 1777, Mammals of Africa, Mammals of Asia, Mammals of Europe, Mammals of Azerbaijan, Mammals of Pakistan, Mammals of Iran, Mammals of Uganda

The wildcat (Felis silvestris) is a small cat found throughout most of Africa, Europe, and southwest and central Asia into India, China, and Mongolia. Because of its wide range it is classed by the IUCN as Least Concern. However, crossbreeding with housecats is extensive and has occurred throughout almost the entirety of the species' range.[tpl]IUCN |assessors=Driscoll, C., Nowell, K. |year=2010 |id=8543 |title=Felis silvestris |version=2011.2.[/tpl]
The wildcat shows a high degree of geographic variation. Asiatic subspecies have spotted, isabelline coats, African subspecies have sandy-grey fur with banded legs and red-backed ears, and European wildcats resemble heavily built striped tabbies with bushy tails, white chins and throats. All subspecies are generally larger than house cats, with longer legs and more robust bodies.Hunter, Luke & Barrett, Priscilla (2011). A Field Guide to the Carnivores of the World. pp. 16. New Holland. ISBN 9781847733467 The actual number of subspecies is still debated, with some organisations recognising 22, while others recognise only four, including the Chinese mountain cat, which was previously considered a species in its own right.
Genetic, morphological and archaeological evidence suggests that the housecat was domesticated from the African wildcat, probably 9,000-10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent region of the Near East, coincident with the rise of agriculture and the need to protect harvests stored in granaries from rodents.[tpl]cite journal |author=Driscoll, C.

[[Empire of Brazil]]

The Empire of Brazil was a 19th-century state that broadly comprised the territories which form modern Brazil and Uruguay. Its government was a representative parliamentary constitutional monarchy under the rule of Emperors Dom Pedro I and his son Dom Pedro II, both members of the House of Braganza—a branch of the Capetian dynasty. A colony of the Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese colonial Empire in 1808, when the Portuguese Prince regent, later King Dom João VI, fled from Napoleon I's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. João VI later returned to Portugal, leaving his eldest son and heir, Pedro, to rule Brazil as regent. On 7 September 1822, Pedro declared the independence of Brazil and, after waging a successful war against his father's kingdom, was acclaimed on 12 October as Pedro I, the first Emperor of Brazil. The new country was huge but sparsely populated and ethnically diverse.
Unlike most of its Hispanic republic neighbors, Brazil had political stability, vibrant economic growth, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and respect for civil rights of its subjects, albeit with legal restrictions to women and slaves, the latter regarded as properties, not citizens. The empire's bicameral parliament was elected under comparatively democratic methods for the era, as were the provincial and local legislatures. This led into a long ideological conflict between Pedro I and a sizable parliamentary faction over the role of the monarch in the government. He also faced other obstacles; the unsuccessful Cisplatine War against the neighboring United Provinces of the Río de la Plata led to the secession of a Brazilian province (later to become Uruguay) in 1828. Despite his role in Brazilian independence, he became the king of Portugal in 1826 but immediately abdicated in favor of his eldest daughter. Two years later her throne was usurped by Pedro I's younger brother. Unable to deal with both Brazilian and Portuguese affairs, Pedro I abdicated on 7 April 1831 and immediately departed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.
Pedro I's successor was his five-year-old son, Pedro II. As the latter was still a minor, a weak regency was created. The power vacuum resulting from the absence of a ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II, once declared of age, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under Pedro II's rule, and it prevailed in several other international disputes and domestic strifes. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888. Brazilian visual arts, literature and theater developed during this time of progress. Although heavily influenced by European styles that ranged from Neoclassicism to Romanticism, each concept was adapted to create a culture that was uniquely Brazilian.
Despite the fact the last four decades of Pedro II's reign were marked by continuous internal peace and economic prosperity, he personally had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime. As the Emperor grew older, he made no effort to maintain support for the institution. Since he lacked viable heirs (the next in line was his daughter Isabel, and both Pedro II and the ruling classes considered a female monarch unacceptable), the Empire's political leaders believed that there was no reason to defend the monarchy. Despite the lack of enthusiasm among most Brazilians for adopting a republican form of government, on 15 November 1889, after a 58-year reign, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator.

Colonial Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil Colonial) comprises the period from 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese, until 1815, when Brazil was elevated to a kingdom alongside Portugal as the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.
During the early 300 years of Brazilian colonial history, the economic exploitation of the territory was based first on brazilwood extraction (16th century), sugar production (16th–18th centuries), and finally on gold and diamond mining (18th century). Slaves, especially those brought from Africa, provided most of the working force of the Brazilian economy.
In contrast to the neighboring fragmented Spanish possessions, the Portuguese colony, built up by the Portuguese in Latin America, kept its territorial unity and linguistic integrity after independence, giving rise to the largest country in the region.[tpl]clarify|text=Why?

Swing is the primary Java GUI widget toolkit.  It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) — an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs.
Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT).  Swing provides a native look and feel that emulates the look and feel of several platforms, and also supports a pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform. It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT. In addition to familiar components such as buttons, check boxes and labels, Swing provides several advanced components such as tabbed panel, scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists.
Unlike AWT components, Swing components are not implemented by platform-specific code. Instead they are written entirely in Java and therefore are platform-independent. The term "lightweight" is used to describe such an element.[tpl]cite book | page=53 | title=Java Swing | first1=Marc | last1=Loy | first2=Robert | last2=Eckstein | first3=Dave | last3=Wood | first4=James | last4=Elliott | first5=Brian | last5=Cole | publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc | year=2012 | edition=2 | isbn=1449337309[/tpl]

Köpingsvik is a locality situated in Borgholm Municipality, Kalmar County, Sweden with 599 inhabitants in 2010. It is located about 4 km east of the city of Borgholm on the island Öland.
Köpingsvik is known as a tourist center, offering large and modern camping sites. Nearby are the historic sites of Borgholm Castle and Halltorps Estate.
Köping (historically) was an important Viking Age port of what is today's Sweden, covering an area of approximately 25 hectars, almost 4 times larger than the similar site on the island of Björkö near Stockholm. Köping was in operation from the 7th to the 13th century. It was also an important center of early Christianity in Sweden. Remains of an unfinished, massive 12th century church 42 meters long have been excavated as well as the largest collection of the so-called eskilstunakistor, 75 pieces. During the last ten years there have been several small excavations which have confirmed the earlier findings and the importance of the site. Note that these findings are almost unknown to public in Sweden and the ruling view is that little site on Björkö is Swedens "oldest town".
Köping faded away around 1200, and Kalmar took over as the most important harbour town in south-eastern Sweden.
Köping is claimed by some amateur historians and historians as a possible alternative to Björkö for the location of the old viking village Birka in SvíÞjóð (the ancient name for Sweden). Birka is mentioned in Vita Ansgari and the work of Adam of Bremen.  He states that Birka is situated directly north of Jomsborg and directly opposite to Kurland and at the same distance between them. This theory has not been widely accepted.

A latte ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɑː|t|eɪ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|t|eɪ[/tpl])Latte - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster DictionaryDefinition of latte in Oxford Dictionaries (British & World English) is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk. The term as used in English is a shortened form of the Italian caffè latte or caffellatte ([tpl]IPA-it|ˌkaffelˈlatte|pron[/tpl]), which means "milk coffee". The word is also sometimes incorrectly spelled latté or lattè in English with different kinds of accents, which can be a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to help customers realize the word is not pronounced as this combination of letters would normally be interpreted by native speakers.
In northern Europe and Scandinavia the term 'café au lait' has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso and milk, but this term is used in the US for brewed coffee and scalded milk. In France, 'caffè latte' is mostly known from American coffee chains; a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a 'latte' is in French called 'grand crème' and in German 'Milchkaffee' or 'Melange'.
Variants include replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate or matcha, and other types of milk, such as soy milk are also used.

Free was an English rock band formed in London in 1968 best known for their 1970 signature song "All Right Now". They disbanded in 1973 and lead singer Paul Rodgers went on to become a frontman of the band Bad Company along with Simon Kirke on drums. Lead guitarist Paul Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler and died from a drug-induced heart failure at the age of 25 in 1976. Bassist Andy Fraser formed Sharks.
The band was famed for its sensational live shows and nonstop touring. However, early studio albums did not sell very well – until the release of Fire and Water which featured the massive hit "All Right Now". The song helped secure them a place at the huge Isle of Wight Festival 1970 where they played to 600,000 people.
By the early 1970s, Free was one of the biggest-selling British blues-rock groups; by the time the band dissolved in 1973, they had sold more than 20 million albums around the world and had played more than 700 arena and festival concerts. "All Right Now," remains a rock staple, and had been entered into ASCAP's "One Million" airplay singles club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/paul-rodgers/id163444 |title=iTunes - Music - Paul Rodgers |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livinglegendsmusic.com/library.php?personID=178 |title=Information on Paul Rodgers |publisher=Living Legends Music |date=2011-06-28 |accessdate=2011-07-09[/tpl]

A bun is a small, sometimes sweet, bread or bread roll. Though they come in many shapes and sizes, they are most commonly hand-sized or smaller, with a round top and flat bottom.
Buns are usually made from flour, sugar, milk, yeast and butter. Common varieties contain small fruit or nuts, are topped with icing or caramel,  or filled with jam or cream. Some types of buns are filled with various meats.
"Bun" may also refer to particular types of filled dumplings, such as Chinese baozi and Lutonian Halapchi. Some of these types of dumplings may be bread-like in texture.
A bun is normally made from dough that has been 'enriched' with sugar and butter and even sometimes egg. Without any of these the dough remains to be 'bread dough' rather than 'bun dough' and the resultant product will be called a roll, rather than a bun.

Nagware (also known as begware, annoyware or a nagscreen) is a type of shareware that reminds (or nags) the user to register it by paying a fee. It usually does this by popping up a message when the user starts the program, or intermittently while the user is using the application. These messages can appear as windows obscuring part of the screen, or as message boxes that can quickly be closed. Some nagware keeps the message up for a certain time period, forcing the user to wait to continue to use the program.
The intent is generally that the user will register or buy the program to get rid of the trial version's annoyance.

[[Stencil]]
CATEGORIES: Decorative arts, Graffiti and unauthorised signage, Graphic design, Printing, Printmaking

A stencil is a thin sheet of material, such as paper, plastic, or metal, with letters or a design cut from it, used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface by applying pigment through the cut-out holes in the material. The key advantage of a stencil is that it can be reused to repeatedly and rapidly produce the same letters or design. The design produced with a stencil is also called a stencil. The context in which stencil is used makes clear which meaning is intended. Although aerosol or painting stencils can be made for one-time use, typically they are made to be reusable. To be reusable, they must remain intact after a design is produced and the stencil is removed from the work surface. With some designs, this is done by connecting stencil islands (sections of material that are inside cut-out "holes" in the stencil) to other parts of the stencil with bridges (narrow sections of  material that are not cut out).
Stencil technique in visual art is also referred to as pochoir.  A related technique (which has found applicability in some surrealist compositions) is aerography, in which spray-painting is done around a  three-dimensional object to create a negative of the object instead of a positive of a stencil design. This technique was used in cave paintings dating to 10,000 BC, where human hands were used in painting hand print outlines among paintings of animals and other objects. The artist sprayed pigment around his hand by using a hollow bone, blown by mouth to direct a stream of pigment.
Screen printing also uses a stencil process, as does mimeography. The masters from which mimeographed pages are printed are often called "stencils". Stencils can be made with one or many colour layers using different techniques, with most stencils designed to be applied as solid colours. During screen printing and mimeography the images for stenciling are broken down into color layers. Multiple layers of stencils are used on the same surface to produce multi-colored images.

"The Internationale" (French: "L'Internationale") is a widely sung left-wing anthem. It has been one of the most recognizable and popular songs of the socialist movement since the late 19th century, when the Second International (now the Socialist International) adopted it as its official anthem.  The title arises from the "First International", an alliance of socialist parties formed by Marx and Engels which held a congress in 1864.  The author of the anthem's lyrics, Eugène Pottier, attended this congress.
The original French refrain of the song is C'est la lutte finale / Groupons-nous et demain / L'Internationale / Sera le genre humain. (English: "This is the final struggle / Let us group together and tomorrow / The Internationale / Will be the human race.") "The Internationale" has been translated into many languages. It is often sung with the left hand raised in a clenched fist salute and is sometimes followed (in English-speaking places) with a chant of "The workers united will never be defeated." "The Internationale" has been celebrated by socialists, communists, anarchists, democratic socialists, and some social democrats.

The roughly 85 species are found in eight (or nine) genera which comprise  five distinct groups, the 'true' cuckooshrikes (Campephaga, Coracina, Lobotos, Pteropodocys and Campochaera) the trillers (Lalage), the minivets (Pericrocotus), the flycatcher-shrikes (Hemipus). The wood-shrikes (Tephrodornis) were often considered to be in this family but are probably closer to the helmetshrikes or bushshrikes. Another genus, Chlamydochaera, which has one species, the Black-breasted Fruithunter was often placed in this family but has now been shown to be a thrush (Turdidae).

[[François de Bassompierre]]

François de Bassompierre (12 April 1579 – 12 October 1646) was a French courtier.
The son of Christophe de Bassompierre (1547–1596), he was born at the castle of Haroué in Lorraine. He was descended from an old family which had for generations served the dukes of Burgundy and Lorraine, and after being educated with his brothers in Bavaria and Italy, was introduced to the court of King Henry IV of France in 1598. He became a great favourite of the king and shared to the full in the dissipations of court life. In 1600, he took part in the brief campaign in Savoy, and in 1603 fought in Hungary against the Turks for emperor Rudolf II.
In 1614, he assisted Marie de' Medici, now queen mother, in her struggle against the nobles, but upon her failure in 1617 remained loyal to the young king Louis XIII and assisted the royalists when they routed Marie's supporters at Les Ponts-de-Cé in 1620. His services during the Huguenot rising of 1621–22 won for him the dignity of marshal of France. He was with the army of the king during the siege of La Rochelle in 1628, and in 1629 distinguished himself in the campaign against the Huguenot rebels of Languedoc, especially at the Siege of Privas. In 1615 Bassompierre had purchased from Henri, duc de Rohan, the coveted position of colonel-general of the Swiss and Grisons; on this account he was sent to raise troops in Switzerland when Louis XIII marched against Savoy in 1629, and after a short campaign in Italy his military career ended.
As a diplomat, his career was a failure. In 1621, he went to Madrid as envoy extraordinary to arrange the dispute concerning the seizure of the Valtelline forts by Spain, and signed the fruitless Treaty of Madrid. In 1625, he was sent into Switzerland on an equally futile mission, and in 1626 to London to secure the retention of the Catholic ecclesiastics and attendants of Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I of England. The personal influence of Henry IV had deterred Bassompierre from a marriage with Charlotte de Montmorency, daughter of the constable Montmorency, afterwards princesse de Condé, and between 1614 and 1630 he was secretly married to Louise Marguerite, widow of François, prince de Conti, and through her became implicated in the plot to overthrow Richelieu on the "Day of the Dupes" (1630). His share was only a slight one, but his wife was an intimate friend of Marie de' Medici, and her hostility to the cardinal aroused his suspicions. By Richelieu's orders, Bassompierre was arrested at Senlis on February 25, 1631, and put into the Bastille, where he remained until after Richelieu's death in 1643.
On his release his offices were restored to him, and he passed most of his time at the castle of Tillières in Normandy, until his death. He left a son, François de la Tour, by the princesse de Conti (Louise Marguerite de Lorraine), and an illegitimate son, Louis de Bassompierre, afterwards Bishop of Saintes.
His Mémoires, which are an important source for the history of his time, were first published at Cologne in 1665. He also left an incomplete account of his embassies to Spain, Switzerland and England (Cologne, 1668) and a number of discourses upon various subjects.

[[United Kingdom general election, February 1974]]
CATEGORIES: General elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1974 elections in the United Kingdom

The United Kingdom's general election of February 1974 was held on the 28th of that month. It was the first of two United Kingdom general elections held that year, and the first election since the Second World War not to produce an overall majority in the House of Commons for the winning party. Instead there was a hung parliament, even though many people had expected a Conservative victory for Edward Heath. Labour won the most seats (301, which was 17 seats short of an overall majority) with the Conservatives on 297 seats, although the Conservatives had a larger share of the popular vote.
This election saw Northern Ireland diverging heavily from the rest of the United Kingdom, with all twelve MPs elected being from local parties (eleven of them representing unionist parties), following the decision of the Ulster Unionists to withdraw support from the Conservative Party in protest over the Sunningdale Agreement. In contrast the Scottish National Party achieved significant success in this election. They increased their share of the popular vote in Scotland from 11% to 22% and their number of MPs rose from 1 to 7. There were also the first Plaid Cymru MPs to be elected in a general election in Wales (they had previously won a by-election).
Although the incumbent Conservative government of Edward Heath polled the most votes by a small margin, the Conservatives were overtaken in terms of Commons seats by Harold Wilson's Labour Party due to a more efficiently-distributed Labour vote, and the decision by Ulster Unionist MPs not to take the Conservative whip.
The two largest parties both lost a considerable share of the popular vote, largely to the Liberals under Jeremy Thorpe who polled two and a half times the share of the national vote that they had achieved in the previous election. But even with over six million votes, only 14 Liberal MPs were elected, polling the most votes (~432,823) ever collected by a party for each MP elected in a general election. There had been some media expectation that the Liberals could take twice as many seats.BBC Feb '74 Election coverage[tpl]dead link |date=February 2014[/tpl]
Heath did not resign immediately as Prime Minister. Assuming that Northern Ireland's Unionist MPs could be persuaded to support a Conservative government on confidence matters over one led by Wilson, he entered into negotiations with Thorpe to form a coalition government. Thorpe, never enthusiastic about supporting the Conservatives, demanded major electoral reforms in exchange for such an agreement. Unwilling to accept such terms, Heath resigned and Wilson returned for his second spell as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
The Liberals did not have enough seats to combine with another party to achieve an overall majority. This made the formation of a stable government in this parliament a practical impossibility. Wilson called another election in October of the same year.
The election night was covered live on the BBC, and presented by Alastair Burnet, David Butler, Robert McKenzie and Robin Day.BBC Programmes - Election 74

[[United Kingdom general election, October 1974]]
CATEGORIES: General elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1974 elections in the United Kingdom

The United Kingdom general election of October 1974 took place on 10 October 1974 to elect 635 members to the British House of Commons. It was the second general election of that year and resulted in the Labour Party led by Harold Wilson, winning by a tiny majority of 3 seats.
The election of February that year had produced an unexpected hung parliament. Coalition talks between the Conservatives and the Liberals failed, allowing Labour leader Harold Wilson to form a minority government. The October campaign was not as vigorous or exciting as the one in February. Despite continuing high inflation, Labour was able to boast that it had ended the miners' strike which had dogged Heath's premiership and had returned some stability. The Conservative Party, still led by Edward Heath released a manifesto promoting national unity, however their chances of forming government were hindered by the Ulster Unionist Party refusing to take their whip at Westminster in response to the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973.
The election saw the Labour Party return 319 MPs, giving them the ability to form a majority government, albeit with a mere 3 seats. The Conservatives and the Liberals each saw their vote share fall, and Conservative leader Edward Heath was ousted as party leader in February 1975 and replaced with future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Scottish National Party achieved their best ever Westminster representation at this election, winning 11 of Scotland's 71 seats and 30% of the Scottish popular vote. Labour's parliamentary majority eroded in the 1974-1979 parliament, through a series of by-election losses and defections, which led to deals with the Liberals, the Ulster Unionists, the Scottish nationalists and the Welsh nationalists having to be carried out.
This was the last general election to be won by Labour until 1997.
The election was broadcast live on the BBC, and was presented by David Butler, Alastair Burnet, Robert McKenzie and Robin Day.October '74 Election results programmeOctober '74 Election results round-up

Alexis Paulin Paris (25 March 1800 – 13 February 1881) was a French scholar and author.
He was born at Avenay (Marne).  He studied classics in Reims and law in Paris.[tpl]Cite CE1913|wstitle=Alexis-Paulin Paris[/tpl] He published in 1824 an Apologie pour l'école romantique (In Defense of the Romantic school) and took an active part in Parisian journalism.  His appointment, in 1828, to the department of manuscripts in the Bibliothèque royale left him leisure to pursue his studies in medieval French literature.  Paulin Paris lived before modern research methods had been generally applied to literature, but his numerous editions of early French poems continued the work begun by Dominique Meon in arousing general interest in the then little-known epics of chivalry.
Admitted to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres in 1837, he was shortly afterwards appointed on the commission entrusted with the continuation of the Histoire littéraire de la France. In 1853, a chair of medieval literature was founded at the Collège de France, and Paulin Paris became the first occupant.  He retired in 1872 with the title of honorary professor and was promoted to officer of the Legion of Honour in the next year.
His works include:
His son Gaston Paris contributed a biographical notice to vol. xxix of the Histoire littéraire.

[[Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet]]

CATEGORIES: 1588 births, 1665 deaths, 17th-century French people, French Marquesses, French female salon-holders, 17th-century French literature

Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet (1588 – 2 December 1665), known as Madame de Rambouillet, was a society hostess and a major figure in the literary history of 17th-century France.
Born in Rome, she was the daughter and heiress of Jean de Vivonne, marquis of Pisani, and Giulia Savelli, who belonged to a noble Roman family. She was married at the age of twelve to Charles d'Angennes, vidame du Mans, and afterwards marquis de Rambouillet. They had seven children, two sons and five daughters.G. Lenotre, Le Château de Rambouillet, six siècles d'histoire, chapter: Les Précieuses, Denoël, Paris, 1984, p. 19. The young, beautiful and witty marquise found the coarseness and intrigues of the French court little to her taste and, after the birth of her eldest daughter, Julie Lucine d'Angennes, in 1607, she began to gather around her the circle that gave its renown to her salon. She and her husband had taken residence in Paris at the Hôtel Pisani, then renamed Hôtel de Rambouillet, and situated rue Saint-Honoré. This hôtel was later demolished to make room for Cardinal Richelieu's Palais Cardinal, and a new Hôtel de Rambouillet was built in 1618 on the rue Saint-Thomas du Louvre, between the Louvre and the Tuileries.Map of Paris by N. de Fer, dated 1705, on which the rue Saint-Thomas du Louvre, which disappeared in mid-19th century, can be seen between the Louvre and the Tuileries: :fr:Fichier:Plan de Paris 1705 BNF07710700.png
Madame de Rambouillet arranged her hotel for the purpose of receiving her guests, and devised suites of small rooms where guests could move around and find more privacy than in the large reception rooms. She received her visitors in a salon painted in blue, the chambre bleue.Tallemant des Réaux Historiettes, chapter Madame de Rambouillet, "Mémoires" reviewed by MM. de Monmerqué & Paulin, (3rd edition), published by J. Techener, Libraire, Paris, 1862, tome 2, p. 262.http://books.google.com/books?id=NLoRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA259&lpg=PA259&dq=mort+de+la+marquise+de+Rambouillet&source=bl&ots=e1Zd5ExUtJ&sig=Z_QGaQet8swjGISLAh1bOUxfIgA&hl=fr&ei=V-EnTM7DJMH_lgfpm7XVAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=mort%20de%20la%20marquise%20de%20Rambouillet&f=false The Hôtel de Rambouillet maintained its importance as a literary salon until 1650. Almost all major personages of the French aristocracy and literature of the time frequented it, and its reputation was at its height in the second quarter of the century.
Occasionally, in spring and summer, the marquis and marquise de Rambouillet would entertain the habitués of their Parisian residence in the château de Rambouillet.Tallemant des Réaux, p. 265G. Lenotre, pp. 24-25.
Her success as a salonnière has many explanations. Her natural abilities had been carefully trained. The marquise had a genuine kindness and a lack of prejudice that enabled her to entertain princes and princesses of the blood royal and literary men with the same grace, whilst among her intimate friends was the beautiful actress Angélique Paulet. The respect paid to ability in the salon effected a great advancement in the position of French men of letters. Moreover, the almost uniform excellence of the memoirs and letters of 17th century French men and women may be traced largely to the development of conversation as a fine art at the Hôtel de Rambouillet, and the consequent establishment of a standard of clear and adequate expression. Mme de Rambouillet was known as the "incomparable Arthénice", the name being an anagram for "Catherine", devised by François de Malherbe and Racan.
Among the more noteworthy episodes in the history of the Hôtel de Rambouillet are the literary quarrel between the Uranistes and the Jobelins - respective partisans of two famous sonnets, the Sonnet d'Uranie, by Vincent Voiture, and the Sonnet de Job, by Isaac de Benserade - and the composition by almost all the great poets of the day of the Guirlande de Julie, a collection of forty-one madrigals, each on the theme of a flower, offered in 1641 to Julie d'Angennes by Charles de Sainte Maure, who had been wooing her for ten years when he conceived the idea of the handsome manuscript, but whom she kept waiting four more years. Julie herself, the Hôtel de Rambouillet Princesse Julie, was responsible for a good deal of the preciosity for which the Précieuses were later ridiculed by Molière.
The Précieuses, who are usually associated with Molière's avowed caricatures and with the extravagances of Mlle de Scudéry, but a name Madame de Sévigné herself was proud to bear, insisted on a ceremonious gallantry from their suitors and friends, though it seems from the account given by Tallemant des Réaux that mild practical jokes took place at the Hôtel de Rambouillet. They especially favoured an elaborate and quintessenced kind of colloquial and literary expression, imitated from Giambattista Marini and Luís de Góngora y Argote, then fashionable throughout Europe.
Molière's immortal Précieuses ridicules was no doubt directly levelled not at the Hôtel de Rambouillet itself, but at the numerous coteries which in the course of years had sprung up in imitation of it. The satire affected the originators as well as the imitators, the former more closely perhaps than they perceived. The Hôtel de Rambouillet remained in existence until the death of its hostess, although the troubles of the Fronde diminished its influence.
The chief original authorities respecting Madame de Rambouillet and her set are Tallemant des Réaux in his Historiettes, and Antoine Baudeau de Somaize in his Grand Dictionnaire des Précieuses (1660). 
Among the habitués of Madame de Rambouillet's chambre bleue were:

A census designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes.

CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble incorporated places.
CDPs are delineated solely to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. They include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities.  The boundaries of a CDP have no legal status.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/pl_metadata.html#cdp | title = Census Designated Place | work = Cartographic Boundary Files | publisher = United States Census Bureau | accessdate = 2010-09-30[/tpl] Thus, they may not always correspond with the local understanding of the area or community with the same name. However, criteria established for the 2010 Census require that a CDP name "be one that is recognized and used in daily communication by the residents of the community" (not "a name developed solely for planning or other purposes") and recommend that a CDP's boundaries be mapped based on the geographic extent associated with residents' use of the place name.
The U.S. Census Bureau states that census designated places are not considered incorporated places and that it only includes census designated places in Hawaii in its city population lists because that state has no incorporated cities.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.census.gov/statab/ccdb/cit1040a.txt | title = Cities with 100,000 or More Population in 2000 ranked by Population per Square Mile, 2000 in Alphabetic Order | publisher = United States Census Bureau, Population Division | date = 2008-07-10 | accessdate = 2008-07-13[/tpl] In addition, census city lists from 2007 include Arlington County, Virginia's CDP in the list with the incorporated places.

[[Monomethylhydrazine]]
CATEGORIES: Rocket fuels, Mycotoxins, Hydrazines, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors

Monomethylhydrazine (MMH) is a volatile hydrazine chemical with the chemical formula CH3 (NH)NH2. It is used as a rocket propellant in bipropellant rocket engines because it is hypergolic with various oxidizers such as nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) and nitric acid (HNO3).  As a propellant, it is described in specification MIL-PRF-27404.
MMH is a hydrazine derivative used in the orbital maneuvering system (OMS) and reaction control system (RCS) engines of NASA's Space Shuttle, which used MMH and MON-3 (a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide). This chemical is toxic and carcinogenic in small amounts, but it is easily stored in outer space providing moderate performance for very low fuel tank system weight. Recently the European Space Agency (ESA) has attempted to seek new options in terms of bipropellant rocket combinations to avoid poisonous chemicals such as this and its relatives.International Conference on Green Propellant for Space Propulsion, European Space Agency
MMH and its chemical relative unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) have a key advantage that they are stable enough to be used in regeneratively cooled rocket engines. The Apollo Lunar Modules used a one-to-one mixture of hydrazine and UDMH (called Aerozine 50, or A-50) as one part of the rocket fuel for lunar landings and takeoff: the rocket motors formed a hypergolic mixture of the hydrazines with liquid dinitrogen tetroxide as the usual oxidizer. (Otherwise, red fuming nitric acid works.) About three tons of mixed hydrazines and four and one half tons of the oxidizer were required for each landing, and about one-third of those amounts for the lunar take-off to orbit.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw1st|page=492[/tpl]
Monomethylhydrazine is believed to be the main cause of the toxicity of Gyromitra genus mushrooms, especially the false morel (Gyromitra esculenta). In these cases, MMH is formed by the hydrolysis of gyromitrin.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pyysalo H. |title=Some new toxic compounds in false morels, Gyromitra esculenta |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=395 |year=1975 |pmid=1238907 |doi=10.1007/BF00625355[/tpl]

The Pike Expedition (July 15, 1806 – July 1, 1807) was a military effort authorized by the United States government to explore the south and west of the recent Louisiana Purchase. Roughly contemporaneous with the Lewis and Clark Expedition, it was led by United States Army Lieutenant Zebulon Pike, Jr.  (He was promoted to captain while on the trip.)  It was the first official American effort to explore the western Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains in present-day Colorado. Pike contacted several Native American tribes during his travels and informed them of the new US rule over the territory. The expedition documented the United States' discovery of Pikes Peak. After splitting up his men, Pike led the larger contingent to find the headwaters of the Red River. A smaller group returned safely to the US Army fort in St. Louis, Missouri before winter set in.
Pike's company made several errors and ended up in Spanish territory in southern present-day Colorado, where the Americans built a fort to survive the winter. Captured by the Spanish and taken into Mexico in February, their travels through present-day New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas provided Pike with important data about Spanish military strength and civilian populations. Although he and most of his men were released because the nations were not at war, some of his soldiers were held in Mexican prisons for years, despite US objections. In 1810, Pike published an account of his expeditions, which was so popular that it was translated into French, German, and Dutch for publication in Europe.

Because of that affiliation, Orlando Sanford International Airport is served primarily by British charter airlines serving the European market for leisure travel. It is primarily a landing point for European travel, but Sanford is also the second largest focus city for Las Vegas-based Allegiant Air. It was a small focus city for the travel marketer Direct Air until the company's demise in 2012.

[[Blue Cliff Record]]

CATEGORIES: Zen koan collections, 1125 works

The Blue Cliff Record ([tpl]zh|c=《碧巖錄》 Bìyán Lù[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ja|[/tpl][tpl]Nihongo||碧巌録|Hekiganroku[/tpl]; Korean: Byeokamrok, 벽암록(碧巖錄); Vietnamese: Bích nham lục (碧巖錄)) is a collection of Chán Buddhist koans originally compiled in China during the Song dynasty in 1125 (宋宣和七年) and then expanded into its present form by the Chán master Yuanwu Keqin (圜悟克勤 1063 – 1135).
The book includes Yuanwu's annotations and commentary on Xuedou Zhongxian's (雪竇重顯 980 – 1052) collection 100 Verses on Old Cases 《頌古百則》 — a compilation of 100 koans. Xuedou selected 82 of these from the Jingde Chuandeng Lu 《景德傳燈錄》 (Jingde era Record of the Transmission of the Lamp), with the remainder selected from the Yunmen Guanglu 《雲門廣録》 (Extensive Record of Yunmen Wenyan (864 – 949).
Yuanwu's successor, Dahui Zonggao (大慧宗杲 1089 – 1163). wrote many letters to lay students teaching the practice of concentrating on koans during meditation. But Dahui did not explain and analyze koans. Oral tradition holds that Dahui noticed students engaged in too much intellectual discourse on koans, and then burned the wooden blocks used to print the Bìyán Lù.
Another key legend regards Dogen Zenji (道元禅師; 1200 – 1253), who brought the Soto Zen sect to Japan: After an extended visit to China for the purpose of studying Zen, on the night before his planned return to Japan, Dogen saw the Bìyán Lù for the first time, and stayed up all night making a handwritten copy of the book. Given the size of the book, this story is most likely apocryphal.
Similar publications included Zutang Record 《祖堂錄》 and the Xutang Record 《虛堂集》, as well as others.

This article is about the book by Roger Zelazny. See Knight of Shadows (disambiguation) for other meanings.
 

Knight of Shadows is the ninth book in the Amber saga by Roger Zelazny and published in November 1989.
Merlin continues to attempt to solve the mysteries in his life: Why did Julia turn against him? And how did she get involved with Jurt, who is raging against him a ruthless vendetta?
After being trapped in a strange world peopled with ghosts induced by the Pattern, Merlin discovers that he is involved in a superpower quarrel between Amber's  Pattern and the Logrus of Chaos.
In this book, Merlin describes Corwin's voice as "the voice which had once told me a very long story containing multiple versions of an auto accident and a number of genealogical gaffes." The "genealogical gaffes" here refers to a number of inconsistencies in the first series (the Corwin Cycle) regarding the parentage of Corwin's various siblings.

[[Renin–angiotensin system]]
CATEGORIES: Human homeostasis, Cardiovascular physiology, Endocrinology

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) or the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and water (fluid) balance.
When blood volume is low, juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys activate their prorenin and secrete renin directly into circulation. Plasma renin then carries out the conversion of angiotensinogen released by the liver to angiotensin I.[tpl]cite book|title=Pathologic Basis of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4160-3121-5|page=493|author=Kumar, Abbas,Fausto, Aster|edition=Eighth|chapter=11[/tpl]  Angiotensin I is subsequently converted to angiotensin II by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme found in the lungs. Angiotensin II is a potent vaso-active peptide that causes blood vessels to constrict, resulting in increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the secretion of the hormone aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone causes the tubules of the kidneys to increase the reabsorption of sodium and water into the blood. This increases the volume of fluid in the body, which also increases blood pressure.
If the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is abnormally active, blood pressure will be too high. There are many drugs that interrupt different steps in this system to lower blood pressure. These drugs are one of the main ways to control high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, kidney failure, and harmful effects of diabetes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec03/ch022/ch022a.html |title=High Blood Pressure: Heart and Blood Vessel Disorders |work=Merck Manual Home Edition [/tpl]

The American paddlefish, Polyodon spathula, also called the Mississippi paddlefish or spoonbill, is a paddlefish living in slow-flowing waters of the Mississippi River drainage system. It appears to have been extirpated from Lake Erie and its tributaries.  They are closely related to the sturgeons. This large Chondrostean freshwater fish may grow to 220 cm (7 feet) and weigh up to 100 kg (220 pounds).  The paddlefish takes its common and scientific names from its distinctive snout, which is greatly elongated and flattened into a paddle shape. The American paddlefish is believed to use sensitive electroreceptors on its paddle to detect prey, as well as to navigate while migrating to spawning sites.http://www.whatamidoingonline.com/2012/09/21/10-amazing-creatures-find-adventuring/ The American paddlefish feeds primarily on zooplankton but also feeds on crustaceans and bivalves. Polyodon spathula is one of two living species of Paddlefish;  the other is the possibly extinct Chinese Paddlefish, Psephurus gladius.

[[Chinese paddlefish]]

CATEGORIES: Polyodontidae, Fish of East Asia, Animals described in 1862, Monotypic fish genera, Endemic fauna of China

Chinese Paddlefish, Psephurus gladius ([tpl]zh|t=白鱘|s=白鲟|p=báixún[/tpl]), also known as Chinese Swordfish, are among the largest freshwater fish. It is one of two extant paddlefish species, the other being the American Paddlefish (Polyodon spathula). It is also called "elephant fish" (象魚; xiàngyú) because its snout resembles an elephant trunk. It is recorded sometimes in Classical Chinese as wěi-fish (鮪). More poetically, it is sometimes referred to as the "Giant Panda of the Rivers", not because of any physical resemblance to a panda, but because of its rarity and protected status.
The Chinese Paddlefish is a first-level protected animal of the People's Republic of China. Its belly is white and back and head grey. They live mostly in the middle or lower part of the Yangtze (Chang Jiang), occasionally in large lakes. They feed on other fish, as well as small amounts of crabs and crayfish. Paddlefish are sexually mature at age seven or eight, with a typical body length of 2 metres and a weight of 25 kilograms.
It is said that the zoologist Bǐng Zhì (秉志) recorded around the 1950s that some fishermen caught a paddlefish of 7-metres, although the authenticity of the story is unconfirmed.  It is said that the Chinese paddlefish can grow to 23 feet and weigh 1,100 pounds, but little research on a maximum size can be conducted today due to the species' scarcity.
Due to overfishing, the Chinese Paddlefish is critically endangered now, and officially recognized by the People's Republic in 1983 to prevent fishing of paddlefish young or adults. Paddlefish are also threatened by dams (such as the Three Gorges Dam) which divide the population into isolated groups. The fish are rarely seen, recently raising concerns that the species might already be extinct. During a three-year search conducted from 2006–2008 a research team from the Chinese Academy of Fisheries Science in Jingzhou failed to find even one specimen. The last confirmed sighting of
the fish alive occurred January 24, 2003 on the Yangtze.name=bbc20090929/> However, a 3.6-meter, 250 kilogram specimen was captured
by illegal fishing on January 8, 2007, in Jiayu County. Local villagers contacted officials who rushed to the site.
Zeb Hogan of Monster Fish on National Geographic Channel and other conservationists transferred the
fish to a holding pen in hope that it would survive. But shortly afterwards it died due to unrecoverable injuries 
sustained while thrashing in the net.[ref]

The Heim ins Reich ([tpl]Audio|De-Heim ins Reich.ogg|listen[/tpl]; German; "Home into the Empire" or "Back to the Reich"),A less literal translation might be "Return to the Nation" was a foreign policy pursued by Adolf Hitler beginning in 1938.  The aim of his initiative was to convince all of the ethnically German people who were living outside of the Third Reich (e.g. in Austria and the western districts of Poland) that they should strive to bring these regions "home" into Greater Germany. It included areas ceded after the Treaty of Versailles, as well as other areas containing significant German populations such as the Sudetenland.
The policy was managed by VOMI (Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle or "Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans"). As a state agency of the NSDAP, it handled all Volksdeutsch issues. By 1941, the VOMI was under the control of the SS.

CATEGORIES: Geography of Marin County, California, Landforms of the San Francisco Bay Area, Valleys of California

San Geronimo Valley (colloquially known as "The Valley" by citizens of West Marin) is a valley in Marin County, California, composed of four unincorporated towns: Woodacre, San Geronimo, Forest Knolls, and Lagunitas.  Residents of San Geronimo Valley and surrounding areas refer to it as "The Valley."  It is a fairly close-knit community, with a rather liberal citizenry.  The farther west, the more forested the land becomes.  The valley is bisected by Sir Francis Drake Boulevard; a number of streets in the towns along this road were constructed on the former right of way of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad.  The valley has numerous hiking/biking trails.  Most of the valley's residents reside on the south side of the valley, which is the shadier side.  
The San Geronimo Valley derives its name from the San Geronimo Ranch, established by Adolph Mailliard and Ann Eliza Ward in 1868, where they bred thoroughbred horses, including the famous stallion Monday who sired most of the race horses in California.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.archive.org/details/mailliardsofcali00mailrich |title=The Mailliards of California : a family chronicle, 1868-1990 |author=Mailliard, William Somers |date=1993 |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=20 April 2010 [/tpl]
It is part of the Lagunitas School District, unique in that it operates three alternative elementary programs and a traditional middle school program on two connected campuses with one superintendent (Larry Enos), one principal (Christian Francis), and one school board (Denise Santa Cruz-Bohmani, Stephanie O'Brien, Steve Rebscher, Christopher Sabec, and Richard Sloan). Each elementary program: Open Classroom, Montessori, and Waldorf-Inspired, has its own unique philosophy and pedagogical methods, all working within the framework of the California professional and academic standards. Each program involves parent participation to some degree.
The main businesses in the Valley are the Woodacre Market and Deli, Video West and the Little Store in Forest Knolls, and the Lagunitas Store, though there are numerous others.

CATEGORIES: Management, Taoism, Political concepts

The portmanteau chaordic refers to a system of organization that blends characteristics of chaos and order. The term was coined by Dee Hock, the founder and former CEO of the VISA credit card association.
The mix of chaos and order is often described as a harmonious coexistence displaying characteristics of both, with neither chaotic nor ordered behavior dominating. Some[tpl]Who|date=June 2010[/tpl] hold that nature is largely organized in such a manner; in particular, living organisms and the evolutionary process by which they arose are often described as chaordic in nature. The chaordic principles have also been used as guidelines for creating human organizations -- business, nonprofit, government and hybrids—that would be neither centralized nor anarchical networks.

[[Clapperboard]]

CATEGORIES: Film and video technology

A clapperboard is a device used in filmmaking and video production to assist in the synchronizing of picture and sound, and to designate and mark particular scenes and takes recorded during a production. The sharp "clap" noise that the clapperboard makes can be identified easily on the audio track, and the shutting of the clapstick can be  identified easily on the separate visual track.  The two tracks can then be precisely synchronised by matching the sound and movement. Other names for the clapperboard include clapper, clapboard, slate, slate board, sync slate, time slate, sticks, board, and sound marker. 
When a movie's sound and picture are out of synchronization, this is known as lip flap.

Roberto Cofresí (June 17, 1791 – March 29, 1825),  better known as "El Pirata Cofresí", was the most renowned pirate in Puerto Rico. He became interested in sailing at a young age, when he acquired his first ship and became acquainted with the Mona Passage. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries there were political and economic difficulties in Puerto Rico, which at the time was a colony of the Spanish Empire. Upon reaching adulthood, Roberto Cofresí decided to abandon a merchant's life and became a pirate. Commanding a crew out of Isla de Mona they navigated between Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Saint Thomas, leading several assaults against cargo and merchant vessels. Historians have speculated that Cofresí may have served as a privateer prior to this, likely aboard the Escipión, a ship owned by one of his cousins named José María Ramírez de Arellano. He established a reputation for being difficult to capture, successfully avoiding the Spanish Armed Forces and United States Navy, and also escaping from a Dominican jail on the first night of his imprisonment. This was accomplished with the help of civil informants and associates - a web so vast that it took 14 years after his death to fully dismantle it.
Cofresí commanded a small and rotating crew, with most contemporary documents and accounts placing its quorum between 10 to 20 men. Though most members were recruited locally, men from the other Antilles and even expatriate Europeans joined the pirates on occasion. His leadership was enhanced by a bold and audacious personality, a trait acknowledged even by those who pursued him. Despite operating during a time where piracy was heavily monitored and most pirates rarely achieved success, Cofresí was confirmed to have plundered at least eight vessels and has been credited with as many as over 70 captures. Throughout his life he commanded at least three different vessels, with the most infamous being a fast six gun schooner named El Mosquito, displaying a preference for speed and maneuverability over firepower. Unlike his predecessors, Cofresí is not known to have operated under any variant of the Pirate code. Despite not admitting to any murder, reports claim that he boasted about his crimes and that the number of persons that died as a consequence of his pillaging ranged between 300 and 400 victims, most of them foreigners.
Cofresí was the dominant pirate of his era in the Caribbean. He shared the Spanish Main with Jean Lafitte until 1823, when he became the sole major threat in the hemisphere until his death, a title that would only be contested by lesser or regional freebooters such as Charles Gibbs, Mansel Alcantra (also spelled Alcántara) or Samuel Hall Lord. On March 5, 1825, El Mosquito engaged a float of ships led by John Slout in battle. After a naval battle that lasted 45 minutes, Cofresí abandoned his ship and tried to escape by land before being captured. After being imprisoned the pirates were sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where a brief military trial found them guilty and on March 29, 1825, he and most members of the crew were executed by a firing squad. 
After his execution, Cofresí's life was the inspiration for several stories and myths, most of them highlighting the Robin Hood-like "steal from the rich, give to the poor" philosophy that became associated with him. Through poetry and oral tradition, this portrayal has evolved into legend, being commonly accepted as veridical in Puerto Rico and throughout the rest of the West Indies. Both the historical and mythical accounts of his life have inspired countless songs, poems, plays, books and films. In Puerto Rico several caves, beaches and other places that supposedly functioned as hideouts or the location of buried treasures, have been named after Cofresí. He also serves as namesake for Cofresí, a resort town located near Puerto Plata, in the Dominican Republic. In the mainland U.S. an international moving and hauling company, Agencia Cofresí, is named after him. [tpl]Harvnb|Pariser|1995|pp=182[/tpl]

Julian Seymour Schwinger (February 12, 1918 – July 16, 1994) was a Nobel Prize winning American theoretical physicist. He is best known for his work on the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), in particular for developing a relativistically invariant perturbation theory, and for renormalizing QED to one loop order. Schwinger was a professor in the physics department at UCLA.
Schwinger is recognized as one of the greatest physicists of the twentieth century, responsible for much of modern quantum field theory, including a variational approach, and the equations of motion for quantum fields. He developed the first electroweak model, and the first example of confinement in 1+1 dimensions. He is responsible for the theory of multiple neutrinos, Schwinger terms, and the theory of the spin 3/2 field.

[[Mixed franking]]

CATEGORIES: Philatelic terminology, Postal system, Postal markings

In philately, a mixed franking is an occurrence of postage stamps of more than one country or issuing entity on a single cover — or the occurrence of postage stamps of more than one currency of a country or issuing identity on a single cover. Since nearly all countries of the world have agreed to deliver each other's mail, it is unusual to need more than the stamps of the originating country; valid mixed frankings are uncommon and valued by collectors.
Before the advent of the Universal Postal Union in 1874, sending international mail was quite an adventure; it might be necessary to affix the stamps of the destination country in addition to those of the origin, and in the worst cases, possibly for several other countries along the way.  Sometimes the letter was held until the recipient brought stamps, they were affixed and cancelled, and the result handed to the recipient.  Since this only happened during the first few decades of stamp usage, and only for the few letters that were sent great distances, very few covers have survived.  For some combinations, only single examples have survived, and command spectacular prices among collectors.
Another form of mixed franking occurs in transitional periods, either as a way to help the public use up the stamps of a defunct government, or involuntarily as a propaganda tool.
An example of involuntary mixed franking is when Germany took over Austria in the Anschluss in 1938; during the several months while Austrian stamps were still accepted, Austrians sending mail to Germany were required to include a German stamp on the envelope.
Sometimes illegitimate mixed frankings occur when a postal user adds another country's stamps to an envelope just for fun.  Many countries' postal regulation require clerks to refuse to handle these, even if the correct postage of the country is present, because they slow down the sorting process, but such covers can still get through the system.

[[Labyrinth seal]]

CATEGORIES: Seals (mechanical)

A labyrinth seal is a type of mechanical seal that provides a tortuous path to help prevent leakage. An example of such a seal is sometimes found within an axle's bearing to help prevent the leakage of the oil lubricating the bearing.   
A labyrinth seal may be composed of many grooves that press tightly inside another axle, or inside a hole, so that the fluid has to pass through a long and difficult path to escape. Sometimes screw threads exist on the outer and inner portion. These interlock, to produce the long characteristic path which slows leakage. For labyrinth seals on a rotating shaft, a very small clearance must exist between the tips of the labyrinth threads and the running surface.
Labyrinth seals on rotating shafts provide non-contact sealing action by controlling the passage of fluid through a variety of chambers by centrifugal motion, as well as by the formation of controlled fluid vortices.  At higher speeds, centrifugal motion forces the liquid towards the outside and therefore away from any passages.  Similarly, if the labyrinth chambers are correctly designed, any liquid that has escaped the main chamber becomes entrapped in a labyrinth chamber, where it is forced into a vortex-like motion.  This acts to prevent its escape, and also acts to repel any other fluid. Because these labyrinth seals are non-contact, they do not wear out.
Many gas turbine engines, having high rotational speeds, use labyrinth seals due to their lack of friction and long life.  
Labyrinth seals are also found on pistons, which use them to store oil and seal against high pressure during compression and power strokes, as well as on other non-rotating shafts. In these applications, it is the long and difficult path and the formation of controlled fluid vortices plus some limited contact-sealing action that creates the seal.

[[Viriconium]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional populated places, Dying Earth subgenre

Viriconium is a fictional city created by M. John Harrison and also the name of the cycle of novels and stories set in and around it.
Viriconium is on a future Earth littered with the technological detritus of millennia (partly inspired by Jack Vance's Dying Earth series and Mervyn Peake's 
Gormenghast series [ref]"A Storm of Wings" in David Pringle,
Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels,  Grafton Books, 1988 ISBN 0-246-13214-0  (pp. 201-203). [/ref] although  the works are also influenced in their imagery by the poems of T.S. Eliot).  
The Pastel City concerns the defence of the eponymous city against northern "barbarians" by a melancholy swordsman and poet, 'sometime soldier and sophisticate'  Lord tegeus-Cromis. tegeus-Cromis is the hero of the Methven but believes he has finished soldiering forever - until the mercenary Birkin Griff brings dire news of the war between the two queens and the hazard facing the Pastel City. They must travel to the Great Brown Waste to find Tomb the Dwarf, and join forces to fight for Queen Jane and Viriconium - for Canna Moidart and the Wolves of the North have awoken the geteit chemosit, alien automata from an ancient science, which will destroy everything in their path. 
The second novel of the series, A Storm of Wings, is set 80 years after the events described in The Pastel City. Lord tegeus-Cromis had broken the yoke of Canna Moidart. But now the Reborn Men, awoken from their long sleep, have inherited the Evening Cultures. Their first representative is Alsath Fulthor. In the wastelands to the north and west of Viriconium, a city is being built - but not by men. It is the Time of the Locust. The attackers are insect-like aliens who threaten to turn the inhabitants of the Pastel City into hideous, mindless insects: the story is told through both human and alien points of view and perceptions. The main characters are a resurrected man, an assassin, a magician, a madwoman, and 
Tomb, the Iron Dwarf.  
The third novel of the series, In Viriconium, whose working title was By Gas Mask and Fire Hydrant, parodies Arthurian motifs and deconstructs the whole series to show that Viriconium is just a fiction: the protagonist Audsley King realizes this and at last can paint the real world, which is our own. The novel is divided into sections named after cards of an imaginary Tarot. The story concerns the efforts of one artist, Ashlyme, to rescue another - the frail, consumptive, dying Audsley King - from the plague zone (the latter is a motif that recurs in Harrison's novel Nova Swing). It is a desperate, misconceived enterprise which draw Ashlyme into unwilling alliance with the sinister dwarf The Grand Cairo, and which goes bizarrely wrong. Yet out of the shambles comes the clue to lifting the plague which symbolises a paralysis of will.  Resonances in the text include the art of Aubrey Beardsley, post-Impressionist art, Mervyn Peake and Wyndham Lewis. 
The short fiction of the Viriconium sequence replays this attrition; finally, in "A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium" (later retitled "A Young Man's Journey to London"), Viriconium has become little more than a dream.
Variations of the city appear throughout the series (most frequently as Uriconium and Vriko), in an attempt by Harrison to subvert the concept of thoroughly-mapped secondary worlds featured in certain works of fantasy, particularly those by J. R. R. Tolkien and his host of successors."What It Might Be Like To Live In Viriconium," by M. John Harrison

John Walters (11 July 1939, Long Eaton, Derbyshire – 30 July 2001) was a British radio producer and presenter and musician, educated at Durham University. Initially a teacher and a jazz enthusiast, he played trumpet in The Mighty Joe Young Jazz Men and the 1960s pop group The Alan Price Set before joining BBC Radio 1 in 1967.
He was long-term producer of DJ John Peel's radio show, and responsible for giving many recording artists their first big break.  He turned down the Sex Pistols for a Peel session when, drawing on his schoolteacher's experience, he said Johnny Rotten "didn't look like the kind of boy you would trust to give out the scissors". He reportedly regretted this decision later, but he was responsible for getting The Smiths their first session after witnessing an early concert.  He produced Vivian Stanshall's first foray into radio, both by overseeing Stanshall's Radio Flashes when Stanshall stood in for a vacationing John Peel, and Stanshall's Sir Henry at Rawlinson End.
As a broadcaster he presented the long-running Radio 1 arts magazine Walters' Weekly and was heard reviewing the music papers on the Janice Long show in the 1980s. In the 1990s he was a reporter on the BBC's current affairs magazine Here and Now.

[[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States]]
CATEGORIES: History of the United States government, Postage stamps of the United States, United States Postal Service, Postal history by country

The history of postal service of the United States evolved from stampless letters, whose cost was borne by the receiving person, to letters carried by private mail carriers and provisional post offices, and then on to letters bearing adhesive postage stamps. Ship captains arriving in port with stampless mail would advertise in the local newspaper names of those having mail and for them to come collect and pay for it, if not already paid for by the sender.
The postal history of the United States was rather haphazard until after the Revolutionary War, when eventually a national postal system was established. Stampless letters, paid for by the receiver, and private postal systems, continued until the introduction of adhesive postage stamps, first issued by the U.S. government post office July 1, 1847 in the denominations of five and ten cents.
The issue and use of adhesive postage stamps continued during the 19th Century primarily for first class mail. Each of these stamps generally bore the face or bust of an American president or another historically important statesman.  However, once the Post Office realized during the 1890s that it could increase revenues by selling stamps as "collectibles," it began issuing commemorative stamps, first in connection with important national expositions, later for the anniversaries of significant American historical events.  Continued technological innovation subsequently prompted the introduction of special stamps, such as those for use with airmail, zeppelin mail, registered mail, certified mail, and so on. Postage due stamps were issued for some time and were pasted by the post office to letters having insufficient postage with the postage due to be paid to the postal carrier at the receiving address.
Today, stamps issued by the post office are self-adhesive, and no longer require that the stamps be "licked" to dissolve the glue on their back. In many cases, post office clerks now use Postal Value Indicators (PVI), which are computer labels, instead of stamps.
Where for a century-and-a-half or so, stamps were almost invariably denominated with their values (5 cent, 10 cent, etc.) the United States post office now sells non-denominated "forever" stamps for use on first-class and international mail. These stamps are still valid even if there is a rate increase. However, for other uses, adhesive stamps with denomination indicators are still available and sold.

[[Angiotensin]]

CATEGORIES: Peptide hormones, Angiology, Endocrinology, Hypertension

Angiotensin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and a subsequent increase in blood pressure. It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that lower blood pressure. Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up.
Angiotensin is an oligopeptide and is a hormone and a powerful dipsogen. It is derived from the precursor molecule angiotensinogen, a serum globulin produced in the liver. It plays an important role in the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin was independently isolated in Indianapolis and Argentina in the late 1930s (as 'angiotonin' and 'hypertensin', respectively) and subsequently characterised and synthesized by groups at the Cleveland Clinic and Ciba laboratories in Basel, Switzerland.[tpl]cite journal | author = Basso N, Terragno NA | title = History about the discovery of the renin-angiotensin system | journal = Hypertension | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 1246–9 |date=December 2001 | pmid = 11751697 | doi = 10.1161/hy1201.101214 | url =  [/tpl]

[[Francesco Maria Guazzo]]
CATEGORIES: 16th-century births, 17th-century deaths, Italian priests, Demonologists, Witch hunter manuals

Francesco Maria Guazzo, aka Guaccio, aka Guaccius (1570[tpl]it[/tpl] Francesco Maria Guazzo, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 60 (2003)-16??) is most well known for the writing the Compendium Maleficarum (Book of Witches). 
He was a member of one of the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosian orders. These religious brotherhoods had appeared at various times since the 14th Century in and around the city of Milan and were quite plentiful, but the only one to attain more than simply local importance was the ‘Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus’ sometimes known as 'The Brethren of the Grove'.
Before 1441 there were various monasteries that were canonically recognized under the name ‘Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus’ but there was little link between them. However, in 1441 Pope Eugene IV merged them into one congregation called ‘Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus’ of which Francesco Maria Guazzo was a member under the papacy of Pope Sixtus V and Pope Paul V. 
Guazzo had firsthand experience of the practice and profession of witchcraft and bewitchment and was widely traveled and highly regarded in the field of possessions and demonology and the cures thereof.
During his life he is credited with performing several exorcisms including to members of several ducal and princely families, notably the bewitched Cardinal Charles of Lorraine and his relative, Eric, Bishop of Verdun.
On another occasion Guazzo was called to Düsseldorf in order to exorcise the mad Duke Johann Wilhelm of Julich and Kleve and Berg (1562–1609). Guazzo first diagnosed possession, but after five months of unsuccessful attempts at spiritual healing and in the summer of 1604, the diagnosis was changed to bewitchment as the cause of the poor Duke’s mental illness. Guazzo had been sent to Düsseldorf by Duke Charles III of Lorraine (a family with which he had a long running association, having exorcised the Cardinal, Charles of Lorraine) on behalf of his daughter Antoinette (1569–1610), Duke Johann Wilhelm’s wife.
It was these direct experiences that inspired Guazzo to write his Compendium Maleficarum which was published in 1608 and was widely regarded among his contemporaries as the authoritative manuscript on Witchcraft.  Within his text, Guazzo discusses witches’ pacts with the devil, detailed descriptions of witches’ powers and poisons and also prepared his classification of the demons based on a previous work by Michael Psellus.
In this work, Guazzo was greatly influenced by Duke Charles III of Lorraine’s leading lawyer and demonologist, Nicholas Remy (Remy produced one of the most important early works on demonology and witchcraft in 1595, Daemonolatreiae libri tres, and claimed to have sentenced to death over 900 people during witch trials between 1582–1592).

[[Prony equation]]

CATEGORIES: Equations of fluid dynamics

The Prony equation (named after Gaspard de Prony) is a historically important equation in hydraulics, used to calculate the head loss due to friction within a given run of pipe.  It is an empirical equation developed by Frenchman Gaspard de Prony in the 19th century:
where hf is the head loss due to friction, calculated from: the ratio of the length to diameter of the pipe L/D, the velocity of the flow V, and two empirical factors a and b to account for friction.
This equation has been supplanted in modern hydraulics by the Darcy–Weisbach equation, which used it as a starting point.

Shedim is the Hebrew word for demons. The word shedim appears only twice (always plural) in the Tanakh, at [tpl]bibleverse||Psalm|106:37[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse||Deuteronomy|32:17[/tpl]. It was possibly a loan-word from Akkadian in which the word sedu referred to a protective, benevolent spirit. Both times the term appears in the Tanakh, it deals with child or animal sacrifice to  false gods that are called demons.W.

[[Empirical relationship]]

CATEGORIES: Empiricism, Concepts in epistemology, Epistemology of science

In science, an empirical relationship is one based solely on observation rather than theory.  An empirical relationship requires only confirmatory data irrespective of theoretical basis.  Sometimes theoretical explanations for what were initially empirical relationships are found, in which case the relationships are no longer considered empirical.  Other times the empirical relationships are merely approximations, often equivalent to the first few terms of the Taylor series of the "real" answer (though in practice these approximations may be so accurate it is difficult to tell they're approximations).  Still other times the relationships may later be found to only hold under certain specific conditions, reducing them to special cases of more general relationships.
Historically the discovery of empirical relationships has been important as a stepping stone to the discovery of theoretical relationships.  And on occasion, what was thought to be an empirical factor is later deemed to be a fundamental physical constant.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
An empirical equation is simply a mathematical statement of one or more empirical relationships in the form of an equation.

Jacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy (Plancy-l'Abbaye, 28 January 1793 –Paris, 1881) was a French occultist, demonologist and writer; he published several works on occultism and demonology.Les Mille et un jours J Stouff - 2010 - biblioweb.hypotheses.org "C'est sans doute la raison pour laquelle, il fut demandé à Jacques Collin de Plancy (1793-1881) qui ne connaissait par l'Orient, mais était expert en esprits et démons de toute sorte, d'en rédiger une introduction."Françoise Lavocat, Pierre Kapitaniak, and Marianne Closson, eds. Fictions du diable: Littérature et démonologie de saint Augustin à Léo Taxil. Françoise Lavocat, H Kallendorf - Renaissance Quarterly, 2008 - JSTOR "... Finally, Jean Céard examines the lingering hold that the demonology of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries exerted upon the imaginations of the later Romantics, as exemplified by authors such as Jacques Collin de Plancy, who “rediscovered” earlier demonologists. ..."
He was born Jacques Albin Simon Collin on 28 (in some sources 30) January 1793 in Plancy (presently Plancy-l'Abbaye) son of Edme-Aubin Collin and Marie-Anne Danton, sister of Georges-Jacques Danton who was executed the year after Jacques was born.Revue de Champagne et de Brie: Histoire, biographie, archaéologie Léon Frémont, Georges Hérelle - 1880 "Jacques Collin, connu en littérature sous le nom de Collin de Plancy, naquit à Plancy, le 30 janvier 1794. Il était fils de Edme- Aubin Collin et de Marie-Anne Danton, et par cette dernière neveu du fameux Danton. Il commença ses études chez ... He later added the aristocratic "de Plancy" himself - an addition which would later cause accusations against his son in his career as a diplomat. He was a free-thinker influenced by Voltaire. He worked as a printer and publisher in Plancy-l'Abbaye and Paris. Between 1830 and 1837, he resided in Brussels, and then in the Netherlands, before he returned to France after having converted to the Catholic religion.
Collin de Plancy followed the tradition of many previous demonologists of cataloguing demons by name and title of nobility, as it happened with grimoires like Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, and The Lesser Key of Solomon among others. In 1818 his best known work, Dictionnaire Infernal, was published. In 1863 were added some images that made it famous: imaginative drawings concerning the appearance of certain demons. In 1822 it was advertised as: 
It is considered a major work documenting beings, characters, books, deeds, and causes which pertain to the manifestations and magic of trafficking with Hell; divinations, occult sciences, grimoires, marvels, errors, prejudices, traditions, folktales, the various superstitions, and generally all manner of marvellous, surprising, mysterious, and supernatural beliefs.
By the end of 1830 he ostensibly became an enthusiastic Catholic—to the confusion of his former admirers and detractors.
In 1846, he published a two volume work entitled Dictionnaire Sciences Occultes et des Idées superstitieuses,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esoterika.org/index.php?telechargements |title=Téléchargements |publisher=Esoterika.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-19[/tpl] another listing of demons.

Jacques Collin de Plancy was the father of Victor Emile Marie Joseph Collin de Plancy (1853–1924) who for nearly a decade starting in 1884 served as French Minister to Korea and whose collected art works and books became part of the core of the Korean collections of the French Bibliothèque Nationale and the Musée Guimet in Paris.François Roudaut, Le Fonds Collin de Plancy à la Bibliothèque de Troyes M Milner - Romantisme, 1995 - persee.fr ...

[[Formal verification]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic circuit verification, Formal methods, Logic in computer science, Theoretical computer science

In the context of hardware and software systems, formal verification is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain formal specification or property, using formal methods of mathematics.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sanghavi|first=Alok|title=What is formal verification?|journal=EE Times_Asia|date=21 May 2010[/tpl]
Formal verification can be helpful in proving the correctness of systems such as: cryptographic protocols, combinational circuits, digital circuits with internal memory, and software expressed as source code.
The verification of these systems is done by providing a formal proof on an abstract mathematical model of the system, the correspondence between the mathematical model and the nature of the system being otherwise known by construction.  Examples of mathematical objects often used to model systems are: finite state machines, labelled transition systems, Petri nets, timed automata, hybrid automata, process algebra, formal semantics of programming languages such as operational semantics, denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics and Hoare logic.Introduction to Formal Verification, Berkeley University of California, Retrieved November 6, 2013

[[Operational semantics]]

CATEGORIES: Formal specification languages, Logic in computer science, Programming language semantics, Operational semantics

Operational semantics are a category of formal programming language semantics in which certain desired properties of a program, such as correctness, safety or security, are verified by constructing proofs from logical statements about its execution and procedures, rather than by attaching mathematical meanings to its terms (denotational semantics). Operational semantics are classified in two categories: structural operational semantics (or small-step semantics) formally describe how the individual steps of a computation take place in a computer-based system. By opposition natural semantics (or big-step semantics) describe how the overall results of the executions are obtained. Other approaches to providing a formal semantics of programming languages include axiomatic semantics and denotational semantics.
The operational semantics for a programming language describes how a valid program is interpreted as sequences of computational steps.
These sequences then are the meaning of the program.
In the context of functional programs, the final step in a terminating
sequence returns the value of the program.  (In general there can be many return values for a single program,
because the program could be nondeterministic, and even for a deterministic program there can be many computation sequences since the semantics may not specify exactly what sequence of operations arrives at that value.)
The concept of operational semantics was used for the first time in defining the semantics of Algol 68.
The following statement is a quote from the revised ALGOL 68 report:
 
 The meaning of a program in the strict language is explained in terms of a hypothetical computer
which performs the set of actions which constitute the elaboration of that program. (Algol68, Section 2)

The first use of the term "operational semantics" in its present meaning is attributed to
Dana Scott (Plotkin04).
What follows is a quote from Scott's seminal paper on formal semantics,
in which he mentions the "operational" aspects of semantics.
 
 It is all very well to aim for a more ‘abstract’ and a ‘cleaner’ approach to
semantics, but if the plan is to be any good, the operational aspects cannot
be completely ignored. (Scott70)

Perhaps the first formal incarnation of operational semantics was the use of the lambda calculus to define the semantics of LISP by web| title=Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I| author=John McCarthy | url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html | accessdate=2006-10-13}}.
Abstract machines in the tradition of the SECD machine are also closely related.

The Marina District Development Company, LLC is a joint venture of Boyd Gaming Corporation and a divestiture trust for MGM Resorts InternationalNew Jersey Casino Control Commission Ownership Information For The Borgata Hotel, Casino & Spa that was established to develop and operate the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey. After a competitive process, MGM Mirage was selected as the lead developer of government-owned vacant property in the "H-Tract" area, later renamed Renaissance Pointe. MGM Mirage sought the participation of Boyd Gaming, which became the operating partner of the Borgata.
Three casino-hotels were planned for Renaissance Pointe but only the Borgata has been built.
In early 2010, following the conclusion of an investigation by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the Division of Gaming Enforcement into the company's suitability as a casino licensee, executives at MGM announced that they would place their shares in MDDC into a special trust until they find a suitable buyer. In their investigation, the NJCCC and DGE alleged that Macau businesswoman Pansy Ho and her father Stanley have deep ties to criminal elements in Macau and mainland China, and therefore would not be suitable for licensing in New Jersey. The NJCCC gave MGM a choice of ending their relationship with Ho by selling their interest in the MGM Grand Macau, or facing revocation of their New Jersey casino license. MGM chose the latter. On October 14, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission approved the $73 million sale of land underneath the Borgata to Vornado Realty Trust and Geyser Holdings as part of its exit strategy from Atlantic City.[ref]http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/business/article_92f2eca0-c78a-5205-92a7-f736582b170d.html

Marking blue, layout stain or Prussian blue is a dye used in metalworking to aid in marking out rough parts for further machining. It is sometimes called Dykem (after a popular brand). It is used to stain or paint a metal object with a very thin layer of dye that can be scratched off using a scriber or other sharp instrument to reveal a bright, yet very narrow line in the metal underneath.  The advantages are that any existing scratches are covered with the dye and the new lines have a contrasting background.
Marking blue is made by mixing methylated spirits with shellac and gentian violet.[tpl]Citation | last = Brink | first = C. | last2 = McNamara | first2 = B. | title = Engineering Fabrication & Boilermaking | page = 44 | publisher = Pearson South Africa | year = 2008 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=coOZXYLqqPoC&lpg=PA44 | isbn = 978-1-77025-374-2[/tpl].

On the World Wide Web, a link farm is any group of web sites that all hyperlink to every other site in the group.[tpl]cite web|title=link farming|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/L/link_farming.html|publisher=www.webopedia.com|accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl] In graph theoretic terms, a link farm is a  clique.  Although some link farms can be created by hand, most are created through automated programs and services. A link farm is a form of spamming the index of a search engine (sometimes called spamdexing or spamexing). Other link exchange systems are designed to allow individual websites to selectively exchange links with other relevant websites and are not considered a form of spamdexing.
Search engines require ways to confirm page relevancy. A known method is to examine for one-way links coming directly from relevant websites. The process of building links should not be confused with being listed on link farms, as the latter requires reciprocal return links, which often renders the overall backlink advantage useless. This is due to oscillation, causing confusion over which is the vendor site and which is the promoting site.

Anthony George "Tony" Banks (born 27 March 1950) is a British musician and multi-instrumentalist, primarily known for being the keyboardist and a founding member of the progressive rock group Genesis. He is one of only two members (the other being bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford) who have been with Genesis throughout its entire history.
Banks was one of the main composers of Genesis's music, and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs. As the band's keyboardist he used a variety of instruments, including the ARP Pro Soloist synthesiser, the Mellotron, the Yamaha CP-70, and the Hammond T-102 organ.  In the band's earliest years Banks would play acoustic guitar for some of the mellow and pastoral songs.
Outside Genesis, Banks has pursued a solo career, which has included film scoring, pop songs and orchestral music.
In 2006, the first Tony Banks biography, Man of Spells by journalist Mario Giammetti, was published in Italy (Edizioni Segno).
In 2010, Banks was inducted (as a member of Genesis) into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  
Banks is ranked number 11 on MusicRadar's greatest keyboard players of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/the-27-greatest-keyboard-players-of-all-time-484228/28 |title=The 27 greatest keyboard players of all time |publisher=Music Radar |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2013[/tpl]

[[DDR2 SDRAM]]

CATEGORIES: SDRAM

DDR2 SDRAM is a double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory interface. It superseded the original DDR SDRAM specification, and has since been superseded by DDR3 SDRAM. DDR2 DIMMs are neither forward compatible with DDR3 nor backward compatible with DDR.
In addition to double pumping the data bus as in DDR SDRAM (transferring data on the rising and falling edges of the bus clock signal), DDR2 allows higher bus speed and requires lower power by running the internal clock at half the speed of the data bus. The two factors combine to produce a total of four data transfers per internal clock cycle. With data being transferred 64 bits at a time, DDR2 SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (memory clock rate) × 2 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a memory clock frequency of 100 MHz, DDR2 SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 3200 MB/s.
Since the DDR2 internal clock runs at half the DDR external clock rate, DDR2 memory operating at the same external data bus clock rate as DDR results in DDR2 being able to provide the same bandwidth but with higher latency. Alternatively, DDR2 memory operating at twice the external data bus clock rate as DDR may provide twice the bandwidth with the same latency. The best-rated DDR2 memory modules are at least twice as fast as the best-rated DDR memory modules.

Red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16 which causes a mutation in the MC1R protein.
Red hair varies from a deep burgundy through burnt orange to bright copper. It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin. The term redhead (originally redd hede) has been in use since at least 1510.[tpl]cite web|title=redhead, n. and adj.|work=OED Online|url=http://oed.com/view/Entry/160309|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2011-08-07|date=June 2011[/tpl] It is associated with fair skin color, lighter eye colors (gray, blue, green, and hazel), freckles, and sensitivity to ultraviolet light.

[[Human hair color]]
CATEGORIES: Hair color, Biological anthropology

Hair color is the pigmentation of hair follicles due to two types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Generally, if more eumelanin is present, the color of the hair is darker; if less eumelanin is present, the hair is lighter. Levels of melanin can vary over time causing a person's hair color to change, and it is possible to have hair follicles of more than one color.
Particular hair colors are associated with  ethnic groups.   The shades of human hair color are assessed using the Fischer–Saller scale. The Fischer–Saller scale, named after Eugen Fischer and Karl Saller, is used in physical anthropology and medicine to determine the shades of hair color. The scale uses the following designations: A (light blond), B to E (blond), F to L (blond), M to O (dark blond), P to T (brown), U to Y (dark brown/black) and Roman numerals I to IV (red) and V to VI (red blond).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/forensic-science-communications/fsc/july2000/index.htm/ubelaker.htm|title=Change in Hair Pigmentation in Children from Birth to 5 Years in a European Population (Longitudinal Study)|publisher =Forensic Science Communications|accessdate=2014-03-19[/tpl] See also the Martin–Schultz scale for eye color.

CATEGORIES: Earldoms in the Peerage of England, Finch-Hatton family

Earl of Winchilsea and Earl of Nottingham are two titles in the Peerage of England held by the Finch family that have been united under a single holder since 1729. The Finch family is believed to be descended from Henry FitzHerbert, Lord Chamberlain to Henry I (r. 1100–1135). The name change came in the 1350s after marriage to an heiress member of the Finch family. A later member of the family, Sir William Finch, was knighted in 1513. His son Sir Thomas Finch (died  1563), was also knighted for his share in suppressing Sir Thomas Wyatt's insurrection against Queen Mary I, and was the son-in-law of Sir Thomas Moyle, some of whose lands Finch's wife inherited.  Thomas's eldest son Moyle Finch represented Weymouth, Kent and Winchilsea in the House of Commons. In 1611 he was created a baronet, of Eastwell in the County of Kent.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage 1900

[[Solar proton event]]

CATEGORIES: Solar phenomena

A solar proton event (or proton storm) occurs when protons emitted by the Sun become accelerated to very high energies either close to the Sun during a solar flare or in interplanetary space by the shocks associated with coronal mass ejections. Besides protons, the events can include other nuclei like helium ions and HZE ions, meaning that the event is sometimes a solar particle event. These high energy protons and ions cause several effects. They can penetrate the Earth's magnetic field and cause ionization in the ionosphere. The effect is similar to auroral events, the difference being that electrons and not protons are involved. Energetic solar protons are also a significant radiation hazard to spacecraft and especially astronauts, who can receive large amounts of absorbed dose from the ionizing radiation.

[[Media ecology]]

CATEGORIES: Information science, Marshall McLuhan, Media studies, Anthropology, Communication studies

According to the Media Ecology Association, the term "media ecology" can be defined as "the study of media environments, the idea that technology and techniques, modes of information and codes of communication play a leading role in human affairs."[tpl]cite web|title=What is Media Ecology?|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/index.html|publisher=Media Ecology Association|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl] Media ecology theory centers on the principles that technology not only profoundly influences society, it also controls virtually all walks of life. It is a study of how media and communication processes affect human perception and understanding.[tpl]cite book|last=West|first=Richard|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year=2010|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338507-5|pages=428–440|edition=4|coauthors=Lynn H.

Brought up in a family of convinced communists, Michnik was one of the most relentless opponents of the communist regime. A legendary figure of the Polish anti-communist opposition, he was imprisoned, first, after the 1968 March Events, then, after the imposition of the Martial Law in 1981. Michnik also played a crucial role during the Polish Round Table Talks, as a result of which the communists conceded to call elections, which were subsequently won by Solidarity. Even though he has withdrawn from active politics he has "maintained an influential voice through journalism".Judt, Tony, Postwar; A History of Europe since 1945, p.694 He is a laureate of many awards and honors, including a Knight of the Legion of Honour and European of the Year.

CATEGORIES: Unix, Unix software

words is a standard file on all Unix and Unix-like operating systems, and is simply a newline-delimited list of dictionary words. It is used, for instance, by spell-checking programs.
With Unix's text processing capabilities, one can use the words file for many purposes.  For example, using the grep tool, one can find all three-letter words without any vowels, using regular expressions:
 egrep -i "^[^aeiouy']{3}$" /usr/share/dict/words
The words file is usually stored in /usr/share/dict/words, or /usr/dict/words.
On Debian and Ubuntu, the words file is provided by the wordlist package, or its provider packages wbritish, wamerican, etc. On Fedora and Arch, the words file is provided by the words package.
A words file is also used to contain words related to a specific topic. One such example of this is for profanity censoring software that replaces profanities, for example, posted on the web with strings such as "###" or some other replacement. Words that are posted in this example are compared with a "bad-words" file and then, if there is an occurrence of such a word, it is summarily replaced.

Zahra "Ziba" Kazemi-Ahmadabadi (زهرا کاظمی احمدآبادی in Persian) (1948 – July 11, 2003) was an Iranian-Canadian freelance photographer, who was killed by Iranian officials following her arrest in Iran.
Although Iranian authorities insist that her death was accidental and that she died of a stroke while being interrogated, Shahram Azam, a former military staff physician who used his purported knowledge of Kazemi's case for seeking asylum in Canada in 2004, has stated that he examined Kazemi's body and observed that Kazemi showed obvious signs of torture, including a skull fracture, broken nose, signs of rape and severe abdominal bruising.INDEPTH: ZAHRA KAZEMI "Iran's changing story" CBC News Online | Updated November 16, 2005  Retrieved 15/03/08 [tpl]Full|date=November 2012[/tpl]

[[Captive bead ring]]

CATEGORIES: Body piercing jewellery

A captive bead ring (CBR), ball closure ring (BCR), captive hoop, or captive ball ring is a common example of body piercing jewelry.
The captive bead or ball fits into a small opening in the circle of the ring. The bead is slightly larger than this opening and has small indentations or depressions that correspond to the ring's end-points so that it may fit snugly against them, thus completing the circuit of the ring. Often, a hole is drilled through the bead to allow easier fitting.
It uses the natural tensile or compressive strength of the metal the ring is made of, usually surgical stainless steel, niobium, or titanium, to hold the bead tightly in place. The bead or ball itself may additionally be made from coloured glass, acrylic or ceramic, or a gemstone.
This is a popular piece of body jewelry because it conveniently allows the wearer to remove the ring by simply removing the captive bead, yet the bead is held so firmly in place that it will not easily fall out. Additionally, because of their closed shape and rounded edges, these rings do not easily snag on clothing, hair, or furniture, making them a popular choice for piercings which are still healing. However, its circular shape means that it can drag dried lymph back into the healing piercing, meaning that barbells are seen as being preferable for certain healing piercings.

[[Gag]]
CATEGORIES: Physical restraint

A gag is usually a device designed to prevent speech, often as a restraint device to stop the subject from calling for help. This is usually done by blocking the mouth, partially or completely, or attempting to prevent the tongue, lips, or jaw from moving in the normal patterns of speech. They are often less effective in reality than in crime fiction.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl] They carry a strong risk of killing the victim by suffocation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl] The more "effective" a gag appears to be, the more hazardous it is: for example, duct tape is fairly effective but is hazardous if for some reason (e.g., the common cold) the subject cannot breathe freely through the nose.
The use of gags is commonly depicted in crime fiction, particularly in comics and novels. It is also often used in movies, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and its sequel Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Very rarely, courts have been known to gag unruly defendants; Bobby Seale was the most famous case.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAseale.htm |title=Bobby Seale : Biography |accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl]
Occasionally a cloth over-the-mouth gag is used not to prevent speech but to keep dust and aerosols out of the lungs.Described, and called a "gag", in a recorded commentary in the Catalyst chemical industry museum in Runcorn (Cheshire, England), to keep alkali dust out of workers' lungs.

Lollapalooza [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɒ|l|ə|p|ə|ˈ|l|uː|z|ə[/tpl] is an annual music festival featuring popular alternative rock, heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop bands, dance and comedy performances, and craft booths. It has also provided a platform for non-profit and political groups.
Conceived and created in 1991 by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell as a farewell tour for his band, Lollapalooza ran annually until 1997, and was revived in 2003. From its inception through 1997, and its revival in 2003, the festival toured North America. In 2004, the festival organizers decided to expand the dates to two days per city, but poor ticket sales forced the 2004 tour to be cancelled.The Associated Press. "Lollapalooza 2004 cancels all dates". USA Today. June 22, 2004. In 2005, Farrell and the William Morris Agency partnered up with Austin, Texas-based company Capital Sports Entertainment (now C3 Presents) and retooled it into its current format as a weekend destination festival in Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois. In 2010 it was announced that Lollapalooza would debut overseas, with a branch of the festival staged in Chile's capital Santiago on April 2–3, 2011 where they partnered up with Santiago-based company Lotus. In 2011, the company Geo Events confirmed the Brazilian version of the event, which was held at the Jockey Club in São Paulo on 7 and 8 April 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/938604-festival-lollapalooza-deve-ter-edicao-em-sp-em-2012.shtml |title=Festival Lollapalooza deve ter edição em SP em 2012 |publisher= Folha de S.Paulo |date=04/07/2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lollapaloozabr.com/ |title=Lollapalooza Brasil |publisher=Lollapaloozabr.com |date=2013-03-29 |accessdate=2013-08-12[/tpl]

[[Digital Hardcore Recordings]]
CATEGORIES: British independent record labels, Electronic music record labels, Record labels established in 1994, Industrial record labels

Digital Hardcore Recordings (DHR) is a record label set up in 1994 by Alec Empire, Joel Amaretto and Pete Lawton. Most of the music is recorded in Berlin, though the label is based in London where the records are mastered and manufactured. The funds for setting up the label came from the payment which Atari Teenage Riot received for their aborted record deal with the major UK record label Phonogram Records''.
The label is acclaimed for its articulation of the digital hardcore style of music - "Digital hardcore" is used not only to refer to the record label itself, but to the genre that its artists helped to create.  Several artists to this day, though not affiliated with the DHR label, would classify themselves as digital hardcore, tangible proof of DHR's solid influence on the industrial/electronic scene as well as on the rock/metal-scene.
In 1995 DHR released its first album (they had previously only released a 12" in 1994) and a compilation, Harder Than The Rest. Digital Hardcore Festival events were held in several German cities, and the Suicide Club in Berlin, run by a friend of ATR, provided a platform to new bands such as EC8OR. The word about DHR spread to underground scenes in Japan, USA, Australia and Europe. BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel heard about DHR and invited Atari Teenage Riot to play in London.
In 1996 DHR made a distribution deal for the US on the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal label then DHR toured there and South East Asia. Atari Teenage Riot toured in support of bands such as Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Beck, Rage Against the Machine and Wu-Tang Clan. In 1997 Atari Teenage Riot, Shizuo and Ec8or embarked on a Digital Hardcore tour of the United States.
In 1998 DHR established an office in New York and its studios in Berlin. In the ensuing years Atari Teenage Riot came under a lot of pressure, amongst other reasons because of member Carl Crack's psychosis (and subsequent death). By 2000 the Berlin music scene in which DHR had found its place was declining, Atari Teenage Riot disbanded and no new groups or artists were being signed to DHR. At the end of that year Alec Empire decided to restructure DHR and began work on a new album.
In 2001 Empire released Intelligence and Sacrifice and played shows in the US. He became aware of the growing digital hardcore scene there, releasing a compilation of American bands on DHR entitled Don’t Fuck With Us!
Although at present the label is seen as less influential than it was in the 1990s, DHR is nevertheless recognised for its role in the emergence of breakcore, as well as promoting music its artists believed in.

Fatal Recordings is a feminist record label, established by German industrial / techno artist Hanin Elias.
Fatal focuses on left-wing political music. It was formed in part because Hanin Elias felt that women did not have a place to record and create electronic music. This perspective was a result of her experience with Digital Hardcore Recordings as a member of Atari Teenage Riot.
In January 2006, Elias announced that Fatal Recordings would cease to exist by the following year. It is now defunct.

[[Elevenses]]
CATEGORIES: Breakfasts, Meals, Tea culture

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, elevenses ([tpl]IPAc-en|pron|ɨ|ˈ|l|ɛ|v|ə|n|z|ɨ|z[/tpl]) is a snack that is similar to afternoon tea, but eaten in the morning. It is generally less savoury than brunch, and might consist of some cake or biscuits with a cup of coffee or tea. The name refers to the time of day that it is taken: around 11 am. In the Royal Australian Navy elevenses is commonly called mornos.[tpl]cn|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In the United States, elevenses was a custom of a late-morning whiskey break.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-10-12-03-the-agri-cultural-contradictions-of-obesity.html?scp=4&sq=elevenses&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-12-03; The (Agri)Cultural Contradictions Of Obesity | first=Michael | last=Pollan | date=October 12, 2003[/tpl]
In Sweden elevenses is a tradition mostly associated with elderly people. The Swedish word is "elva-kaffe" meaning "eleven-coffee". It is often served with some kind of biscuits but the main focus is on the coffee.[tpl]cn|date=December 2012[/tpl] In West Friesland country people had a similar meal called "konkelstik" (served at "konkeltoid", the proper time for "konkelen", a verb denoting "making a visit").[tpl]cite book|last=Thijs|first=J.

In many Spanish-speaking cultures, like Colombia and others, the term las onces (the elevens in Spanish) is used to describe a similar meal.  Among Chileans it has shifted to later in the afternoon, more closely reflecting the pattern of British "tea time".

[tpl]lang-sa|धर्मपद[/tpl] Dharmapada) is a collection of sayings of the Buddha in verse form and one of the most widely read and best known Buddhist scriptures. The original version of the Dhammapada is in the Khuddaka Nikaya, a division of the Pali Canon of Theravada Buddhism.
The Buddhist scholar and commentator Buddhaghosa explains that each saying recorded in the collection was made on a different occasion in response to a unique situation that had arisen in the life of the Buddha and his monastic community. His commentary, the Dhammapada Atthakatha, presents the details of these events and is a rich source of legend for the life and times of the Buddha.This commentary is translated into English as Buddhist Legends by E W Burlingame.

[[Spectator sport]]
CATEGORIES: Sports culture

A spectator sport is a sport that is characterized by the presence of spectators, or watchers, at its matches. For instance, American football, association football, baseball, basketball, Canadian football, cricket, field hockey, Formula One, ice hockey, rugby league, rugby union, team handball and volleyball are spectator sports, while hunting or underwater hockey typically are not. Spectator sports may be professional sports or amateur sports. They often are distinguished from participant sports, which are more recreational; golf and tennis can be either. Association football, also known as soccer, is by far the most watched sport on the planet.
Spectator sports require venues or sometimes stadiums in which the fans may observe a game or event. The largest such facility on earth is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and thus is host to the greatest spectacle in all of sports every year, the Indy 500, with a single day attendance at 400,000.
The increasing broadcasting of sports events, along with media reporting can affect the number of people attending sports due to the ability to experience the sport without the need to physically attend and sometimes an increasingly enhanced experience including highlights, replays, commentary, statistics and analysis. Some sports are particularly known as "armchair sports" or "lounge room sports" due to the quality of the broadcasting experience in comparison to the live experience.
Spectator sports have built their own set of culture and traditions including, in the United States, cheerleading and pre-game and half time entertainment such as fireworks, particularly for big games such as competition decider events and international tests. The passion of some sports fans also means that there are occasionally spectator incidents.
Notable spectator sports events where events regularly sell out well in advance and are broadcast to large audiences include the K-League, Nippon Professional Baseball, Korea Professional Baseball, J. League Division 1, FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, UEFA European Football Championship, Cricket World Cup, Commonwealth Games, The Ashes, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, Heineken Cup, Indian Premier League, Six Nations Championship, FA Cup, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Fußball-Bundesliga, Australian Football League, State of Origin series, Super League, Rugby League Challenge Cup, Grand Slam tennis, World Series Baseball, Rugby World Cup, Kentucky Derby, Melbourne Cup, PGA Tour, National Rugby League, All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, Wimbledon, Formula One, and NASCAR.
The North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM) devotes much of their annual conference to research addressing the psychology behind a desire to view spectator sports, and how it might be leveraged to increase demand. Much of the research focuses on exploiting a need for vicarious achievement, and a desire within the spectator to project a public image through a declaration of team allegiance.
Separation of the active and the passive, the line between sport and spectator, gives rise to the paradox of the spectator—described by French philosopher Jacques Rancière; which is to seek an opportunity to passively contemplate engaging in an activity, and in doing so, forfeit that life moment one might have used to actually engage in the activity.

Sterling banknotes are the banknotes in circulation in the British Islands (encompassing the United Kingdom and the British Crown dependencies), denominated in pounds sterling (symbol: £; ISO 4217 currency code GBP). One pound is equivalent to 100 pence.
The pound is the official currency of the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies of Britain. Three British Overseas Territories also have currencies called pounds which are at par with the pound sterling.
In most countries of the world the issue of banknotes is handled exclusively by a single central bank or government, but in the United Kingdom seven retail banks have the right to print their own banknotes in addition to the Bank of England; sterling banknote issue is thus not automatically tied in with one national identity or the activity of the state. The arrangements in the UK are unusual, but comparable systems are used in Hong Kong and Macao, where three and two banks respectively issue their own banknotes in addition to their respective governments.
The Bank of England does act as a central bank in that it has a monopoly on issuing banknotes in England and Wales, and regulates the issues of banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Pounds issued by Crown Dependencies and other areas are regulated only by local governments and not the Bank of England.

Touch football is a variant of American football in which the basic rules are similar to those of the mainstream game (called "tackle football" for contrast), but instead of tackling players to the ground, the person carrying the ball need only be touched by a member of the opposite team to end a down. The game is usually played by amateurs on a recreational basis. 
Major variants of touch football include one-hand or two-hand touch, each of which dictates the number of hands a defensive player must touch the ball carrier with in order to end a down.

[[Series and parallel circuits]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic circuits

Components of an electrical circuit or electronic circuit can be connected in many different ways.  The two simplest of these are called series and parallel and occur very frequently.  Components connected in series are connected along a single path, so the same current flows through all of the components.Resnick et al. (1966), Chapter 32, Example 1.Smith, R.J. (1966),  page 21  Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component.Resnick et al. (1966), Chapter 32, Example 4.
A circuit composed solely of components connected in series is known as a series circuit; likewise, one connected completely in parallel is known as a parallel circuit.
In a series circuit, the current through each of the components is the same, and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the voltages across each component.  In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component.
As an example, consider a very simple circuit consisting of four light bulbs and one 6 V battery. If a wire joins the battery to one bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, then back to the battery, in one continuous loop, the bulbs are said to be in series. If each bulb is wired to the battery in a separate loop, the bulbs are said to be in parallel. If the four light bulbs are connected in series, there is same current through all of them, and the voltage drop is 1.5 V across each bulb, which may not be sufficient to make them glow.  If the light bulbs are connected in parallel, the currents through the light bulbs combine to form the current in the battery, while the voltage drop is 6.0 V across each bulb and they all glow.
In a series circuit, every device must function for the circuit to be complete.  One bulb burning out in a series circuit breaks the circuit.  In parallel circuits, each light has its own circuit, so all but one light could be burned out, and the last one will still function.

Tolpuddle [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|p|ʌ|d|əl[/tpl] is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It is situated in the Piddle valley [tpl]convert|8|mi|km[/tpl] east of Dorchester, the county town, and [tpl]convert|12|mi|km[/tpl] west of Poole.  The village has a population of 331 (2001).
The village is famous as the home of the Tolpuddle Martyrs who were sentenced to transported to Australia after they formed a trade union in 1833.  A row of cottages, housing agricultural workers and a museum, and a row of seated statues commemorate the martyrs.  The annual Tolpuddle Martyrs festival is held in the village in the third weekend of July.
Tolpuddle used to have a petrol station, village shop and post office, but these have closed. It has a public house, The Martyrs Inn, which is owned by nearby Athelhampton House, a tudor house open to the public approximately [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] to the west.

[[All-star game]]

CATEGORIES: All-star games

An all-star game is an exhibition game that purports to showcase the best players (the "stars") of a sports league. The exhibition is between two teams organized solely for the event, usually representing the league's teams based on region or division, but sometimes dividing the players by an attribute such as nationality.  Selection of the players may be done by a vote of the coaches and/or news media; in professional leagues, fans may vote on some or all of the roster.  An all-star game usually occurs at the midpoint of the regular season.  An exception is American football's Pro Bowl, which occurs at the end of the season.
All-star games are organized like regular games, but are often played with less emphasis on victory. Competing goals are to give many players time in the game and to avoid injury. In hockey, for example, there is no serious checking, while in football no blitzing is allowed. In basketball, there is virtually no defense played until the final quarter. However, the Australian State of Origin series does involve physicality that often leads to on-field scuffles.
The term "all-star" is mainly used in North America. All-star games are rare in international sports (such as association football) where games between national teams are more popular than all-star games would be. In the United Kingdom, all-star teams are usually denoted with the Roman numeral corresponding to the number of players allowed on the field - for example, a soccer or cricket XI, a rugby league XIII and a rugby union XV.
Major League Baseball organized the first professional league all-star game as part of the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago. It was the brainchild of Arch Ward, then sports editor for The Chicago Tribune."All-Star Game History", Baseball Almanac. Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in playing the game annually.  Ward's contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the "Arch Ward Trophy," given to the All-Star Game's most valuable player each year.Newman, Mark.

The Major League Baseball All-Star Game, also known as the "Midsummer Classic", is an annual baseball game between players from the National League and the American League, currently selected by fans for starting fielders, managers for pitchers, and managers and players for reserves.
The game usually occurs on either the second or third Tuesday in July and marks a symbolic halfway-point in the Major League Baseball (MLB) season (though not the mathematical halfway-point which, for most seasons, is usually found within the previous calendar week). Both leagues have a common All-Star break, with no regular-season games scheduled on the day before or the day after the day of the All-Star Game itself. For a brief period in MLB history, two such games had been held during each of the four seasons 1959 through 1962, but this format was subsequently abandoned.

[[Confirmation holism]]
CATEGORIES: Epistemology of science, Metatheory of science, Holism, Willard Van Orman Quine

In the epistemology of science, confirmation holism, also called epistemological holism, involves the problem of credit assignment, i.e. determining which aspect of the overall network of knowledge needs to be credited with the support earned by a piece of evidence.
It is attributed to Willard van Orman Quine who motivated his holism through extending Pierre Duhem's problem of underdetermination in physical theory to all knowledge claims.,W. v. O. Quine. 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism.' The Philosophical Review, 60 (1951), pp. 20–43. online textDuhem, Pierre. The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory. Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 1954. Duhem's idea was, roughly, that no theory of any type can be tested in isolation but only when embedded in a background of other hypotheses, e.g. hypotheses about initial conditions. Quine thought that this background involved not only such hypotheses but also our whole web-of-belief, which, among other things, includes our mathematical and logical theories and our scientific theories. This last claim is sometimes known as the Duhem-Quine thesis.Curd, M. and Cover, J.A. (Eds.) (1998). Philosophy of Science, Section 3, The Duhem-Quine Thesis and Underdetermination, W.W. Norton & Company. A related claim made by Quine, though contested by some (see Adolf Grünbaum 1962),Grünbaum, A. 1962. 'The falsiability of theories: total or partial? A contemporary evaluation of the Duhem-Quine thesis', Synthese, vol. 14:17-34. online text is that one can always protect one's theory against refutation by attributing failure to some other part of our web-of-belief. In his own words, "Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system.".W. v. O. Quine. 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism.'

CATEGORIES: Symptoms and signs: Cognition, perception, emotional state and behaviour, Mood disorders, Depression (psychology)

In psychology and psychiatry, anhedonia ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|h|i|ˈ|d|oʊ|n|i|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|AN|hee|DOH|nee-ə[/tpl]; Greek: ἀν- an-, "without" and ἡδονή hēdonē, "pleasure") is defined as the inability to experience pleasure from activities usually found enjoyable, e.g. exercise, hobbies, music, sexual activities or social interactions. While earlier definitions of anhedonia emphasized pleasurable experience, more recent models have highlighted the need to consider different aspects of enjoyable behavior, such as motivation or desire to engage in an activity ("motivational anhedonia"), as compared to the level of enjoyment of the activity itself ("consummatory anhedonia").Treadway MT, Zald DH (2011) Reconsidering anhedonia in depression: lessons from translational neuroscience. Neurosci Biobehav Rev 35:537-555.
According to William James the term was coined by Théodule-Armand Ribot.  One can distinguish many kinds of pathological depression. Sometimes it is mere passive joylessness and dreariness, discouragement, dejection, lack of taste and zest and spring. Professor Ribot has proposed the name anhedonia to designate this condition. "The state of anhedonia, if I may coin a new word to pair off with analgesia," he writes, "has been very little studied, but it exists."Varieties of Religious Experience Lecture VI, The Sick Soul, William James 1902 
Anhedonia can be a characteristic of mental disorders including mood disorders, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder and schizophrenia. For example, people affected with schizophrenia often describe themselves as feeling emotionally empty.Hales R., Yudofsky S., Talbott J. 1999. Textbook of Psychiatry 3rd ed.

[[Instrumentalism]]
CATEGORIES: Philosophy of science, Theories of mind, Pragmatism, Metatheory of science, Epistemology of science

In the philosophy of science, instrumentalism is the view that a scientific theory is a useful instrument in understanding the world.  A concept or theory should be evaluated by how effectively it explains and predicts phenomena, as opposed to how accurately it describes objective reality.
Instrumentalism avoids the debate between anti-realism and philosophical or scientific realism. It may be better characterized as non-realism.  Instrumentalism shifts the basis of evaluation away from whether or not phenomena observed actually exist, and towards an analysis of whether the results and evaluation fit with observed phenomena.

CATEGORIES: Metatheory of science, Metaphysical theories, Metaphysics of science, Philosophical realism

Scientific realism is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be.  Within philosophy of science, it is often framed as an answer to the question "how is the success of science to be explained?" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make valid claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as observables, as opposed to instrumentalism.

[[Surgical stainless steel]]

CATEGORIES: Steels, Surgical instruments

Surgical stainless steel is an informal term which refers to certain grades of stainless steel that are used in biomedical applications.  The most common "surgical steels" are austenitic 316 stainless and martensitic 440 and 420 stainless steels.  There is no formal definition on what constitutes a "surgical stainless steel", so product manufacturers and distributors may apply the term to refer to any grade of corrosion resistant steel.
316 stainless steel, also referred to as "Marine Grade Stainless Steel", is a chromium, nickel, molybdenum alloy of steel that exhibits relatively good strength and corrosion resistance.  Along with the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V, 316 stainless is a common choice of material for biomedical implants.  Although Ti6Al4V provides greater strength per weight and corrosion resistance, 316 stainless components can be more economical to produce.  However, immune system reaction to nickel is a potential complication of 316.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=P. |last2=Schuh |first2=A. |last3=Ring |first3=J. |last4=Thomsen |first4=M. |title=Orthopädisch-chirurgische Implantate und Allergien |trans_title=Orthopedic surgical implants and allergies |language=German |journal=Der Orthopäde |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=75–88 |year=2007 |pmid=18210082 |doi=10.1007/s00132-007-1183-3[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=P. |last2=Thomsen |first2=M. |title=Implantatallergien |trans_title=Implant allergies |language=German |journal=Der Hautarzt |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=255–62; quiz 263–4 |year=2010 |pmid=20204719 |doi=10.1007/s00105-009-1907-x[/tpl]

440 and 420 stainless steels, known also by the name "Cutlery Stainless Steel", are high carbon steels alloyed with chromium.  They have very good corrosion resistance compared to other cutlery steels, but their corrosion resistance is inferior to 316 stainless.  Biomedical cutting instruments are often made from 440 or 420 stainless due to its high hardness coupled with acceptable corrosion resistance.

[[Gumbel distribution]]
CATEGORIES: Continuous distributions, Extreme value data, Probability distributions

In probability theory and statistics, the Gumbel distribution is used to model the distribution of the maximum (or the minimum) of a number of samples of various distributions.
Such a distribution might be used to represent the distribution of the maximum level of a river in a particular year if there was a list of maximum values for the past ten years. It is useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake, flood or other natural disaster will occur.
The potential applicability of the Gumbel distribution to represent the distribution of maxima relates to extreme value theory which indicates that it is likely to be useful if the distribution of the underlying sample data is of the normal or exponential type.
The Gumbel distribution is a particular case of the generalized extreme value distribution (also known as the Fisher-Tippett distribution). It is also known as the log-Weibull distribution and the double exponential distribution (a term that is alternatively sometimes used to refer to the Laplace distribution). It is related to the  Gompertz distribution[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]: when its density is first reflected about the origin and then restricted to the positive half line, a Gompertz function is obtained.
In the latent variable formulation of the multinomial logit model — common in discrete choice theory — the errors of the latent variables follow a Gumbel distribution.  This is useful because the difference of two Gumbel-distributed random variables has a logistic distribution.
The Gumbel distribution is named after Emil Julius Gumbel (1891–1966), based on his original papers describing the distribution.Gumbel E.J. (1941). The return period of ﬂood ﬂows. The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 12, 163–190

[[Washington Bullets (song)]]

CATEGORIES: 1980 songs, Anti-war songs, The Clash songs, Reggae songs

"Washington Bullets" is a song from The Clash's 1980 album Sandinista!. A politically charged song, it is a simplified version of imperialist history from the 1959 Cuban Revolution to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas of the 1980s, with mention of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Soviet-Afghan War, the Dalai Lama, and Victor Jara, referencing his death at the hands of the Chilean military dictatorship in the stadium that now bears his name. Although a criticism of the foreign policy of the United States, the song's final stanza also delivers a harsh criticism of communist states by making reference to the treatment of pacifist Buddhist monks in the People's Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution and the USSR's Invasion of Afghanistan.
The song's title is often thought to have been a pun on the name of the American capital city's National Basketball Association franchise, which later went on to change its name to the Washington Wizards in 1997, but frontman Joe Strummer denied any knowledge of the basketball team previous to the song's release.Liner notes to The Clash on Broadway:
The song is one of The Clash's more experimental, in the reggae style, with a marimba and  lyrics that are almost spoken rather than sung. Though the marimba is the most prominent instrument, electric guitar riffs are still audible. The marimba part is an altered version of the melody from Turkey in the Straw.
On the tribute album The Clash Tribute: The Never Ending Story, the song was covered by Attila the Stockbroker, with new lyrics to the later verses, omitting the reference to Afghanistan and The Clash's subtle attack on communism. The new verses are critical of U.S. involvement in the end of the Soviet Union, and Boris Yeltsin's embrace of western-style capitalism, making particular disparaging references to the new world order following the end of the Cold War.

[[Martingale (betting system)]]
CATEGORIES: Betting systems, Roulette and wheel games, Gambling terminology

A martingale is any of a class of betting strategies that originated from and were popular in 18th century France. The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails.  The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake.  The martingale strategy has been applied to roulette as well, as the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%.
Since a gambler with infinite wealth will, almost surely, eventually flip heads, the martingale betting strategy was seen as a sure thing by those who advocated it.  Of course, none of the gamblers in fact possessed infinite wealth, and the exponential growth of the bets would eventually bankrupt "unlucky" gamblers who chose to use the martingale. It is therefore a good example of a Taleb distribution – the gambler usually wins a small net reward, thus appearing to have a sound strategy. However, the gambler's expected value does indeed remain zero (or less than zero) because the small probability that he will suffer a catastrophic loss exactly balances with his expected gain. (In a casino, the expected value is negative, due to the house's edge.) The likelihood of catastrophic loss may not even be very small. The bet size rises exponentially. This, combined with the fact that strings of consecutive losses actually occur more often than common intuition suggests, can bankrupt a gambler quickly. 
Casino betting limits eliminate use of the martingale strategy.

[[Bulletin board]]

CATEGORIES: Office equipment, Media technology, Academia

A bulletin board (pinboard, pin board, noticeboard, or notice board in British English) is a surface intended for the posting of public messages, for example, to advertise items wanted or for sale, announce events, or provide information. Bulletin boards are often made of a material such as cork to facilitate addition and removal of messages, or they can be placed on computer networks so people can leave and erase messages for other people to read and see. 
Bulletin boards are particularly prevalent at universities. They are used by many sports groups and extracurricular groups and anything from local shops to official notices. Dormitory corridors, well-trafficked hallways, lobbies, and freestanding kiosks often have cork boards attached to facilitate the posting of notices. At some universities, lampposts, bollards, trees, and walls often become impromptu posting sites in areas where official boards are sparse in number. 
Internet forums are becoming a global replacement for traditional bulletin boards. Online bulletin boards are sometimes referred to as message boards.  The terms bulletin board, message board and even Internet forum are interchangeable, although often one bulletin board or message board can contain a number of Internet forums or discussion groups. An online board can serve the same purpose as a physical bulletin board.
Magnet boards, or magnetic bulletin boards, are a popular substitute for cork boards because they lack the problem of board deterioration from the insertion and removal of pins over time.

Saint Alexander of Constantinople (born between 237 and 244) was bishop of Byzantium and the first Archbishop of Constantinople[tpl]harvnb|Smith|1911[/tpl] cites Theodoret Hist. i. 19 (the city was renamed during his episcopacy). Information from the Synaxarion mention that Alexander was originally from Calabria in Italy and his parents were George and Vryaine. From very young he was given to God and stayed in a Monastery, where he cultivated virtue and became a good labourer of God's commands. He was granted divine visions, while for twenty days he stayed completely fasting. But he also stayed naked for four years and fell into thousands of problems because of attacks of the Saracenes. In this way, he lived many years travelling around Greece with his pupils Vitalius and Nicephorus.
He was elected as a vicar to assist the aged bishop Saint Metrophanes of Constantinople.  As a result, both he and Metrophanes are both reported as being the first Bishop of Constantinople (both are also sometimes listed as first "Patriarch" of Constantinople, though the episcopal see had not yet been elevated to that rank).See Canon iii, First Council of Constantinople, 359 AD  Alexander served as bishop for about 23 years, until his death at 73 years of age, in 337.[tpl]harvnb|Smith|1911[/tpl] cites Socrates Scholasticus Hist. ii. 6; Sozomen Hist. iii. 3 At the time of Metrophanes' death, he left instructions in his will to elect his vicar to the throne of Constantinople.

Truevision TGA, often referred to as TARGA, is a raster graphics file format created by Truevision Inc. (now part of Avid Technology). It was the native format of TARGA and VISTA boards, which were the first graphic cards for IBM-compatible PCs to support Highcolor/truecolor display. This family of graphic cards was intended for  professional computer image synthesis and video editing with PCs; for this reason, usual resolutions of TGA image files match those of the NTSC and PAL video formats.
TARGA is an acronym for T'''ruevision '''A'''dvanced '''R'''aster '''G'''raphics '''A'''dapter''; '''TGA''' is an initialism for Truevision Graphics A'dapter.
TGA files commonly have the extension ".tga" on PC DOS/Windows systems and Mac OS X (older Macintosh systems use the "TPIC" type code). The format can store image data with 8, 15, 16, 24, or 32 bits of precision per pixel[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~martino/disciplinas/ea978/tgaffs.pdf | title = Truevision TGAª — FILE FORMAT SPECIFICATION — Version 2.0[/tpl] – the maximum 24 bits of RGB and an extra 8-bit alpha channel. Color data can be color-mapped, or in direct color or truecolor format.  Image data may be stored raw, or optionally, a lossless RLE compression similar to PackBits can be employed. This type of compression performs poorly for typical photographic images, but works acceptably well for simpler images, such as icons, cartoons and line drawings.

[[Citizen's arrest]]

CATEGORIES: Criminal law, Criminal procedure, Legal terms

A citizen's arrest is an arrest made by a person who is not acting as a sworn law-enforcement official.[tpl]cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=va&vol=1022703&invol=1 |title=HUDSON v. COMMONWEALTH, Record No. 022703., September 12, 2003 - VA Supreme Court - FindLaw |publisher=FindLaw |year= 2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl] In common law jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval England and the English common law, in which sheriffs encouraged ordinary citizens to help apprehend law breakers.
Despite the practice's name, in most countries, the arresting person is usually designated as a person with arrest powers, who need not be a citizen of the country in which he or she is acting. For example, in the British jurisdiction of England and Wales, the power comes from section 24A(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A |title=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 |publisher=The National Archives, UK |date=16 Aug 2011 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl] called "any person arrest". This legislation states "any person" has these powers, and does not state that they need to be a British Citizen.

[[Bathing machine]]

CATEGORIES: Swimming, Victorian era

The bathing machine was a device, popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, to allow people to change out of their usual clothes, possibly change into swimwear and then wade in the ocean at beaches. Bathing machines were roofed and walled wooden carts rolled into the sea. Some had solid wooden walls; others had canvas walls over a wooden frame.
The bathing machine was part of etiquette for sea-bathing more rigorously enforced upon women than men but to be observed by both sexes among those who wished to be proper.Byrde, Penelope. "That Frightful Unbecoming Dress: Clothes for Spa Bathing at Bath, Costume, No 21, 1987
Especially in Britain, men and women were usually segregated, so nobody of the opposite sex might catch sight of them in their bathing suits, which (although extremely modest by modern standards) were not considered proper clothing in which to be seen.

It was founded in 1989 by Jeff Yang, Amy Chu, Sandi Kim and Bill Yao to cover Asian American issues and culture, and grew out of a campus magazine Yang edited while an undergraduate at Harvard University.
The magazine operated for 12 years. On its tenth year, the magazine made a profit for the firs time. During that year it reached its circulation high of 200,000. When the economy declined in 2001, the magazine declined.
Until it ceased on February 20, 2002, it was the largest publication for English-speaking Asian Americans in the United States, with bimonthly readership exceeding 200,000 in North America.
Though well known and influential in the Asian American community, it was never profitable in its 13 year existence.
In November 1999, it obtained US $4.5 million in venture capital funding, and the company was renamed aMedia, reflecting a branching out into Web publishing. Unfortunately, this change came right as the dot-com boom was turning to bust.

[[Silky-flycatcher]]
CATEGORIES: Ptilogonatidae, Bird families

The silky-flycatchers are a small family, Ptilogonatidae, of passerine birds. The family contains only four species in three genera. They were formerly lumped with waxwings and Hypocolius in the family Bombycillidae, and they are listed in that family by the Sibley-Monroe checklist. The family is named for their silky plumage and their aerial flycatching techniques, although they are unrelated to the Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae) and the tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae).[tpl]Citation | first = Miyoko | last = Chu | editor-first = Josep | editor-last = del Hoyo | editor2-first = Andrew | editor2-last = Elliott | editor3-first = David | editor3-last = Christie | contribution = Family Ptilogonatidae (Silky-flyctachers) | title = Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 10, Cuckoo-shrikes to Thrushes | year = 2005 | pages = 292–304| place = Barcelona | publisher = Lynx Edicions | isbn = 84-87334-72-5 [/tpl]
They occur mainly in Central America from Panama to Mexico, with one species, the Phainopepla, extending northwards into the southwestern US. Most do not engage in long-distance migration (instead wandering widely in search of fruit), but the Phainopepla is migratory over the northern part of its range.
They are related to waxwings, and like that group have a soft silky plumage, usually gray or pale yellow in color. All species, with the exception of the Black-and-yellow Phainoptila, have small crests. They range in size from 18–25 cm in length and are mostly slender birds (with the exception again of the Black-and-yellow Phainoptila). All the species in this family are sexually dimorphic both in plumage color and in having a longer tail. Juveniles birds of both sexes are colored like the female.
These birds eat fruit or insects. The Phainopepla is particularly dependent on Desert Mistletoe, Phoradendron californicum.
They are birds of various types of woodland (semi-desert with trees for the Phainopepla), and they nest in trees.

[[Screen test]]

CATEGORIES: Acting, Performing arts

A screen test is a method of determining the suitability of an actor or actress for performing on film or in a particular role. The performer is generally given a scene, or selected lines and actions, and instructed to perform in front of a camera to see if they are suitable. The developed film is later evaluated by the relevant production personnel such as the casting director and the director. The actor may be asked to bring a prepared monologue or alternatively, the actor may be given a script to read at sight ("cold reading"). In some cases, the actor may be asked to read a scene, in which another performer reads the lines of another character.

Perry Farrell (born Perry Bernstein; March 29, 1959) is an American musician, best known as the frontman for the alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Farrell created the touring festival Lollapalooza as a farewell tour for Jane's Addiction in 1991; it has since evolved into an annual destination festival. Farrell continues to produce Lollapalooza with partners William Morris Agency and C3. Farrell has led the alternative rock groups Porno for Pyros and Satellite Party. He is the only person who has performed at all twelve Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festivals to date, having appeared under five different names (Perry Farrell, Jane's Addiction, DJ Peretz, Satellite Party, and with Hybrid). DJ Peretz and The Chemical Brothers are the only names to have appeared on the festival's lineup card more than four times.
Born as Perry Bernstein in Queens, New York, he spent his grade-school years in Woodmere, Long Island, and moved to Miami, Florida with his family during his teens.Mullen, Brendan. Google Books, Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane's Addiction. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2005. ISBN 0-306-81347-5 His father was a jeweler; his mother was an artist who committed suicide when Farrell was three, an event later noted in the Jane's Addiction songs "Then She Did" and "Twisted Tales." According to a Howard Stern interview on 3 June 1997, Farrell believes aliens visit him and he accepts the knowledge and spirituality they bring.
His early musical influences included The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Sly & The Family Stone and James Brown. Soon after, he discovered David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. Following graduation from high school, Farrell moved to California in the early 1980s to live as a surfer, lived in his car and made money working construction and waiting tables.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/my-life-music-perry-farrell|title=My Life in Music: Perry Farrell|publisher=Spin.com|accessdate=2013-07-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://kevchino.com/band/perry-farrell/1149 |title=Perry Farrell|publisher= Kevchino.com|accessdate=2013-07-13[/tpl] Farrell has been sighted at premier surfing destinations throughout the world, most notably Bali, in 2001.
In 2002, Farrell married Etty Lau Farrell, a professional dancer who has performed in all the Jane's Addiction shows since the 1997 Relapse tour.  The couple now have two sons together, Hezron Wolfgang and Izzadore Bravo. In a video interview with Blender Online, Farrell says of his wife, "Etty and I have been working together since 1997. The very first time I saw her come in and shake her... ponytail, I hired her and I fell in love with her on the spot. We travel together and we have a collective memory. So in another words, I don't remember anything and she just reminds me of everything. So we share this memory bank. And it ain't a bad thing waking up with a hot chick in your bed every day."

[[Resonance (chemistry)]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical bonding

In chemistry, resonance or mesomerism IUPAC Gold Book mesomerism PDF is a way of describing delocalized electrons within certain molecules or polyatomic ions where the bonding cannot be expressed by one single Lewis formula. A molecule or ion with such delocalized electrons is represented by several contributing structures IUPAC Gold Book resonance PDF (also called resonance structures  or canonical forms).
Each contributing structure can be represented by a Lewis structure, with only an integer number of covalent bonds between each pair of atoms within the structure.IUPAC Gold Book contributing structure PDF  Several Lewis structures are used collectively to describe the actual molecular structure.  However these individual contributors cannot be observed in the actual resonance-stabilized molecule; the molecule does not oscillate back and forth between the contributing structures, as might be assumed from the word "resonance".   The actual structure is an approximate intermediate between the canonical forms, but its overall energy is lower than each of the contributors. This intermediate form between different contributing structures is called a resonance hybrid.
Contributing structures differ only in the position of electrons, not in the position of nuclei.
Resonance is a key component of valence bond theory.
Electron delocalization lowers the potential energy of the substance and thus makes it more stable than any of the contributing structures. The difference between the potential energy of the actual structure and that of the contributing structure with the lowest potential energy is called the resonance energyIUPAC Gold Book resonance energy PDF or delocalization energy.
Resonance is distinguished from tautomerism and conformational isomerism, which involve the formation of isomers, thus the rearrangement of the nuclear positions.

The Rottweiler was employed in its traditional roles until the mid-19th century when railways replaced droving for herding livestock to market. While still used in herding, Rottweilers are now used as search and rescue dogs, as guide dogs for the blind, as guard dogs or police dogs, and in other roles.Adolf Pienkoss, The Rottweiler, 3rd ed., Borken, Germany: Internationale Föderation der Rottweilerfreunde, 2008.

[[Hermit]]
CATEGORIES: Hermits, Asceticism, Religious occupations, Types of saints

A hermit (adjectival form: eremitic or  hermitic) is a person who lives, to some degree, in seclusion from society.New York Times In Christianity, the term was originally applied to a Christian who lives the eremitic life out of a religious conviction, namely the Desert Theology of the Old Testament (i.e., the forty years wandering in the desert[tpl]bibleverse||Numbers|13:3|[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Numbers|13:26|[/tpl] that was meant to bring about a change of heart).
In the Christian tradition the heremitic lifeMarina Miladinov, Margins of Solitude: Eremitism in Central Europe between East and West (Zaghreb: Leykam International, 2008) is an early form of monastic living that preceded the monastic life in the cenobium. The Rule of St Benedict (ch. 1) lists hermits among four kinds of monks. In the Roman Catholic Church, in addition to hermits who are members of religious institutes, contemporary Roman Catholic Church law (canon 603) recognizes also consecrated hermits under the direction of their diocesan bishop as members of the Consecrated Life ("consecrated diocesan hermits"). The same is true in many parts of the Anglican Communion, including the Episcopal Church in the US, although in the canon law of the Episcopal Church they are referred to as "solitaries" rather than "hermits".
Often, both in religious and secular literature, the term "hermit" is also used loosely for any Christian living a secluded prayer-focused life, and sometimes interchangeably with anchorite/anchoress, recluse and "solitary". Other religions, for example, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, (Sufism) and Taoism, also have hermits in the sense of individuals living an ascetic form of life.
In modern colloquial usage, "hermit" denotes anyone living apart from the rest of society, or simply participating in fewer social events, for any reason.

The perpetrators were Chrysler plant superintendent Ronald Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz. The lenient sentencing of these two men in a plea bargain generated public outrage over the murder attack, which included blows to the head from a baseball bat and possessed attributes consistent with hate crimes. Many of the layoffs in Detroit's auto industry, including Nitz's in 1979, had been due to the increasing market share of Japanese automakers, leading to allegations that Vincent Chin received racially charged comments attributing to the layoffs while being beaten.
The case became a rallying point for the Asian American community, and Ebens and Nitz were put on trial for violating Chin's civil rights. Because the subsequent Federal prosecution was a result of public pressure from a coalition of many Asian ethnic organizations, Vincent Chin's murder is often considered the beginning of a pan-ethnic Asian American movement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/061397/feature.html |author=Alethea Yip|publisher=Asian Week |title=Remembering Vincent Chin |accessdate=2007-03-14[/tpl]

Metro Vancouver is the name of a political body and corporate entity designated by provincial legislation as one of the regional districts in British Columbia, Canada.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/publications/Publications/ActionPlan2013.pdf | title=2013 Action Plan | date=January 2013 | author=Metro Vancouver | accessdate=January 30, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=47d814e0-3cf9-4577-bc14-d6b8518fc30b&k=15838 | title=Goodbye GVRD, hello Metro Vancouver | date=August 2, 2007 | publisher=Vancouver Sun | accessdate=March 1, 2012[/tpl] The organization was formerly known as the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD), and that name is still the official name and remains in common colloquial use, especially in the abbreviated form. Metro Vancouver is under the direction of 24 local authorities; it delivers regional services, sets policy and acts as a political forum. The region's most populous city is Vancouver, but Metro Vancouver's administrative offices are located in the City of Burnaby.
The term "Metro Vancouver" can also be used to refer to the geographic territory approximately equivalent to the territory under the authority of the organization Metro Vancouver. This term is used increasingly in favour over the colloquial term "Greater Vancouver". Both terms generally imply reference only to the urban and suburban areas of the region -  wilderness and outlying rural regions within the regional district are generally excluded. Statistics Canada defines the Vancouver CMA (census metropolitan area) as having perfectly coterminal boundaries with the Metro Vancouver regional district.
Other political geographic regions parallel to the regional district are the Lower Mainland region of the Ministry of Environment, the Chilliwack Forest District, the New Westminster Land District, and the Fraser Health Authority. Schools are not subject to local or regional district governance and are administered via the school districts system.

Atom Heart Mother is the fifth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd.  It was released by Harvest and EMI Records 2 October 1970 in the UK, and by Harvest and Capitol on 10 October 1970 in the US.[tpl]cite book |last=Povey |first=Glenn |title=Echoes : The Complete History of Pink Floyd |year=2006 |publisher=Mind Head Publishing |isbn=978-0-9554624-0-5 |edition=New |page=137 |accessdate=5 September 2012|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qnnl3FnO-B4C&pg=RA1-PA1986&lpg=RA1-PA1986&dq=atom+heart+mother&source=bl&ots=HdZPGvF9h8&sig=wRo9qs9Gqa-qq2wVMEn8ydDFV3M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TVZHULbhBurG0QWgz4C4Dw&ved=0CDkQuwUwAQ#v=onepage&q=atom%20heart%20mother&f=false[/tpl] It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, England, and was the band's first album to reach number 1 in the UK,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/pink%20floyd/|title=Pink Floyd – UK Chart History|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl] while it reached number 55 in the US chart,[tpl]cite web |author=Pink Floyd |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/pink-floyd-mn0000346336/awards |title=Pink Floyd – Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=4 September 2012[/tpl] eventually going gold there.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aA4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=%22atom+heart+mother%22+gold+certification&source=bl&ots=vKAVcgk23R&sig=ZkjR-dc20rZOEZLCWn0d5tzTVb8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k3tIUMHLDsTX0QXtzYHYBg&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22atom%20heart%20mother%22%20gold%20certification&f=false |title=Record Research (advertisement) |publisher=Billboard magazine |date=15 March 1997 |accessdate=6 September 2012[/tpl] A remastered CD was released in 1994 in the UK and the United States, and again in 2011. Ron Geesin, who had already influenced and collaborated with Roger Waters, made a notable contribution to the album and received a then-rare outside songwriting credit.
This was the first Pink Floyd album to be specially mixed for four-channel quadraphonic sound as well as conventional two-channel stereo. The SQ quadraphonic mix was released on LP in a matrix format compatible with standard stereo record players. There was also a release of the quadraphonic version in the UK in fully discrete four-channel form on the "Quad-8" format, a four-channel variant of the stereo 8-track tape cartridge.
The cover was, like earlier albums, designed by Hipgnosis, and was significant in that it was the first one to not feature the band's name on the cover, or contain any photographs of the band anywhere. This was a trend that would continue on subsequent covers throughout the 1970s and beyond.
Although it was commercially and critically successful on release, the band, particularly Waters and David Gilmour, have expressed several negative opinions of the album in more recent years.  Nevertheless, it remained popular enough for Gilmour to perform the title track with Geesin in 2008.

Willem Frederik "Wim" Slijkhuis (13 January 1923 – 28 June 2003) was a Dutch athlete. During his career that lasted from 1939 to 1954 he was a world’s top middle distance runner, excelling in distances from 1500 to 5000 metres.
Slijkhuis began his international sports career shortly after World War II, having  competed nationally since 1939. In 1946, he won a silver medal in the 5000 m at the European Championships in Oslo.Wim Slijkhuis. sports-reference.com
Two years later he took part in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and was a favourite to win a medal. In the 5000 m he finished third, behind Belgian Gaston Reiff and the legendary Emil Zátopek; nevertheless Slijkhuis was not satisfied. In the 1500 m, his second event, he could have done better, but started his final sprint to the finish line too late to catch the two leading Swedes, who finished narrowly ahead of him. In spite of this, realising 3:50.4 he equalled his own Dutch record, set two years earlier. Slijkhuis' achievements were overshadowed, however, by the performances of compatriot Fanny Blankers-Koen, who won four gold medals at the same Olympics.
In 1950, Slijkhuis did win a major title: the 1500 m at the European championships held in Brussels, with a time of 3:47.2. His personal best at this distance had already been improved to 3:43.8, realised one year earlier in Antwerp and only 0.8 s away from the existing world record at the time.
During his career Willem Slijkhuis didn’t just run almost everywhere in Europe, but also in New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. He was the first Dutchman who competed in the US Indoor circuit and the first non-American, who ever succeeded in obtaining the US title over one mile.
Owing to his stubborn behaviour Slijkhuis sometimes clashed with officials of the Dutch Athletics Federation, who he accused of outrageous interference. On the track however he impressed experts and public with his smooth, steady running style. Especially the English were delighted about his beautiful running style, which they lyrically described as "The Poetry of motion".
His second Olympic participation in the 1952 Summer Olympics ended without any successes. Slijkhuis, who won eleven national titles – including eight in the men's 5000 metres – on track, seven in Cross country running and set thirty Dutch records, ended his career in 1954 due to injuries. He died on 28 June 2003 in Badhoevedorp.

Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald (July 24, 1900 – March 10, 1948), born Zelda Sayre in Montgomery, Alabama, was an American novelist and the wife of writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was an icon of the 1920s—dubbed by her husband "the first American Flapper." After the success of his first novel, This Side of Paradise (1920), the Fitzgeralds became celebrities.
From early adolescence Zelda was a formidable presence in Southern society, outshining all other belles as the star in ballet recitals and elite country club events. Shortly after finishing high school, she met F. Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance, but was unimpressed and agreed with her family on his limited financial prospects to provide for a family. With his professed infatuation, a light flirtation evolved into a lengthy long distance courtship of weekly letters, with Fitzgerald aware of her uncommitted dating of other men. Determined to obtain financial security, and thus Zelda, Fitzgerald increased his writing from articles to his first book.  On March 20, 1920, Scribner's Sons agreed to publish his novel This Side of Paradise and Fitzgerald immediately cabled Zelda, who agreed to travel to New York to marry and live with him. The couple wed in New York on April 3, 1920, and later moved to Europe. While Scott received acclaim for The Great Gatsby and his short stories, and the couple socialized with literary luminaries like Ernest Hemingway, their marriage was a tangle of jealousy, resentment and acrimony. Scott used their relationship as material in his novels, even lifting snippets from Zelda's diary and assigning them to his fictional heroines. Seeking an artistic identity of her own, Zelda wrote magazine articles and short stories, and at 27 became obsessed with a career as a ballerina, practicing to exhaustion.
The strain of her tempestuous marriage, Scott's increasing alcoholism, and her growing instability presaged Zelda's admittance in 1930 to the Sheppard Pratt sanatorium in Towson, Maryland, where she was diagnosed with schizophrenia (though, according to scholars, she was more likely to have had bipolar disorder).Boston Globe May 5, 2013 "'Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald' and 'Beautiful Fools'" book review by Julia M. Klein http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/05/04/review-novel-zelda-fitzgerald-therese-anne-fowlery-and-beautiful-fools-clifton-spargo/NBTHpPNOmRPZwhfjlG4n3O/story.html While there, she wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, Save Me the Waltz, which was published in 1932. Scott was furious that she had used material from their life together, though he would go on to do the same, as in Tender Is the Night, published in 1934; the two novels provide contrasting portrayals of the couple's failing marriage.
Back in America, Scott went to Hollywood where he tried screenwriting and began a relationship with the movie columnist Sheilah Graham. In 1936, Zelda entered the Highland Mental Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina. Scott died in Hollywood in 1940, having last seen Zelda a year and a half earlier. She spent her remaining years working on a second novel, which she never completed, and she painted extensively. In 1948 she died when the hospital in which she was residing caught fire. Interest in the Fitzgeralds resurged shortly after her death: the couple has been the subject of popular books, movies and scholarly attention. After a life as an emblem of the Jazz Age, Roaring Twenties, and Lost Generation, Zelda Fitzgerald posthumously found a new role: after a popular 1970 biography portrayed her as a victim of an overbearing husband, she became a feminist icon.  She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1992.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.awhf.org/inductee.html |title=Inductees |work=Alabama Women's Hall of Fame |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=February 20, 2012[/tpl]

[[Image:Marstrand City Arms.png|right|thumb|100px|Arms; incorporated with Kungälv Municipality 
in 1971]]
Marstrand is a seaside locality situated in Kungälv Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 1,319 inhabitants in 2010. It has held city privileges since 1200. The most striking feature about Marstrand is the 17th-century fortress Carlsten, named after King Carl X Gustav of Sweden. The town got its name from its location on the island Marstrandsön. Recently the town has expanded to the neighbouring island Koön, which has bridge access to the mainland.
During the last quarter of the 18th century Marstrand had the free port status, granted by the King Gustav III. Marstrand is a popular sailing resort in summer time. It is also the venue of the annual Match Cup Sweden, a match race sailing competition.
Administratively Marstrand and its immediately surrounding islands constituted a city municipality of its own up until the local government reform in 1971, when it was merged into Kungälv Municipality.
Marstrand is, despite its small population, for historical reasons often still referred to as a city. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities.

He was the preeminent expert on F. Scott Fitzgerald. He also wrote about writers such as Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe and John O'Hara, and was editor of the Dictionary of Literary Biography.
Bruccoli's interest in Fitzgerald began in 1947 when he heard a radio broadcast of Fitzgerald's short story "The Diamond as Big as the Ritz".Caroline Lord, "Interview with Matthew Bruccoli", Short Story, Fall 2006.  Retrieved on June 5, 2008. That week he tracked down a copy of The Great Gatsby, "and I have been reading it ever since," he told interviewers.
Bruccoli graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1949, and studied at Cornell University where one of his professors was Vladimir Nabokov[tpl]cite news|last=Williams|first=Richard|title=Matthew Bruccoli|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/aug/07/usa|accessdate=May 10, 2012|newspaper=theguardian|date=August 6, 2008[/tpl]  and at Yale University where he was a founder member of the fledgling Manuscript Society, graduating in 1953. He was awarded a master's degree and doctorate from the University of Virginia in 1960. Bruccoli, who also taught at the University of Virginia and the Ohio State University, spent nearly four decades teaching at the University of South Carolina. He lived in Columbia, South Carolina, where, according to his New York Times obituary, he "cut a dash on campus, instantly recognizable by his vintage red Mercedes convertible, Brooks Brothers suits, Groucho mustache and bristling crew cut that dated to his Yale days. His untamed Bronx accent also set him apart" (Grimes). 
Over the course of his career, he authored over 50 books on F. Scott Fitzgerald and other literary figures. His 1981 biography of Fitzgerald, Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald, is considered the standard Fitzgerald biography. He has edited many of Fitzgerald's works, from This Side of Paradise to Fitzgerald's unfinished final novel, The Love of the Last Tycoon. Bruccoli has also edited Scott's wife Zelda Fitzgerald's only novel Save Me the Waltz.
While studying Fitzgerald, Bruccoli and his wife Arlyn began to collect all manner of Fitzgerald memorabilia. Bruccoli owned the artist's copy of Celestial Eyes, the cover art by Francis Cugat which appeared on the first edition, and most modern editions, of The Great Gatsby. In 1969, Bruccoli befriended F. Scott and Zelda's daughter Frances "Scottie" Fitzgerald. In 1976, Bruccoli and the Fitzgeralds' daughter Scottie (as Scottie Fitzgerald Smith) published The Romantic Egoists, from the scrapbooks that F. Scott and Zelda had maintained throughout their lives of photographs and book reviews. Later in life Bruccoli and his wife donated their collection to the Thomas Cooper Library at USC. The collection is valued at nearly $2 million.
Bruccoli was general editor of the "Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography," published by the University of Pittsburgh Press. As part of this series, he produced F. Scott Fitzgerald: A Descriptive Bibliography and, with Richard Layman, Ring W. Lardner: A Descriptive Bibliography (1976). A working draft of the Lardner book was prepared in the summer of 1973 by Bruccoli, who "put his then-graduate-research-assistant Layman to work on checking it. Layman displayed so much aptitude for the assignment that a collaboration seemed obligatory."Bruccoli, Matthew J. and Richard Layman. Ring W. Lardner: A Descriptive Bibliography. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1976, p. xiii. ISBN 0-8229-3306-3
Along with Richard Layman, a Dashiell Hammett scholar and former graduate assistant, and businessman C. E. Frazer Clark, Jr., Bruccoli launched the Dictionary of Literary Biography. The 400-volume reference work contains biographies of more than 12,000 literary figures from antiquity to modern times. 
Bruccoli continued working at the University of South Carolina until being diagnosed with a brain tumor, and died June 4, 2008.

[[Nomogram]]

CATEGORIES: Charts, Analog computers, Mathematical tools, Theory of computation, Diagrams

A nomogram (from Greek νόμος nomos, "law" and γραμμή grammē, "line"), also called a nomograph, alignment chart or abaque, is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a function. The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne (1862-1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.
A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an index line or isopleth.
Nomograms flourished in many different contexts for roughly 75 years because they allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators, making such calculations available to people who did not normally use slide rules, and who didn’t know algebra or were not competent at substituting numbers into equations to obtain results. Results from a nomogram are obtained very quickly and reliably by simply drawing one or more lines, and the user does not even need to know the actual equation used to calculate the result. In addition, nomograms naturally incorporate implicit or explicit domain knowledge into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually takes the care to only include scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user.
Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device, and like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned. Most nomograms are used in applications where an approximate answer is appropriate and useful. Alternatively, a nomogram may be used to check an answer obtained from another exact calculation method. The slide rule is intended to be a general-purpose device, while a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation, with tables of values effectively built into the construction of the scales.
Note that other types of graphical calculators such as intercept charts, trilinear diagrams and hexagonal charts are sometimes called nomograms. Another such example is the Smith chart, a graphical calculator used in electronics and systems analysis. Thermodynamic diagrams and tephigrams, used to plot the vertical structure of the atmosphere and perform calculations on its stability and humidity content, are also occasionally referred to as nomograms. These do not meet the strict definition of a nomogram as a graphical calculator whose solution is found by the use of one or more linear isopleths.

The missile had GRAU indices of 3M65, 3M20, and 3R65. It was carried on board Typhoon class submarines.
An intercontinental missile, the R-39 had a three-stage solid-fuel boost design with a liquid-fuel post-boost unit carrying up to ten MIRV warheads. Like other SLBMs the initial launch was powered by a gas generator in the bottom of the firing tube. During the missile's passage through the water additional motors produce a gaseous wall around the missile, reducing hydrodynamic resistance.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] The launch system was designated "D-19".

[[Radio propagation]]
CATEGORIES: Radio frequency propagation

Radio propagation is the behavior of radio waves when they are transmitted, or propagated from one point on the Earth to another, or into various parts of the atmosphere.H. P. Westman et al., (ed), Reference Data for Radio Engineers, Fifth Edition, 1968, Howard W. Sams and Co., no ISBN, Library of Congress Card No. 43-14665 page 26-1 As a form of electromagnetic radiation, like light waves, radio waves are affected by the phenomena of reflection, refraction, diffraction, absorption, polarization and scattering.Demetrius T Paris and F. Kenneth Hurd, Basic Electromagnetic Theory, McGraw Hill, New York 1969 ISBN 0 048470-8, Chapter 8
Radio propagation is affected by the daily changes of water vapor in the troposphere and ionization in the upper atmosphere, due to the Sun. Understanding the effects of varying conditions on radio propagation has many practical applications, from choosing frequencies for international shortwave broadcasters, to designing reliable mobile telephone systems, to radio navigation, to operation of radar systems.
Radio propagation is also affected by several other factors determined by its path from point to point. This path can be a direct line of sight path or an over-the-horizon path aided by refraction in the ionosphere, which is a region between approximately 60 and 600 km.Radiowave propagation, edited by M.Hall and L.Barclay, page 2, published by Peter Peregrinus Ltd., (1989), ISBN 0-86341-156-8 Factors influencing ionospheric radio signal propagation can include sporadic-E, spread-F, solar flares, geomagnetic storms, ionospheric layer tilts, and solar proton events.
Radio waves at different frequencies propagate in different ways. At extra low frequencies (ELF) and very low frequencies the wavelength is very much larger than the separation between the earth's surface and the D layer of the ionosphere, so electromagnetic waves may propagate in this region as a waveguide. Indeed, for frequencies below 20 kHz, the wave propagates as a single waveguide mode with a horizontal magnetic field and vertical electric field.Radiowave propagation, edited by M.Hall and L.Barclay, published by Peter Peregrinus Ltd., page 3, (1989), ISBN 0-86341-156-8 The interaction of radio waves with the ionized regions of the atmosphere makes radio propagation more complex to predict and analyze than in free space. Ionospheric radio propagation has a strong connection to space weather. A sudden ionospheric disturbance or shortwave fadeout is observed when the x-rays associated with a solar flare ionize the ionospheric D-region.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] Enhanced ionization in that region increases the absorption of radio signals passing through it. During the strongest solar x-ray flares, complete absorption of virtually all ionospherically propagated radio signals in the sunlit hemisphere can occur.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] These solar flares can disrupt HF radio propagation and affect GPS accuracy.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Since radio propagation is not fully predictable, such services as emergency locator transmitters, in-flight communication with ocean-crossing aircraft, and some television broadcasting have been moved to communications satellites. A satellite link, though expensive, can offer highly predictable and stable line of sight coverage of a given area.

President Mohammad Najibullah, whom the U.S. government predicted would not last the summer when Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan in February 1989, continues to rule his war-wracked nation from a precarious position. A Moscow-brokered plan calls for Najibullah to step aside in favor of Prime Minister Khaliqyar, who would serve as a transitional administrative leader until a new government could be elected. However, on October 13 moderate guerrilla officials in Pakistan highlight the remaining obstacles to peace by withdrawing their support for Khaliqyar. The mujaheddin say his association with Najibullah makes him unacceptable. Afghanistan is like a maimed patient after 13 years of civil war. The streets of Kabul are full of one-legged men, victims of land mines. The government says it has released more than 19,000 prisoners in the past four years and has abolished the special tribunals set up to try those accused of political crimes. Meanwhile, fierce fighting continues between government troops and the Muslim guerrillas. The guerrillas launch their long-planned assault on Najibullah's hometown, the garrison town of Gardez in southeastern Afghanistan, and coordinate a series of attacks aimed at demoralizing the Afghan Army and destabilizing the government, but none of the attacks is decisive. In 1991 the guerrillas control 6 of Afghanistan's 31 provinces. In their only major gain during the year, they overrun a series of government-held garrisons to gain control of strategic areas along the border with the breakaway Soviet republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. They also hold the narrow corridor linking Afghanistan with China.

David Christopher Kelly, CMG (14 May 1944 – 17 July 2003) was a British scientist and authority on biological warfare, employed by the British Ministry of Defence, and formerly a United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq. He came to public attention in July 2003 when an unauthorised discussion he had off the record with BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan about the British government's dossier on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was cited by Gilligan and led to a major controversy. Kelly's name became known to the media as Gilligan's source and he was called to appear on 15 July before the parliamentary foreign affairs select committee investigating the issues Gilligan had reported. Kelly was questioned aggressively about his actions. He was found dead two days later."Timeline: Dr David Kelly", The Guardian, 18 July 2003.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's government set up the Hutton Inquiry, a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death. The inquiry concluded that Kelly had committed suicide, with the cause of death as "haemorrhage due to incised wounds of the left wrist" in combination with "coproxamol ingestion and coronary artery atherosclerosis". Lord Hutton also decided that evidence related to the death, including the post-mortem report and photographs of the body, should remain classified for 70 years. In October 2010, Hutton claimed that he had done so to protect the wife and daughters of Kelly from the distress of further media reports about the death, saying: "My request was not a concealment of evidence because every matter of relevance had been examined or was available for examination during the public inquiry. There was no secrecy surrounding the postmortem report because it had always been available for examination and questioning by counsel representing the interested parties during the inquiry."
In 2009 a group of British doctors who had not had access to the evidence - including Michael Powers, a physician, barrister, and former coroner - challenged Hutton's verdict, offering their opinion based on published reports that the cause of death was untenable; they argued that the artery is small and difficult to access, and severing it would not have triggered sufficient blood loss to cause death.Goslett, Miles. "David Kelly post mortem to be kept secret for 70 years as doctors accuse Lord Hutton of concealing vital information", Daily Mail, 24 January 2010. This opinion was challenged by several forensic pathologists who had not had access to the evidence, who told The Guardian that the combination of Kelly's heart disease and the overdose would have meant a smaller loss of blood could have killed him than would be needed to kill a healthier person. In August 2010 the former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, called for a full inquest,Dodd, Vikram, and Sample, Ian. "David Kelly: forensic experts say Hutton inquiry scientifically sound", The Guardian, 16 August 2010. and Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General for England and Wales, confirmed that he was considering re-opening it.Taylor, Matthew. "David Kelly death inquest may be reopened", The Guardian, 13 August 2010.
In October 2010, the postmortem—including the pathologist's 14-page report and the six-page toxicology report—was made public, re-iterating the conclusion of the Hutton report.Taylor, Matthew. David Kelly postmortem reveals injuries were self-inflicted, The Guardian, 22 October 2010. Powers maintains that questions remain about the amount of blood found at the scene and the number of pills taken.

[[Gakkel Ridge]]

The Gakkel Ridge (formerly known as the Nansen Cordillera and Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gebco.net/about_us/meetings_and_minutes/documents/gebco_scufn_15_report.pdf |format=PDF|title=IHO-IOC GEBCO Gazetteer |accessdate=2008-05-24 |publisher=International Hydrographic Organization/Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission |date=September 2007 [/tpl] is a mid-oceanic ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary between the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate."GPS Measurements Reveal Imprint of North American Plate in Siberia", Earth Institute at Columbia University, 2003 It is located in the Arctic Ocean between Greenland and Siberia, and has a length of about 1,800 kilometers. Geologically, it connects the northern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with the Laptev Sea Rift.
The existence and approximate location of the Gakkel Ridge were predicted by Soviet polar explorer Yakov Yakovlevich Gakkel, and confirmed on Soviet expeditions in the Arctic around 1950. The Ridge is named after him, and the name was recognized in April 1987 by SCUFN (under that body's old name, the Sub-Committee on Geographical Names and Nomenclature of Ocean Bottom Features).
The ridge is the slowest known spreading ridge on earth, with a rate of less than one centimeter per year. Until 1999, it was believed to be non-volcanic; that year, scientists operating from a nuclear submarine discovered active volcanos along it. In 2001 two research icebreakers, the German Polarstern and the American Healy, with several groups of scientists, cruised to the Gakkel Ridge to explore it and collect petrological samples. Among other discoveries, this expedition found evidence of hydrothermal vents. In 2007, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution conducted the "Arctic Gakkel Vents Expedition" (AGAVE), which made some unanticipated discoveries, including the unconsolidated fragmented pyroclastic volcanic deposits that cover the axial valley of the ridge (whose area is greater than 10 km2). These suggest volatile substances in concentrations ten times those in the magmas of normal mid-ocean ridges.Robert A. Sohn, et al., Explosive volcanism on the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel ridge, Arctic Ocean, Nature 453, 1236-1238 (26 June 2008) | [tpl]doi|10.1038/nature07075[/tpl] http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7199/full/nature07075.html (abstract) The AGAVE expedition also discovered on the Gakkel ridge, using "free-swimming" robotic submersibles, what they called "bizarre 'mats' of microbial communities containing a half dozen or more new species".http://www.ridge2000.org/dls/abstracts.php The Arctic Gakkel Vents (AGAVE) Expedition: A High–Stakes Technology Gamble Pays Big Dividends Beneath the Arctic Ice Cap, Ridge 2000 Abstracts 2009

José Padilla (born October 18, 1970), also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir or Muhajir Abdullah ([tpl]pronunciation|En-us-Abdullah Al-Muhajir from U.S. pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg[/tpl] [tpl]respell|ahb|DUHL|lah[/tpl] [tpl]respell|al moo|HAH|jeer[/tpl][tpl]Need-IPA[/tpl]), is a United States citizen from Brooklyn, New York, who was convicted in federal court of aiding terrorists.
Padilla was arrested in Chicago on May 8, 2002, on suspicion of plotting a radiological bomb ("dirty bomb") attack. He was detained as a material witness until June 9, 2002, when President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing that he was not entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison. Padilla was held for three and a half years as an "enemy combatant." He was subjected to what were called enhanced interrogation techniques, regarded as torture under International law, including sleep deprivation, shackling and stress positions, the administration of psychotropic drugs, and solitary confinement.Rosenthal, Andrew, "Tortured Logic", The New York Times, 3 May 2012. After pressure from civil liberties groups, the charge was dropped, and his case was moved to a civilian court.
On January 3, 2006, Padilla was transferred to a Miami, Florida, jail to face criminal conspiracy charges. On August 16, 2007, a federal jury found him guilty of conspiring to kill people in an overseas jihad, and to fund and support overseas terrorism. Government officials had earlier claimed Padilla was suspected of planning to build and explode a "dirty bomb" in the United States, a plot they had foiled, but he was never charged with this crime.
On January 22, 2008, Padilla was sentenced by Judge Marcia G. Cooke of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to 17 years and four months in prison. His mother, Estela Ortega Lebron, was relieved. She announced that they would appeal the sentence: "You have to understand that the government was asking for 30 years to life sentence in prison.

Carlsten is a stone fortress located at Marstrand, on the western coast of Sweden. The fortress was built on the orders of King Carl X of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde, 1658 to protect the newly acquired province of Bohuslän from hostile attacks.
The site of Marstrand was chosen because of its location and its access to an ice free port. Initially a square stone tower was constructed, but by 1680 it was reconstructed and replaced by a round shaped tower. Successive additions to the fortress were carried out, by the inmates sentenced to hard labor, until 1860 when it was reported finished. Carlsten was exclusively a prison form men: Metta Fock was in 1806-1809 the only female prisoner to have been kept here. The fortress was decommissioned as a permanent defense installation in 1882, but remained in military use until the early 1990s.
The fortress was attacked and sieged twice falling into enemy hands. In 1677 it was conquered by Ulrik Frederick Gyldenløve, the Danish military commander in Norway and in 1719 by the Norwegian Vice-Admiral Tordenskjold. At both occasions the fortress was returned to Swedish control through negotiations and treaties.

[[Pennyweight]]

CATEGORIES: Obsolete units of measurement, Units of mass

A pennyweight (abbreviated dwt) is a unit of mass that is equal to 24 grains, [tpl]frac|20[/tpl] of a troy ounce, [tpl]frac|240[/tpl] of a troy pound, approximately 0.054857 avoirdupois ounce [ref]Calculated using the relationships:

In the Middle Ages, a British penny's weight was literally, as well as monetarily, [tpl]frac|20[/tpl] of an ounce and [tpl]frac|240[/tpl] of a pound of sterling silver. At that time, the pound in use was the Tower pound. The medieval English pennyweight was thus equal to 32 Tower grains (also known as wheat grains). When Troy weights replaced Tower weights in 1527, the Troy weights were defined in such a way that the old Tower pound came out to exactly 5400 Troy grains (also known as barleycorns), the Tower pennyweight 22[tpl]frac|2[/tpl] Troy grains (and thus approximately 1.46 grams). After 1527, the English pennyweight was the Troy pennyweight.[tpl]cite book| last = Zupko| first = Ronald Edward| authorlink = Ronald Edward Zupko| title = A dictionary of weights and measures for the British Isles| publisher = American Philosophical Society| year = 1985| pages = 280–84| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=0l_k-XMIiQIC&pg=PA283&dq=pennyweight&hl=en&ei=en_ATrmDKNDciQLr7dHAAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=pennyweight&f=false| isbn = 978-0-87169-168-2[/tpl]
The Troy pound and the pennyweight lost their official status in the United Kingdom in the Weights and Measures Act of 1878; only the Troy ounce and its decimal subdivisions remained official. The Troy ounce enjoys a specific legal exemption from metrication in the UK.
The pennyweight is the common weight used in the valuation and measurement of precious metals. Jewelers use the pennyweight in calculating the amount and cost of precious metals used in fabricating or casting jewellery. Similarly, dentists and dental labs still use the pennyweight as the measure of precious metals in dental crowns and inlays.
The most common abbreviation for pennyweight is dwt; d, for the Roman denarius, was the abbreviation for penny before decimalization of the British monetary system. Alternate abbreviations are pwt and PW.
Although the abbreviations are the same, the pennyweight bears no relation to the actual weight of the penny nail, but to the price for a hundred nails in 15th century England: the larger the nail, the higher the cost per hundred.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary | title = Penny | url = http://ed2.oed.com/cgi/display_main/00174661#00174661-mB.V.10 | accessdate = 2010-05-30 | edition = 2nd |format= subscription required | quote = Applied to nails, such adjectives denote the original price (in 15th c.) per hundred; as fivepenny nail, a nail which cost 5d. a hundred, tenpenny nail, a nail costing 10d. a hundred.

Northern Cyprus (or North Cyprus), officially the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC; [tpl]lang-tr|[tpl]italics correction|Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti[/tpl][/tpl]), is a self-declared state that comprises the northeastern portion of the island of Cyprus. Recognised only by Turkey, Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community as Turkish-occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus.[tpl]cite book|author=Susannah Verney|title=EUROSCEPTICISM IN SOUTHERN EUROPE|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1S_dAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA161|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-99612-5|pages=161–|quote=The international community (UN, EU, Council of Europe and other international organisations) recognise the de jure sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the whole island.[/tpl]
Northern Cyprus extends from the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in the north east, westward to Morphou Bay and Cape Kormakitis (the Kokkina/Erenköy exclave marks the westernmost extent of the area), and southward to the village of Louroujina. A buffer zone under the control of the United Nations stretches between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the island and divides Nicosia, the island's largest city and capital of both states.
The 1974 coup d'état, an attempt to annex the island to Greece, was followed by the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. This resulted in the eviction of much of the north's Greek Cypriot population, the flight of Turkish Cypriots from the south, and the partitioning of the island, leading to a unilateral declaration of independence by the North in 1983. Due to its lack of recognition, Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic, political and military support.Thomas M. Leonard. Encyclopedia of the Developing World, Volume 1, page 429. Taylor & Francis, 2006, 159 pages http://books.google.com/books?id=3mE04D9PMpAC&dq=TRNC%2Bdependent&source=gbs_navlinks_s
Attempts to reach a solution to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful. Recognising the need for a resolution, in May 2008 the two sides began another round of negotiations after committing themselves to working towards "a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as defined by relevant Security Council resolutions."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33631&Cr=cyprus&Cr1 |title=United Nations News Centre - Mutually beneficial solution to the Cyprus problem ‘within reach,’ Ban says |publisher=Un.org |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl] The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus with its presence supported and approved by the TRNC government, which the Republic of Cyprus regards as an illegal occupation force, with its presence denounced in several United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Mario Gabriele Andretti (born February 28, 1940) is a retired Italian American world champion racing driver, one of the most successful Americans in the history of the sport. He is one of only two drivers to win races in Formula One, IndyCar, World Sportscar Championship and NASCAR (the other being Dan Gurney). He also won races in midget cars, and sprint cars.
During his career, Andretti won the 1978 Formula One World Championship, four IndyCar titles (three under USAC-sanctioning, one under CART), and IROC VI. To date, he remains the only driver ever to win the Indianapolis 500 (1969), Daytona 500 (1967) and the Formula One World Championship, and, along with Juan Pablo Montoya, the only driver to have won a race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Formula One, and an Indianapolis 500.

Computational neuroscience is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system.What is computational neuroscience?

MIT Press http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=7195  It is an interdisciplinary science that links the diverse fields of neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology with electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, and physics.
Computational neuroscience is distinct from psychological connectionism and from learning theories of disciplines such as machine learning, neural networks, and computational learning theory in that it emphasizes descriptions of functional and biologically realistic neurons (and neural systems) and their physiology and dynamics.  These models capture the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, from membrane currents, proteins, and chemical coupling to network oscillations, columnar and topographic architecture, and learning and memory.
These computational models are used to frame hypotheses that can be directly tested by biological and/or psychological experiments.

[[Minority government]]

CATEGORIES: Minority governments, Political terminology

A minority government or a minority cabinet is a cabinet of a parliamentary system formed when a political party or coalition of parties does not have a majority of overall seats in the parliament but is sworn into government by the outside support of the other parties to break a Hung Parliament election result. In such a government, legislation can only be passed with the support of other parties in order to give a majority, encouraging multi-partisanship. It is also known as a minority parliament. In bicameral parliaments, the term relates to the situation in the chamber whose confidence is considered most crucial.
In general a minority government tends to be less stable than a majority government, because the opposition always - if it can unite for the purpose - is strong enough to bring down the government with a simple vote of no confidence.

Chesil Beach [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|z|ɨ|l[/tpl], sometimes called Chesil Bank, in Dorset, southern England is one of three major shingle structures in Britain.A. P. Carr and M. W. L. Blackley, "Investigations Bearing on the Age and Development of Chesil Beach, Dorset, and the Associated Area" Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, No. 58 (March 1973) pp. 99-111. Its toponym is derived from the Old English ceosel or cisel, meaning "gravel" or "shingle". 
The beach is often identified as a tombolo, although research into the geomorphology of the area has revealed that it is in fact a barrier beach which has "rolled" landwards, joining the mainland with the Isle of Portland, giving the appearance of a tombolo.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] The shingle beach is [tpl]convert|29|km|mi|0[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|200|m|ft|-1[/tpl] wide and [tpl]convert|15|m|ft|-1[/tpl] high. The beach and the Fleet are part of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the location for a 2007 novel, On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan.
At the eastern end of the beach at the village of Chiswell, against the cliffs of the Isle of Portland, the beach curves round sharply to form Chesil Cove. This part of the beach protects the low-lying village from flooding. Westwards the shingle forms a straight line along the coast, enclosing the Fleet, a shallowThe lagoon is 3m at its deepest (Carr and Blackley 1973:99. tidal lagoon.
The beach provides shelter from the prevailing winds and waves for the town of Weymouth and the village of Chiswell.
Varying with the Bank's unbroken increase in height, to [tpl]convert|14.7|m|ft[/tpl], above mean high water, the size of the flint and chert shingle varies from pea-sized at the north-west end (by West Bay) to orange-sized at the south-east end (by Portland).

Gereby is the former name of a German place nowadays called  Carlsburg. It is situated in Schwansen at the northern borderline to Angeln (engl. Anglia). Today Carlsburg is a settlement on the Schlei inlet, some 10 km south of the city of Kappeln.  Located on Carlsburg is Schloss Carlsburg, a country manor owned by the present Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and the former location of a boarding school (Landerziehungsheim Carlsburg) which has since moved to Louisenlund, near Fleckeby.
Gereby is said to be founded by the Vikings in order to defend their way to Hedeby. The name probably derives from the surname "Gero".

Radama II (September 23, 1829 – May 12, 1863 dead) was the son and heir of Queen Ranavalona I and ruled from 1861 to 1863 over the Kingdom of Madagascar, which controlled virtually the entire island. Radama's rule, although brief, was a pivotal period in the history of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Under the unyielding and often harsh 33-year rule of his mother, Queen Ranavalona I, Madagascar had successfully preserved its cultural and political independence from French and British designs. Rejecting the queen's policy of isolationism and Christian persecution, Radama II permitted religious freedom and re-opened Madagascar to European influence. Under the terms of the Lambert Charter, which Radama secretly contracted in 1855 with French entrepreneur Joseph-François Lambert while Ranavalona still ruled, the French were awarded exclusive rights to the exploitation of large tracts of valuable land and other lucrative resources and projects. This agreement, which was later revoked by Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, was key to establishing France's claim over Madagascar as a protectorate and, in 1896, as a colony.
The dramatic contrast between Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard of the advice of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been made on the basis of significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.

Ranavalona III (November 22, 1861 – May 23, 1917) was the last sovereign of the Kingdom of Madagascar. She ruled from July 30, 1883 to February 28, 1897 in a reign marked by ongoing and ultimately futile efforts to resist the colonial designs of the government of France. As a young woman, she was selected from among several Andriana qualified to succeed Queen Ranavalona II upon her death. Like both preceding queens, Ranavalona entered a political marriage with a member of the Hova elite named Rainilaiarivony, who in his role as Prime Minister of Madagascar, largely oversaw the day-to-day governance of the kingdom and managed its foreign affairs. Ranavalona tried to stave off colonization by strengthening trade and diplomatic relations with the United States and Great Britain throughout her reign. French attacks on coastal port towns and an assault on the capital city of Antananarivo ultimately led to the capture of the royal palace in 1895, ending the sovereignty and political autonomy of the century-old kingdom.
The newly installed French colonial government promptly exiled Rainilaiarivony to Algiers, although Ranavalona and her court were initially permitted to remain as symbolic figureheads. But the outbreak of a popular resistance movement – the menalamba rebellion – and discovery of anti-French political intrigues at court led the French to exile the queen to the island of Réunion in 1897. Rainilaiarivony died that same year and shortly thereafter Ranavalona was relocated to a villa in Algiers, along with several members of her family. The queen, her family and the servants accompanying her were provided an allowance and enjoyed a comfortable standard of living including occasional trips to Paris for shopping and sightseeing. Despite Ranavalona's repeated requests, she was never permitted to return home to Madagascar. She died of an embolism at her villa in Algiers in 1917 at the age of 55. Her remains were buried in Algiers but were disinterred 21 years later and shipped to Madagascar, where they were placed within the tomb of Queen Rasoherina on the grounds of the Rova of Antananarivo.

Angeln, also known as Anglia (German: Angeln, Danish: Angel, Latin: Anglia), is a small peninsula (within the larger Jutland peninsula) in Southern Schleswig in the northern Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, protruding into the Bay of Kiel. It is separated from the neighbouring peninsula of Schwansen (Danish: Svans or Svansø) by the Schlei inlet, and from the Danish island of Als by the Flensburger Förde ("Firth of Flensburg"). Whether ancient Angeln conformed to these borders is uncertain. It may have been somewhat larger; however, the ancient sources mainly concur that it included the territory of modern Angeln.
Angeln has a significance far beyond its current small area and country terrain, in that it is believed to have been the original home of the Angles, Germanic immigrants to central and northern England, and East Anglia. This migration led to their new homeland being named after them, from which the name "England" derives. Both England and the English language, thus, ultimately derive their names from the Angles and Angeln.

It is a 1986 horror novel by American author Stephen King. The story follows the exploits of seven children as they are terrorized by an eponymous being, which exploits the fears and phobias of its victims in order to disguise itself while hunting its prey. "It" primarily appears in the form of a clown in order to attract its preferred prey of young children. The novel is told through narratives alternating between two time periods, and is largely told in the third-person omniscient mode. It deals with themes which would eventually become King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma, and the ugliness lurking behind a façade of traditional small-town values. The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1987, and received nominations for the Locus and World Fantasy Awards that same year. Publishers Weekly listed It as the best-selling book in the United States in 1986.

[tpl]Nihongo|Stellvia|宇宙のステルヴィア|Uchū no Suteruvia[/tpl], also known as Stellvia of the Universe, is an anime series set in space. As a prelude to the series, the Earth of year 2167 AD is shown to be devastated by a powerful electromagnetic shockwave. This is caused by a nearby star, Hydrus Beta, 20 light-years away, going supernova As result  3 billion of 14 billion people of humanity on earth where  wiped out. The series itself is set 189 years later, in the year 2356 AD. Civilization has been rebuilt with humanity having united together to face the coming of the second shockwave of the supernova. The second shockwave, unlike the first, is to contain a great deal of matter composed of the remnants of the star itself. Stellvia ran for 26 episodes and was produced by the animation studio XEBEC. It was distributed in the United States by Geneon. In September 2007 Geneon halted all distribution of anime DVDs in America,Geneon USA to Cancel DVD Sales, Distribution by Friday including Stellvia. A sequel was originally announced for 2005, but was canceled after internal difficulties.
Beginning with the May 2003 issue, a manga adaptation by Ryo Akizuki was serialized in Dengeki Daioh and has been published in the US as a two volume graphic novel series by DrMaster. The word Stellvia is composed of two Latin words, stella meaning star(s) and via meaning street or road. Therefore Stellvia is roughly translated as The Road to the Stars.
The series makes references to things such as Theory of knowledge, CAS, and Extended Essay, which suggests that Stellvia might have been partially inspired by the International Baccalaureate program, or at least, included an Ex-IB student in its development.

[[Golden Horseshoe]]

CATEGORIES: Metropolitan areas of Ontario, Geographic regions of Ontario, Golden Horseshoe

The Golden Horseshoe is a subregion of Southern Ontario, Canada, which lies at the western end of Lake Ontario with outer boundaries stretching south to Lake Erie and north to Georgian Bay. The region is densely populated and industrialized. Most of it is also part of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, Quebec City–Windsor Corridor and the Great Lakes Megalopolis. With a population of 8.76 million people in 2011, the Golden Horseshoe makes up over 26% of the population of Canada and contains more than 68% of Ontario's population,[tpl]failed verification|date=July 2012[/tpl] making it one of the largest population concentrations in North America. Although it is a geographically named sub-region of Southern Ontario, the Greater Golden Horseshoe is also used today to describe the metropolitan region that stretches across the area in totality, including smaller centres outside of the core region.
The core of the region starts from Niagara Falls at the eastern end of the Niagara Peninsula and extends west, wrapping around the western end of Lake Ontario at Hamilton and then turning northeast to its anchor city Toronto (on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario), before finally terminating at Oshawa, just east of Toronto. The wider region spreads inland in all directions away from the Lake Ontario shoreline, southwest to Brantford, west to the Kitchener-Waterloo area, north to Barrie, and northeast to Peterborough. The whole region's area covers approximately [tpl]convert|33500|km2|mi2|sigfig=2|abbr=on[/tpl], out of this, [tpl]convert|7300|km2|mi2|sigfig=2|abbr=on[/tpl] or approximately 22% of the area is covered by the environmentally protected Greenbelt.

[[Mangaka]]

CATEGORIES: Manga artists, Anime and manga terminology

[tpl]Nihongo|Mangaka|漫画家|[/tpl] is the Japanese word for a comic artist or cartoonist. Outside of Japan, manga usually refers to a Japanese comic book and mangaka refers to the author of the manga, who is usually Japanese. As of 2006, about 3000 professional mangaka were working in Japan.[tpl]cite book |last=McCarthy |first=Helen  |authorlink=Helen McCarthy |title=500 Manga Heroes & Villains |year=2006 |publisher= Chrysalis Book Group |location= Hauppauge, New York, USA |isbn=978-0-7641-3201-8 |pages=14 |chapter= Manga: A Brief History [/tpl]
Most mangaka study at an art college, manga school, or take on an apprenticeship with another artist before entering the industry as a primary creator. More rarely a mangaka breaks into the industry directly, without previously being an assistant. For example, Naoko Takeuchi, author of Sailor Moon, won a contest sponsored by Kodansha, and manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka was first published while studying an unrelated degree, without ever working as an assistant.
A mangaka will rise to prominence through recognition of their ability when they spark the interest of institutions, individuals or a demographic of manga consumers. For example, there are contests which prospective mangaka may enter, sponsored by manga editors and publishers. They are also recognized for the number of manga they run at one time.Schodt, Frederik L.: Manga! Manga!: The World of Japanese Comics, Kodansha International, August 18, 1997, ISBN 0-87011-752-1

[[Conversations with God]]
CATEGORIES: Channelled texts, Dialogues, New religious movement-related media, New Thought literature, New Age texts, Books about spirituality

Conversations with God (CwG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch. It was written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers.[tpl]cite book|last=Walsch|first=Neale Donald|authorlink=Neale Donald Walsch|title=Conversations with God|year=1995|type=Paperback|ISBN=0-399-14278-9[/tpl]  The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue, appeared on bookshelves in 1995, and quickly became a publishing phenomenon, staying on the New York Times Best-Sellers List for 137 weeks.  The succeeding volumes in the nine book series also appeared prominently on the List.
In an interview with Larry King, Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working.  After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: "Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?"Neale Donald Walsch on CNS's Larry King Live (April 7th, 2000)  Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down.  The ensuing dialogue became the Conversations with God books. When asked in a recent interview how does he ‘open up’ to God these days, Neale argued “I am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.”'Being at One': Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel, PhD (Part 1 of 3), Paragraph 16

The near field (or near-field) and far field (or far-field) are regions of the electromagnetic field around an object, such as a transmitting antenna, or as a result of radiation scattering off an object. Non-radiative 'near-field' behaviors of electromagnetic fields dominate close to the antenna or scattering object, while electromagnetic radiation 'far-field' behaviors dominate at greater distances. Near-field behaviors decay rapidly with distance away from an object, whereas the far-field radiative field's intensity decays with an inverse-square law.

An off-by-one error (OBOE) is a logic error involving the discrete equivalent of a boundary condition.  It often occurs in computer programming when an iterative loop iterates one time too many or too few. This problem could arise when a programmer makes mistakes such as using "is less than or equal to" where "is less than" should have been used in a comparison or fails to take into account that a sequence starts at zero rather than one (as with array indices in many languages). This can also occur in a mathematical context.

[[Quarrendon, Buckinghamshire]]
CATEGORIES: Deserted medieval villages in England, Civil parishes in Buckinghamshire

Quarrendon is a civil parish and also the name of a now deserted medieval village on the outskirts of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England. Today its name is also associated with the modern housing estate of Quarrendon beyond the parish boundary in Aylesbury.
The toponym is derived from the Old English Cweorndun meaning "hill where mill stones are obtained". There is evidence to suggest that the village dates back at least as far as the Anglo Saxon era as the village was reputedly the birthplace of daughters of King Penda, St Edburga and St Edith, and their niece St Osyth. Legend has it that St Osyth was beheaded by the Danish occupiers of Britain at Nuns Wood in the Grounds of St Osyth Priory, Where a spring of holy water sprang forth and is still in existence today.
Queen Elizabeth I was entertained at Quarrendon Manor by Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley for two days in 1592. The village and its manor survived until the 18th century, when Henry Lee, the Lord of the Manor, went bankrupt and lost all his lands. The only remaining building in the old village is the ruined church of St Peter. In 1817 the building was described in the Gentleman's Magazine as "a melancholy object of contemplation". Until the 1930s there were substantial remains. Old pictures show that the church had north and south aisles with octagonal piers and  double-chamfered arches. All that now remains (as of 2006) are two low sections of wall and the foot of one of the south aisle buttresses. The moat, fish ponds and groundworks of the manor house also remain.
The modern housing estate of Quarrendon in Aylesbury is named after the ancient village.
Quarrendon is situated between Aylesbury railway station and Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station. It is also served by three bus routes.

[[St Trinian's School]]

CATEGORIES: 1946 introductions, Fictional schools

St Trinian's is a fictional girls' boarding school, the creation of English cartoonist Ronald Searle, that later became the subject of a popular series of comedy films. 
The first cartoon appeared in 1941, but shortly afterwards Searle had to fulfil his military service where he was captured at Singapore and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese. After the war, in 1946 he started making new cartoons about the girls, but the content was a lot darker in comparison with the previous years.
The school is the antithesis of the Enid Blyton or Angela Brazil–type posh girls' boarding school; its pupils are wicked and often well armed, and mayhem is rife. The schoolmistresses are also disreputable. Cartoons often showed dead bodies of girls who had been murdered with pitchforks or succumbed to violent team sports, sometimes with vultures circling; girls drank, gambled and smoked. It is reputed that the gymslip style of dress worn by the girls was closely modelled on the uniform of the school that Searle's daughter Kate attended, JAGS in Dulwich. The films implied that the girls were the daughters of gangsters, crooks, shady bookmakers, and other low-lifes and the institution is often referred to as a "female borstal".

Schönefeld was the major civil airport of East Germany (GDR), and the only airport serving East Berlin. Today, it is the smaller of the two airports in Berlin after Berlin Tegel Airport.
Schönefeld Airport is situated outside the city proper, unlike Berlin Tegel Airport. Noise pollution is, therefore, less of an issue at Schönefeld. The airport will be merged into Berlin Brandenburg Airport when it opens in 2015 or later.The future lies in Schoenefeld
Schönefeld Airport saw a major increase in passenger numbers over the recent years, which was caused by the opening of bases for both easyJet and Germanwings. In 2008, the airport served 6.6 million passengers. At the start of the winter season in 2012 Germanwings left Schönefeld for Berlin-Tegel.Germanwings zieht nach Berlin-Tegel

Ellen Gould White (née Harmon; November 26, 1827 – July 16, 1915) was a prolific  author and an American Christian pioneer. She, along with other Sabbatarian Adventist leaders, such as Joseph Bates and her husband James White, formed what is now known as the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
Ellen White reported to her fellow believers her visionary experiences. James White, and others of the Adventist pioneers, viewed these experiences as the Biblical gift of prophecy as outlined in [tpl]bibleverse||Revelation|12:17|NIV[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse||Revelation|19:10|NIV[/tpl] which describe the testimony of Jesus as the "spirit of prophecy." Her Conflict of the Ages series of writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in Biblical and Christian church  history. This cosmic conflict, referred to as the "Great Controversy theme", is foundational to the development of Seventh-day Adventist theology.[tpl]sfn|Douglass|2010|p=416[/tpl]
White was considered a somewhat controversial figure. Her reports of visionary experiences and use of other sources in her writings comprise much of the controversy. She received her first vision soon after the Millerite Great Disappointment.[tpl]sfn|Graybill|1994[/tpl]The various printed editions of her first vision can be found at Adventist History Library's Ellen White's First Vision Historian Randall Balmer has described her as "one of the more important and colorful figures in the history of American religion".[tpl]sfn|Balmer|2002|pp=614-615[/tpl] Walter Martin described her as "one of the most fascinating and controversial personages ever to appear upon the horizon of religious history."[tpl]sfn|Martin|1965|p=379[/tpl] Arthur L. White, her grandson and biographer, writes that Ellen G. White is the most translated female non-fiction author in the history of literature, as well as the most translated American non-fiction author of either gender.[tpl]sfn|White|2000[/tpl] Her writings covered creationism, agriculture, theology, evangelism, Christian lifestyle, education and health. She advocated vegetarianism. She promoted and was instrumental in the establishment of schools and medical centers. During her lifetime she wrote more than 5,000 periodical articles and 40 books. Today, including compilations from her 100,000 pages of manuscript, more than 100 titles are available in English. Some of her most famous books include The Desire of Ages, The Great Controversy and Steps to Christ. Her work on successful Christian living, Steps to Christ, has been published in more than 140 languages.
