The Australian Greens, commonly known as The Greens, is an Australian green political party. The party was formed in 1992 and is today a confederation of eight state and territory parties. Other than environmentalism the party cites four core values: ecological sustainability, social justice, grassroots democracy and peace and non-violence.http://www.themonthly.com.au/australian-greens-party-divided-we-fall-sally-neighbour-4524
Party constituencies can be traced to various origins – notably the early environmental movement in Australia and the formation of the United Tasmania Group (UTG), one of the first green parties in the world,[tpl]cite web |title=About Us|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/about-us|publisher=Global Greens|accessdate=19 December 2011[/tpl] but also the nuclear disarmament movement in Western Australia and sections of the industrial left in New South Wales. Co-ordination between environmentalist groups occurred in the 1980s with various significant protests. Key people involved in these campaigns included the party's former leader Bob Brown and current leader Christine Milne who went on to contest and win seats in the Tasmanian Parliament and eventually form the Tasmanian Greens.
Currently, the Greens party have nine senators and one member in the lower house, 17 elected representatives in state and territory parliaments, more than 100 local councillors[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-03-23/greens-celebrate-40-years-of-movement/3909912 |title=Greens celebrate 40 years of movement |accessdate=6 July 2012 |date=24 March 2012 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation [/tpl] and close to 10,000 party members.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3256735.htm |title=Bob Brown outlines Greens plans for Senate power |author=Ashley Hall |accessdate=6 July 2012 |date=29 June 2011 |work=PM |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation [/tpl]

"Why did the chicken cross the road?" is a common riddle or joke. The answer or punchline is: "To get to the other side." The riddle is an example of anti-humor, in that the curious setup of the joke leads the listener to expect a traditional punchline, but they are instead given a simple statement of fact. "Why did the chicken cross the road?" has become largely iconic as an exemplary generic joke to which most people know the answer, and has been repeated and changed numerous times.

[[Minamoto no Yoshinaka]]

CATEGORIES: Minamoto clan, Shoguns, 1154 births, 1184 deaths, People of Heian-period Japan

[tpl]Nihongo|Minamoto no Yoshinaka|源 義仲||1154 – February 21, 1184[/tpl] was a general of the late Heian Period of Japanese history. A member of the Minamoto samurai clan, Minamoto no Yoritomo was his cousin and rival during the Genpei War between the Minamoto and the Taira clans.  
Born in Musashi province, Yoshinaka's father Minamoto no Yoshikata was killed and his domain was seized by Minamoto no Yoshihira in an intrafamily feud while he was still an infant. Yoshihira sought to kill Yoshinaka also, but he escaped into the care of Nakahara clan in Kiso, Shinano Province (present-day Nagano Prefecture) where he was then raised. He was raised with Nakahara Shiro who was his milkbrother (Shiro's mother Chizuru nursed Yoshinaka and Shiro). This Shiro would later become Imai no Shiro Kanehira, Yoshinaka's best friend and most loyal retainer. Yoshinaka later changed his name from Minamoto to Kiso.  
In 1180, Yoshinaka received Prince Mochihito's call to the members of the Minamoto clan to rise against the Taira.  Yoshinaka entered the Genpei War raising an army in Shinano and  quickly conquered the province. In 1181, Yoshinaka sought to regain his father's domain in Musashi which was already under the control of his cousin Minamoto no Yoritomo. The two reconciled and resolved to not fight one another but Yoshinaka had to accept Yoritomo as the leader of the Minamoto clan, give up his aspirations for his father's domain, and send his son Yoshitaka to Kamakura as a hostage. However, having been shamed, Yoshinaka was now determined to beat Yoritomo to Kyoto, defeat the Taira on his own, and take control of the Minamoto for himself.  
Yoshinaka defeated the army of Taira no Koremori at the Battle of Kurikara Pass and marched to Kyoto.  The Taira retreated out of the capital, taking the child Emperor Antoku with them. Three days later Yoshinaka's army entered the capital and the cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa bestowed upon him the title of Asahi Shogun. However, his army ransacked Kyoto, and the emperor ordered him to attack the Taira in order to get the army out of the capital.  
Later, returning to Kyoto after a battle, Yoshinaka was angered to find out that the Emperor had sided with his cousin Yoritomo. He extended military control over the city, pillaging it and imprisoning the Emperor Go-Shirakawa, and forced the Emperor to bestow upon him the title of shogun. Minamoto no Yoritomo, angry at Yoshinaka's actions, ordered his brothers Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori to attack and kill Yoshinaka.  
Yoshinaka was driven out of Kyoto and killed by his cousins at the Battle of Awazu in Ōmi Province (present-day Shiga Prefecture) along with his milk brother Kanehira. With night coming and with many enemy soldiers chasing him, he attempted to find an isolated spot to kill himself. However, the story says that his horse became trapped in a field of partly frozen mud and his enemies were able to approach him and kill him.
He was buried in Otsu, in Ōmi; a temple was built his honor during the later Muromachi period. Its name, Gichū-ji, has the same two kanji as his given name. Kanehira's grave is also in Otsu, but it is not close to Yoshinaka's. The Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō, pursuant to his last wishes, was buried next to Minamoto no Yoshinaka in Gichū-ji.  
Minamoto no Yoshinaka is one of many main characters in the Kamakura period epic, the Tale of Heike. The story of Yoshinaka and Kanehira is fairly well known in Japan; it is also the subject of the Noh play "Kanehira", in which Kanehira's tormented ghost describes his and Yoshinaka's death, and his wish to go to the other side.

[[Computational archaeology]]
CATEGORIES: Computational archaeology

Computational archaeology describes computer-based analytical methods for the study of long-term human behaviour and behavioural evolution. As with other sub-disciplines that have prefixed 'computational' to their name (e.g. computational biology, computational physics and computational sociology), the term is reserved for (generally mathematical) methods that could not realistically be performed without the aid of a computer.
Computational archaeology may include the use of geographical information systems (GIS), especially when applied to spatial analyses such as viewshed analysis and least-cost path analysis as these approaches are sufficiently computationally complex that they are extremely difficult if not impossible to implement without the processing power of a computer. Likewise, some forms of statistical and mathematical modelling, and the computer simulation of human behaviour and behavioural evolution using software tools such as Swarm or Repast would also be impossible to calculate without computational aid. The application of a variety of other forms of complex and bespoke software to solve archaeological problems, such as human perception and movement within built environments using software such as University College London's Space Syntax program, also falls under the term 'computational archaeology'.
Computational archaeology is also known as archaeological informatics   (Burenhult 2002, Huggett and Ross 2004) or archaeoinformatics (sometimes abbreviated as "AI", but not to be confused with artificial intelligence).

[[Bump mapping]]

CATEGORIES: Demo effects, Texture mapping, Virtual reality

Bump mapping is a technique in computer graphics for simulating bumps and wrinkles on the surface of an object. This is achieved by perturbing the surface normals of the object and using the perturbed normal during lighting calculations. The result is an apparently bumpy surface rather than a smooth surface although the surface of the underlying object is not actually changed. Bump mapping was introduced by Blinn in 1978.Blinn, James F. "Simulation of Wrinkled Surfaces", Computer Graphics, Vol. 12 (3), pp. 286-292 SIGGRAPH-ACM (August 1978)
Normal mapping is the most common variation of bump mapping used.Mikkelsen, Morten. Simulation of Wrinkled Surfaces Revisited, 2008 (PDF)

Sophie's Choice is a novel by American author William Styron, that was published in 1979. It concerns a young American Southerner, an aspiring writer, who befriends the Jewish Nathan Landau and his beautiful lover Sophie, a Polish survivor of the German Nazi concentration camps. The plot ultimately centers around a tragic decision which Sophie was forced to make upon entering the concentration camp.
An immediate bestseller and the basis of a successful film of the same name, the novel is often considered both Styron's best work and a major novel of the twentieth century. The difficult decision that shapes the character Sophie is sometimes used as an idiom: a Sophie's Choice is the necessity to choose between two unbearable options.
Sophie's Choice won the US National Book Award for Fiction in 1980."National Book Awards – 1980". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-15.  (With essay by Robert Weil from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.)This was the 1980 award for hardcover general Fiction.  From 1980 to 1983 in National Book Awards history there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories, and multiple fiction categories, especially in 1980. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including the 1980 general Fiction.

While serving as Sweden's special envoy in Budapest between July and December 1944, Wallenberg issued protective passports and sheltered Jews in buildings designated as Swedish territory saving tens of thousands of lives.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/search/index_search.html |title= Yad Vashem database | quote= who saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest during World War II ... and put some 15,000 Jews into 32 safe houses.|accessdate=2007-02-12 |publisher = Yad Vashem|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070207032351/http://www1.yadvashem.org/search/index_search.html |archivedate = February 7, 2007[/tpl]
On January 17, 1945,Raoul Wallenberg’s arrest order, signed by Bulganin in January 1945 during the Siege of Budapest by the Red Army, Wallenberg was detained by Soviet authorities on suspicion of espionage and subsequently disappeared. He was later reported to have died on July 17, 1947, while imprisoned by communist authorities, and KGB secret police in the Lubyanka, a building located in Moscow, Russia, housing both the KGB headquarters and its affiliated prison. The motives behind Wallenberg's arrest and imprisonment by the Soviet government, along with questions surrounding the circumstances of his death and his possible ties to US intelligence, remain mysterious and are the subject of continued speculation.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1807803,00.html | work=Time | title=Unraveling Raoul Wallenberg's Secrets | date=May 19, 2008[/tpl]
Due to his courageous actions on behalf of the Hungarian Jews, Raoul Wallenberg has been the subject of numerous humanitarian honors in the decades following his presumed death. In 1981, U.S. Congressman Tom Lantos, himself one of those saved by Wallenberg, sponsored a bill making Wallenberg an Honorary Citizen of the United States. He is also an honorary citizen of Canada, Hungary, Australia and Israel. Israel has also designated Wallenberg one of the Righteous among the Nations. Monuments have been dedicated to him, and streets have been named after him throughout the world. A Raoul Wallenberg Committee of the United States was created in 1981 to "perpetuate the humanitarian ideals and the nonviolent courage of Raoul Wallenberg".[tpl]cite web|title = The Raoul Wallenberg Committee of the United States – Our Mission|url = http://www.raoulwallenberg.org/aboutus.htm.html|accessdate = June 8, 2013[/tpl] It gives the Raoul Wallenberg Award annually to recognize persons who carry out those goals. A postage stamp was issued by the U.S. in his honour in 1997. On July 26, 2012, he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal by the United States Congress "in recognition of his achievements and heroic actions during the Holocaust."[tpl]cite web | title=The Library of Congress: Bill Summary & Status 112th Congress (2011 - 2012) H.R. 3001|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3001:[/tpl]

Harold Larwood (14 November 1904 – 22 July 1995) was a professional cricketer for Nottinghamshire and England between 1924 and 1938. A right-arm fast bowler who combined unusual speed with great accuracy, he was considered by many commentators to be the finest bowler of his generation. He was the main exponent of the bowling style known as "bodyline", the use of which during the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Australia in 1932–33 caused a furore that brought about a premature and acrimonious end to his international career.
A coal miner's son who began working in the mines at the age of 14, Larwood was recommended to Nottinghamshire on the basis of his performances in club cricket, and rapidly acquired a place among the country's leading bowlers. He made his Test debut in 1926, in only his second season in first-class cricket, and was a member of the 1928–29 touring side that retained the Ashes in Australia. The advent of the Australian batsman Don Bradman ended a period of English cricket supremacy; Larwood and other bowlers were completely dominated by Bradman during Australia's victorious tour of 1930. Thereafter, under the guidance of England's combative captain Douglas Jardine, the fast leg theory or bodyline bowling attack was developed. With Larwood as its spearhead the tactic was used with considerable success in the 1932–33 Test series. The Australians' description of the method as "unsportsmanlike" soured cricketing relations between the two countries; during subsequent efforts to heal the breach, Larwood refused to apologise for his bowling, since he was carrying out his captain's instructions. Although he never played for England again, he continued his county career with considerable success for several more seasons.
In 1949, after years out of the limelight, Larwood was elected to honorary membership of the MCC. The following year he and his family were encouraged by former opponent Jack Fingleton to emigrate and settle in Australia, where he was warmly welcomed, in contrast to the reception accorded him in his cricketing days. He worked for a soft drinks firm, and as an occasional reporter and commentator on Tests against visiting England sides. He paid several visits to England, and was honoured at his old county ground, Trent Bridge, where a stand was named after him. In 1993, at the age of 88, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in a delayed recognition of his cricket services to his country. He died two years later.

[[Drag equation]]

CATEGORIES: Aerodynamics, Equations of fluid dynamics, Aircraft wing design

In fluid dynamics, the drag equation is a formula used to calculate the force of drag experienced by an object due to movement through a fully enclosing fluid. The formula is accurate only under certain conditions: the objects must have a blunt form factor and the fluid must have a large enough Reynolds number to produce turbulence behind the object. The equation is
where
The equation is attributed to Lord Rayleigh, who originally used L2 in place of A (with L being some linear dimension).See Section 7 of Book 2 of Newton's Principia Mathematica; in particular Proposition 37. 
The reference area A is typically defined as the area of the orthographic projection of the object on a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion. For non-hollow objects with simple shape, such as a sphere, this is exactly the same as a cross sectional area. For other objects (for instance, a rolling tube or the body of a cyclist), A may be significantly larger than the area of any cross section along any plane perpendicular to the direction of motion. Airfoils use the square of the chord length as the reference area; since airfoil chords are usually defined with a length of 1, the reference area is also 1. Aircraft use the wing area (or rotor-blade area) as the reference area, which makes for an easy comparison to lift. Airships and bodies of revolution use the volumetric coefficient of drag, in which the reference area is the square of the cube root of the airship's volume. Sometimes different reference areas are given for the same object in which case a drag coefficient corresponding to each of these different areas must be given.
For sharp-cornered bluff bodies, like square cylinders and plates held transverse to the flow direction, this equation is applicable with the drag coefficient as a constant value when the Reynolds number is greater than 1000.Drag Force For smooth bodies, like a circular cylinder, the drag coefficient may vary significantly until Reynolds numbers up to 107 (ten million).See Batchelor (1967), p. 341.

Joseph Wheeler (September 10, 1836 – January 25, 1906) was an American military commander and politician. He has the rare distinction of serving as a general during war time for two opposing forces: first as a noted cavalry general in the Confederate States Army in the 1860s during the American Civil War, and later as a general in the United States Army during both the Spanish-American War and Philippine-American War near the turn-of-the-twentieth-century. For much of the Civil War he served as the senior cavalry general in the Army of Tennessee and fought in most of its battles in the Western Theater.

Valleys & Cardiff Local Routes ([tpl]lang-cy|Llwybrau Lleol y Cymoedd a Chaerdydd[/tpl]) (formerly Valley Lines) is the busy network of passenger suburban railway services radiating from Cardiff, Wales. It includes lines within the city itself, the Vale of Glamorgan and the South Wales Valleys.http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/StrategicBusinessPlan/RoutePlans/2008/Route%2015%20-%20South%20Wales%20Valleys.pdf
The services are currently operated by Arriva Trains Wales. In total, it serves 81 stations in six unitary authority areas: 20 in the city of Cardiff, 11 in the Vale of Glamorgan, 25 in Rhondda Cynon Taff, 15 in Caerphilly, 8 in Bridgend and 5 in Merthyr Tydfil.http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=4776
Services on these routes are provided by Class 142, 143 and 150 DMUs, and are typically end-to-end, in that they run from one branch terminus, through Cardiff Queen Street station, to another branch terminus, e.g. from Pontypridd to Barry Island.
The major hubs of the network are [tpl]Stnlnk|Cardiff Queen Street[/tpl] and [tpl]Stnlnk|Cardiff Central[/tpl]. Other hubs are [tpl]Stnlnk|Pontypridd[/tpl], [tpl]Stnlnk|Bridgend[/tpl] and [tpl]Stnlnk|Barry[/tpl].Cardiff Central and Queen Street are where all services pass through and are interchanges to the national network. Pontypridd and Barry are the two stations with the largest passenger numbers outside of Cardiff and they are only served by this network. See respective Wikipedia pages.
On 16 July 2012 the UK Government announced plans to extend the electrification of the network at a cost of £350 million. This was at the same time of the announcement of electrification of the South Wales Main Line from Cardiff to Swansea. This would also see investment in new trains and continued improvements to stations. It is thought to start between 2014 and 2019.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18852955 |title=Rail electrification to Swansea and south Wales valleys welcomed |work=BBC News Wales |date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=16 July 2012 [/tpl]

The September 11 attacks transformed the first term of President George W. Bush and led to what he has called the Global War on Terrorism. The accuracy of describing it as a "war" and the political motivations and consequences are the topic of strenuous debate. The US government increased military operations, economic measures and political pressure on groups it accused of being terrorists, as well as on governments and countries accused of sheltering them. October 2001 saw the first military action initiated by the US. Under this policy, the NATO invaded Afghanistan in order to remove the Taliban regime (which harbored al-Qaeda) and to capture al-Qaeda forces.  
The war, however, is ongoing and has not been won.

In Canada, they were once known as Bushx, because the 1970s band Bush, led by Domenic Troiano, owned the Canadian rights to the name. In April 1997, it was announced that Troiano had agreed to let them use the name Bush in Canada without the exponent x, in exchange for donating $20,000 each to the Starlight Children's Foundation and the Canadian Music Therapy Trust Fund.

CATEGORIES: Phonetics, Stress (linguistics), Phonology, Poetic rhythm

In linguistics, stress is the relative emphasis that may be given to certain syllables in a word, or to certain words in a phrase or sentence. The term is also used for similar patterns of phonetic prominence inside syllables. The word "accent" is often used with this sense, but it may be used for other kinds of prominence; stress specifically may thus be called stress accent or dynamic accent.
The stress placed on syllables within words is called word stress or lexical stress. The stress placed on words within sentences is called sentence stress or prosodic stress. The latter is one of the three components of prosody, along with rhythm and intonation.

XLISP is a family of Lisp implementations written by David Betz.
The first version was a Lisp with object-oriented extensions for computers with limited power. The second version (XLISP 2.0) moved toward Common Lisp, but was by no means a complete implementation. After a long period of inactivity, the author released a new version based on XSCHEME, his Scheme implementation. The most current version follows the Scheme R3RS standard.

Alianza Federal de Mercedes,Also referred to as: Alianza de Pueblos y Pobladores (The Alliance of Towns and Settlers) and Alianza de Pueblos Libres (The Alliance of Free Pueblos) which in English translates to Federal Land Grant Alliance, was a group led by Reies Tijerina based in New Mexico in the 1960s that fought for the land rights of Chicano New Mexicans.Richard M. Gardner, Grito!  Reies Tijerina and the New Mexico Land Grant War of 1967,  Bobbs-Merrill Co, 1970, trade paperback, 292 pages, ISBN 0-672-50946-6; Random House, ISBN 0-609-02477-9Tony Hillerman, The Great Taos Bank Robbery and other Indian Country Affairs,  University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1973, trade paperback, 147 pages, ISBN 0-8263-0530-X
The Alianza had affiliates in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico and San Luis, Colorado.
Chicano residents had settled in the areas of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado centuries before.  Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States Congress ostensibly guaranteed that current residents would retain their land rights after the New Mexico territory was transferred to U.S. ownership. However, by the 1960s, many traditional shepherds had lost their land to cattle ranchers and the U.S. Forestry Service.

The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a North American mammal of the cat family Felidae, appearing during the Irvingtonian stage of around 1.8 million years ago (AEO).Paleobiology Database, collection 20397 Doña Ana County, New Mexico. Authorized and entered by Dr. John Alroy, Macquarie University, April 30, 1994. With 12 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to northern Mexico, including most of the continental United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edges, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but local populations are vulnerable to extirpation by coyotes and domestic animals. The bobcat is vital for controlling pest populations. 
With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the mid-sized Lynx genus. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as large as the domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.
Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it will hunt anything from insects, chickens, and small rodents to deer. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months. 
Although bobcats have been hunted extensively by humans, both for sport and fur, their population has proven resilient though declining in some areas. The elusive predator features in Native American mythology and the folklore of European settlers.

Griswold v. Connecticut, [tpl]ussc|381|479|1965[/tpl],[tpl]cite court |litigants=Griswold v. Connecticut |vol=381 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=479 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1965 |url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0381_0479_ZO.html[/tpl] is a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Constitution protected a right to privacy. The case involved a Connecticut statute that prohibits any person from using "any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception." By a vote of 7–2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the "right to marital privacy".
Although the Bill of Rights does not explicitly mention "privacy", Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the majority that the right was to be found in the "penumbras" and "emanations" of other constitutional protections, such as the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment. The right to privacy is seen as a right to "protection from governmental intrusion." Justice Arthur Goldberg wrote a concurring opinion in which he used the Ninth Amendment in support of the Supreme Court's ruling. Justice Arthur Goldberg and Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote concurring opinions in which they argued that privacy is protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Byron White also wrote a concurrence based on the due process clause.
Two Justices, Hugo Black and Potter Stewart, filed dissents. Justice Black argued that the right to privacy is to be found nowhere in the Constitution. Furthermore, he criticized the interpretations of the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to which his fellow Justices adhered. Justice Stewart called the Connecticut statute "an uncommonly silly law" but argued that it was nevertheless constitutional.
Since Griswold, the Supreme Court has cited the right to privacy in several rulings, most notably in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), where the Court ruled that a woman's choice to have an abortion was protected as a private decision between her and her doctor. For the most part, the Court has made these later rulings on the basis of Justice Harlan's substantive due process rationale.

[[Skid-steer loader]]

CATEGORIES: American inventions, Engineering vehicles, Agricultural machinery

A skid loader, skid-steer loader, or skidsteer, is a small rigid frame, engine-powered machine with lift arms used to attach a wide variety of labor-saving tools or attachments. Many manufacturers have their own versions of this vehicle, including: 
Bobcat, 
Terex, 
Case, 
Caterpillar, 
Gehl Company, 
Hyundai,
JCB, 
JLG, 
John Deere, 
Komatsu, 
LiuGong, 
New Holland, 
Volvo, 
Wacker Neuson, 
and more.
Skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel vehicles with the wheels mechanically locked in synchronization on each side, and the left-side drive wheels can be driven independently of the right-side drive wheels. The wheels typically have no separate steering mechanism and hold a fixed straight alignment on the body of the machine. By turning the left and right wheel pairs at different speeds, the machine turns by skidding, or dragging its fixed-orientation wheels across the ground. The extremely rigid frame and strong wheel bearings prevent the torsional forces caused by this dragging motion from damaging the machine. The skid-steering vehicle is turned by generating differential velocity at the opposite sides of the vehicle. Like tracked vehicles, the high ground friction produced by skid steers can rip up soft or fragile road surfaces. They can be converted to low ground friction by using specially designed wheels such as the Mecanum wheel. Skid-steer loaders are capable of zero-radius, "pirouette" turning, which makes them extremely maneuverable and valuable for applications that require a compact, agile loader. Skid-steer loaders are sometimes equipped with tracks in lieu of the wheels and such a vehicle is known as a "compact track loader", which is not the same as a skid-steer loader.http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/skid-steer.htm
Unlike in a conventional front loader, the lift arms in these machines are alongside the driver with the pivot points behind the driver's shoulders. Because of the operator's proximity to moving booms, early skid loaders were not as safe as conventional front loaders, particularly during entry and exit of the operator. Modern skid loaders have fully enclosed cabs and other features to protect the operator. Like other front loaders, it can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket or load material into a truck or trailer.

Cambridge.) of Chalcedon was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, and leader (scholarch) of the Platonic Academy from 339/8 to 314/3 BC. His teachings followed those of Plato, which he attempted to define more closely, often with mathematical elements. He distinguished three forms of being, the sensible, the intelligible, and a third compounded of the two, to which correspond respectively, sense, intellect and opinion. Unity and duality he considered to be gods which rule the universe, and the soul is a self-moving number. God pervades all things, and there are daemonical powers, intermediate between the divine and the mortal, which consist in conditions of the soul. He held that mathematical objects and the Platonic Ideas are identical, unlike Plato who distinguished them. In Ethics, he taught that virtue produces happiness, but that external goods can minister to it and enable it to effect its purpose.

Industrial policies are sector specific, unlike broader macroeconomic policies. They are often considered to be interventionist as opposed to laissez-faire economics. Examples of horizontal, economywide policies are tightening credit or taxing capital gain, while examples of vertical, sector-specific policies comprise protecting textiles from imports or subsidizing export industries. Free market advocates consider industrial policies as interventionist measures typical of mixed economy countries.
Many types of industrial policies contain common elements with other types of interventionist practices such as trade policy and fiscal policy. An example of a typical industrial policy is import-substitution-industrialization (ISI), where trade barriers are temporarily imposed on some key sectors, such as manufacturing.[tpl]sfn|Krugman|1987[/tpl] By selectively protecting certain industries, these industries are given time to learn (learning by doing) and upgrade. Once competitive enough, these restrictions are lifted to expose the selected industries to the international market.[tpl]sfn|Gereffi|Wyman|1990[/tpl]

Jean Rey (c. 1583 - c. 1645) was a French physician and chemist.
Born at Le Bugue, in the Périgord (Dordogne département), he studied medicine at the University of Montpellier. He practised medicine in his native town and corresponded with Descartes and Mersenne.
He discovered that the weight of lead and tin increases when they are calcinated, and attributed this phenomenon to the weight of air, which he believed to become denser when heated (Essays, 1630). He explained the greater weight of calcinated lead and tin by supposing that calcination involves the incorporation of air in the metal. This hypothesis would later be confirmed by Lavoisier, over a century later in 1789.
His discovery of the weight of air also made possible the invention of the barometer by Torricelli in 1643. He also developed a device called a "Thermoscope", a precursor of the thermometer. 
Jean Rey died at Le Bugue, where he had lived all his life.

[[Agricultural subsidy]]

CATEGORIES: Agricultural subsidies

An agricultural subsidy is a governmental subsidy paid to farmers and agribusinesses to supplement their income, manage the supply of agricultural commodities, and influence the cost and supply of such commodities. Examples of such commodities include; wheat, feed grains (grain used as fodder, such as maize or corn, sorghum, barley, and oats), cotton, milk, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, oilseeds such as soybeans, and meat products such as beef, pork, and lamb and mutton. Such subsidies are extremely controversial, both because of their complex effects and because of their political origins, which involve heavy lobbying from groups representing the interests of agribusiness.Ajit Karnik and Mala Lalvani, "Interest Groups, Subsidies and Public Goods: Farm Lobby in Indian Agriculture."

Joseph Russel(l) Robinson (July 8, 1892 – September 30, 1963) was a United States ragtime and dixieland jazz pianist and a composer of jazz, blues, and popular tunes.
Robinson, whose name appeared as "J. Russel Robinson", was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. He started publishing ragtime compositions in his teens; his early hits included "Sapho Rag" and "Eccentric".[tpl]Cite book|last=Jasen |first=David A. |coauthors=Trebor Jay Tichenor |title=Rags and Ragtime: A Musical History |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |year=1978 |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-486-25922-6 |page=150[/tpl]  With his drummer brother John he toured the Southern United States in the early 1910s including an extended stay in New Orleans. He also turned out hundreds of piano roll recordings for the US Music Company in Chicago and later the QRS Company in New York. He was known for his heavily blues and jazz influenced playing style. His style has been described as having a swinging, shimmying style with many right hand only blues breaks.
In October 1918, he joined W. C. Handy's publishing company Pace and Handy, supplying new arrangements and lyrics for popular editions of tunes like "The Memphis Blues" in the 1920s. Robinson joined the Original Dixieland Jazz Band when pianist Henry Ragas died in the Spanish Flu Pandemic in 1919. Also in 1919, he co-wrote the song "Though We're Miles and Miles Apart" with W.C. Handy and Charles H. Hillman. He also played piano with various popular and blues singers in phonograph recording sessions, accompanying singers such as Annette Hanshaw, Lucille Hegamin, Marion Harris, and Lizzie Miles. On some of his accompaniments to African American singers the accompaniment was listed on the record labels as being by Spencer Williams (with Williams' permission).

A tautochrone or isochrone curve (from Greek prefixes tauto- meaning same or iso- equal, and chrono time) is the curve for which the time taken by an object sliding without friction in uniform gravity to its lowest point is independent of its starting point.  The curve is a cycloid, and the time is equal to π times the square root of the radius over the acceleration of gravity.  The tautochrone curve is the same as the brachistochrone curve for any given starting point.

[[Brachistochrone curve]]

CATEGORIES: Curves

A brachistochrone curve (Gr. βράχιστος, brachistos - the shortest, χρόνος, chronos - time) or curve of fastest descent, is the path that will carry a point-like body from one place to another in the least amount of time. The body is released at rest from the starting point and is constrained to move without friction along the curve to the end point, while under the action of constant gravity.  The brachistochrone curve is the same as the tautochrone curve for a given starting point.

[[Calculus of variations]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus of variations, Mathematical optimization

Calculus of variations is a field of mathematical analysis that deals with maximizing or minimizing functionals, which are mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers. Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving  functions and their derivatives. The interest is in extremal functions that make the functional attain a maximum or minimum value – or stationary functions – those where the rate of change of the functional is zero.
A simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is obviously a straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics. A related problem is posed by Fermat's principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, where the optical length depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least action.
Many important problems involve functions of several variables. Solutions of boundary value problems for the Laplace equation satisfy the Dirichlet principle. Plateau's problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space: a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in a solution of soap suds. Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform, their mathematical interpretation is far from simple: there may be more than one locally minimizing surface, and they may have non-trivial topology.

[[List of trees native to New Zealand]]
CATEGORIES: Trees of New Zealand, Lists of trees, Lists of biota of New Zealand

New Zealand's long geological isolation means that most of its flora is unique.  There are a wide variety of native trees, adapted to all the various micro-climates in New Zealand. The native bush (forest) ranges from the subtropical Kauri forests of the northern North Island, temperate rainforests of the West Coast, the alpine forests of the Southern Alps and Fiordland to the coastal forests of the Abel Tasman National Park and the Catlins. 
In the early period of British colonisation, many New Zealand trees were known by names derived from the names of unrelated European trees, but more recently the trend has been to adopt the native Māori language names into English. For a listing in order of Māori name, with species names for most, see the Flora of New Zealand list of vernacular names.
The New Zealand Plant Conservation Network has published a list of New Zealand indigenous vascular plants including all 574 native trees and shrubs.NZPCN (2006). New Zealand indigenous vascular plant checklist. ISBN 0-473-11306-6. Written by Peter de Lange, John W.D. Sawyer and J.R. Rolfe.

[[Chicago blues]]

CATEGORIES: Music of Chicago, Illinois, Blues music genres, Chicago blues

The Chicago blues is a form of blues music indigenous to Chicago, Illinois. Chicago blues is a type of urban blues. Urban blues evolved from classic blues as a result of the great depression and developed in the first half of the twentieth century during the Great Migration, when Black workers moved from the Southern United States into the industrial cities of the Northern United States such as Chicago.William H. Frey, "The New Great Migration: Black Americans' Return to the South, 1965–2000", The Brookings Institution, May  2004, pp. 1–3, accessed 19 March 2008.
The two most significant cities for urban blues were Chicago and St. Louis. Urban blues started in these cities as music created by part-time musicians playing as street musicians, at rent parties, and other events within the black community. For example, bottleneck guitarist Kokomo Arnold was a steelworker and had a moonshine business that was far more profitable than his music.[tpl]cite book|last=Oakley|first=Giles|title=The Devil's Music: A History of the Blues|year=1976|publisher=Taplinger|location=New York|isbn=0800821890|page=177[/tpl] 
One of the most important early incubators for Chicago blues was the open air market on Maxwell street. The Maxwell street market was one of the largest open air markets in the nation. Residents of the black community would frequent it to buy and sell just about anything. It was a natural location for blues musicians to perform. The standard path for blues musicians was to start out as street musicians and at house parties and to eventually make their way to blues clubs. The first blues clubs in Chicago were mostly in predominantly black neighborhoods on the south side with a few in the smaller black neighborhoods on the west side. One of the most famous was Ruby Lee Gatewood's Tavern, known by patrons as "The Gates". During the 1930s virtually every big name artist played there.[tpl]cite book|last=Rowe|first=Mike|title=Chicago Blues the City and the Music|year=1873|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=London|isbn=0-306-80145-0|pp=40-49[/tpl] 
What drove the blues to international influence was the promotion of record companies such as Paramount Records, RCA Victor, and Columbia Records. [tpl]cite book|last=Oakley|first=Giles|title=The Devil's Music: A History of the Blues|year=1976|publisher=Taplinger|location=New York|isbn=0800821890|page=172[/tpl] Through such record companies Chicago blues became a commercial enterprise. The new style of music eventually reached Europe and the United Kingdom. In the 1960s, young British musicians were highly influenced by Chicago blues resulting in the British blues movement.

The Mississippi Delta area is famous both for its fertile soil and its poverty. Guitar, harmonica and cigar box guitar are the dominant instruments used, with slide guitar (usually on the steel guitar) being a hallmark of the style. The vocal styles range from introspective and soulful to passionate and fiery.  Delta blues is also regarded as a regional variation of country blues.

A port of the original rc to Unix is part of Plan 9 from User Space.  A rewrite of rc for Unix-like operating systems by Byron Rakitzis is also available but includes some incompatible changes.
Rc uses C-like control structures instead of ALGOL-like, as the original Bourne shell uses, except that it uses a construct if not instead of else and has a Bourne-like for loop to iterate over lists. In rc all variables are lists of strings, which eliminates the need for constructs like "$@".

[[Detroit blues]]

CATEGORIES: Blues music genres

Detroit blues is blues music played by musicians resident in Detroit, Michigan, particularly that played in the 1940s and 1950s. Detroit blues originated when Delta blues performers migrated north from the Mississippi Delta and Memphis, Tennessee to work in Detroit's industrial plants in the 1920s and 1930s. Typical Detroit blues was very similar to Chicago blues in style. The sound was distinguished from Delta blues by its use of electric amplified instruments and a more eclectic assortment of instruments, including the bass guitar and piano.
The only Detroit blues performer to achieve national fame is John Lee Hooker, as record companies and promoters have tended to ignore the Detroit scene in favor of the larger, more influential Chicago blues. The Detroit scene was centered on Black Bottom, a Detroit neighborhood.

The term "rockabilly" itself is a portmanteau of "rock" (from "rock 'n' roll") and "hillbilly", the latter a reference to the country music (often called "hillbilly music" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style's development. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing and boogie woogie.
Defining features of the rockabilly sound included strong rhythms, vocal twangs and common use of the tape echo,http://www.guitar.com/articles/fundamentals-rockabilly but the progressive addition of different instruments and vocal harmonies led to its "dilution". Initially popularised by artists such as Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis, the influence and success of the style waned in the 1960s; nonetheless, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, rockabilly enjoyed a major revival through acts such as the Stray Cats. An interest in the genre endures even in the 21st century, often within a subculture. Rockabilly has left a legacy, spawning a variety of sub-styles and influencing other genres such as punk rock.

Retrieved 6 July 2010.) is a subgenre of hard rock and heavy metal. It combines elements of these genres with punk rock and pop music, adding catchy hooks and guitar riffs, while borrowing from the aesthetic of 1970s glam rock.
It arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as Kix, Hanoi Rocks, Mötley Crüe and Quiet Riot. It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, Cinderella and Bon Jovi.
The genre rapidly lost mainstream interest from 1992 to 1994 with the rise of grunge and the release of albums such as Nirvana's Nevermind, but it has enjoyed something of a revival since the beginning of the new millennium with reunions of many popular acts from the genre`s 1980s heyday, as well as the retro styling of new bands including The Darkness and Steel Panther.

The floating holiday is similar to holidays set under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act.
King was the chief spokesman for nonviolent activism in the civil rights movement, which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law. The campaign for a federal holiday in King's honor began soon after his assassination in 1968. President Ronald Reagan signed the holiday into law in 1983, and it was first observed three years later. At first, some states resisted observing the holiday as such, giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays. It was officially observed in all 50 states for the first time in 2000.

[[Environmental ethics]]
CATEGORIES: Environmental ethics, Relational ethics

Environmental ethics is the part of environmental philosophy which considers extending the traditional boundaries of ethics from solely including humans to including the non-human world. It exerts influence on a large range of disciplines including environmental law, environmental sociology, ecotheology, ecological economics, ecology and environmental geography.
There are many ethical decisions that human beings make with respect to the environment. For example:
The academic field of environmental ethics grew up in response to the work of scientists such as Rachel Carson and events such as the first Earth Day in 1970, when environmentalists started urging philosophers to consider the philosophical aspects of environmental problems. Two papers published in Science had a crucial impact: Lynn White's "The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis" (March 1967)[tpl]cite journal|journal=Science| title=The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis| first=Lynn| last=White|date=March 1967| url=http://www.gnn.tv/headlines/9038/The_Historical_Roots_of_Our_Ecologic_Crisis | doi =  10.1126/science.155.3767.1203|volume=155|issue=3767|pages=1203–1207|pmid=17847526 [/tpl] and Garrett Hardin's "The Tragedy of the Commons" (December 1968). Also influential was Garett Hardin's later essay called "Exploring New Ethics for Survival", as well as an essay by Aldo Leopold in his A Sand County Almanac, called "The Land Ethic," in which Leopold explicitly claimed that the roots of the ecological crisis were philosophical (1949).[tpl]cite book|title=A Sand County Almanac| first=Aldo| last=Leopold| year=1949| chapter=The Land Ethic|isbn=1-59726-045-2[/tpl]
The first international academic journals in this field emerged from North America in the late 1970s and early 1980s – the US-based journal Environmental Ethics in 1979 and the Canadian based journal The Trumpeter: Journal of Ecosophy in 1983. The first British based journal of this kind, Environmental Values, was launched in 1992.

The population of Napier is about [tpl]NZ population data|Napier Zone|y|y|y|as of the |.[/tpl] About 18 kilometres south of Napier is the inland city of Hastings. These two neighbouring cities are often called "The Twin Cities" or "The Bay Cities" of New Zealand. The total population of the Napier-Hastings urban area is [tpl]NZ population data|Napier-Hastings|y[/tpl] people, which makes it the fifth-largest urban area in New Zealand, closely followed by Tauranga ([tpl]NZ population data|Tauranga|y[/tpl]), and Dunedin ([tpl]NZ population data|Dunedin|y[/tpl]), and trailing the Hamilton urban area ([tpl]NZ population data|Hamilton|y[/tpl]).
Napier is  about 320 kilometres northeast of the capital city of Wellington. Napier has a similar population to its neighbouring city of Hastings ([tpl]NZ population data|Hastings Zone|y[/tpl]) but is seen as the main centre due to it being closer in distance to both the seaport and the main airport that service Hawke's Bay. The City of Napier has a land area of 106 square kilometres and a population density of 540.0 per square kilometre.
Napier is the nexus of the largest wool centre in the Southern Hemisphere, and it has the primary export seaport for northeastern New Zealand – which is the largest producer of apples, pears, and stone fruit in New Zealand. Napier has also become an important grape and wine production area, with the grapes grown around Hastings and Napier being sent through the Port of Napier for export. Large amounts of sheep's wool, frozen meat, wood pulp, and timber also pass through Napier annually for export. Smaller amounts of these materials are shipped via road and railway to the large metropolitan areas of New Zealand itself, such as Auckland, Wellington and Hamilton.
Napier is a popular tourist city, with a unique concentration of 1930s Art Deco architecture, built after much of the city was razed in the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake. It also has one of the most photographed tourist attractions in the country, a statue on Marine Parade called Pania of the Reef. Thousands of people flock to Napier every February for the Art Deco Weekend event, a celebration of its Art Deco heritage and history. Other notable tourist events attracting many outsiders include the region's annual GEON Art Deco Weekend, and Mission Estate Concert at Mission Estate and Winery in the suburb of Greenmeadows.

The GNU build system, also known as the Autotools, is a suite of programming tools designed to assist in making source code packages portable to many Unix-like systems.
It can be difficult to make a software program portable: the C compiler differs from system to system; certain library functions are missing on some systems; header files may have different names. One way to handle this is to write conditional code, with code blocks selected by means of preprocessor directives (#ifdef); but because of the wide variety of build environments this approach quickly becomes unmanageable. Autotools is designed to address this problem more manageably.
Autotools is part of the GNU toolchain and is widely used in many free software and open source packages.  Its component tools are free software-licensed under the GNU General Public License with special license exceptionsAutoconf license exceptionlibtool HACKING including all pertinent license exceptions permitting its use with proprietary software.

Gloria May Josephine Swanson ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|ɑː|n|s|ən[/tpl]; March 27, 1899 – April 4, 1983) was an American actress, singer and producer, who is best known for her role as Norma Desmond, a faded silent film star, in the critically acclaimed film Sunset Boulevard (1950). She was one of the most prominent stars during the silent film era as both an actress and a fashion icon, especially under the direction of Cecil B. DeMille, making dozens of silent films and being nominated for the first Academy Award in the Best Actress category. She also produced her own films like Sadie Thompson and The Love of Sunya.  In 1929, Swanson transitioned to talkies with The Trespasser.  However, personal problems and changing tastes saw her popularity wane during the 1930s when she moved into theater and television.

David Alfaro Siqueiros (born José de Jesús Alfaro Siqueiros, December 29, 1896, in Chihuahua, Chih. - January 6, 1974, in Cuernavaca, Morelos) was a Mexican social realist painter, better known for his large murals in fresco. Along with Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, he established "Mexican Muralism." He was a Stalinist and member of the Mexican Communist Party who participated in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Leon Trotsky in May 1940.
His surname was Alfaro; like another eminent 20th century painter, Pablo Ruíz y Picasso, Siqueiros went by his mother's surname. It was long believed that he was born in Camargo, Chihuahua, but in 2003 it was proven that he had actually been born in Chihuahua's capital city but grew up in Irapuato, Guanajuato, at least from the age of six. The discovery of his birth certificate, made by a Mexican art curator, was announced the following year (2004) by art critic Raquel Tibol, who was renowned as the leading authority on Mexican Muralism[tpl]sfn|Conaculta|2011[/tpl] and who had been a close acquaintance of Siqueiros.[tpl]sfn|Proceso|2004[/tpl] Siqueiros switched his given name to "David" after his first wife took to calling him it admiringly, in allusion to Michelangelo's, David.[tpl]sfn|Proceso|2004[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Gente Sur|2005[/tpl] Another factual confusion is the year of his birth.

James Henry Scullin (18 September 1876 – 28 January 1953) was an Australian Labor Party politician and the ninth Prime Minister of Australia. Scullin led Labor to government at the 1929 election. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 transpired just two days after his swearing in, which would herald the beginning of the Great Depression in Australia. Already in a weak political position, the economic crisis would prove overwhelming for Scullin, with interpersonal and policy disagreements causing a three-way split of his party that would bring down the government in late 1931. Despite his chaotic term of office, Scullin remained a leading figure in the Labor movement throughout his lifetime, and served as an éminence grise in various capacities for the party until his retirement in 1949.
The son of working-class Irish-immigrants, Scullin spent much of his early life as a laborer and grocer in Ballarat. An autodidact and passionate debater, Scullin would join the Australian Labor Party in 1903, beginning a career spanning five decades. He was a political organizer and newspaper editor for the party, and was elected to the House of Representatives first in 1910 and then again in 1922 until 1949. Scullin quickly established himself as a leading voice in parliament, rapidly rising to become deputy leader of the party in 1927 and then Leader of the Opposition in 1928.
Winning a landslide election in 1929, events took a dramatic change with the crisis on Wall Street and the rapid onset of the Great Depression around the world, which hit heavily indebted Australia hard. Scullin and his Treasurer Ted Theodore responded by developing several plans during 1930 and 1931 to repay foreign debt, provide relief to farmers and create economic stimulus to curb unemployment based on deficit spending and expansionary monetary policy. Although the Keynesian Revolution would see these ideas adopted by most Western nations by the end of the decade, in 1931 such ideas were considered radical and the plans were bitterly opposed by many who feared hyperinflation and economic ruin. The still opposition-dominated Senate, and the conservative-dominated boards of the Commonwealth Bank and Loan Council, repeatedly blocked the plans.
With the prospect of bankruptcy facing the government, Scullin backed down and instead advanced the Premiers' Plan, a far more conservative measure that met the crisis with severe cutbacks in government spending. Pensioners and other core Labor constituencies were severely affected by the cuts, leading to a widespread revolt and multiple defections in parliament. After several months of infighting the government collapsed and the newly formed United Australia Party took power at the subsequent 1931 election.
Scullin would remain party leader for several more years but the party split would not be healed until after Scullin's return to the backbenches in 1935. Scullin became a respected elder voice within the party and leading authority on taxation and government finance, and would eventually play a significant role in reforming both when the ALP returned to government in 1941. Although disappointed with his own term of office, he nonetheless lived long enough to see many of his government's ideas implemented by subsequent governments before his death in 1953.

A chapel is a religious place of fellowship, prayer and worship – most often associated with interfaith worship services. It may be part of a larger structure or complex, such as a church, synagogue, mosque,  college, hospital, palace, prison or funeral home, located on board a military or commercial ship, or it may be an entirely free-standing building, sometimes with its own grounds.Catholic Encyclopedia  Many military installations have chapels for the use of military personnel, normally under the leadership of a military chaplain. Until the Protestant Reformation, a chapel denoted a place of worship that was either at a secondary location that was not the main responsibility of the local parish priest, or that belonged to a person or institution.  Most larger churches had one or more secondary altars, which if they occupied a distinct space, would often be called a chapel. Although chapels frequently refer to Christian places of worship, they are also commonly found in Jewish synagogues and do not necessarily connote a specific denomination. Non-denominational chapels are commonly encountered as part of a non-religious institution such as a hospital, airport, university, prison or military installation.[tpl]cite news|title=Multi-faith Spaces: Symptoms and Agents of Religious and Social Change|work=University of Manchester|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/mfs|first=Chris|last=Hewson|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate= September 14, 2012[/tpl] In England, where the Church of England is established by law, nondenominational or inter-faith chapels in such institutions may nonetheless be consecrated by the local Anglican bishop.

John Dickson Carr (November 30, 1906 – February 27, 1977) was an American author of detective stories, who also published under the pen names Carter Dickson, Carr Dickson and Roger Fairbairn.
Carr is generally regarded as one of the greatest writers of so-called "Golden Age" mysteries, complex, plot-driven stories in which the puzzle is paramount. He was influenced in this regard by the works of Gaston Leroux and by the Father Brown stories of G. K. Chesterton. He was a master of the locked room mystery, in which a detective solves apparently impossible crimes. The Dr. Fell mystery The Hollow Man (1935), usually considered Carr's masterpiece, was selected in 1981 as the best locked-room mystery of all time by a panel of 17 mystery authors and reviewers.http://mysteryfile.com/Locked_Rooms/Library.html He was also a pioneer of the historical mystery.
A resident of England for a number of years, Carr is often grouped among "British-style" mystery writers. Most (though certainly not all) of his novels had English settings, especially country villages and estates, and English characters. His two best-known fictional detectives were English.
The son of Wooda Nicholas Carr, a U.S. congressman from Pennsylvania, Carr graduated from The Hill School in Pottstown in 1925 and Haverford College in 1929. In the early 1930s, he moved to England, where he married an Englishwoman. He began his mystery-writing career there, returning to the United States as an internationally known author in 1948.
In 1950, his biography of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brought Carr the first of his two Special Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America; the second came in 1970, in recognition of his 40-year career as a mystery writer.  He was also presented the MWA's Grand Master award in 1963.  Carr was one of only two Americans ever admitted to the British Detection Club.
In early spring 1963, while living in Mamaroneck, New York, Carr suffered a stroke, which paralyzed his left side. He continued to write using one hand, and for several years contributed a regular column of mystery and detective book reviews, "The Jury Box", to Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. Carr eventually moved to Greenville, South Carolina, and he died there of lung cancer in 1977.

CATEGORIES: 1947 births, Living people, College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University alumni, American journalists, Writers from Minneapolis, Minnesota

Larry Millett (b. 1947 in Minneapolis, Minnesota) is an American journalist and author.  He is the former (retired 2002) architectural critic for the St. Paul Pioneer Press, a daily newspaper in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the author of several books on the history of architecture in Minnesota.  He has also written a series of Sherlock Holmes mysteries set in the United States and Minnesota in the 1890s.  The books feature the character Shadwell Rafferty, who assists Holmes in his American investigations.
Millett attended St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1969.  He went on to Chicago, Illinois, where he obtained an English Masters degree in 1970 from the University of Chicago.  Millett worked at the Pioneer Press from 1972 until 1984 when he had an opportunity to study architecture at the University of Michigan.  When he returned to St. Paul in 1985, he became the newspaper's first architecture critic.
He has written articles for several historical and architectural magazines in the Midwest, mostly focusing on works by Prairie School architects such as Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright.
Millett's Lost Twin Cities is probably the best known of his works in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region largely because KTCA, a local public television station, created a video documentary by the same name which covered a few of the buildings in the book.  The video was narrated by Dave Moore, a noted area TV journalist, and is often replayed when the station is running a pledge drive.

Alfred Emanuel "Al" Smith (December 30, 1873 – October 4, 1944) was an American statesman who was elected Governor of New York four times and was the Democratic U.S. presidential candidate in 1928. He was the foremost urban leader of the efficiency-oriented Progressive Movement and was noted for achieving a wide range of reforms as governor in the 1920s. He was also linked to the notorious Tammany Hall machine that controlled New York City's politics; was a strong opponent of Prohibition and was the first Catholic nominee for President. His candidacy mobilized Catholic votes—especially women who previously had not voted.  It also mobilized the anti-Catholic vote, which was strongest in the South.
As a committed "wet" (anti-Prohibition) candidate, Smith attracted not only drinkers but also voters angered by the corruption and lawlessness brought about by prohibition.Daniel Okrent, Last Call, 2010. However, he was feared among Protestants, including German Lutherans and Southern Baptists, who believed that the Catholic Church and the pope would dictate his policies. Most importantly, this was a time of national prosperity under a Republican Presidency, and Smith lost in a landslide to Republican Herbert Hoover. Four years later Smith sought the 1932 nomination but was defeated by his former ally and successor as New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. Smith entered business in New York City and became an increasingly vocal opponent of Roosevelt's New Deal. Roosevelt blocked Smith from having any major role in World War II.

[[Kimball Bent]]

Kimball Bent (24 August 1837 – 22 May 1916), also known as "Kimble Bent", was a soldier and adventurer, who deserted from the British Army during the New Zealand Wars and lived for the reminder of his life among the Maori people of New Zealand.
Bent was born in Eastport, Maine USA.  He ran away to sea at 17 and spent three years travelling the Atlantic seaboard as a sailor/ gunner in the US Navy.  He returned to Eastport but was restless and sailed to Liverpool, England.  Penniless and seeking adventure on 18 October 1859 he enlisted in the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot in the British Army. He served in India and his unit was posted to New Zealand in 1861. His record was dubious, and he was repeatedly disciplined for various military infractions including disobedience and drunkenness. This discipline included a prison sentence in Wellington, and receiving lashes in front of his company. Bent accordingly decided to desert in June 1865 while serving in Taranaki.
Bent was found by a local Māori chief of the Ngāti Ruanui iwi in South Taranaki and eventually became accepted as a part of the local tribe. He fell in with Titokowaru's followers in 1867 and fought with them against the colonists in what has become known as Titokowaru's War until their eventual defeat in 1869. 
Bent then went into hiding first in the backblocks of Taranaki and later in Wairau, Blenheim.  He spent his remaining years working in several trades including as a builder, fisherman, horticulturist, tattooist, traditional healer using Maori medicine and even a confectioner.  He remained a wanted deserter with a reward on his head for many years, but eventually the authorities stopped looking for him.  In 1903 he was rediscovered, and a book was written about his life by James Cowan. Entitled The adventures of Kimble Bent: a story of wild life in the New Zealand bush,, it was something of sensation at the time.
He died in Wairau Hospital on 22 May 1916. 
More recently, his tale has been fictionalised by New Zealand author Maurice Shadbolt in his 1990 historical novel Monday's Warriors and in the 2011 graphic novel, Kimble Bent Malcontent: The Wild Adventures of a Runaway Soldier in Old-Time New Zealand by Chris Grosz.

[[Classful network]]

CATEGORIES: Internet architecture

A classful network is a network addressing architecture used in the Internet from 1981 until the introduction of Classless Inter-Domain Routing in 1993. The method divides the address space for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) into five address classes. Each class, coded in the first four bits of the address, defines either a different network size, i.e. number of hosts for unicast addresses (classes A, B, C), or a multicast network (class D). The fifth class (E) address range is reserved for future or experimental purposes.
Since its discontinuation, remnants of classful network concepts remain in practice only in limited scope in the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g., default subnet mask), but the terms are often still used erroneously by people working in IT.

[[Partially ordered group]]

CATEGORIES: Ordered algebraic structures, Ordered groups, Order theory

In abstract algebra, a partially ordered group is a group (G,+) equipped with a partial order "≤" that is translation-invariant; in other words, "≤" has the property that, for all a, b, and g in G, if a ≤ b then a+g ≤ b+g and g+a ≤ g+b.
An element x of G is called positive element if 0 ≤ x. The set of elements 0 ≤ x is often denoted with G+, and it is called the positive cone of G. So we have a ≤ b if and only if -a+b ∈ G+.
By the definition, we can reduce the partial order to a monadic property: a ≤ b if and only if 0 ≤ -a+b.
For the general group G, the existence of a positive cone specifies an order on G. A group G is a partially ordered group if and only if there exists a subset H (which is G+) of G such that:
A partially ordered group G with positive cone G+ is said to be unperforated if n · g ∈ G+ for some positive integer n implies g ∈ G+. Being unperforated means there is no "gap" in the positive cone G+.
If the order on the group is a linear order, then it is said to be a linearly ordered group.
If the order on the group is a lattice order, i.e. any two elements have a least upper bound, then it is a lattice-ordered group.
A Riesz group is an unperforated partially ordered group with a property slightly weaker than being a lattice ordered group. Namely, a Riesz group satisfies the Riesz interpolation property: if x1, x2, y1, y2 are elements of G and xi ≤ yj, then there exists z ∈ G such that xi ≤ z ≤ yj.
If G and H are two partially ordered groups, a map from G to H is a morphism of partially ordered groups if it is both a group homomorphism and a monotonic function. The partially ordered groups, together with this notion of morphism, form a category.
Partially ordered groups are used in the definition of valuations of fields.

The city of Hastings is one of two major urban areas in the Hawke's Bay region of the North Island of New Zealand. Hastings city is the administrative centre of the Hastings District. Hastings is some 20 km inland from the neighbouring port city of Napier.
Less than twenty kilometres separate the centres of Hastings and Napier, and as such the two are often grouped together as "The Twin Cities" or "The Bay Cities", and are increasingly treated together in official statistics. Their combined population is [tpl]NZ population data|Napier-Hastings|y[/tpl], making the combined urban area the fifth-largest by population in New Zealand, between Hamilton ([tpl]NZ population data|Hamilton|y[/tpl]) and Tauranga ([tpl]NZ population data|Tauranga|y[/tpl]).
The principal settlements in the Hastings District are the city of Hastings itself and the nearby towns of Flaxmere and Havelock North. These main centres are surrounded by thirty-eight rural settlements, including Clive, Haumoana and Bridge Pā. Hastings District covers an area of [tpl]convert|5229|km2|sqmi[/tpl] and has [tpl]Decimals|[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]NZ population data|Hastings District|y[/tpl]|R[/tpl]/[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]NZ population data|New Zealand|y[/tpl]|R[/tpl]*100|1[/tpl] % of the population of New Zealand, ranking it fourteenth in size out of the seventy-four territorial authorities. Since the merger of the surrounding and satellite settlements, Hastings District Council has grown to become part of the two large urban areas in Hawke's Bay.
The Hastings district has a long history of a food producing region, and is commonly referred to as the 'Fruit Bowl of New Zealand'. The fertile plains surrounding the city have grow an abundance of stone fruit, vegetables, and more recently has become the base of New Zealand's red wine industry. Associated business included food processing, agricultural services, rural finance, and freight. Hastings also is the major service centre for the surrounding inland pastoral communities while the service industry and tourism is growing rapidly.

[[Knitting needle]]

CATEGORIES: Knitting tools and materials

A knitting needle or knitting pin is a tool in hand-knitting to produce knitted fabrics.  They generally have a long shaft and taper at their end, but they are not nearly as sharp as sewing needles.  Their purpose is two-fold.  The long shaft holds the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, to prevent them from unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to form new stitches. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place.  In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously.
The size of a needle is described first by its diameter and secondly by its length.  The size of the new stitch is determined in large part by the diameter of the knitting needle used to form it, because that affects the length of the yarn-loop drawn through the previous stitch.  Thus, large stitches can be made with large needles, whereas fine knitting requires fine needles. In most cases, the knitting needles being used in hand-knitting are of the same diameter; however, in uneven knitting, needles of different sizes may be used. Larger stitches may also be made by wrapping the yarn more than once around the needles with every stitch. The length of a needle determines how many stitches it can hold at once; for example, very large projects such as a shawl with hundreds of stitches might require a longer needle than a small project such as a scarf or bootie.  Various sizing systems for needles are in common use.

[[Demarchy]]
CATEGORIES: Democracy, Political systems, Political theories

Demarchy (or lottocracy) is a form of government in which the state is governed by randomly selected decision makers who have been selected by sortition (lot) from a broadly inclusive pool of eligible citizens.  These groups, sometimes termed "policy juries", "citizens' juries", or "consensus conferences", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that juries decide criminal cases.
Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional representative democracy, which is widely subject to manipulation by special interests and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher John Burnheim, who coined the term demarchy, random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.
More generally, random selection of decision makers from a larger group is known as sortition (from the Latin base for lottery). The Athenian democracy made much use of sortition, with nearly all government offices filled by lottery (of full citizens) rather than by election. Candidates were almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of wealth and status.
In the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario, a group of citizens was randomly selected to create a Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform to investigate and recommend changes to the provinces' electoral systems. A similar system happened with the Dutch Burgerforum Kiesstelsel. The Old Order Amish use a combination of election and sortition to select church leaders; men receiving two or three nominations to fill a vacancy (the number varies by district) are then asked to select a psalm book containing a slip of paper, one of those slips being marked to indicate who will take on the burden of the position.

[[Logit]]

CATEGORIES: Categorical data, Functions and mappings

The logit ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|oʊ|dʒ|ɪ|t[/tpl] [tpl]respell|LOH|jit[/tpl]) function is the inverse of the sigmoidal "logistic" function used in mathematics, especially in statistics.  When the function's parameter represents a probability [tpl]mvar|p[/tpl], the logit function gives the log-odds, or the logarithm of the odds [tpl]mvar|p[/tpl]/(1-[tpl]mvar|p[/tpl]).http://itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman2/auxillar/logoddra.htm

[[Odds]]

CATEGORIES: Probability theory, Statistical ratios, Statistical terminology, Wagering

Odds are a numerical expression used in gambling and statistics to reflect the likelihood that a particular event will take place. Conventionally, they are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers. 
In gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a wager or bet. Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a bookmaker) is staking six times the amount that the second party is. In statistics, odds represent the probability that an event will take place. Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean that there are six possible outcomes in which the event will not take place to every one where it will. In other words, the probability that X will not happen is six times the probability that it will. 
The gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a fair one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other.

[[Adaptive filter]]

CATEGORIES: Digital signal processing, Nonlinear filters

An adaptive filter is a system with a linear filter that has a transfer function controlled by variable parameters and a means to adjust those parameters according to an optimization algorithm.  Because of the complexity of the optimization algorithms, most adaptive filters are digital filters. Adaptive filters are required for some applications because some parameters of the desired processing operation (for instance, the locations of reflective surfaces in a reverberant space) are not known in advance or are changing. The closed loop adaptive filter uses feedback in the form of an error signal to refine its transfer function.
Generally speaking, the closed loop adaptive process involves the use of a cost function, which is a criterion for optimum performance of the filter, to feed an algorithm, which determines how to modify filter transfer function to minimize the cost on the next iteration.  The most common cost function is the mean square of the error signal.
As the power of digital signal processors has increased, adaptive filters have become much more common and are now routinely used in devices such as mobile phones and other communication devices, camcorders and digital cameras, and medical monitoring equipment.

Tammany Hall, also known as the Society of St. Tammany, the Sons of St. Tammany, or the Columbian Order, was a New York City political organization founded in 1786 and incorporated on May 12, 1789, as the Tammany Society.  It was the Democratic Party political machine that played a major role in controlling New York City and New York State politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise up in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s.  It controlled Democratic Party nominations and political patronage in Manhattan from the mayoral victory of Fernando Wood in 1854 through the election of John P. O'Brien in 1932.  
The Tammany Society was named for Tamanend, a Native American leader of the Lenape, and emerged as the center for Democratic-Republican Party politics in the city in the early 19th century.  The "Hall" serving as the Society's headquarters was built in 1868 on East 14th Street, marking an era when Tammany Hall became the city affiliate of the Democratic Party, controlling most of the New York City elections afterwards.
The Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city's ever-expanding immigrant community, which functioned as a base of political capital. The Tammany Hall ward boss or ward heeler – "wards" were the city's smallest political units from 1686 to 1938 – served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage.  Beginning in late 1845, Tammany power surged with the influx of millions of Irish immigrants to New York.  From 1872, Tammany had an Irish "boss," and in 1928 a Tammany hero, New York Governor Al Smith won the Democratic presidential nomination.  However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for graft and political corruption, perhaps most infamously under William M. "Boss" Tweed in the mid-19th century. 
Tammany Hall's influence waned in the 20th Century; in 1932, Mayor Jimmy Walker was forced from office, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt stripped Tammany of federal patronage.  Republican Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor on a Fusion ticket and became the first anti-Tammany mayor to be re-elected.  A brief resurgence in Tammany power in the 1950s under the leadership of Carmine DeSapio was met with Democratic Party opposition led by Eleanor Roosevelt, Herbert Lehman, and the New York Committee for Democratic Voters.  By the mid-1960s Tammany Hall ceased to exist.

[[Luscombe Aircraft]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct aircraft manufacturers of the United States, Companies based in Kansas City, Missouri, Companies based in Trenton, New Jersey, Defunct companies based in Missouri

Luscombe aircraft was a United States aircraft manufacturer from 1933 to 1950.
Donald A. Luscombe founded the Luscombe aircraft company in 1933, in Kansas City, Missouri. Luscombe had already made his reputation as an aircraft designer with the Monocoupe series of light aircraft, but he felt that the tube-and-fabric method of construction was too expensive and inefficient.  He planned to create a light aircraft that was all-metal monocoque construction.
The new company's first aircraft was the Luscombe Model 1, commonly known as the Luscombe Phantom.  This was a high-wing, two-place monoplane of all-metal construction (except for the fabric wing covering). The Phantom was tricky to land, and was never a financial success.
In the winter of 1934/35, Luscombe Aircraft moved to Trenton, New Jersey, and was incorporated as the Luscombe Aircraft Development Corporation.  Shortly afterwards, the Luscombe School of Aeronautics opened.  Trainees from the school worked in the Luscombe factory, and the school helped support the aircraft company for many years.
In 1936, the company designed and began flying a simplified version of the Phantom known as the Luscombe 90, or Model 4. 
The Luscombe Aircraft Corporation was re-formed as a New Jersey company in 1937, and a new design was begun.  The Luscombe 50 (Model 8) became the company's most famous product. The Type Certificate for the Model 8 is A-694 and is now held by Good Earthkeeping Organization, Inc. of Corona, California, USA.
In 1946, Luscombe also introduced the four-place model 11, designed to specifications produced by the Flying Farmers of America. 
The firm was bankrupt in 1948 and its assets were purchased the following year by Temco.

Accessed online 22 April 2010. (Note however that the OED has final /ɪ/, as this entry predates its acceptance of happy-tensing.) with scientific names Ribes uva-crispa (and syn. Ribes grossularia), is a species of Ribes (which also includes the currants). It is native to Europe, northwestern Africa, west, south and southeast Asia. Gooseberry bushes produce an edible fruit and are grown on both a commercial and domestic basis.
Although usually placed as a subgenus within Ribes, a few taxonomists treat Grossularia as a separate genus, although hybrids between gooseberry and blackcurrant (e.g., the jostaberry) are possible. The subgenus Grossularia differs somewhat from currants, chiefly in their spiny stems, and in that their flowers grow one to three together on short stems, not in racemes.  It is one of several similar species in the subgenus Grossularia; for the other related species (e.g., North American Gooseberry Ribes hirtellum), see the genus page Ribes.

[[Cushion]]

CATEGORIES: Pillows, Furnishings, Interior design

A cushion is a soft bag of some ornamental material, stuffed with wool, hair, feathers, polyester staple fiber, non-woven material, or even paper torn into fragments. It may be used for sitting or kneeling upon, or to soften the hardness or angularity of a chair or couch.
A cushion is also referred to as a bolster, hassock, headrest and a sham.[tpl]cite web| url= http://thesaurus.com/browse/cushion+?s=t|title=Cushion|publisher=Thesaurus.com|accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl]
Cushions and rugs can be used temporarily outside to soften a hard ground. They can be placed on sunloungers and used to prevent annoyances from moist grass and biting insects. Some dialects of English use this word to refer to throw pillows as well.
The cushion is a very ancient article of furniture; the inventories of the contents of palaces and great houses in the early Middle Ages constantly made mention of them. Cushions were then often of great size, covered with leather, and firm enough to serve as a seat, but the steady tendency of all furniture has been to grow smaller with time.
Cushions were, and are, used as seats at all events in France and Spain at a very much later period, and in Saint-Simon's time it is found that in the Spanish court they were still regarded as a peculiarly honourable substitute for a chair. In France, the right to kneel upon a cushion in church behind the king was jealously guarded and strictly regulated, as it is learnt again from Saint-Simon. This type of cushion was called a carreau, or square. When seats were rude and hard, cushions may have been a necessity; they are now one of the minor luxuries of life.
Decorative cushions are likely to have a fancy cover material which are patterned style and generally used to decorate furniture.

[[Locked room mystery]]

CATEGORIES: Crime fiction, Detective fiction, Puzzles, Locked room mysteries

The locked room mystery is a sub-genre of detective fiction in which a crime—almost always murder—is committed under apparently impossible circumstances. The crime in question typically involves a crime scene that no intruder could have entered or left, e.g., a locked room. Following other conventions of classic detective fiction, the reader is normally presented with the puzzle and all of the clues, and is encouraged to solve the mystery before the solution is revealed in a dramatic climax.
To investigators of the crime, the prima facie impression almost invariably is that the perpetrator has vanished into thin air. The need for a rational explanation for the crime is what drives the protagonist to look beyond these appearances and solve the puzzle.

A  washing machine (laundry machine, clothes washer, or washer) is a machine to wash laundry, such as clothing and sheets. The term is mostly applied only to machines that use water as opposed to dry cleaning (which uses alternative cleaning fluids, and is performed by specialist businesses) or ultrasonic cleaners. Washing entails immersing, dipping, rubbing, or scrubbing in water usually accompanied by detergent, or bleach.  The simplest machines may simply agitate clothes in water; automatic machines may fill, empty, wash, spin, and heat in a cycle. Most washing machines remove substantial amounts of water from the laundry at the end of a wash cycle, but do not completely dry it.

Other prominent members at various points in the band's lifespan included Jaco Pastorius, Peter Erskine, Alex Acuña, Alphonso Johnson, Victor Bailey, Airto Moreira and Chester Thompson.
Alongside Miles Davis's electric bands, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever, and Headhunters, Weather Report is considered to be one of the earliest pre-eminent jazz fusion bands. As a continuous working unit, Weather Report outlasted all of its contemporaries despite (or perhaps because of) frequent changes of personnel, with a career lasting sixteen years between 1970 and 1986.

[[Glove]]

CATEGORIES: Gloves, Protective gear, Protestant vestments

A glove (Middle English from Old English glof) is a garment covering the whole hand. Gloves have separate sheaths or openings for each finger and the thumb; if there is an opening but no covering sheath for each finger they are called "fingerless gloves". Fingerless gloves with one large opening rather than individual openings for each finger are sometimes called gauntlets. Gloves which cover the entire hand or fist but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called mittens. Mittens are warmer than gloves made of the same material because fingers maintain their warmth better when they are in contact with each other. Reduced surface area reduces heat loss.
A hybrid of glove and mitten also exists, which contains open-ended sheaths for the four fingers (as in a fingerless glove, but not the thumb) and also an additional compartment encapsulating the four fingers as a mitten would. This compartment can be lifted off the fingers and folded back to allow the individual fingers ease of movement and access while the hand remains covered. The usual design is for the mitten cavity to be stitched onto the back of the fingerless glove only, allowing it to be flipped over (normally held back by Velcro or a button) to transform the garment from a mitten to a glove. These hybrids are called convertible mittens or glittens, a combination of "glove" and "mittens".
Gloves protect and comfort hands against cold or heat, damage by friction, abrasion or chemicals, and disease; or in turn to provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch. Latex, nitrile rubber or vinyl disposable gloves are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting glove prints, law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence.Police use glove prints to catch criminals In many jurisdictions the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense.James W.H. McCord and Sandra L. McCord, Criminal Law and Procedure for the paralegal: a systems approach, supra, p. 127.
Fingerless gloves are useful where dexterity is required that gloves would restrict. Cigarette smokers and church organists use fingerless gloves. Some gloves include a gauntlet that extends partway up the arm. Cycling gloves for road racing or touring are usually fingerless. Guitar players often use fingerless gloves in circumstances when weather is much too cold to play with an un-covered hand.
Gloves are made of materials including cloth, knitted or felted wool, leather, rubber, latex, neoprene, and metal (as in mail). Gloves of kevlar protect the wearer from cuts. Gloves and gauntlets are integral components of pressure suits and spacesuits such as the Apollo/Skylab A7L which went to the moon. Spacesuit gloves combine toughness and environmental protection with a degree of sensitivity and flexibility.

[[Gramophone record]]

CATEGORIES: 1894 in music, 1894 introductions, Audio storage, Edwardian era, German inventions, Recorded music

A gramophone record (phonograph record in American English) or vinyl record, commonly known as "a record", is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat polyvinyl chloride (previously Shellac) disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc. Phonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12", 10", 7"), the rotational speed in rpm at which they are played (33[tpl]frac|1|3[/tpl], 45, 78), and their time capacity resulting from a combination of those parameters (LP − long playing, SP − single, EP − 12" single or extended play); their reproductive quality or "fidelity" ("high fidelity", "orthophonic", "full-range", etc.), and the number of audio channels provided ("mono", "stereo", "quad", etc.).
The Phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century, replacing the phonograph cylinder record, with which it had co-existed, by the 1920s. By the late 1980s, digital media, in the form of the Compact Disc, had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991.End of track.

The compound 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile (also called o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile) (chemical formula: C10H5ClN2), a cyanocarbon, is the defining component of a tear gas commonly referred to as CS gas, which is used as a riot control agent. CS gas is an aerosol of a volatile solvent (a substance that dissolves other active substances and that easily evaporates) and 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, which is a solid compound at room temperature. CS gas is generally accepted as being non-lethal. It was discovered by two Americans, Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton, at Middlebury College in 1928, and the chemical's name is derived from the first letters of the scientists' surnames.[tpl]OED|CS[/tpl]"CS, chemical compound." columbia.thefreedictionary.com.

Xenusion auerswaldae is an early arthropod/onychophore known from two specimens found in glacial debris in Germany.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1502-3931.1989.tb01679.x[/tpl] They probably originated in the Kalmarsund Sandstone of Southern Sweden (Jaeger and Martinsson 1966), which was deposited in the Lower Cambrian (Upper Tommotian–Lower Atdabanian; Stages 2→3).[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.gr.2007.09.001[/tpl] The specimens are not especially well preserved. The older specimen is 10 cm or so in length with a narrow, weakly segmented body. A depression runs up the bottom on all but the rearmost segments. There is a slightly bulbous tail, and each segment beyond that seems to have a single pair of tapering annulated legs similar to the modern onychophore, but without claws. Nine segments are present. There is a spine on each body bump and faint transverse parallel striations on the annulations on the legs. The legs of what is possibly the foremost segments are either missing or not preserved. The head is believed to be missing or is poorly preserved.  If Xenusion is an arthropod/onychophore, it is one of the oldest currently known fossils of a mobile, modern animal.
Xenusion has been reinterpreted as an Ediacaran frond animal by Tarlo, and a drawing of that interpretation has been presented by McMenamin. Assuming that the creature is actually a lobopodian, the original specimen would appear to be part of an animal about 20 cm in length.
In a photograph presented in The Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Volume O, the organism's appearance seems to support the original interpretation more.  Further studies of Xenusiid close the possibility of a Rangeomorphy affinity.

[[Blackcurrant]]

CATEGORIES: Ribes, Berries, Flora of Asia, Flora of Europe, Fruits originating in Asia, Plants described in 1753

The blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum) is a woody shrub in the family Grossulariaceae grown for its piquant berries. It is native to temperate parts of central and northern Europe and northern Asia where it prefers damp fertile soils and is widely cultivated both commercially and domestically. It is winter hardy but cold weather at flowering time during the  spring reduces the size of the crop. Bunches of small, glossy black fruit develop along the stems in the summer and can be harvested by hand or by machine. The fruit is rich in vitamin C, various other nutrients, phytochemicals and antioxidants. Blackcurrants can be eaten raw but are usually cooked in a variety of sweet or savoury dishes. They are used to make jams, jellies and syrups and are grown commercially for the juice market. The fruit is also used in the preparation of alcoholic beverages and both fruit and foliage have uses in traditional medicine and the preparation of dyes.
As a crop, the blackcurrant suffers from several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, caused by a virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is white pine blister rust which requires two alternating hosts, the blackcurrant and certain coniferous trees. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America. As a result, the blackcurrant has been subject to restrictions in the United States as a disease vector for most of the 20th century. Breeding is being undertaken in Europe and New Zealand to produce fruit with better eating qualities and bushes with greater hardiness and disease resistance.

[[Social center]]
CATEGORIES: Social centres, DIY culture, Volunteer cooperatives

Social centers (or social centres) are community spaces. They are buildings which are used for a range of disparate activities, which can be linked only by being not-for-profit. They might be organizing centers for local activities or they might provide support networks for minority groups such as prisoners and refugees. Often they provide a base for initiatives such as cafes, free shops, public computer labs, graffiti murals, legal collectives and free housing for travellers. The services are determined by both the needs of the community in which the social center is based and the skills which the participants have to offer.  
Social centers tend to be in large buildings and thus can host activist meetings, concerts, bookshops, dance performances and art exhibitions. Social centers are common in many European cities, sometimes in squats, sometimes in rented buildings.  
Also known as a free space, social centers may be designated "safe-space" where specific forms of dialogue and activism are encouraged and protected from harassment, or they may be intended to serve as open space for community interaction among widely disparate groups without censorship. There is a great deal of overlap between the two types. 
Social centers that are open to the general public are also part of the general third place movement in community building. Third places which include small commercial or non-reclaimed urban spaces (or reclaimed from commercial activity towards cooperative use) such as community coffee houses may serve a similar function with or without an organizing focus besides localism.

The forum is best known for its annual winter meeting in Davos, a mountain resort in Graubünden, in the eastern Alps region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 2,500 top business leaders, international political leaders, selected intellectuals, and journalists, for a winter meeting, to discuss the most pressing issues facing the world, including health and the environment. Often this location alone is used to identify meetings, participation, and participants with such phrases as, "a Davos panel" and "a Davos Man"[tpl]fact|date=February 2014[/tpl]

[[Transatlantic Business Dialogue]]

CATEGORIES: Working groups

The TransAtlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) was established by the US government and European Union in 1995 as the official business sector advisory group for EU and US officials on trade and investment issues. The purpose of the TABD was to foster an ongoing dialogue between business and government at the highest levels. It had become clear to both governments that international business maintains a unique and indispensable perspective on trade liberalization, and that it was necessary to create an official forum that allowed these transatlantic businesses to come together in a single setting where they would be able to address their mutual concerns.
The first TABD conference was held in Seville, Spain in 1995 and concluded in the creation of working groups on standards and regulatory issues, trade liberalization, investment, and third country relations. As it was the first time that the private sector held an official role in determining EU/US public policy, the Seville conference signified a milestone in transatlantic trade relations. US Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown convened the conference along with European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan and Commissioner Dr. Martin Bangeman, and it was met with enthusiasm across the transatlantic business community.
Throughout the years, the TABD continually provided input on a number of trade issues, including financial services, raw materials/recycling, and eMobility.  Since 2007, the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), which is the primary plenary for economic dialogue between the US and EU, has served as an additional platform for the TABD to exercise its advisory role.
Currently, the TABD enjoys an especially important position in the Transatlantic Business Council, operating as a distinct program within the overall organization. The TABD program is the highest forum within the TBC and brings together European and American CEOs and C-suite executives. The TABD meets twice a year, leading to the development of joint policy recommendations to the US and European governments on a number of trade-related issues.
The last TABD program meeting took place in January in Davos/Switzerland in the margins of the World Economic Forum. Government guests and speakers included Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, OECD Secretary General Ángel Gurría and Michael Froman, Assistant to President Barack Obama and US Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs.
TABD’s ultimate goal has always been to facilitate the eventual establishment of a barrier-free transatlantic market, which would further global trade liberalization and prosperity. Consequently, the recent launch of free trade negotiations between the US and EU exemplifies TABD’s efforts, and places the program in an attractive position vis-à-vis the negotiators.

The Schengen Information System (SIS), is a governmental database used by European countries to maintain and distribute information on individuals and pieces of property of interest. The intended uses of this system are for national security, border control and law enforcement purposes. A second technical version of this system, SIS II, is scheduled to go live on 9 April 2013http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/jha/135901.pdf under the responsibility of the European Commission.
Information in SIS is shared among institutions of the participating countries in the Schengen Agreement Application Convention (SAAC). The five original participating countries were France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Twenty additional countries have joined the system since its creation: Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austria, Greece, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Currently, the Schengen Information System is used by 27 countries. Among the current participants, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland are not members of the European Union.
Although Ireland and the United Kingdom have not signed the Schengen Agreement Application Convention, they take part in Schengen co-operation under the terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which introduced the provisions of Schengen Acquis into the European Union.  Schengen Acquis allows the United Kingdom and Ireland to take part in all or part of the Schengen convention arrangements.  Ireland and the United Kingdom use the Schengen Information System for law enforcement purposes.Europa: The Schengen area and cooperation They do not have access to the Article 26D (former 96) data,  because they do not intend to remove the border controls between themselves and the rest of Europe.

[[Rubber bullet]]
CATEGORIES: Projectiles, Non-lethal projectiles, Riot control weapons

Rubber bullets (also called rubber baton rounds) are rubber or rubber-coated projectiles that can be fired from either standard firearms or dedicated riot guns. They are intended to be a non-lethal alternative to metal projectiles.  Like other similar projectiles made from plastic, wax, and wood, rubber bullets may be used for short range practice and animal control, but are most commonly associated with use in riot control and to disperse protests. These types of projectiles are sometimes called baton rounds.Hogg (1985) p.67 Rubber projectiles have largely been replaced by other materials as rubber tends to bounce uncontrollably.[tpl]cite book |last=Hogg |first=Ian V. |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Ammunition |publisher=The Apple Press |isbn=1-85076-043-8 |location=London  |year=1985 [/tpl]
Such "kinetic impact munitions" are meant to cause pain but not serious injury. They are expected to produce contusions, abrasions, and hematomas. However, they may cause bone fractures, injuries to internal organs, or death. In a study of injuries in 90 patients injured by rubber bullets, one died, 17 suffered permanent disabilities or deformities and 41 required hospital treatment after being fired upon with rubber bullets.
Rubber bullets were invented by the British Ministry of Defence for use against rioters in Northern Ireland during The Troubles.New Scientist – 3 February 1983. p.292 They were first used in 1970 in Northern Ireland.A Chronology of the Conflict - August 1970.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers. Arrays of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) are currently the most common magnetometer, and SERF being investigated for future machines. Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of various parts of the brain, and neurofeedback. This can be applied in a clinical setting to find locations of abnormalities as well as experimental setting to simply measure brain activityCarlson, Neil R. (2013). Physiology of Behavior.

CATEGORIES: Country blues, Blues music genres

Country blues (also folk blues, rural blues, backwoods blues, or downhome blues) is a general term that refers to all the acoustic, mainly guitar-driven forms of the blues.  It often incorporated elements of rural gospel, ragtime, hillbilly, and dixieland jazz.  After blues' birth in the Southern United States, it quickly spread throughout the country (and elsewhere), giving birth to a host of regional styles. These include Memphis, Detroit, Chicago, Texas, Piedmont, Louisiana, West Coast, Atlanta, St. Louis, East Coast, Swamp, New Orleans, Delta, Hill country and Kansas City blues.http://www.blues.org/blues/background/country.php#ref=blues_background_country
When African-American musical tastes began to change in the early 1960s, moving toward soul and rhythm and blues music, country blues found renewed popularity as "folk blues" and was sold to a primarily white, college-age audience. Traditional artists like Big Bill Broonzy and Sonny Boy Williamson II reinvented themselves as folk blues artists, while Piedmont bluesmen like Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee found great success on the folk festival circuit.Country Blues Style - Definition of the Country Blues Style
Contemporary country blues artists such as Ramon Goose have fused country blues and African styles of music to create new hybrids.

Louisiana blues is a genre of blues music that developed in the period after World War II in the state of Louisiana. It is generally divided into two major sub-genres, with the jazz-influenced New Orleans blues based around the city and the slower tempo swamp blues incorporating influences from zydeco and Cajun music from around Baton Rouge. Major artists in the New Orleans tradition include Professor Longhair and Guitar Slim and for swamp blues Slim Harpo and Lightnin' Slim. Both genres peaked in popularity in the 1960s and were covered by a number of rock artists. Interest declined in the later 1960s but there have been occasional revivals since the 1970s.

[[Guts (game)]]

CATEGORIES: Flying disc games, Team sports

Guts or guts disc (sometimes guts Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name) is a disc game inspired by dodgeball, involving teams throwing a flying disc (rather than balls) at members of the opposing team. One to five team members stand in a line facing the opposing team across the court, with the two teams lined up parallel to each other.  Which team begins play is determined "flipping the disc", an action similar to a coin toss, but using the disc itself. One member of the team is then selected to start play.
That member then raises an arm to indicate readiness to throw, at which point the members of the opposing team freeze in position. The thrower then throws the disc as hard as possible at someone on the opposing team. If the thrower misses the "scoring area" (a demarcated area a bit larger than the space occupied by the opposing team), the receiving team scores a point. If a member of the receiving team catches the disc cleanly, neither team scores a point. If the throw is within the scoring area and the receiving team fails to catch, or catches but drops the disc, the throwing team gets a point. The receiving team then picks up the disc and becomes the throwing team.
The receiving team must catch the disc cleanly in one hand, and may not move from position until after the disc leaves the hand of the thrower. The disc may not be trapped between the hand and any other part of the body, including the other hand. This frequently results in a challenging sequence of "tips" or "bobbles", which are rebounds of the disc off of receivers' hands or body to slow the disc down and keep it in play until it can be caught. This often involves multiple players on the receiving team.
Play continues until at least 21 points have been scored by one of the teams and there is a difference in score of at least 2 points.

Surf music is a genre of popular music associated with surf culture, particularly as found in Orange County and other areas of Southern California. It was especially popular from 1961 to 1966, has subsequently been revived and was highly influential on subsequent rock music.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), pp. 1313-4.  It has two major forms: largely instrumental surf rock, with an electric guitar or saxophone playing the main melody, largely pioneered by Dick Dale and the Del-Tones, and vocal surf pop, including both surf ballads and dance music, often with strong harmonies that are most associated with the Beach Boys. Many notable surf bands have been equally noted for both surf instrumental and surf pop music, so surf music is generally considered as a single genre despite the variety of these styles. During the later stages of the surf music craze, many groups started to leave surfing behind and write songs about cars and girls; this was later known as hot rod rock.[tpl]cite web| url =http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/hot-rod-d2780|title= Hot rod rock|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate =23 April 2011[/tpl].

Founded in 1769 by Manuel Sepúlveda, its population of 1,509,939 inhabitants (2010) makes it the tenth most populous city in the country and the centre of Brazil's fourth largest metropolitan area, with 4,405,760 inhabitants (2010). The city is the southernmost capital city of a Brazilian state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Introduction |title=Location of Porto Alegre |publisher=Iguide.travel |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] Porto Alegre is one of the top cultural, political and economic centers of Brazil.
Porto Alegre was founded in 1769 by Manuel Jorge Gomes de Sepúlveda, who used the fictitious name or pseudonym José Marcelino de Figueiredo (fictitious name), to hide their identity; but the official date is 1772 with the act signed by immigrants from the Azores, Portugal. In the late 19th century the city received many immigrants from other parts of the world, particularly from Germany, Italy, and Poland. The vast majority of the population is of European descent.
The city lies on the eastern bank of the Rio Guaiba (Guaiba Lake), where five rivers converge to form the Lagoa dos Patos (Lagoon of the Ducks), a giant freshwater lagoon navigable by even the largest of ships. This five-river junction has become an important alluvial port as well as a chief industrial and commercial center of Brazil.
The port of Porto Alegre is important for transporting local produce. The "capital gaúcha" has a broad-based economy that lays particular emphasis on agriculture and industry. Agricultural production includes produce such as plums, peaches, rice and cassava grown on rural smallholdings. The shoe and leather industries are also important, especially in Novo Hamburgo, in the Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre.
In recent years, Porto Alegre hosted the World Social Forum, an initiative of several non-government organizations. The city became famous for being the first city that implemented participatory budgeting.[tpl]cite web |title=More generous than you might think |author=Eva-Maria Verfürth |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/participatory-budgeting-about-every-voice-being-heard[/tpl] The 9th Assembly of the World Council of Churches was held in Porto Alegre in 2006.

It was discovered by David L. Rabinowitz, then of the University of Arizona's Spacewatch Project, and named after Pholus, the brother of the mythological Chiron, after which 2060 Chiron was named, in order to follow the tradition of naming this class of outer planet-crossing objects after centaurs.
Pholus was the second centaur to be discovered and was quickly found to be quite red in color, for which it has been occasionally nicknamed "Big Red". The color has been speculated to be due to organic compounds on its surface.[tpl]cite journal | author=Wilson PD, Sagan C, Thompson WR | title=The organic surface of 5145 Pholus: constraints set by scattering theory | journal=Icarus | year=1994 | volume=107 | pages=288–303 | doi=10.1006/icar.1994.1024 | pmid=11539180 | bibcode=1994Icar..107..288W | issue=2[/tpl]

[[Simulated annealing]]

CATEGORIES: Heuristic algorithms, Optimization algorithms and methods, Monte Carlo methods

Simulated annealing (SA) is a generic probabilistic metaheuristic for the global optimization problem of locating a good approximation to the global optimum of a given function in a large search space.  It is often used when the search space is discrete (e.g., all tours that visit a given set of cities).  For certain problems, simulated annealing may be more efficient than exhaustive enumeration — provided that the goal is merely to find an acceptably good solution in a fixed amount of time, rather than the best possible solution.
The name and inspiration come from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to increase the size of its crystals and reduce their defects. Both are attributes of the material that depend on its thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy.  While the same amount of cooling brings the same amount of decrease in temperature it will bring a bigger or smaller decrease in the thermodynamic free energy depending on the rate that it occurs, with a slower rate producing a bigger decrease.
This notion of slow cooling is implemented in the Simulated Annealing algorithm as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as it explores the solution space. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the optimal solution.
The method was independently described by Scott Kirkpatrick, C. Daniel Gelatt and Mario P. Vecchi in 1983,[tpl]cite journal |jstor=1690046 |pages=671–680 |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=S. |last2=Gelatt Jr |first2=C. D. |last3=Vecchi |first3=M.

Woldemar Voigt ([tpl]IPA-de|foːkt|lang[/tpl]; 2 September 1850 – 13 December 1919) was a German physicist, who taught at the Georg August University of Göttingen.  Voigt eventually went on to head the Mathematical Physics Department at Göttingen and was succeeded in 1914 by Peter Debye, who took charge of the theoretical department of the Physical Institute.  In 1921, Debye was succeeded by Max Born.
Voigt was born in Leipzig, and died in Göttingen. He was a student of Franz Ernst Neumann. He worked on crystal physics, thermodynamics and electro-optics. His main work was the Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik (textbook on crystal physics), first published in 1910. He discovered the Voigt effect in 1898. The word tensor in its current meaning was introduced by him in 1899. Voigt profile and Voigt notation are named after him. He was also an amateur musician and became known as a Bach expert (see External links).

CATEGORIES: Companies established in 1896, Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of Germany, History of Szczecin, Companies disestablished in 1945

Stoewer was a German automobile manufacturer before World War II whose headquarters were in Stettin (Szczecin). 
The first company was founded by the Stoewer brothers, Emil (lived 1873 - 1942) and Bernhard (1875 - 1937) in 1896 for manufacturing sewing machines in Stettin. In 1899, the Stoewer brothers founded the firm Gebrüder Stoewer, Fabrik für Motorfahrzeugen and started to produce automobiles. Their first automobile was the Grosser Motorwagen (Large Motor Car), with 6.5 hp (4.8 kW) and [tpl]convert|17|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] maximum speed.
In 1908 Stoewers constructed Stoewer G4. This model was immensely successful - 1070 cars were built. In 1910, Stoewer cars were built under licence by Mathis of Strassburg.
In 1916, the family-owned company was transformed into a limited company under the name of Stoewer-Werke AG, vormals Gebrüder Stoewer. 
In the mid-20's a new class of cars was introduced: the D-Types included D3, D9 and D10 with four-cylinder engines, as well as D5, D6 and D12 with six cylinders.
Something special was in 1921 class D7 with a proprietary six-cylinder aero engine with [tpl]convert|120|hp|abbr=on[/tpl]. It was the strongest car in those days.
In 1928 the company started to build S8 and G14 models with eight-cylinder engines.
At the beginning of the 1930s Stoewers delivered their highlights: G15 Gigant, M12 Marschall and P20 Repräsentant, each with eight-cylinder engines, with 60 to 120 hp (45 to 90 kW) and [tpl]convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] maximum speed.[tpl]cite web|last=Apral|first=K|title=Stoewer 1930|url=http://www.classiccarcatalogue.com/STOEWER%201930.html|work=www.classiccarcatalogue.com|accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl] The production of these cars had to be cancelled after 2,500 vehicles being produced due to worldwide economic troubles. In 1931 Stoewer constructed one of the first cars with front-wheel drive at all, class V5 25 hp (19 kW), [tpl]convert|80|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] maximum speed. The model named Greif Junior was built under the licence of Tatra. Its afterdecessor V8 Greif was the last car being constructed by Mr Stoewer itself, class Arkona and Sedina were the last civilian cars produced by the company. 
In 1936 Stoewer factory developed the light off-road car (le.E.Pkw, leichter geländegängiger Einheits-PKW) for the Wehrmacht, a versatile four-wheel drive car, initially equipped (to 1940) with four-wheel steering. Due to capacity-problems the cars had also been produced at BMW-Factory Eisenach as BMW 325 and by Hanomag in Hanover as Type 20 B. Together the three manufacturers made a total of ca. 13.000 units. 
Stoewer was one of several German companies that exploited slave labour and had its own camp for prisoners[ref]Pomorze Zachodnie na przełomie dwu epok, 1944-1946 Kazimierz Golczewski
 Wydawn. Poznańskie,page 29, 1964</ref>
After World War II, the Red Army seized the remaining production facilities, freed slave workers, dismantled the factory and sent equipment to the Soviet Union. The company subsequently ceased to exist.

[[Centaur (minor planet)]]

CATEGORIES: Centaurs (minor planets), Distant minor planets

Centaurs are small Solar System bodies with a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets. They have unstable orbits that cross or have crossed the orbits of one or more of the giant planets, and have dynamic lifetimes of a few million years.[ref]
</ref> Centaurs typically behave with characteristics of both [[asteroid]]s and [[comets]]. They are named after the mythological beings that were a mixture of [[horse]] and [[human]], [[centaur]]s. It has been estimated that there are around 44,000 centaurs in the [[Solar System]] with diameters larger than 1&nbsp;km.<ref name=Horner2004a/>
The first centaur to be discovered was 944 Hidalgo in 1920. However, they were not recognized as a distinct population until the discovery of 2060 Chiron in 1977. The largest confirmed centaur is 10199 Chariklo, which at 260 km in diameter is as big as a mid-sized main-belt asteroid, and is known to have a system of rings.  It was discovered in 1997.  However, the lost centaur, [tpl]mpl|1995 SN|55[/tpl], may be somewhat larger.
No centaur has been photographed up close, although there is evidence that Saturn's moon Phoebe, imaged by the Cassini probe in 2004, may be a captured centaur. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope has gleaned some information about the surface features of 8405 Asbolus.
[tpl]As of|2008[/tpl], three centaurs have been found to display cometary comas: Chiron, 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT. Chiron and Echeclus are therefore classified as both asteroids and comets. Other centaurs such as 52872 Okyrhoe are suspected of showing cometary activity. Any centaur that is perturbed close enough to the Sun is expected to become a comet.

[[Mecklenburgisch dialect]]

CATEGORIES: Low German, German dialects, Languages of Germany, Mecklenburg

Mecklenburgisch (Mecklenborgsch or Mäkelborgsch) is a Low German (Low Saxon) dialect group used predominantly in the Mecklenburg area of today’s North German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
There is no sharp dividing line between its western dialects and adjacent Northern Low Saxon dialects on the one hand and between its eastern dialects and dialects of Western Pomerania on the other hand. Thus, although the Mecklenburg group is traditionally considered an East Low German group, it is in fact a link between eastern and western dialects. Its Western Slavic substrata do not seem to be as strong as those of dialects spoken farther east. A striking eastern characteristic is the use of the diminutive suffix -ing (e.g. Poot ‘paw’ > Pöting ‘little paw’, Änning ‘Annie’, lies’ ‘quietly’, ‘softly’, ‘slowly’ > liesing ‘very quietly’, ‘very softly’, ‘very carefully’, ‘nice and easy’). This suffix is most likely derived from West Slavic varieties once spoken in the area (cf. diminutive -inka in other Slavic languages).

[[Foreign relations of São Tomé and Príncipe]]

CATEGORIES: Foreign relations of São Tomé and Príncipe

Until independence in 1975, São Tomé and Príncipe had few ties abroad except those that passed through Portugal. Following independence, the new government sought to expand its diplomatic relationships. A common language, tradition, and colonial experience have led to close collaboration between São Tomé and other ex-Portuguese colonies in Africa, particularly Angola. São Toméan relations with other African countries in the region, such as Gabon and the Republic of the Congo, are also good. In December 2000, São Tomé signed the African Union treaty; it was later ratified by the National Assembly.
The São Toméan government has generally maintained a foreign policy based on nonalignment and cooperation with any country willing to assist in its economic development. In recent years, it has also increasingly emphasized ties to the United States and western Europe. It maintains relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) instead of the People's Republic of China.

Capricorn One is a 1977 thriller movie about a Mars landing hoax. It was written and directed by Peter Hyams and produced by Lew Grade's (British) ITC Entertainment. It stars Elliott Gould with James Brolin, Sam Waterston and O. J. Simpson as the astronauts.
Although Capricorn One is thematically a typical 1970s government-conspiracy thriller with similarities to Hyams's subsequent film Outland, the story was inspired by conspiracy theories surrounding the Apollo Moon landings.Bancroft, 2002.

[[Northern Low Saxon]]

CATEGORIES: Low German, German dialects

Northern Low Saxon (in Low German, Noordneddersassisch) is a West Low German dialect.
As such, it covers a great part of the West Low-German-speaking areas of northern Germany, with the exception of the border regions where Eastphalian and Westphalian are spoken. However, Northern Low Saxon is easily understood by speakers of these dialects.
Northern Low Saxon can be divided into Holsteinisch, Schleswigsch, East Frisian Low Saxon, Dithmarsch, North Hanoveranian, Emsländisch, and Oldenburgisch.Noble, Cecil A. M. (1983). Modern German dialects New York al., Lang, p. 103-104
Holsteinisch is spoken in Holstein, the southern part of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, in Dithmarschen, around Neumünster, Rendsburg, Kiel and Lübeck.
The local variant of Lübeck ("Lübsch") was a lingua franca for the Hanseatic league in the Middle Ages.
Schleswigsch ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈʃleːsvɪkʃ[/tpl]) is spoken in Schleswig, in Germany and Denmark. It is mainly is based on an South Jutlandic substrate. Therefore it has some notable differences in pronunciation and grammar with its southern neighbour dialects. The dialects on the west coast of Schleswig and some islands show some North Frisian influences.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Oldenburg dialect (Low Saxon Ollnborger Platt, High German Oldenburger Platt) is spoken around the city of Oldenburg. It is limited to Germany. Its difference to East Frisian Low Saxon, which is spoken in the Frisian parts of Low Saxony, is the lack of a Frisian substrate. Ollnborger Platt is in the city of Bremen as Breemsch (Bremian), which is the only capital where Ollnborger Platt is spoken. The Westphalian town or city of Minden possibly partly belongs to the area, where Ollnborger Platt is spoken traditionally.

[[Hamburgisch dialect]]

CATEGORIES: Culture in Hamburg, Low German, German dialects, Languages of Germany

Hamburgisch is a group of Northern Low Saxon varieties spoken in Hamburg, Germany. Occasionally, the term Hamburgisch is also used for Hamburg Missingsch, a variety of standard German with Low Saxon substrates. These are urban dialects that have absorbed numerous English and Dutch loanwords, for instance Törn ‘trip’ (Hamburg is pronounced [tpl]IPA-de|ˈhambɔrç|[/tpl] in these dialects, with a "ch" similar to that in the standard German word Milch. Typical of the Hamburg dialects and other Lower Elbe dialects is the pronunciation (and spelling) eu (pronounced oi ) for the diphthong [tpl]IPA|/œɪ/[/tpl] (written öö, öh or ö), e.g.
However, as in most other Low Saxon (Low German) dialects, the long monophthong [tpl]IPA|/øː/[/tpl] is pronounced [tpl]IPAblink|øː|ø[/tpl] (as in French peu), for instance Kööm ~ Kœm [tpl]IPA|kʰøːm[/tpl] ‘caraway’.

[[Brandenburgisch dialect]]

CATEGORIES: Low German, German dialects, Brandenburg

Brandenburgish, or Markish, is a dialect spoken in Germany in the northern and western parts of Brandenburg (Uckermark, Prignitz and Mittelmark regions) as well as in northern Saxony-Anhalt (Altmark). The language area can be further divided between into North Markish (Stendal, Wittenberge, Prenzlau) and South (or Central) Markish (Brandenburg an der Havel).
It is classified as the original East Low German dialect of the Brandenburg margraviate, but it has been much influenced by the East Central German dialects and by Standard German. With the arisal of the Berlin metropolitan area the original Brandenburgisch together with Berlinerisch has formed the local Berlin-Brandenburgish dialect, which today is considered an East Central German subgroup. The spread of Berlin-Brandenburgisch into the Markish language area is an ongoing process.

[[Drag coefficient]]

CATEGORIES: Aerodynamics, Aerospace engineering, Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics, Fluid dynamics

In fluid dynamics, the drag coefficient (commonly denoted as: cd, cx or cw) is a dimensionless quantity that is used to quantify the drag or resistance of an object in a fluid environment, such as air or water. It is used in the drag equation, where a lower drag coefficient indicates the object will have less aerodynamic or hydrodynamic drag. The drag coefficient is always associated with a particular surface area.McCormick, Barnes W. (1979): Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics. p. 24, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, ISBN 0-471-03032-5
The drag coefficient of any object comprises the effects of the two basic contributors to fluid dynamic drag: skin friction and form drag. The drag coefficient of a lifting airfoil or hydrofoil also includes the effects of lift-induced drag.Clancy, L. J.: Aerodynamics. Section 5.18Abbott, Ira H., and Von Doenhoff, Albert E.: Theory of Wing Sections.

An American Family is an American television documentary filmed from May 30 through December 31, 1971"An American Family Screenings", Paley Center for Media, 2011, New York. and first aired in the United States on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in early 1973.  After being edited down from about 300 hours of raw footage, the series ran one season of 12 episodes on Thursday nights at 9:00 p.m.  
Originally intended as a chronicle of the daily life of the Louds — an upper-middle-class family in Santa Barbara, California — the groundbreaking program documented the break-up of the family via the separation and subsequent divorce of parents Bill and Pat Loud.Cf. Loud, Pat, Pat Loud: A Woman's Story, 1974 The documentary inspired spoofs such as the Albert Brooks feature film Real Life (1979).
A year after this programme was broadcast, the BBC in 1974 filmed its own similar 12-episode programme, called The Family, focusing on the working-class Wilkins family, of Reading, Berkshire, England.

Dumbo is a 1941 American animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions and premiered on October 23, 1941, by RKO Radio Pictures. Sound was recorded conventionally using the RCA System. One voice was synthesized using the Sonovox system, but it, too, was recorded using the RCA System.
Dumbo, the fourth animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, is based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Pearl for the prototype of a novelty toy ("Roll-a-Book").Obituary: Helen Aberson Mayer. The Independent. April 12, 1999. Retrieved September 30, 2009. The main character is Jumbo Jr., a semi-anthropomorphic elephant who is cruelly nicknamed "Dumbo". He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of flying by using his ears as wings. Throughout most of the film, his only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy – a relationship parodying the stereotypical animosity between mice and elephants.
Dumbo was made to recoup the financial losses of Fantasia. It was a deliberate pursuit of simplicity and economy for the Disney studio, and at 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features.

Highlife is a music genre that originated in Ghana at the turn of the 20th century and incorporated the traditional harmonic 9th, as well as melodic and the main rhythmic structures in traditional Akan music, and married them with Western instruments and ideas. Highlife was associated with the local African aristocracy during the colonial period. Highlife spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gambia and Nigeria via Ghanaian workers, among other West African countries, by the 1930s. It is very popular in Liberia and all of English-speaking West Africa, although little has been produced in other countries due to economic challenges brought on by war and instability.
Highlife is characterised by jazzy horns and multiple guitars which lead the band. Recently it has acquired an uptempo, synth-driven sound (see Daddy Lumba).

Piedmont blues (also known as East Coast, or Southeastern blues) refers primarily to a guitar style, the Piedmont fingerstyle, which is characterized by a fingerpicking approach in which a regular, alternating thumb bass string rhythmic pattern supports a syncopated melody using the treble strings generally picked with the fore-finger, occasionally others.[tpl]cite book | first= Paul | last= Du Noyer | year= 2003 | title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music | edition= 1st | publisher= Flame Tree Publishing | location= Fulham, London | isbn= 1-904041-96-5 | page= 169[/tpl] The result is comparable in sound to ragtime or stride piano styles.

The Daily Telegraph is a conservative, Australian tabloid newspaper published in Sydney, New South Wales, by Nationwide News, part of News Corp. The Tele, as it is also known, was founded in 1879. From 1936 to 1972, it was owned by Frank Packer's Australian Consolidated Press. That year it was sold to News Limited (now News Corp Australia). In 1990, it merged with its afternoon sister paper The Daily Mirror to form The Daily Telegraph-Mirror with morning and afternoon editions although the afternoon editions were later discontinued.
The new paper continued in this vein until January 1996 when reader pressure for a shorter title caused the name of the paper to revert to The Daily Telegraph, despite staff concerns that former Mirror readers would now feel disenfranchised. The circulation of the newspaper during the June quarter 2013 was 310,724 on weekdays,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/08/16/newspaper-circulation-results-shocker-the-contagion-edition/?wpmp_switcher=desktop |title=Newspaper circulation results shocker: the contagion edition |last1=Knott |first1=Matthew |date=16 August 2013 |website=Crikey |publisher=Private Media |accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl] the largest of a Sydney newspaper.

Gerhard "Gerd" Müller ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈɡɛrt ˈmʏlɐ[/tpl]; born 3 November 1945) is a retired German footballer and one of the most prolific goalscorers of all time.
With national records of 68 goals in 62 international appearances, 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga games, and the international record of 66 goals in 74 European club games, he was one of the most successful goalscorers ever.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=174790/bio.html | title = Der Bomber wrote records for eternity | publisher = FIFA.com | accessdate = 10 December 2012[/tpl] Müller is now eleventh on the list of all time international goalscorers despite playing fewer matches than every other player in the top 25. Among top international scorers, only Poul Nielsen and Sándor Kocsis have higher scoring rates. His nicknames are “Bomber der Nation” (the nation's Bomber) or simply “Der Bomber“, and “kleines dickes Müller” (short fat Müller; this name was given to him by Čik Čajkovski, his first coach at Bayern Munich. Čajkovski was Yugoslavian and got the German declension wrong). 
In 1970, Müller was elected European Footballer of the Year after a successful season at Bayern Munich and scoring 10 goals at the 1970 World Cup. Müller held the all-time goal-scoring record in the tournament with a 14-goal total, a record that stood for 32 years until it was broken by Brazil's Ronaldo against Ghana in the Round of 16 of the 2006 World Cup. 
In 1999, Müller was ranked ninth in the European player of the Century election held by the IFFHS, and he was voted thirteenth in the IFFHS' "World Player of the Century" election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-century.html|title=IFFHS Century Elections|publisher=RSSSF.com – International Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=8 October 2011[/tpl] In 2004, Pelé named Müller one of the 125 best living footballers in his FIFA 100 list.

[[Ray transfer matrix analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Geometrical optics, Accelerator physics

Ray transfer matrix analysis (also known as ABCD matrix analysis) is a type of ray tracing technique used in the design of some optical systems, particularly lasers. It involves the construction of a ray transfer matrix which describes the optical system; tracing of a light path through the system can then be performed by multiplying this matrix with a vector representing the light ray. The same analysis is also used in accelerator physics to track particles through the magnet installations of a particle accelerator, see Beam optics. 
The technique that is described below uses the paraxial approximation of ray optics, which means that all rays are assumed to be at a small angle (θ) and a small distance (x) relative to the optical axis of the system.An exact method for tracing meridional rays is available here.

Rubella, also known as German measles or three-day measles,[tpl]cite book|last=Neighbors|first=M|last2=Tannehill-Jones|first2=R|title=Human diseases|edition=3rd|chapter=Childhood diseases and disorders|pages=457–79|publisher=Delmar, Cengage Learning|location=Clifton Park, New York|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4354-2751-8[/tpl] is a disease caused by the rubella virus. The name "rubella" was derived from Latin, meaning little red. Rubella is also known as German measles because the disease was first described by German physicians in the mid-eighteenth century. This disease is often mild and attacks often pass unnoticed. The disease can last one to three days. Children recover more quickly than adults. Infection of the mother by rubella virus during pregnancy can be serious; if the mother is infected within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, the child may be born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which entails a range of serious incurable illnesses. Miscarriage occurs in up to 20% of cases.
Rubella is a common childhood infection that can sometimes be fatal usually with minimal systemic upset although transient arthropathy may occur in adults. Serious complications such as deterioration of the skin are very rare. Apart from the effects of transplacental infection on the developing fetus, rubella is a relatively trivial infection.
Acquired (i.e. not congenital) rubella is transmitted via airborne droplet emission from the upper respiratory tract of active cases (can be passed along by the breath of people sick from rubella). The virus may also be present in the urine, feces and on the skin. There is no carrier state: the reservoir exists entirely in active human cases. The disease has an incubation period of 2 to 3 weeks. In most people the virus is rapidly eliminated. However, it may persist for some months post partum in infants surviving the CRS. These children are a significant source of infection to other infants and, more importantly, to pregnant female contacts.
The name rubella is sometimes confused with rubeola, an alternative name for measles in English-speaking countries; the diseases are unrelated.Merriam-webster:Rubeola Accessed 2009-09-20.T. E. C. Jr. Letters to the editor Pediatrics Vol. 49 No. 1 January 1972, pp. 150–151. In some other European languages, like Spanish, rubella and rubeola are synonyms, and rubeola is not an alternative name for measles.Webster's Online Dictionary: German measles Accessed 2009-09-20 Thus, in Spanish, "rubeola" refers to rubella and "sarampión" refers to measles.

[[Congenital rubella syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Congenital disorders, Syndromes, Virus-related cutaneous conditions, Infections specific to the perinatal period, Rubella

Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) can occur in a developing fetus of a pregnant woman who has contracted rubella during her first trimester. If infection occurs 0–28 days before conception, there is a 43% chance the infant will be affected. If the infection occurs 0–12 weeks after conception, there is a 51% chance the infant will be affected.
If the infection occurs 13–26 weeks after conception there is a 23% chance the infant will be affected by the disease. Infants are not generally affected if rubella is contracted during the third trimester, or 26–40 weeks after conception. Problems rarely occur when rubella is contracted by the mother after 20 weeks of gestation and continues to disseminate the virus after birth.
It was discovered in 1941 by Australian Norman McAllister Gregg.

[[Dispersion (optics)]]

CATEGORIES: Optics, Glass physics

In optics, dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a wave depends on its frequency, or equivalently when the group velocity depends on the frequency.
Media having such a property are termed dispersive media. Dispersion is sometimes called ''chromatic'' dispersion to emphasize its wavelength-dependent nature, or group-velocity dispersion (GVD) to emphasize the role of the group velocity.
Dispersion is most often described for light waves, but it may occur for any kind of wave that interacts with a medium or passes through an inhomogeneous geometry (e.g., a waveguide), such as sound waves. A material's dispersion for optical wavelengths is measured by its Abbe number, V, with low Abbe numbers corresponding to strong dispersion.

In materials science, dispersion is the fraction of atoms of a material exposed to the surface.  In general:
where D is the dispersion, NS is the number of surface atoms and NT is the total number of atoms of the material.  Dispersion is an important concept in heterogeneous catalysis, since only atoms that are exposed to the surface are able to play a role in catalytic surface reactions. Dispersion increases with decreasing crystallite size and approaches unity at a crystallite diameter of about 1 nm.

[[Mohair]]

CATEGORIES: Animal hair products

Mohair [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|h|ɛər[/tpl] is usually a silk-like fabric or yarn made from the hair of the Angora goat."Mohaire". The Oxford English Dictionary.
Both durable and resilient, mohair is notable for its high luster and sheen, which has helped give it the nickname the "Diamond Fiber", and is often used in fiber blends to add these qualities to a textile. Mohair takes dye exceptionally well. Mohair is warm in winter as it has great insulating properties, while remaining cool in summer due to its moisture wicking properties. It is durable, naturally elastic, flame resistant, crease resistant, and does not felt. It is considered to be a luxury fiber, like cashmere, angora and silk, and is usually more expensive than most wool that comes from sheep.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Mohair is composed mostly of keratin, a protein found in the hair, wool, horns and skin of all mammals. While it has scales like wool, the scales are not fully developed, merely indicated. Thus, mohair does not felt as wool does.
Mohair fiber is approximately 25–45 microns in diameter.[ref]

The term mohair is sometimes used to describe a type of material used for the folding roof on convertible cars. In this instance, mohair refers to a form of denim-like canvas. Mohair should not be confused with the fur from the angora rabbit, which is called angora wool.

The Mirage III ([tpl]IPA-fr|miʁaʒ[/tpl]) is a supersonic fighter aircraft designed by Dassault Aviation during the mid-1950s, and manufactured both in France and a number of other countries.
The versatility of the design enabled production of trainer, reconnaissance and ground-attack versions as well as the Dassault Mirage 5 variant.Wheeler 1992, p. 117. It was a successful fighter aircraft, being sold to many air forces around the world and remaining in production for over a decade. Currently, the Pakistan Air Force is the largest operator of Mirage III fighters, with 75 aircraft still in service. It is the first European combat aircraft design capable of exceeding a speed of Mach 2 in horizontal flight.

[[Thrust specific fuel consumption]]
CATEGORIES: Engine technology, Power (physics)

Thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) or sometimes simply specific fuel consumption, SFC, is an engineering term that is used to describe the fuel efficiency of an engine design with respect to thrust output. 
TSFC may also be thought of as fuel consumption (grams/second) per unit of thrust (kilonewtons, or kN). It is thus thrust-specific, meaning that the fuel consumption is divided by the thrust.
TSFC or SFC for thrust engines (e.g. turbojets, turbofans, ramjets, rocket engines, etc.) is the mass of fuel needed to provide the net thrust for a given period e.g. lb/(h·lbf) (pounds of fuel per hour-pound of thrust) or g/(s·kN) (grams of fuel per second-kilonewton). Mass of fuel is used rather than volume (gallons or litres) for the fuel measure since it is independent of temperature.Specific Fuel Consumption 
Specific fuel consumption of air-breathing jet engines at their maximum efficiency varies more or less inversely with speed, which means that the fuel consumption per mile or per km can be a more appropriate comparison for aircraft that travel at very different speeds. 
This figure is inversely proportional to specific impulse.

[[Electric blues]]

CATEGORIES: Blues music genres

Electric blues is a type of blues music distinguished by the amplification of the guitar, bass guitar, drums, and often the harmonica. Pioneered in the 1930s, it emerged as a genre in Chicago in the 1940s. It was taken up in many areas of America leading to the development of regional subgenres such as electric Memphis blues and Texas blues. It was adopted in the British blues boom of the 1960s, leading to the development of blues-rock. It was a foundation of rock music. It continues to be a major style of blues music and has enjoyed a revival in popularity since the 1990s.

D66 was formed in 1966 by a group of politically unaligned, young intellectuals, led by journalist Hans van Mierlo. The party's main objective was to democratise the political system; it proposed to create an American style presidential system. In the 1967 general election, the party won 7 of the 150  seats in the House of Representatives; no new party had ever gained that many seats before. The electoral history of the party is characterised by large fluctuations. At one point they had 24 seats, currently (following the September 2012 Parliamentary elections) they have 12. The party was in government from 1973-1977, 1981-1982, 1994-2002 and 2003-2006. Over time the party began to emphasise other issues in addition to democratic reform, creating a social-liberal programme.
Currently the party is represented by twelve seats in the House of Representatives, five in the Senate and three in the European Parliament. The party leader, and chair of the parliamentary party in the House of Representatives, is Alexander Pechtold. The party is in opposition against the Rutte cabinet. The party has a growing number of elected local and provincial politicians, but supplies a relative large share of the mayors, which are appointed. The party's voters are concentrated in larger cities, especially those with a university degree, and towns with an above average number of wealthy citizens.
The organisation of D66 is based on principles of direct democracy.https://www.d66.nl/d66nl/item/directe_democratie Important decisions are made per referendum. D66 is a member of the Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Party.

[[British blues]]
CATEGORIES: British styles of music, Blues music genres

British blues is a form of music derived from American blues that originated in the late 1950s and which reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1960s, when it developed a distinctive and influential style dominated by electric guitar and made international stars of several proponents of the genre including The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin. A number of these moved into mainstream rock music and as a result British blues helped to form many of the sub-genres of rock. Since then direct interest in the blues in Britain has declined, but many of the key performers have returned to it in recent years, new acts have emerged and there has been a renewed interest in the genre.

[[Lichenology]]
CATEGORIES: Lichens

Lichenology is the branch of mycology that studies the lichens, symbiotic organisms made up of an intimate symbiotic association of a microscopic alga (or a cyanbacterium) with a filamentous fungus.
Study of lichens draws knowledge from several disciplines: mycology, phycology, microbiology and botany and scholars of lichenology are known as lichenologists.
The taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the Swedish botanist Erik Acharius (1757–1819), who is therefore sometimes named the "father of lichenology". Acharius was a student of Carolus Linnaeus. Some of his more important works on the subject, which marked the beginning of lichenology as a discipline, are:
Later lichenologists include the American scientists Vernon Ahmadjian and Edward Tuckerman and the Russian evolutionary biologist Konstantin Merezhkovsky, as well as amateurs such as Louisa Collings.

Cambridge University Press, 2005) is a composite organism consisting of a fungus (the mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (the photobiont or phycobiont) growing together in a symbiotic relationship. The photobiont is usually either a green alga (commonly Trebouxia) or cyanobacterium (commonly Nostoc). The morphology, physiology and biochemistry of lichens are very different from those of the isolated fungus and alga in culture. Lichens occur in some of the most extreme environments on Earth—arctic tundra, hot deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag heaps. However, they are also abundant as epiphytes on leaves and branches in rain forests and temperate woodland, on bare rock, including walls and gravestones, and on exposed soil surfaces (e.g., Collema) in otherwise mesic habitats. The roofs of many buildings have lichens growing on them. Lichens are widespread and may be long-lived; however, many are also vulnerable to environmental disturbance, and may be useful to scientists in assessing the effects of air pollution, ozone depletion, and metal contamination. Lichens have also been used in making dyes and perfumes, as well as in traditional medicines. It has been estimated that 6% of Earth's land surface is covered by lichen.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/156/3/609.full|title=Metals, minerals and microbes: geomicrobiology and bioremediation|journal=Microbiology|author=Geoffrey Michael Gadd|volume=156|issue=Pt 3|date=March 2010|pages=609–643|pmid=20019082|doi=10.1099/mic.0.037143-0[/tpl]

[[Federated state]]

CATEGORIES: Administrative divisions, Lists of country subdivisions, States, Decentralization, Constitutional state types

A federated state (which may be referred to as a state, a province, a canton, a Land, etc.) is a territorial and constitutional community forming part of a federal union.The Australian National Dictionary: Fourth Edition, pg 1395. (2004) Canberra. ISBN 978-0-19-551771-2. Such states differ from sovereign states, in that they have transferred a portion of their sovereign powers to a federal government.Constitution of the United States of America: Tenth Amendment, Reserved Powers Importantly, when states choose to federate, they lose their standing as persons of international law. Instead, the federal union as a single entity becomes the sovereign state, the person of international law.Crawford, J. (2006). The Creation of States in International Law. Oxford, Clarendon Press. A federated state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and is a form of regional government.
In some cases, a federation is created from a union of political entities, which are either independent, or dependent territories of another sovereign entity (most commonly a colonial power).Examples are Australia and the United States. In other cases, federated states have been created out of the regions of previously unitary states.This occurred in Belgium in 1993. The Belgian regions had previously devolved powers. Once a federal constitution is formed, the rules governing the relationship between federal and regional powers become part of the country's constitutional law and not international law.
In countries with federal constitutions, there is a division of power between the central government and the component states. These entities - states, provinces, cantons, Länder, etc. - are partially self-governing and are afforded a degree of constitutionally guaranteed autonomy that varies substantially from one federation to another.For instance, Canadian provinces and Swiss cantons possess substantially more powers and enjoy more protection against interference and infringments from the central government than most non-Western federations. Depending on the form the decentralization of powers takes, a federated state's legislative powers may or may not be overruled or vetoed by the federal government. Laws governing the relationship between federal and regional powers can be amended through the federal constitution and state constitutions.

They represent music tracks as an arrangement of discrete musical notes positioned in one of several channels, at discrete chronological positions on a timeline. The file format used for saving songs is called a module file.
A music tracker's musical interface is traditionally numeric: both notes and parameter changes, effects and other commands are entered with the keyboard into a grid of fixed time slots as codes consisting of letters, numbers and hexadecimal digits.
Separate patterns have independent timelines; a complete song consists of a master list of repeated and concatenated patterns.
Recent trackers have departed from module file limitations and advantages, adding other options both to the sound synthesis (hosting generic synthesizers and effects or MIDI output) and to the sequencing (MIDI input and recording), effectively becoming general purpose sequencers with a different user interface.

In the UK the term "public service broadcasting" refers to broadcasting which is intended for the public and will benefit rather than for purely commercial concerns. The communications regulator Ofcom requires that certain television and radio broadcasters fulfil certain requirements as part of their licence to broadcast. All of the BBC's television and radio stations have a public service remit, including those that broadcast digitally.

The Mesabi Iron Range is a vast deposit of iron ore and the largest of four major iron ranges in the region collectively known as the Iron Range of Minnesota. Discovered in 1866, it is the chief deposit of iron ore in the United States. The deposit is located in northeast Minnesota, largely in Itasca and Saint Louis counties. It was extensively worked in the earlier part of the 20th century. Extraction operations declined throughout the mid-1970s but rebounded in 2005. China's growing demand for iron, along with the falling value of the US dollar versus other world currencies, have made taconite production profitable again, and some mines that had closed have been reopened, while current mines have been expanded.Duluth News Tribune[tpl]dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl]

Kaspar Hauser (30 April 1812 (?) – 17 December 1833) was a German youth who claimed to have grown up in the total isolation of a darkened cell. Hauser's claims, and his subsequent death by stabbing, sparked much debate and controversy. Theories propounded at the time linked him with the grand ducal House of Baden.  These have long since been rejected by professional historians.Reinhard Heydenreuter: König Ludwig I. und der Fall Kaspar Hauser, in: Staat und Verwaltung in Bayern.

[[Lactic acid]]
CATEGORIES: Food acidity regulators, Hydroxy acids, Exercise physiology, Preservatives

Lactic acid is a chemical compound that plays a role in various biochemical processes and was first isolated in 1780 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Lactic acid is a carboxylic acid with the chemical formula C3H6O3. It has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group, making it an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA).
In solution, it can lose a proton from the carboxyl group, producing the lactate ion CH3CH(OH)COO−. Compared to acetic acid, its pKa is 1 unit less, meaning lactic acid deprotonates ten times more easily than acetic acid does. This higher acidity is the consequence of the intramolecular hydrogen bridge between the α-hydroxyl and the carboxylate group, making the latter less capable of strongly attracting its proton.
Lactic acid is miscible with water and with ethanol, and is hygroscopic.
Lactic acid is chiral and has two optical isomers. One is known as L-(+)-lactic acid or (S)-lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D-(−)-lactic acid or (R)-lactic acid.
In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal, which is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, concentration and isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually [tpl]nowrap|1–2 mmol/L[/tpl] at rest, but can rise to over 20 mmol/L during intense exertion.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
In industry, lactic acid fermentation is performed by lactic acid bacteria, which convert glucose and sucrose to lactic acid. These bacteria can also grow in the mouth; the acid they produce is responsible for the tooth decay known as caries.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 19088910 | last1 = Badet | year = 2008 | first1 = C | pages = 38–48 | last2 = Thebaud | volume = 2 | journal = The open microbiology journal | first2 = NB | title = Ecology of Lactobacilli in the Oral Cavity: A Review of Literature | pmc = 2593047 | doi = 10.2174/1874285800802010038[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Nascimento | pmid = 19239634 | first1 = MM | year = 2009 | pages = 89–95 | issue = 2 | last2 = Gordan | volume = 24 | journal = Oral microbiology and immunology | first2 = VV | last3 = Garvan | first3 = CW | last4 = Browngardt | first4 = CM | last5 = Burne | first5 = RA | title = Correlations of oral bacterial arginine and urea catabolism with caries experience | pmc = 2742966 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-302X.2008.00477.x [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 18216213 | last1 = Aas | first1 = JA | year = 2008 | pages = 1407–17 | issue = 4 | volume = 46 | last2 = Griffen | first2 = AL | journal = Journal of clinical microbiology | last3 = Dardis | first3 = SR | last4 = Lee | first4 = AM | last5 = Olsen | first5 = I | last6 = Dewhirst | first6 = FE | last7 = Leys | first7 = EJ | last8 = Paster | first8 = BJ | title = Bacteria of Dental Caries in Primary and Permanent Teeth in Children and Young Adults | pmc = 2292933 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.01410-07 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000096099 | last1 = Caufield | first1 = PW | last2 = Li | first2 = Y | last3 = Dasanayake | first3 = A | last4 = Saxena | first4 = D | title = Diversity of Lactobacilli in the Oral Cavities of Young Women with Dental Caries | journal = Caries Res. | year = 2007 | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–8 | pmid = 17167253 | pmc = 2646165[/tpl]
In medicine, lactate is one of the main components of lactated Ringer's solution and Hartmann's solution. These intravenous fluids consist of sodium and potassium cations along with lactate and chloride anions in solution with distilled water, generally in concentrations isotonic with human blood. It is most commonly used for fluid resuscitation after blood loss due to trauma, surgery, or burn injury.

[[Makossa]]

CATEGORIES: Makossa, African popular music, Cameroonian styles of music

Makossa is a noted Cameroonian popular urban musical style. Like much other late 20th century music of Sub-Saharan Africa It uses strong electric bass rhythms and prominent brass. In the 1980s makossa had a wave of mainstream success across Africa and to a lesser extent abroad. 
Makossa, which means "(I) dance" in the Duala language,[ref]
 Section "Cultural-based terms" (last line)[/ref] originated from a Duala dance called the kossa. Emmanuel Nelle Eyoum started using the refrain kossa kossa in his songs with his group Los Calvinos. The style began to take shape in the 1950s though the first recordings were not seen until a decade later. Artists such as Eboa Lotin, Misse Ngoh and especially Manu Dibango, who popularised makossa throughout the world with his song "Soul Makossa" in the early 1970s. The chant from the song, mamako, mamasa, maka makossa, was later used by Michael Jackson in "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'". Many other performers followed suit. The 2010 World cup also brought makossa to the international stage as Shakira sampled the Golden Sounds popular song "Zamina mina (Zangalewa)". 
Makassi is a lighter style of makossa.

[[Dream, After Dream]]

CATEGORIES: Film soundtracks, Journey (band) albums, Albums produced by Kevin Elson, 1980 soundtracks, Columbia Records soundtracks

Dream, After Dream, performed by the American rock band Journey, is the soundtrack album to the Japanese film, Yume, Yume No Ato. Released in 1980 on Columbia Records, it was the seventh album-length recording by the group. The soundtrack, however, firmly overshadowed the film itself, which enjoyed little notoriety. The album is notable for being a significant departure from the arena rock which characterized the band's three preceding albums, harking back to their progressive rock beginnings and relying on complex musicianship and instrumentals.
Dream, After Dream features a full vocal on three of its nine tracks, "Destiny", "Sand Castles" and "Little Girl". "Little Girl" was later the B-side of the "Open Arms" single and was featured on Journey's Time3 collection. The track also appears as a bonus track on the 2006 reissue of Departure and in 2011 on Greatest Hits 2. "Destiny" is the bands longest recorded song.
This was the last studio album to feature founding member Gregg Rolie.

[[Ornament and Crime]]
CATEGORIES: Modernism, 1910 essays

Ornament and Crime was first spoken in a lecture on 21 January 1910 in Vienna and first published in Cahiers d'aujourd'hui 5/1913Janet Stewart, Fashioning Vienna: Adolf Loos's Cultural Criticism, London: Routledge, 2000 by the influential and self-consciously "modern" Austrian architect Adolf Loos under the German title Ornament und Verbrechen. It was under this challenging title that in 1913 the essay was translated into French and did not appear in German until 1929:Janet Stewart, Fashioning Vienna: Adolf Loos's Cultural Criticism, London: Routledge, 2000, p. 173 "The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects", Loos proclaimed, linking the optimistic sense of the linear and upward progress of cultures with the contemporary vogue for applying evolution to cultural contexts.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]  
In Loos's essay, "passion for smooth and precious surfaces"Studio International, 1973, Volume 186, Number 957, "Adolf Loos: the new vision" he explains his philosophy, describing how ornamentation can have the effect of causing objects to go out of style and thus become obsolete.  It struck him that it was a crime to waste the effort needed to add ornamentation, when the ornamentation would cause the object to soon go out of style.  Loos introduced a sense of the "immorality" of ornament, describing it as  "degenerate", its suppression as necessary for regulating modern society. He took as one of his examples the tattooing of the "Papuan" and the intense surface decorations of the objects about him—Loos considered the Papuan not to have evolved to the moral and civilized circumstances of modern man, who, should he tattoo himself,  would either be considered a criminal or a degenerate.[tpl]cite book|author=Loos, A.|year=1908|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930[/tpl]
The essay was written when Art Nouveau, which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900, was about to show a new way of modern art. The essay is important in articulating some moralizing views, inherited from the Arts and Crafts movement, which would be fundamental to the Bauhaus design studio and would help define the ideology of Modernism in architecture.

An aperture grille (tension mask) is one of two major technologies used to manufacture color cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions and computer displays; the other is shadow mask.
Fine vertical wires behind the front glass of the display screen separate the different colors of phosphors into strips. These wires are positioned such that an electron beam from one of three guns at the rear of the tube is only able to strike phosphors of the appropriate color. That is, the blue electron gun will strike blue phosphors, but will find a wire blocks the path to red and green phosphors.
The fine wires allow for a finer dot pitch as they can be spaced much closer together than the perforations of a shadow mask, and there need be no gap between adjacent horizontal pixels.
During the display of bright images, a shadow mask warms, and expands outward in all directions (sometimes called blooming). Aperture grilles do not exhibit this behavior; when the wires heat up, they expand vertically. Because there are no defined holes, this expansion does not affect the image, and the wires do not move horizontally.
The vertical wires of the aperture grille have a resonant frequency and will vibrate in sympathetic resonance with loud sounds near the display, resulting in fluttering and shimmering of colors on the display. To reduce these resonant effects, one or two horizontal stabilizing wires, called "damping wires", are welded across the grille wires, and may be visible as fine dark lines across the face of the screen. These stabilizing wires provide the easiest way to distinguish aperture grille and shadow mask displays at a glance. The stabilized grille can still vibrate but the sounds need to be loud and close to the display.
Additionally, aperture grille displays tend to be vertically flat and are often horizontally flat as well, while shadow mask displays usually have a spherical curvature.
The first patented aperture grille televisions were manufactured by Sony in the late 1960s under the Trinitron brand name, which the company carried over to its line of CRT computer monitors. Subsequent designs, either licensed from Sony or manufactured after the patent's expiration, tend to use the -tron suffix, such as Mitsubishi's DiamondTron and ViewSonic's SonicTron.
Cromaclear is an improvement of the aperture grille technology, pioneered by the NEC Corporation; one of its advantage is the lack of the damping wires.
While many considered aperture grille technology to produce superior images, advances in shadow mask and hybrid technologies since the 1990s have made people's preferences more a matter of personal choice or specific application. Furthermore, the arrival of inexpensive liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors and other flat-screen designs has, for many applications, rendered CRTs obsolete.

[[Shadow mask]]
CATEGORIES: Cathode ray tube

The shadow mask is one of the technologies used to manufacture cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions and computer displays that produce color images. Another approach is the aperture grille, better known by its trade name, Trinitron. All early color televisions and the majority of CRT computer monitors used shadow mask technology. Both of these technologies are largely obsolete, having been increasingly replaced since the 1990s by the liquid-crystal display (LCD).
A shadow mask is a metal plate punched with tiny holes that separate the colored phosphors in the layer behind the front glass of the screen. Three electron guns at the back of the screen sweep across the mask, with the beams only reaching the screen if they pass through the holes. As the guns are physically separated at the back of the tube, their beams approach the mask from three slightly different angles, so after passing through the holes they hit slightly different locations on the screen. The screen is patterned with dots of colored phosphor positioned so that each can only be hit by one of the beams coming from the three electron guns. For instance, the blue phosphor dots are hit by the beam from the "blue gun" after passing through a particular hole in the mask. The other two guns do the same for the red and green dots. This arrangement allows the three guns to address the individual dot colors on the screen, even though their beams are much too large and too poorly aimed to do so without the mask in place.
The red, green, and blue phosphors for each pixel are generally arranged in a triangular shape (sometimes called a "triad"). For television use, modern displays (starting in the late 1960s) use rectangular slots instead of circular holes, improving brightness.

The screenplay by Stallone was originally written for the film Beverly Hills Cop. It was loosely based on the novel Fair Game by Paula Gosling, which was later filmed under that title in 1995. He had wanted to make a less comedic, more action-oriented film. When he left that project, Eddie Murphy was brought in to play the lead role.

Born in Bentonia, Mississippi, United States, he died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
He first learned to play guitar from another bluesman from the area, Henry Stuckey. His guitar playing is noted for its dark, minor sound, played in an open D-minor tuning with an intricate fingerpicking technique. James first recorded for Paramount Records in 1931, but these recordings sold poorly due to the Great Depression, and he drifted into obscurity. After a long absence from the public eye, James was "rediscovered" in 1964 by three blues enthusiasts, helping further the blues and folk music revival of the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, James appeared at several folk and blues festivals and gave live concerts around the country, also recording several albums for various record labels.
His songs have influenced several generations of musicians, being adapted or covered by Kansas Joe McCoy, Robert Johnson, Alan Wilson, Cream, Deep Purple, Chris Thomas King, Alvin Youngblood Hart, The Derek Trucks Band, Beck, Big Sugar, Eric Clapton, Lucinda Williams and Rory Block. He is hailed as "one of the seminal figures of the blues."[tpl]cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/413213341.html?dids=413213341:413213341&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+28%2C+2003&author=Richard+Cromelin&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=TELEVISION%3B+%27Blues%27+out+of+rhythm%3B+Infinitely+rich+subject+matter+suffers+from+a+lack+of+a+thematic+line+in+the+hands+of+seven+directors+--+though+Wim+Wenders+gets+it+right.&pqatl=google |title=TELEVISION; 'Blues' out of rhythm; Infinitely rich subject matter suffers from a lack of a thematic line in the hands of seven directors - though Wim Wenders gets it right |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2003-09-28 |accessdate=2011-12-30[/tpl]

A roots revival (folk revival) is a trend which includes young performers popularizing the traditional musical styles of their ancestors.

The term roots revival is vague, and may not always refer to identical events. Characteristics associated with a roots revival include:
With such a vague and variable definition, roots revival could be seen as referring to the creation of any kind of pop music industry, though there are countries with well-developed pop traditions that have not had a period referred to as a roots revival (such as Jamaica, India, Cuba and Kenya). For example, homogenized pop has long had its fans in most every country in the world, but many of these nations have created their own indigenous pop styles out of folk music; this process could be called a roots revival, though in some cases the folk musics in question were still widespread and did not need to be revived.

The Toyota Celica [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|ɨ|k|ə[/tpl] is a sports compact car which was produced by the Japanese company Toyota from 1970 to 2006. The Celica name was ultimately derived from the Latin word coelica meaning "heavenly" or "celestial". In Japan, the Celica was exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships Toyota Corolla Store.
Throughout its life span the Celica has been powered by various four-cylinder engines.  The most significant change occurred in August 1985, when the car's drive layout was changed from rear wheel drive to front wheel drive.  During the first three generations, American market Celicas were powered by various versions of Toyota's R series engines. The four-wheel drive turbocharged model called GT-Four worldwide (All-Trac Turbo in the US) was produced from 1986 to 1999. Variable Valve Timing came in certain Japanese models starting in December 1997, and became standard in all models from 2000 on. Through seven generations, the model has gone through many revisions and design forks, including the Toyota Celica Supra (later known as the Toyota Supra). The Celica was available as notchback and liftback coupes, as well as a convertible.

International relations theory is the study of international relations from a theoretical perspective; it attempts to provide a conceptual framework upon which international relations can be analyzed.http://www.irtheory.com/ Ole Holsti describes international relations theories as acting like pairs of coloured sunglasses that allow the wearer to see only salient events relevant to the theory; e.g. an adherent of realism may completely disregard an event that a constructivist might pounce upon as crucial, and vice versa. The three most popular theories are realism, liberalism and constructivism.Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.52
International relations theories can be divided into "positivist/rationalist" theories which focus on a principally state-level analysis, and "post-positivist/reflectivist" ones which incorporate expanded meanings of security, ranging from class, to gender, to postcolonial security.  Many often conflicting ways of thinking exist in IR theory, including constructivism, institutionalism, Marxism, neo-Gramscianism, and others.  However, two positivist schools of thought are most prevalent: realism and liberalism; though increasingly, constructivism is becoming mainstream.Reus-Smit, Christian. "Constructivism."

[[Route inspection problem]]

CATEGORIES: NP-complete problems, Computational problems in graph theory

In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, the Chinese postman problem (CPP), postman tour  or route inspection problem is to find a shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of a (connected) undirected graph. When the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a closed walk that covers every edge once), that circuit is an optimal solution.
Alan Goldman of the U.S. National Bureau of Standards first coined the name 'Chinese Postman Problem' for this problem, as it was originally studied by the Chinese mathematician Kwan Mei-Ko in 1962.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/chinesePostman.html | title="Chinese Postman Problem"[/tpl]

[[William Emerson (mathematician)]]
CATEGORIES: 1701 births, 1782 deaths, 18th-century English mathematicians, People from County Durham

William Emerson (14 May 1701 – 20 May 1782), English mathematician, was born at Hurworth, near Darlington, where his father, Dudley Emerson, also a mathematician, taught a school. William himself had a small estate in Weardale called Castle Gate situated not far from Eastgate where he would repair to work throughout the Summer on projects as disparate as stonemasonry and watchmaking.
Unsuccessful as a teacher, he devoted himself entirely to studious retirement. Possessed of remarkable energy and forthrightness of speech, Emerson published many works which are singularly free from errata.
In The Principles of Mechanics (1754) he shows a wind-powered vehicle in which the vertically mounted propeller gives direct power to the front wheels via a system of cogs. In mechanics he never advanced a proposition which he had not previously tested in practice, nor published an invention without first proving its effects by a model. He was skilled in the science of music, the theory of sounds, and the ancient and modern scales; but he never attained any excellence as a performer. He died on 20 May 1782 at his native village, where his gravestone bears epitaphs in Latin and Hebrew.
Emerson dressed in old clothes and his manners were uncouth. He wore his shirt back to front and his legs wrapped in sacking so as not to scorch them as he sat over the fire. He declined an offer to become FRS because it would cost too much after all the expense of farthing candles he had been put to in the course of his life of study. Emerson rode regularly into Darlington on a horse like Don Quixote's, led by a hired small boy. In old age, plagued by the stone, he would alternately pray and curse, wishing his soul 'could shake off the rags of mortality without such a clitter-me-clatter.'

[[Planck scale]]

CATEGORIES: Astrophysics, Particle physics, Physical cosmology, Quantum gravity, Quantum field theory

In particle physics and physical cosmology, the Planck scale (named after Max Planck) is an energy scale around 1.22 × 1019 GeV (which corresponds by the mass–energy equivalence to the Planck mass 2.17645 × 10−8 kg) at which quantum effects of gravity become strong. At this scale, present descriptions and theories of sub-atomic particle interactions in terms of quantum field theory break down and become inadequate, due to the impact of the apparent non-renormalizability of gravity within current theories.
At the Planck scale, the strength of gravity is expected to become comparable with the other forces, and it is theorized that all the fundamental forces are unified at that scale, but the exact mechanism of this unification remains unknown. The Planck scale is therefore the point where the effects of quantum gravity can no longer be ignored in other fundamental interactions, and where current calculations and approaches begin to break down, and a means to take account of its impact is required.
While physicists have a fairly good understanding of the other fundamental interactions of forces on the quantum level, gravity is problematic, and cannot be integrated with quantum mechanics at very high energies using the usual framework of quantum field theory. At lesser energy levels it is usually ignored, while for energies approaching or exceeding the Planck scale, a new theory of quantum gravity is required. The current leading approaches[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] are string theory and M-theory.  Other approaches to this problem include Loop quantum gravity, Noncommutative geometry, and Causal set theory.
The term Planck scale can also refer to a length scale or time scale.
The Planck length is related to Planck energy by the uncertainty principle. At this scale, the concepts of size and distance break down, as quantum indeterminacy becomes virtually absolute. Because the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is roughly equal to the Compton wavelength at the Planck scale, a photon with sufficient energy to probe this realm would yield no information whatsoever. Any photon energetic enough to precisely measure a Planck-sized object could actually create a particle of that dimension, but it would be massive enough to immediately become a black hole (a.k.a. Planck particle), thus completely distorting that region of space, and swallowing the photon. This is the most extreme example possible of the uncertainty principle, and explains why only a quantum gravity theory reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics will allow us to understand the dynamics of space-time at this scale. Planck scale dynamics are important for cosmology because if we trace the evolution of the cosmos back to the very beginning, at some very early stage the universe should have been so hot that processes involving energies as high as the Planck energy (corresponding to distances as short as the Planck length) may have occurred. This period is therefore called the Planck era or Planck epoch.

Sorrento  (Neapolitan: Surriento) is a small town in Campania, southern Italy, with some 16,500 inhabitants. It is a popular tourist destination which can be reached easily from Naples and Pompeii, as it lies at the south-eastern end of the Circumvesuviana rail line.  The town overlooks the Bay of Naples as the key place of the Sorrentine Peninsula, and many viewpoints allow sight of Naples itself, Vesuvius, and the Isle of Capri.
The Amalfi Drive (connecting Sorrento and Amalfi) is a narrow road that threads along the high cliffs above the Tyrrhenian Sea.
Ferry boats and hydrofoils provide services to Naples, Amalfi, Positano, Capri and Ischia. Sorrento's sea cliffs and luxury hotels have attracted notable people, including Enrico Caruso and Luciano Pavarotti.
Sorrento is famous for the production of limoncello, a digestif made from lemon rinds, alcohol, water and sugar. Other agricultural production includes citrus fruit, wine, nuts and olives. Wood craftsmanship is also developed.

The team is nicknamed Dragões (Dragons), for the mythological creature standing atop the club's crest, or Azuis e brancos (Blue and white), for their kit colours; their supporters are called Portistas.
As of 2014, Porto is the most successful Portuguese club, having won a total of 74 senior titles. Domestically, it has 67 titles (one less than Benfica), which include 27 Primeira Liga trophies. Porto is the only Portuguese team to have won a record five consecutive league titles, between 1994–95 and 1998–99. Other national honours won by the club include the Taça de Portugal (16 times), the defunct Campeonato de Portugal (a record four times, along with Sporting CP) and the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira (a record 20 times, five of which in succession). Porto became the second team in Portuguese league history, after Benfica, to complete two full 30-game seasons without defeats, namely in the 2010–11 and 2012–13 seasons. In the former, Porto achieved the largest difference ever between champion and runners-up (21 points) in a 3 points-per-win system.
Porto is an internationally successful team, having won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League in 1987 and 2004, the UEFA Cup/Europa League in 2003 and 2011, the UEFA Super Cup in 1987, and the Intercontinental Cup in 1987 and 2004, for a total of seven titles. They are the only Portuguese team to have won any of the last three competitions and one of few teams in the world to have won three international titles in the same season (1987). In addition, Porto were runners-up in the 1983–84 European Cup Winners' Cup and the 2003, 2004 and 2011 editions of the UEFA Super Cup.

According to the Book of Mormon, the Lamanites are members of a historically dark-skinned nation of indigenous Americans that occasionally battled with the historically light-skinned Nephite nation. They are usually described as descendants of Laman and Lemuel, two rebellious brothers of a family of Israelites who crossed the ocean in a ship around 600 BC.  Their brother Nephi founded the Nephite nation.[tpl]Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=9|verse=2[/tpl]
The Lamanites were cut off from the presence of the Lord as a curse for their rebelliousness, and later gained their dark skin as a sign of this curse.[tpl]Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=2 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=21[/tpl]Hugh Nibley, Lehi in the Desert (1950): 73-74.[tpl]citation |title="The Charge of 'Racism' in the Book of Mormon" |first= John A. |last= Tvedtnes |journal=FARMS Review |volume=15 |issue= 2 |year=2003 |pages=183–198[/tpl] They warred with the Nephites over a period of centuries. The book says that Jesus appeared and converted all the Nephites and Lamanites to Christianity; however, after about two centuries, many of these Christians fell away and took upon themselves the name of Lamanites,[tpl]Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=4 Nephi|chapter=1|verse=20[/tpl] leading some of the "true believers in Christ" to rechristen themselves Nephites.[tpl]Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=4 Nephi|chapter=1|verse=36[/tpl] It was this group of Lamanites that eventually exterminated all the Nephites. By the end of the Book of Mormon, the Lamanites were defined less by their skin color than by their lack of Christianity. Many Mormons[tpl]who|date=December 2013[/tpl] believe that the Polynesian people originated from the descendents of Hagoth who led his people off on a ship and was never heard from again. Although Hagoth was a Nephite, these Mormons regard Polynesians as Lamanites.
No non-LDS archaeologists, geneticists, and historians has ever found data relating to the existence of Lamanites from any other source, but adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement typically believe that the Lamanites comprise some part, if not the entirety, of the indigenous peoples of the Americas and the Polynesian people.

The Bonnot Gang (La Bande à Bonnot) was a French criminal anarchist group that operated in France and Belgium during the Belle Époque, from 1911 to 1912. Composed of individuals who identified with the emerging illegalist milieu, the gang utilized cutting-edge technology (including automobiles and repeating rifles) not yet available to the French police.
Originally referred to by the press as simply "The Auto Bandits", the gang was dubbed "The Bonnot Gang" after Jules Bonnot gave an interview at the office of Le Petit Parisien, a popular daily paper. Bonnot's perceived prominence within the group was later reinforced by his high-profile death during a shootout with French police in Choisy-le-Roi.
Their story was adapted in cinema in 1969.Bonnot's Gang (1969) It also appeared in the popular 70s TV series Les Brigades du Tigre and its cinematographic adaptation made in 2005 with Jacques Gamblin as Jules Bonnot.

[[Wickham]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Hampshire

Wickham, formerly spelled Wykeham, is a small historic village and civil parish in Hampshire, southern England, located about three miles north of Fareham. It is within the City of Winchester local government district, although it is considerably closer to Fareham than to Winchester. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 4,816.
The centre of Wickham is focused on its wide and well-proportioned square, which is lined with historic buildings and is designated a conservation area.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]
It was the fording place of the River Meon on the Roman road between Noviomagus Regnorum (Chichester) and Venta Belgarum (Winchester), and the inferred divergent point of the route to Clausentum (Bitterne). The Roman road from Wickham to Chichester is still followed today by local roads, passing behind Portsdown Hill to the north of Portsmouth Harbour and then onwards via Havant. In contrast, the route to Winchester is mostly likely lost through neglect in the Dark Ages, before present field patterns emerged.
There have been a reasonable number of sites identified nearby associated with Romano-British industry. These have mainly been pottery kilns focused around the limit of navigation of the River Hamble, near Botley. It is also here that a ford on the Clausentum road has been identified.
Wickham has occasionally been hypothesised as an alternative to Nursling (on the River Test) or Neatham (near Alton) for the Roman station Onna listed in the Antonine Itinerary. However, no definite location for Onna has been determined.
It was the birthplace of William of Wykeham, founder of Winchester College and New College, Oxford.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/bios/wmofwkhm/early.html |title=Biography of William of Wykeham (1324-1404), Bishop of Winchester |publisher=Britannia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28[/tpl]
The Admiralty Shutter Telegraph Line had a station at Wickham.

Over time, mamluks became a powerful military caste in various Muslim societies.  Particularly in Egypt, but also in the Levant, Mesopotamia, and India, mamluks held political and military power.  In some cases, they attained the rank of sultan, while in others they held regional power as amirs or beys.  Most notably, mamluk factions seized the sultanate for themselves in Egypt and Syria in a period known as the Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1517).  The Mamluk Sultanate famously beat back the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut and fought the Crusaders, effectively driving them out from the Levant by 1291 and officially in 1302 ending the era of the Crusades.[tpl]cite web|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|title=The Crusades Episode 3|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01bqy7r/The_Crusades_Victory_and_Defeat/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl]
While mamluks were purchased, their status was above ordinary slaves, who were not allowed to carry weapons or perform certain tasks. In places such as Egypt from the Ayyubid dynasty to the time of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, mamluks were considered to be “true lords", with social status above freeborn Muslims.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris.

[[Transmeta Crusoe]]

CATEGORIES: Microprocessors, X86 microprocessors, Embedded microprocessors, Transmeta microprocessors

The Crusoe is a family of x86-compatible microprocessors developed by Transmeta. Crusoe was notable for its method of achieving x86 compatibility. Instead of the instruction set architecture being implemented in hardware, or translated by specialized hardware, the Crusoe runs a software abstraction layer, or a virtual machine, known as the Code Morphing Software (CMS). The CMS translates machine code instructions received from programs into native instructions for the microprocessor. In this way, the Crusoe can emulate other instruction set architectures (ISAs).
Currently, this is used to allow the microprocessors to emulate the Intel x86 instruction set. In theory, it is possible for the CMS to be modified to emulate other ISAs. Transmeta demonstrated Crusoe executing Java bytecode by translating the bytecodes into instructions in its native instruction set. The addition of an abstraction layer between the x86 instruction stream and the hardware means that the hardware architecture can change without breaking compatibility, just by modifying the CMS. For example, Transmeta Efficeon — a second-generation Transmeta design — has a 256-bit-wide VLIW core versus the 128-bit core of the Crusoe.
Crusoe performs in software some of the functionality traditionally implemented in hardware (e.g. instruction re-ordering), resulting in simpler hardware with fewer transistors. The relative simplicity of the hardware means that Crusoe consumes less power (and therefore generates less heat) than other x86-compatible microprocessors running at the same frequency.
Transmeta Crusoe's software emulation of the x86 instruction set caused x86 programs to run very slowly[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] compared to a real x86 processor (a 700MHz Crusoe ran x86 programs at the speed of a 500MHz Pentium III x86 processor).[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Transmeta-Are-the-chips-down/2100-1006_3-275353.html|title=Transmeta: Are the chips down?|first1=Michael|last1=Kanellos|first2=Rachel|last2=Konrad|publisher=CNET|date=November 5, 2001[/tpl]

[[Illbient]]

CATEGORIES: Ambient music, Trip hop

Illbient is a term allegedly coined by DJ Olive to describe the iconoclastic[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2010[/tpl] music being produced by a community of artists based in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York in 1994.http://www.discogs.com/artist/DJ+Olive  The word "Illbient" is a portmanteau of the hip hop slang term "ill" (a positive expression: bad meaning good) and "ambient". 
Psychedelic musician Helios Creed joked that "although Eno invented ambient music while ill in bed - 'illbient' is actually an extreme retro offshoot that demands that the listener produces a doctor's note before being allowed to purchase."
Though there are many individualistic variants of illbient, the music is characterized by interesting dub-wise layering of soundscapes, hip hop-influenced use of samples and a progressive approach to beat programming that encompasses all genres of world groove and electronic music.  Usually, but not always, illbient uses beats more than purely ambient music, and often illbient includes loops in the recordings.
Illbient was introduced to the public at large in 1996 through the Asphodel Records Incursions in Illbient compilation and a feature in The Wire magazine.  
According to DJ Spooky, DJ Olive started an event in Brooklyn called Lalalandia - that had nothing to do with illbient. DJ Spooky also claims to have invented the word "illbient" in relation to the multicultural digital arts scene in Manhattan.[tpl]cite web |url = http://thephoenix.com/boston/music/54467-beyond-illbient/ |title = Beyond illbient |last =  Garelick |first = Jon | date = January 14, 2008 |publisher = The Boston Phoenix |accessdate= February 4, 2013 [/tpl] To his credit, he released Necropolis, a mix CD in 1996 as a follow up to the 1995 Subharmonic release VALIS 1 CD that first pulled together many illbient associated artists. DJ Spooky wrote the liner notes to the VALIS release and recommended many of the artists that were included on the compilation. DJ Spooky strongly disagrees that DJ Olive coined the term illbient[tpl]Clarify|date=June 2011[/tpl]. The compilation that Asphodel put out took many of the same artists that DJ Spooky pulled together, and made a commercial release in October 1996.
DJ Spooky's events like Molecular at The Gas Station on Avenue B and Second street in Manhattan set the tone for the genre, and predated all of the Manhattan events around what later came to be called "illbient."

In object-oriented computer programming, an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. Various types of iterators are often provided via a container's interface. Though the interface and semantics of a given iterator are fixed, iterators are often implemented in terms of the structures underlying a container implementation and are often tightly coupled to the container to enable the operational semantics of the iterator. Note that an iterator performs traversal and also gives access to data elements in a container, but does not perform iteration (i.e., not without some significant liberty taken with that concept or with trivial use of the terminology). An iterator is behaviorally similar to a database cursor. Iterators date to the CLU programming language in 1974.

Lochgoilhead ([tpl]lang-gd|'Ceann Loch Goibhle'[/tpl]) is a small village of some 300-400 people in the Scottish Highlands in Argyll, Scotland.
The main employment spheres include tourism, agriculture (mainly sheep farming), and forestry. There are two outdoor education centres in the village, The Lochgoilhead National Activity Centre and Ardroy Outdoor Education Centre. Tourism more than doubles the village population during the summer months. Two single-track roads both lead in and out of the village. It has a Post Office, village store, a medical and dental practice, two hotels, two pubs, and an inn. 
BBC News correspondent Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped in The Gaza Strip by Palestinian militants, spent many years in Lochgoilhead in his youth. The highlands above the village were used for the scene in the 1963 James Bond film From Russia with Love in which Bond (played by Sean Connery) eliminated two villains in a helicopter by firing gunshots at them.From Russia with Love (1963) - Filming locations The 1985 Scottish movie Restless Natives also used Lochgoilhead to film a chase scene, as well as some roads just outside the village.

The site covers an area of about 5 miles (8 km) square. The ruins of the ancient structures had their stones reused for residential construction of the agricultural village of Rockstone Pond in modern times, but the ancient site did not come to the attention of archeologists until 1963. The Old Northern Highway connects Altun Ha to Belize's Northern Highway, and the site is accessible for tourism.

The [tpl]unicode|Ismāʿīlī[/tpl] get their name from their acceptance of Isma'il ibn Jafar as the appointed spiritual successor ([tpl]unicode|Imām[/tpl]) to Ja'far al-Sadiq, wherein they differ from the Twelvers, who accept Musa al-Kadhim, younger brother of Isma'il, as the true [tpl]unicode|Imām[/tpl].Encyclopaedia Iranica, ISMAʿILISM
Tracing its earliest theology to the lifetime of Muhammad, Ismailism rose at one point to become the largest branch of Shī‘ism, climaxing as a political power with the Fatimid Caliphate in the tenth through twelfth centuries.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ismaili.net/Source/0016b.html | title = Religion of My Ancestors | accessdate = 2007-04-25[/tpl] Ismailis believe in the oneness of God, as well as the closing of divine revelation with Muhammad, whom they see as "the final Prophet and Messenger of God to all humanity". The Ismāʿīlī and the Twelvers both accept the same initial Imams from the descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah and therefore share much of their early history. Both groups see the family of Muḥammad (the Ahl al-Bayt) as divinely chosen, infallible (ismah), and guided by God to lead the Islamic community (Ummah), a belief that distinguishes them from the majority Sunni branch of Islam.
After the death of Muhammad ibn Ismail in the 8th century AD, the teachings of Ismailism further transformed into the belief system as it is known today, with an explicit concentration on the deeper, esoteric meaning (batin) of the Islamic religion. With the eventual development of Twelverism into the more literalistic (zahir) oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shi'i Islam developed into two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismaili group focusing on the mystical path and nature of God, with the "Imām of the Time" representing the manifestation of truth and reality, with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law (sharia) and the deeds and sayings (sunnah) of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams who were guides and a light to God.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | title = Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i | accessdate = 2007-04-25[/tpl]
Though there are several paths (tariqat) within Ismailism, the term in today's vernacular generally refers to the Nizaris, who recognize the Aga Khan IVhttp://www.theismaili.org/cms/14/The-Aga-Khan Aga Khan IV as the 49th hereditary Imam and is the largest Ismaili group. In recent centuries Ismāʿīlīs have largely been a Pakistani, Indian and Afghani community,Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.76 but Ismaili minorities are also found in Bangladesh, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, East Africa, Angola, Lebanon, and South Africa, and have in recent years emigrated to Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Trinidad and Tobago.[tpl]cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=A Short History of the Ismailis |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn=0-7486-0687-4 |pages=1–4[/tpl] There are also a significant number of Ismāʿīlīs in Central Asia.Dr. Sarfaroz Niyozov, University of Toronto [tpl]cite web | url =http://simerg.com/literary-readings/literary-reading-shia-ismaili-tradition-in-central-asia-evolution-continuities-and-changes-2/ | title = Shi'a Ismaili Tradition in Central Asia – Evolution, and Continuities and Changes | accessdate = 2012-03-20[/tpl]

I told her about the dates and she stared at me. 'Mother always said I was born at Easter.

A versatile author, she is best known for her 1936 hit play The Women, which had an all-female cast. Her writings extended from drama and screen scenarios to fiction, journalism, and war reportage. She was the wife of Henry Luce, publisher of Time, Life and Fortune. 
Politically, Luce was a Republican who became steadily more conservative in later life. In her youth however, she flirted briefly with the Democratic liberalism of Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a protege of Bernard Baruch.Morris, pp. 191–198. During her two terms as a Congresswoman from Connecticut in the early 1940s, her moderate views, especially toward blacks, immigrants, and women denied professional careers, contrasted with those of most of men in her party. Although she was a strong supporter of the Anglo-American alliance in World War II, she remained outspokenly critical of the British presence in India.Clare Boothe Luce, Address to the India League of America, August 9, 1943, Clare Boothe Luce Papers, Library of Congress (hereafter CBLP-LC).

[[OpenGL Utility Library]]

CATEGORIES: OpenGL

The OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) is a computer graphics library for OpenGL.
It consists of a number of functions that use the base OpenGL library to provide higher-level drawing routines from the more primitive routines that OpenGL provides.  It is usually distributed with the base OpenGL package.  GLU is not implemented in the embedded version of the OpenGL package, OpenGL ES.
Among these features are mapping between screen- and world-coordinates, generation of texture mipmaps, drawing of quadric surfaces, NURBS, tessellation of polygonal primitives, interpretation of OpenGL error codes, an extended range of transformation routines for setting up viewing volumes and simple positioning of the camera, generally in more human-friendly terms than the routines presented by OpenGL.  It also provides additional primitives for use in OpenGL applications, including spheres, cylinders and disks.
GLU functions can be easily recognized by looking at them because they all have glu as a prefix. An example function is gluOrtho2D() which defines a two dimensional orthographic projection matrix.
Specifications for GLU are available at the

The modern name "caltrop" is derived from the Latin calcitrapa (foot-trap). The synonymous Latin word tribulus gave rise to the modern Latin name of a plant offering similar hazards to sandaled or bare feet, Tribulus terrestris (Zygophyllaceae), whose spiked seed case can injure feet and puncture tires.

[[Call Level Interface]]

CATEGORIES: SQL, Open Group standards

The Call Level Interface (CLI) is a software standard defined in ISO/IEC 9075-3:2003. The Call Level Interface defines how a program should send SQL queries to the database management system (DBMS) and how the returned recordsets should be handled by the application in a consistent way. Developed in the early 1990s, the API was defined only for the C and COBOL programming languages.
The interface is part of what The Open Group refers to as the Common Application Environment, which is intended to be a wide standard for programming open applications, i.e. applications from different programming teams and different vendors that can interoperate in an efficient manner. SQL/CLI provides an international standard implementation-independent CLI to access SQL databases. Client-server tools can easily access databases through Dynamic-link libraries (DLL). It supports and encourages a rich set of client-server tools.
The most widespread use of the CLI standard is the basis of the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) specification, which is widely used to allow applications to transparently access database systems from different vendors. The current version of the API, ODBC 3.52, incorporates features from both the ISO and X/Open standards (see below).

CATEGORIES: Chess engines

Junior is a computer chess program written by the Israeli programmers Amir Ban and Shay Bushinsky. Grandmaster Boris Alterman assisted, in particular with the opening book. Junior can take advantage of multiple processors, taking the name Deep Junior when competing this way in tournaments.
According to Bushinsky, one of the innovations of Junior over other chess programs is the way it counts moves. Junior counts orthodox, ordinary moves as two moves, while it counts interesting moves as only one move, or even less. In this way interesting variations are analyzed more meticulously than less promising lines. This seems to be a generalization of search extensions  already used by other programs.
Another approach its designers claim to use is 'opponent modeling'; Junior might play moves that are not objectively the strongest but that exploit the weaknesses of the opponent. According to Don Dailey ″It has some evaluation that can sting if it's in the right situation—that no other program has.″TCEC, November, 11 2013: Don Dailey (Komodo) (Season 2 Participant) ″Junior is not super strong, but it's super dangerous—if that makes any sense.

[[De facto standard]]

CATEGORIES: Technological change, Standards

A ''de facto'' standard is a custom, convention, product, or system that has achieved a dominant position by public acceptance or market forces (such as early entrance to the market). De facto is a Latin phrase that means "concerning fact." De facto  means "existing in fact,"thefreedictionary.com/de+facto   adv; in fact, adj; existing in fact, whether legally recognized or not or "in practice but not necessarily ordained by law" or "in practice or actuality, but not officially established."
The term "de facto standard" is used in contrast with obligatory standards (also known as "de jure standards"); or to express the dominant voluntary standard, when there is more than one  standard available for the same use.
In social sciences, a voluntary standard that is also a de facto standard is a typical solution to a coordination problem.[tpl]cite book |first=Edna |last=Ullmann-Margalit |title=The Emergence of Norms |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1977 |isbn=0-19-824411-8 [/tpl] The choice of a de facto standard tends to be stable in situations in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. In contrast, an enforced "de jure standard" is a solution to the prisoner's problem.

[[Punta Gorda, Belize]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Toledo District

Punta Gorda, known locally as P.G., is the capital and largest town of Toledo District in southern Belize. Punta Gorda is the southernmost sizable town in the nation, with a population of about 5,000 people. Although the town bears a Spanish name, its inhabitants are mostly Kriol/English-speaking, and are primarily of Garifuna, East Indian, Kriol, and Maya descent.
Punta Gorda is a seaport and fishing town on the Caribbean Sea. It was a small fishing village before it was settled by a number of Garifuna emigrants from Honduras in 1823. The town is about fifteen feet above sea level.
Punta Gorda is the main point of transportation for people visiting the Toledo District and the offshore southern cayes. There is a small airport which serves domestic flights from Maya Island Air and Tropic Air.  James Bus Line is based in Punta Gorda and offers a regular service to points north such as Independence, Dangriga, Belmopan, and Belize City.  Water taxis offer daily crossings to Puerto Barrios and twice weekly service to Livingston in Guatemala. Unlike the sophisticated, purpose-built water taxis plying the routes between Belize city and the northern cays, the services from Punta Gorda are provided by small, open boats.  Crossings can be quite interesting, and schedules can be somewhat erratic.
There are several hotels in Punta Gorda that draw tourists with their ocean views, including BlueBelize, Coral House Inn, Seafront Inn, Beya Suites, and Tropics Inn. Punta Gorda is also a gateway to several well-regarded jungle accommodations, including Cotton Tree Lodge, The Lodge at Big Falls, Belcampo Lodge, and Hickatee Cottages. Every May the town hosts the Toledo Cacao Festival, held over the Commonwealth Day Holiday weekend, which celebrates Toledo District's ancient and modern-day links with cacao and chocolate. 
Well-known people from Punta Gorda include paranda musician Paul Nabor and Belize's 'Queen of Brukdown', Leela Vernon.
The town is served by Punta Gorda Hospital.

The Corris Railway (Welsh: Rheilffordd Corris) is a narrow gauge preserved  railway based in Corris  on the border between Merionethshire (now Gwynedd) and Montgomeryshire (now Powys) in Mid-Wales.
The line opened in 1859, and originally ran from Derwenlas, south east of Machynlleth north to Corris and on to Aberllefenni. Branches served the slate quarries at Corris Uchaf, Aberllefenni, the isolated quarries around Ratgoed and quarries along the length of the Dulas Valley.
The railway closed in 1948, but a preservation society was formed in 1966, initially opening a museum; a short section of line between Corris and Maespoeth was re-opened to passengers in 2002. The railway now operates as a tourist attraction. A new steam locomotive was built for the railway, which was delivered in 2005. The two surviving locomotives, plus some of the original rolling stock, are preserved on the nearby Talyllyn Railway.
The gauge of the railway is [tpl]RailGauge|2ft3in[/tpl].

The line was opened in 1866 to carry slate from the quarries at Bryn Eglwys to Tywyn, and was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by Act of Parliament to carry passengers using steam haulage.Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 7Boyd 1988, page 44 Despite severe under-investment,Rolt 1965, page 50 the line remained open, and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers.Thomas 2002, page 32Ransom 1996, page 139
Since preservation, the railway has operated as a tourist attraction, expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages. In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001, the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary, and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place, including a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum.
The fictional Skarloey Railway, which formed part of the Railway Series of children's books by The Rev. W. Awdry, was based on the Talyllyn Railway. The preservation of the line inspired the Ealing Comedy film The Titfield Thunderbolt.

[[Electro-Theremin]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic musical instruments, Continuous pitch instruments

The Electro-Theremin, often called the Tannerin, is an electronic musical instrument developed by trombonist Paul Tanner and amateur inventor Bob Whitsell in the late 1950s to produce a sound to mimic that of the theremin.[tpl]cite web |title=Tannerin built for the 1999 Brian Wilson solo Tour - Tom Polk |url=http://www.tompolk.com/Tannerin/Tannerin.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=The Paul Tanner Electro-Theremin Page |url=http://www.electrotheremin.com/etfaq.htm |accessdate=2010-01-22[/tpl] The instrument features a tone and portamento similar to that of the theremin (or thereminvox), but with a different control mechanism. It consisted of a sine wave generator with a knob that controlled the pitch, placed inside a wooden box.  The pitch knob was attached to a slider on the outside of the box with some string.  The player would move the slider, thus turning the knob to the desired frequency, with the help of markings drawn on the box. 
The instrument was custom-built at Tanner's request. Tanner appreciated the theremin's sound, but wanted greater control of pitch and attack. The Electro-Theremin uses mechanical controls, a long slide bar for the pitch (analogous to the slide of the trombone that was Tanner's main instrument) and a knob to adjust volume. This contrasts with the hand movements in space that formed the original theremin's signal feature. The Electro-Theremin also produces a slightly less complex timbre than the original. This is not due to the nature of the instrument, but due to Dr. Theremin's intentional harmonic generation in the output of the Theremin, which Tanner did not do.
Tanner played it for the 1958 LP Music for Heavenly Bodies, the first full length album featuring the instrument,[tpl]cite web |title=MUSIC FOR HEAVENLY BODIES |work=The Paul Tanner Electro-Theremin Page / Discography |url=http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/4611/MFHBnotes.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020429091105/http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/4611/MFHBnotes.html |archivedate=2002-04-29[/tpl] and played it subsequently on several television and movie soundtracks—most notably on George Greeley's theme for the 1960s TV series My Favorite Martian—and on an LP entitled Music from Outer Space.
Most famously, Tanner played his Electro-Theremin on three tracks by The Beach Boys: "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times", "Good Vibrations", and "Wild Honey". The instrument used in "Good Vibrations" was a Heathkit tube-type audio oscillator coupled to a mechanical action that allowed the player to mark notes along a ruler-type scale where notes could be located quickly and precisely.
Tanner's prototype Electro-Theremin appears to have been the only one made. In the late 1960s, Tanner donated or sold the instrument to a hospital to use for audiology work, because he believed that newer keyboard synthesizers made it obsolete.The Paul Tanner Electro-Theremin - David S. Miller. The rock group Led Zeppelin also made use of the Theremin on more than one occasion, both in a solo for it in Seattle in 1977, and featured in the Led Zeppelin concert movie "The song remains the same".
The Electro-Theremin was brought back to life in 1999 by Tom Polk who built a custom Electro-Theremin for Brian Wilson's Solo Tour of that year.Tannerin built for the 1999 Brian Wilson solo Tour - Tom Polk In 2004 Therevox also began producing a modern Electro-Theremin in Canada.Therevox - Custom Musical Instruments

[[TYPSET and RUNOFF]]
CATEGORIES: Word processors, Troff, History of software

RUNOFF was the first computer text formatting program to see significant use. It was written in 1964 for the CTSS operating system by Jerome H. Saltzer in MAD assembler.
It actually consisted of a pair of programs, TYPSET (which was basically a document editor), and RUNOFF (the output processor).
RUNOFF had support for pagination and headers, as well as text justification (TJ-2 appears to have been the earliest text justification system, but it did not have the other capabilities).
RUNOFF is a direct predecessor of the runoff document formatting program of Multics, which in turn was the ancestor of the roff and nroff document formatting programs of Unix, and their descendants. It was also the ancestor of FORMAT for the IBM System/360, and of course indirectly for every computerized  word processing system.
Likewise, RUNOFF for CTSS was the predecessor of the various RUNOFFs for DEC's operating systems, via the RUNOFF developed by the University of California, Berkeley's Project Genie for the SDS 940 system.[tpl]cite newsgroup |title=Re: Runoffs (was: TJ-2, a very early word-processor-like program for the PDP-1) |author=John V.

[[DVD player]]

CATEGORIES: DVD, Consumer electronics, Video hardware, 1996 introductions

A DVD player is a device that plays discs produced under both the DVD-Video and DVD-Audio technical standards, two different and incompatible standards. Some DVD players will also play audio CDs. DVD players are connected to a television to watch the DVD content, which could be a movie, a recorded TV show, or other content.
The first DVD player was created by Tatung Company in Taiwan in collaboration with Pacific Digital Company from the United States in 1994. Some manufacturers originally announced that DVD players would be available as early as the middle of 1996. These predictions were too optimistic. Delivery was initially held up for "political" reasons of copy protection demanded by movie studios, but was later delayed by lack of movie titles. The first players appeared in Japan in November, 1996, followed by U.S. players in March, 1997, with distribution limited to only 7 major cities for the first 6 months. 
Players slowly trickled into other
regions around the world. Prices for the first players in 1997 were $1000 and up. By the end of 2000, players were available for under $100 at discount retailers. In 2003 players became available for under $50. Six years after the initial launch, close to one thousand models of DVD players were available from over a hundred
consumer electronics manufacturers.
Fujitsu released the first DVD-ROM-equipped computer on Nov. 6 in Japan. Toshiba released a DVD-ROM-equipped computer and a DVD-ROM drive in Japan in early 1997 (moved back from December which was moved back from November). DVD-ROM drives from Toshiba, Pioneer, Panasonic, Hitachi, and Sony began appearing in sample quantities as early as January 1997, but none were available before May. The first PC upgrade kits (a combination of DVD-ROM drive and hardware decoder card) became available from Creative Labs, Hi-Val, and Diamond Multimedia in April and May of 1997. In 2014, every major PC manufacturer has models that include DVD-ROM drives.  
The first DVD-Audio players were released in Japan by Pioneer in late 1999, but they did not play copy-protected discs. Matsushita (under the Panasonic and Technics labels) first released full-fledged players in July 2000 for $700 to $1,200. DVD-Audio players are now also made by Aiwa, Denon, JVC, Kenwood, Madrigal, Marantz, Nakamichi, Onkyo, Toshiba, Yamaha, and others. Sony released the first SACD players in May 1999 for $5,000. Pioneer's first DVD-Audio players released in late 1999 also played SACD. SACD players are now also made by Accuphase, Aiwa, Denon, Kenwood, Marantz, Philips, Sharp, and others.

Initially known for their new wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style, including funk and dance elements.
In the early 1980s, INXS first charted in their native Australia with their debut self-titled album, but later garnered moderate success elsewhere with Shabooh Shoobah and a single, "The One Thing". Though The Swing brought more success from around the world, its single "Original Sin" was even greater commercially, becoming their first number-one single. They would later achieve international success with a series of hit recordings through later in the 1980s and the 1990s, including the albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, and X; and the singles "What You Need", "Need You Tonight", "Devil Inside", "New Sensation", and "Suicide Blonde".[tpl]Cite book |title=Australian Chart Book 1970–1992  |last=Kent |first=David |authorlink= David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, Sydney |year=1993 |isbn=0-646-11917-6 [/tpl] NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988.[tpl]cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |title=INXS discography |publisher=Australian Charts Portal |accessdate=16 November 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4555/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=INXS > Charts & Awards > Billboard singles|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=6 March 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=inxs|chart=all[/tpl] |title=Artist Chart History – INXS – Albums|work=Billboard |accessdate=6 March 2008[/tpl]
In the 1990s, INXS brought a new audience following Hutchence's romance with pop singer, Kylie Minogue, and achieved greater acclaim in the UK. However, starting with Welcome to Wherever You Are, in 1992, they achieved less success in the United States. Michael Hutchence was found dead in his hotel suite in Sydney in November 1997 and INXS did not perform publicly for a year. They made appearances with several guest singers including Jimmy Barnes, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Jon Stevens; Stevens formally joined the band for a tour and recording session in 2002. In 2005, members of INXS participated in Rock Star: INXS, a reality television series, broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J.D. Fortune, and the release of "Pretty Vegas" and "Afterglow" as singles, and its album Switch.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4555/charts-awards|pure_url=yvrcres[/tpl] |title=INXS > Charts & Awards > Billboard albums|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=6 March 2008[/tpl]
In late 2010, they recorded and released Original Sin, a tribute album, featuring guest artists such as Kavyen Temperley (of Eskimo Joe) and Ben Harper.

Copyright 2009 generally for the aim of inducing local analgesia, that is, local insensitivity to pain, although other local senses may be affected as well. It allows patients to undergo surgical and dental procedures with reduced pain and distress.  In many situations, such as cesarean section, it is safer and therefore superior to general anesthesia.  It is also used for relief of non-surgical pain and to enable diagnosis of the cause of some chronic pain conditions.  Anesthetists sometimes combine both general and local anesthesia techniques.

[[InterNetNews]]

CATEGORIES: Usenet, Usenet servers

InterNetNews (INN) is a Usenet news server package, originally released by Rich Salz in 1991, and presented at the Summer 1992 USENIX conference in San Antonio, Texas. It was the first news server with integrated NNTP functionality.
While previous servers processed articles individually or in batches, innd is a single continuously running process that receives articles from the network, files them, and records what remote hosts should receive them.  Readers can access articles directly from the disk in the same manner as B News and C News, but an included program, called nnrpd, also serves newsreaders that employ NNTP.
A later improvement was the Cyclical News Filesystem (CNFS), which sequentially stores articles in large on-disk buffers.  This method, implemented by Scott Fritchie, greatly increased performance by eliminating the operating system overhead needed to deal with thousands of individual article files.
James Brister's innfeed program was also added to the package.  Like innd, innfeed operates continuously to feed articles out to other servers, while the earlier innxmit processed them in batches. This combination allows articles to be received and redistributed with virtually no latency, and has substantially changed the nature of Usenet interaction by reducing the time for messages to be posted, read across the network and answered, from hours or days, to seconds or minutes.  A similar earlier program, called nntplink, provided a comparable function, but it was produced independently.
INN is under active development [tpl]As of|2012|lc=on[/tpl].  The package is maintained by volunteers, and development is hosted by the Internet Systems Consortium.

Klezmer (Yiddish: כליזמר or קלעזמער (klezmer), pl.: כליזמרים (klezmorim), כליזמר from [tpl]lang-he|כלי זמר[/tpl] — instruments of music) is a musical tradition of the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe. Played by professional musicians called klezmorim, the genre originally consisted largely of dance tunes and instrumental display pieces for weddings and other celebrations. In the United States the genre evolved considerably as Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, who arrived between 1880 and 1924,Hankus Netsky, "American Klezmer: A Brief History" from American Klezmer: Its Roots and Offshoots Ed. Mark Slobin, p.13 met and assimilated American jazz. During the initial years after the klezmer revival of the 1970s, this was what most people knew as klezmer, although in the current century musicians have begun paying more attention to the "original" pre-jazz traditions as revivalists including Josh Horowitz, Yale Strom, and Bob Cohen have spent years doing field research in Eastern/Central Europe. Additionally, late immigrants from the Soviet Union such as German Goldenshtayn brought their surviving repertoires to the United States and Israel in the 1980s.
Compared to most other European folk music styles, little is known about the history of klezmer music, and much of what is said about it must be seen as conjecture.Mark Slobin, Fiddler on the Move. p.93. Starting in 2008, "The Other Europeans" project, funded by several EU cultural institutions,The Other Europeans: An Intercultural Dialogue spent a year doing intensive field research in Moldavia under the leadership of Alan Bern and scholar Zev Feldman. They wanted to explore klezmer and lautari roots, and fuse the music of the two "other European" groups. The resulting band now performs internationally.  As with this ensemble, groups like Di Naye Kapelye and Yale Strom & Hot Pstromi have incorporated Rom musicians and elements since their inceptions.

[[Condensation reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Condensation reactions, Organic reactions, Chemical reactions

A condensation reaction, also commonly referred to as dehydration synthesis, is a chemical reaction in which two molecules or moieties (functional groups) combine to form a larger molecule, together with the loss of a small molecule.[tpl]GoldBookRef|title=Condensation Reaction|file=C01238|year=1994[/tpl] Possible small molecules lost are water, hydrogen chloride, methanol, or acetic acid but most commonly in a biological reaction it is water. The word "condensation" suggests a process in which two or more things are brought "together" (Latin "con") to form something "dense", like in condensation from gaseous to liquid state of matter; this does not imply, however, that condensation reaction products have greater density than reactants.
When two separate molecules react, the condensation is termed intermolecular. A simple example is the condensation of two amino acids to form the peptide bond characteristic of proteins. This reaction example is the opposite of hydrolysis, which splits a chemical entity into two parts through the action of the polar water molecule, which itself splits into hydroxide and hydrogen ions. Hence energy is released. 
If the union is between atoms or groups of the same molecule, the reaction is termed intramolecular condensation, and in many cases leads to ring formation. An example is the Dieckmann condensation, in which the two ester groups of a single diester molecule react with each other to lose a small alcohol molecule and form a β-ketoester product.

[[Scientific citation]]

CATEGORIES: Library science, Academic publishing

Scientific citation is providing detailed reference in a scientific publication, typically a paper or book, to previous published (or occasionally private) communications which have a bearing on the subject of the new publication. The purpose of citations in original work is to allow readers of the paper to refer to cited work to assist them in judging the new work, source background information vital for future development, and acknowledge the contributions of earlier workers. Citations in, say, a review paper bring together many sources, often recent, in one place.
To a considerable extent the quality of work, in the absence of other criteria, is judged on the number of citations received, adjusting for the volume of work in the relevant topic. While this is not necessarily a reliable measure, counting citations is trivially easy; judging the merit of complex work can be very difficult.
Previous work may be cited regarding experimental procedures, apparatus, goals, previous theoretical results upon which the new work builds, theses, and so on. Typically such citations establish the general framework of influences and the mindset of research, and especially as "part of what science" it is, and to help determine who conducts the peer review.
Disciplined citation of prior works in mathematics and science is known at least as far back as Euclid. Late in the first millennium, Islamic scholars developed their practice of isnad, or "backing", which established the validity of sayings of Muhammad in the hadith. The Asharite school of early Muslim philosophy extended this into fiqh or jurisprudence, while the Mutazilite school used the traditional methods and applied them to science.
In some form, then, achieving authority for new work by citing accepted authorities is a near-universal idea among the peoples of the Mediterranean, whose educated people were exposed to one or other of these practices well before the European Renaissance and the emergence of the formal scientific method.

[[Fado]]
CATEGORIES: Fado, Portuguese styles of music, Urban street dance and music, Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity

Fado ([tpl]IPA-pt|ˈfaðu[/tpl], "destiny, fate") is a music genre which can be traced to the 1820s in Portugal, but probably with much earlier origins. Fado historian and scholar Rui Vieira Nery states that "the only reliable information on the history of Fado was orally transmitted and goes back to the 1820s and 1830s at best. But even that information was frequently modified within the generational transmission process that made it reach us today."http://www.fnac.pt/Para-uma-Historia-do-Fado-Rui-Vieira-Nery/a306961
In popular belief, fado is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a characteristic sentiment of resignation, fatefulness and melancholia (loosely captured by the word saudade, or "longing"). However, although the origins are difficult to trace, today fado is regarded, by many, as simply a form of song which can be about anything, but must follow a certain structure. The music is usually linked to the Portuguese word saudade which symbolizes the feeling of loss (a permanent, irreparable loss and its consequent lifelong damage). Famous singers of fado include Amália Rodrigues, Dulce Pontes, Carlos do Carmo, Mariza, Mafalda Arnauth, António Zambujo, Ana Moura, Camané, Helder Moutinho, Aldina Duarte, Joanna Amandoeira, Ricardo Robeiro, Argentina Santos, Carminho, sometimes Misia, and sometimes Cristina Branco.
On 27 November 2011, Fado was inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.[tpl]cite web| title= Fado, urban popular song of Portugal |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00563 |publisher=UNESCO Culture Sector |accessdate=2011-11-27[/tpl]

[[Royal house]]

CATEGORIES: Royal families

A royal house or royal dynasty consists of at least two, but usually more, monarchs who are related to one another, as well as their non-reigning descendants and spouses. Monarchs of the same realm who are not related to one another are usually deemed to belong to different houses, and each house is designated by a name which distinguishes it from other houses. Strictly, a royal house is a dynasty whose members reign while bearing the title of king or queen, although it has become common to refer to any family which legally exercises sovereignty by hereditary right as a royal family, and its members as royalty or (colloquially) royals. Historically, ruling families often consist of a senior and several junior branches, which are akin, but may have diverged in descent from a common ancestor many generations ago. The name used to refer to a royal house may or may not also be used by its members as a surname. Rather, members of dynasties are usually referred to by their titles, which may or may not also be hereditary.

BattleBots was an American company that hosted robot competitions.  BattleBots was also the name of the television show created from the competition footage hosted by comedian Bill Dwyer.  BattleBots Inc. was headquartered in Vallejo, California and held most of its competitions in the San Francisco area.
In a BattleBots event the competitors are remote-controlled armed and armored machines designed to fight in an arena combat elimination tournament. If both combat robots are still operational at the end of the match, the winner is determined by a point system based on damage, aggression, and strategy.
The television show BattleBots aired on the American cable network Comedy Central for five seasons, covering five BattleBots tournaments.  The first season aired starting in August 2000, and the fifth season aired starting in August 2002. Hosts of BattleBots were Bil Dwyer and Sean Salisbury (with Tim Green replacing Salisbury after the second season) and correspondents included former Baywatch actresses Donna D'Errico, Carmen Electra, and Traci Bingham, former Playboy Playmate Heidi Mark, and identical twins Randy and Jason Sklar. Bill Nye was the show's "technical expert". The show's match announcer was longtime boxing ring announcer Mark Beiro.
After five 'seasons', Comedy Central terminated their contract with BattleBots Inc. in late 2002.  As of May 2011, there are no future plans for Battlebots.

Tubby's innovative studio work, which saw him elevate the role of the mixing engineer to a creative fame previously only reserved for composers and musicians, would prove to be influential across many genres of popular music.  He is often cited as the inventor of the concept of the remix, and so may be seen as a direct antecedent of much dance and electronic music production. Singer Mikey Dread stated "King Tubby truly understood sound in a scientific sense.  He knew how the circuits worked and what the electrons did.  That's why he could do what he did".

[[San Estevan, Belize]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Orange Walk District

San Estevan was the first town in the Orange Walk District of the nation of Belize but later became a village due to migration of villagers to other parts of the country during a great epedimic.  According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 3,847 people.  The village is approximately 6 miles northeast from Orange Walk Town.
Most villagers rely on sugar cane as a source of income to their families.  As much as 90% of the villagers own a parcel of sugar cane and are very active cane farmers.  The village is the number one producer of sugar cane in the entire two divisions which are Corozal and Orange Walk.  San Estevan is surrounded by thousands of acres of lush cane plantations.  The New River passes through the left side of the village and the river is still used for transportation of sugar through barges up to Belize City where it is sent abroad.
Sugarcane is cultivated all year long and harvested from November to June.  Cane is delivered to BSI (Belize Sugar Industries) which is located in Orange Walk on the Tower Hill Area.

War (originally called Eric Burdon and War) is an American funk band from California, known for the hit songs "Low Rider", "Spill the Wine", "Summer", "Why Can't We Be Friends?", "The Cisco Kid", and "The World Is a Ghetto". Formed in 1969, War was a musical crossover band which fused elements of rock, funk, jazz, Latin, rhythm and blues, and reggae.Allmusic biography page The band also transcended racial and cultural barriers with a multi-ethnic line-up. War was also subject to many line-up changes over the course of its formation, leaving member Leroy "Lonnie" Jordan as the only original member in the current line-up.
Although War's lyrics are often socio-political in nature, their music usually had a laid-back, California funk vibe. A particular feature of War's sound is the use of harmonica and saxophone playing melody lines in unison, sounding like a single instrument, for example in the melody of "Low Rider". The music has been sampled and recorded by many singers and groups, ranging from R&B/pop singers such as Janet Jackson to nu metal band Korn and hip hop groups like TLC and A$AP Mob.

Bayard Rustin ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|ɚ|d[/tpl]; March 17, 1912 – August 24, 1987) was an American leader in social movements for civil rights, socialism, pacifism and non-violence, and gay rights.  He was born and raised in Pennsylvania where his family was involved in civil rights work. In 1936, he moved to Harlem, New York City and earned a living as a nightclub and stage singer, and continued activism for civil rights.
In the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), Rustin practiced nonviolence. He was a leading activist of the early  1947–1955 civil-rights movement, helping to initiate a 1947 Freedom Ride to challenge with civil disobedience racial segregation on interstate busing. He recognized Martin Luther King, Jr.'s leadership, and helped to organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to strengthen King's leadership; Rustin promoted the philosophy of nonviolence and the practices of nonviolent resistance, which he had observed while working with Gandhi's movement in India. Rustin became a leading strategist of the civil rights movement from 1955 to 1968. He was the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which was headed by A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American labor-union president and socialist.[ref]
 Available via books.google.com with Advanced Search issn:0012-9011 date Nov 1963[/ref]De Leon, David (1994). Leaders from the 1960s: a biographical sourcebook of American activism, Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 138. ISBN 0-313-27414-2. Rustin also influenced young activists, such as Tom Kahn and Stokely Carmichael, in organizations like the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).
After the passage of the civil-rights legislation of 1964–65, Rustin focused attention on the economic problems of working-class and unemployed African Americans, suggesting that the civil-rights movement had left its period of "protest" and had entered an era of "politics", in which the Black community had to ally with the labor movement. Rustin became the head of the AFL–CIO's A. Philip Randolph Institute, which promoted the integration of formerly all-white unions and promoted the unionization of African Americans. Rustin became an honorary chairperson of the Socialist Party of America in 1972, before it changed its name to Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA); Rustin acted as national chairman of SDUSA during the 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin served on many humanitarian missions, such as aiding refugees from Communist Vietnam and Cambodia. He was on a humanitarian mission in Haiti when he died in 1987.
Rustin was a gay man who had been arrested for a homosexual act in 1953. Homosexuality was criminalized in parts of the United States until 2003. Rustin's sexuality, or at least his embarrassingly public criminal charge, was criticized by some fellow pacifists and civil-rights leaders. Rustin was attacked as a "pervert" or "immoral influence" by political opponents from segregationists to Black power militants, and from the 1950s through the 1970s. In addition, his pre-1941 Communist Party affiliation when he was a young man was controversial. To avoid such attacks, Rustin served only rarely as a public spokesperson. He usually acted as an influential adviser to civil-rights leaders. In the 1970s, he became a public advocate on behalf of gay and lesbian causes.
On November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[tpl]cite web|author=Justin Snow |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2013/11/obama-posthumously-honors-rustin-ride-with-medal-o.html |title=Obama honors Bayard Rustin and Sally Ride with Medal of Freedom |publisher=metroweekly.com |accessdate=November 21, 2013[/tpl]

Mountbatten-Windsor is the personal surname of some of the descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh under an Order in Council issued in 1960,[tpl]cite web |title=The Royal Family name |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheRoyalFamilyname/Overview.aspx |publisher=The British Monarchy |accessdate=2011-05-05[/tpl] which has not been applied consistently.  While the Order specifically applies the surname "Mountbatten-Windsor" to those descendants of the Queen not holding Royal styles and titles, "Mountbatten-Windsor" has been formally used by some descendents of Queen Elizabeth II who do hold Royal styles. For example, both Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Anne, the Princess Royal, children of the Queen, used the surname "Mountbatten-Windsor" in official marriage registry entries.
Mountbatten-Windsor differs from the official name of the British Royal Family or Royal House, which remains Windsor. The adoption of the Mountbatten-Windsor surname applies only to members of the Royal Family who are descended from the Queen, and not, for example, to her cousins, or descendants of her sister, Princess Margaret.
Mountbatten-Windsor may be considered a cadet branch of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, which in turn is a branch of the House of Oldenburg.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w1MHY8-dMX0C&pg=PT363&dq=cadet+branch+Mountbatten-Windsors&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Nbr-Uc2BEeiKiAKZwYGoAw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=cadet%20branch%20Mountbatten-Windsors&f=false | title=Popular Errors Explained | publisher=Random House | author=McCartney, Stewart | year=2012 | location=New York | isbn=1409021890[/tpl]

[[Private copying levy]]

CATEGORIES: Taxation, Taxation in the United States, Taxation in Canada, Copyright law, Taxation in Australia

A private copying levy (also known as blank media tax or levy) is a government-mandated scheme in which a special tax or levy (additional to any general sales tax) is charged on purchases of recordable media.  Such taxes are in place in various countries and the income is typically allocated to the developers of "content". (A distinction is sometimes made between "tax" and "levy" based on the recipient of the accumulated funds; taxes are received by a government, while levies are received by a private body, such as a copyright collective.)
Levy system may operate in principle as a system of collectivisation, partially replacing a property approach of sale of individual units.

The Storting ([tpl]lang-no|Stortinget[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-no|ˈstuː.ʈiŋə|[/tpl], literally "the great council") is the supreme legislature of Norway, established in 1814 by the Constitution of Norway. It is located in Oslo. The unicameral parliament has 169 members, and is elected every four years based on party-list proportional representation in nineteen plural member constituencies. 
The assembly is led by a president and five vice presidents—the presidium. The members are allocated to twelve standing committees, as well as four procedural committees. Three ombudsmen are directly subordinate to parliament: the Parliamentary Intelligence Oversight Committee and the Office of the Auditor General .
Parliamentarianism was established in 1884. In 2009, qualified unicameralism was replaced by unicameralism, through the dissolution of the two chambers: the Lagting and the Odelsting. 
Following the 2013 election, eight parties are represented in parliament: the Labour Party (55 representatives), Conservative Party (48), the Progress Party (29), the Centre Party (10), the Christian Democratic Party (10), the Liberal Party (9), the Socialist Left Party (7), and the Green Party (1). Since 2013 Olemic Thommessen has been president.

Dire Straits were a British rock band, formed in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), his younger brother David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion). Dire Straits' sound drew from a variety of musical influences, including jazz, folk, blues, and came closest to beat music within the context of rock and roll. Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band's early years, the band's stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more "rootsy" influence that emerged from pub rock. Many of Dire Straits' compositions were melancholic.Dire Straits: Biography Allmusic Retrieved 29 April 2011 Dire Straits' biggest selling album, Brothers in Arms, has sold over 30 million copies, and was the first album to sell a million copies on compact disc.Mark Knopfler hurt in crash BBC.

Sementivae, also known as Feriae Sementivae or Sementina dies (in the country called Paganalia), was a Roman festival of sowing.
It was a type of feriae conceptivae conceptae. These free days were held every year, but not on certain or fixed days, the time being every year appointed by the magistrates or priests (quotannis a magistratibus vel sacerdotibus concipiuntur,Macrobius l. c.; Varro, On the Latin Language in 25 Books, vi. 25, etc.; Festus s. v.).
It was held in honor of Ceres (the goddess of agriculture) and Tellus (Mother Earth). The initial half of the event was a festival in honor of Tellus which ran from January 24 through January 26. The festival honoring Ceres occurred one week later, starting February 2. The Sementina dies were kept in seed-time at Rome for the purpose of praying for a good crop; it lasted only for one day, which was fixed by the pontiffs.Varro On the Latin Language in 25 Books, vi. 26, de Re Rustica, i. 2, init.; Ovid, On the Roman Calendar, i. 658, etc.) At the same time the Paganalia were observed in the country.Merkel, Ovid, On the Roman Calendar, p. clv.

Nuclear weapon designs are physical, chemical, and engineering arrangements that cause the physics packageThe physics package is the nuclear explosive module inside the bomb casing, missile warhead, or artillery shell, etc., which delivers the weapon to its target. While photographs of weapon casings are common, photographs of the physics package are quite rare, even for the oldest and crudest nuclear weapons. For a photograph of a modern physics package see W80. of a nuclear weapon to detonate. There are four basic design types. In all except the last, the explosive energy of deployed devices is derived primarily from nuclear fission, not fusion.

Because explosions are spherical in shape and targets are spread out on the relatively flat surface of the earth, numerous smaller weapons cause more destruction. From page 35: ". . .five five-megaton weapons would demolish a greater area than a single 50-megatonner."[/ref] (The United States briefly deployed a three-stage 25-megaton bomb, the B41, starting in 1961. Also in 1961, the Soviet Union tested, but did not deploy, a three-stage 50–100 megaton device, Tsar Bomba.)
Pure fission weapons historically have been the first type to be built by a nation state. Large industrial states with well-developed nuclear arsenals have two-stage thermonuclear weapons, which are the most compact, scalable, and cost effective option once the necessary industrial infrastructure is built.
Most known innovations in nuclear weapon design originated in the United States, although some were later developed independently by other states;The United States and the Soviet Union were the only nations to build large nuclear arsenals with every possible type of nuclear weapon. The U.S. had a four-year head start and was the first to produce fissile material and fission weapons, all in 1945. The only Soviet claim for a design first was the Joe 4 detonation on August 12, 1953, said to be the first deliverable hydrogen bomb. However, as Herbert York first revealed in The Advisors: Oppenheimer, Teller and the Superbomb (W.H. Freeman, 1976), it was not a true hydrogen bomb (it was a boosted fission weapon of the Sloika/Alarm Clock type, not a two-stage thermonuclear). Soviet dates for the essential elements of warhead miniaturization – boosted, hollow-pit, two-point, air lens primaries – are not available in the open literature, but the larger size of Soviet ballistic missiles is often explained as evidence of an initial Soviet difficulty in miniaturizing warheads. the following descriptions feature U.S. designs.
In early news accounts, pure fission weapons were called atomic bombs or A-bombs, a misnomer since the energy comes only from the nucleus of the atom. Weapons involving fusion were called hydrogen bombs or H-bombs, also a misnomer since their energy comes mostly from fission. Insiders favored the terms nuclear and thermonuclear, respectively.
The term thermonuclear refers to the high temperatures required to initiate fusion. It ignores the equally important factor of pressure, which was considered secret at the time the term became current. Many nuclear weapon terms are similarly inaccurate because of their origin in a classified environment.

[[Limes]]
CATEGORIES: Roman frontiers, Roman Dacia, World Heritage Sites in Germany

A limes [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|m|iː|z[/tpl]Oxford English Dictionary (1989) was a border defence or delimiting system of Ancient Rome. It marked the boundaries of the Roman Empire.
The Latin noun limes had a number of different meanings: a path or balk delimiting fields, a boundary line or marker, any road or path, any channel, such as a stream channel, or any distinction or difference. In Latin, the plural form of limes is limites.
The word limes was utilized by Latin writers to denote a marked or fortified frontier. This sense has been adapted and extended by modern historians concerned with the frontiers of the Roman Empire: e.g. Hadrian's Wall in the north of England is sometimes styled the Limes Britannicus, the frontier of the Roman province of Arabia facing the desert is called the Limes Arabicus, and so forth.
This was the traditional definition and usage of the term. It is now more common to accept that limes was not a term used by the Romans for the imperial frontier, fortified or not. This is a modern, anachronistic interpretation. The term became common after the 3rd century AD, when it denoted a military district under the command of a dux limitis.

Family Ties is an American sitcom that aired on NBC from September 22, 1982 until May 14, 1989. The series, created by Gary David Goldberg, reflected the move in the United States from the cultural liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s to the conservatism of the 1980s.The Museum of Broadcast Communications: Family Ties This was particularly expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex P. Keaton (Michael J. Fox) and his ex-hippie parents, Steven and Elyse Keaton (Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter-Birney).
The show won multiple awards, including three consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

[[Chroma subsampling]]

CATEGORIES: Film and video technology, Image compression

Chroma subsampling is the practice of encoding images by implementing less resolution for chroma information than for luma information, taking advantage of the human visual system's lower acuity for color differences than for luminance.[ref]

</ref>
It is used in many video encoding schemes — both analog and digital — and also in JPEG encoding.

[[Strong inflection]]

CATEGORIES: Verb types, Germanic languages

A strong inflection is a system of verb conjugation or noun/adjective declension which can be contrasted with an alternative system in the same language, which is then known as a weak inflection.  The term strong was coined with reference to the Germanic verb, but has since been used of other phenomena in these and other languages, which may or may not be analogous.  Note that there is nothing objectively "strong" about a strong form; the term is only meaningful in opposition to "weak" as a means of distinguishing paradigms within  a single language.  Nor is there any distinguishing feature common to all strong forms, except that they are always counterpoints to "weak" ones.
The Germanic strong verb, occurring in Germanic languages including German and English, is characterised by a vowel shift called ablaut.  Examples in English include give/gave, come/came, fall/fell. There is nothing comparable in the German strong adjective inflections.  For a full discussion of this distinction see weak inflection.

[[Demogroup]]

CATEGORIES: Demogroups, Demoscene, Social groups

Demogroups are teams of demosceners, who make computer based audio-visual works of art known as demos. Demogroups form a subculture collectively known as the demoscene.
Groups frequently consist of students, young computer enthusiasts who spend days coding their demos. They often have a pseudonym (called a "handle" or "nick"), usually chained together with the name of their group (in formats like "Scener of Demo Group" or "Scener/DG"). Demosceners rarely use their real names in demoscene contexts. This is a tradition originating from the demoscene's roots, where small demos were distributed along with cracked software, usually computer games.
Many demogroups have been founded by friends who already knew each other in real life. However, there have also been groups that have taken their form online via Bulletin Board Systems or the Internet. Perhaps the most important way for demogroups to communicate is IRC. Demosceners from different groups also meet each other in real life at demoparties and smaller meetings.
Demogroups often bear resemblances to corporate companies: demogroups incorporate wordmarks, logos, catchphrases and slogans for their promotion. It is very important for a demogroup to have good PR, and major groups have dedicated group organisers who are responsible for "managing the group's human resources", i.e. nag the members who slack off. Some groups also treat the recruitment of new members with great care, often applying "trial periods" in which the new member has to prove himself to be worthy. However these practices are often just intentional exaggeration (often tongue-in-cheek), to maintain an "elite" image for the group.
A group is perhaps the most important social unit in the demoscene, and belonging to a group is often considered more or less synonymous to being a demoscener. Even individual productions, with no group activity involved, are typically associated with the group of the creative individual. There have even been several "one-man groups" when an individual demomaker with no group has wanted to release a demo or intro.

CATEGORIES: Computer art, Demoscene, Home computer software

The demoscene is a computer art subculture that specializes in producing demos, which are audio-visual presentations that run in real-time on a computer. The main goal of a demo is to show off programming, artistic, and musical skills.
The demoscene first appeared during the 8-bit era on computers such as the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari 800 and Amstrad CPC, and came to prominence during the rise of the 16/32-bit home computers (mainly the Amiga and Atari ST). In the early years, demos had a strong connection with software cracking.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=vague statement|date=March 2012[/tpl] When a cracked program was started, the cracker or his team would take credit with a graphical introduction called a "crack intro" (shortened cracktro).

The Napier Nomad was a British diesel aircraft engine designed and built by Napier & Son in 1949. They combined a piston engine with a turbine to recover energy from the exhaust and thereby improve fuel economy. Two versions were tested, the complex Nomad I which used two propellers, each driven by the mechanically independent stages, and the Nomad II, using the turbo-compound principle, coupled the two parts to drive a single propeller. The Nomad II had the lowest specific fuel consumption figures seen up to that time. Despite this the Nomad project was cancelled in 1955 having spent £5.1 million on development, as most interest had passed to turboprop designs.

[[C News]]

CATEGORIES: Usenet, Usenet servers

C News is a news server package, written by Geoff Collyer, assisted by Henry Spencer, at the University of Toronto as a replacement for B News. It was presented at the Winter 1987 USENIX conference in Washington, D.C.
Functionally, the operation of C News is very much like that of B News.  One major difference was that C News was written with portability in mind.  It ran on many variants of Unix and even MS-DOS.  The relaynews program that handled article filing and feeding was carefully optimized and designed to process articles in batches, while B News processed one article per program invocation.  The authors claimed that relaynews could process articles 19 times as quickly as B News.
In 1992, Collyer gave C News a new index facility called NOV (or News Overview).  This allowed newsreaders to rapidly retrieve header and threading information with relatively little load on the server.  Virtually all [tpl]As of|2004|alt=current[/tpl] news servers continue to use this method in the form of the NNTP XOVER command.  Development of C News stopped about 1995, and the package was largely superseded by INN.

He also wrote The Ten Commandments for C Programmers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c/msg/08c8c117dd2d13b6 |title=Ten Commandments For C Programmers |first=Henry |last=Spencer |publisher=comp.lang.c |date=October 14, 1987[/tpl] He is coauthor, with David Lawrence, of the book Managing Usenet.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/musenet/ |title=Managing Usenet |publisher=O'Reilly Media |first1=David |last1=Lawrence |first2=Henry |last2=Spencer |date=January 1998 |isbn=1-56592-198-4[/tpl] While working at the University of Toronto he ran the first active Usenet site outside the U.S., starting in 1981. His records from that period were eventually acquired by Google to provide an archive of Usenet in the 1980s.
The first international Usenet site was run in Ottawa, in 1981; however, it is generally not remembered, as it served merely as a read-only medium. Later in 1981, Spencer acquired a Usenet feed from Duke University, and brought "utzoo" online; the earliest public archives of Usenet date from May 1981 as a result.
The small size of Usenet in its youthful days, and Spencer's early involvement, made him a well-recognised participant;  this is commemorated in Vernor Vinge's 1992 novel A Fire Upon the Deep. The novel featured an interstellar communications medium remarkably similar to Usenet, down to the author including spurious message headers; one of the characters who appeared solely through postings to this was modeled on Spencer (and, slightly obliquely, named for him).
He is also credited with the claim that "Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly."[tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.ca/group/sci.space.shuttle/msg/442b343281a7de34 |title=space news from Sept 28 AW&ST |publisher=sci.space.shuttle |first=Henry |last=Spencer |date=November 14, 1987[/tpl]

[[Solar mass]]

CATEGORIES: Units of mass, Units of measurement in astronomy, Sun

The solar mass (M''☉'') is a standard unit of mass in astronomy that is used to indicate the masses of other stars, as well as clusters, nebulae and galaxies. It is equal to the mass of the Sun, about two nonillion kilograms:
The above mass is about 332,946 times the mass of the Earth or 1,048 times the mass of Jupiter.
Because the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, its solar mass can be computed from the equation for the orbital period of a small body orbiting a central mass. Based upon the length of the year, the distance from the Earth to the Sun (an astronomical unit or AU), and the gravitational constant (G), the mass of the Sun is given by:
The value of the gravitational constant was derived from measurements that were made by Henry Cavendish in 1798 with a torsion balance. The value he obtained differs by only 1% from the modern value.[ref]
</ref> The [[Parallax#Diurnal parallax|diurnal parallax]] of the Sun was accurately measured during the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769,<ref>
</ref> yielding a value of 9&Prime; (compared to the present 1976 value of 8.794148&Prime;). If we know the value of the diurnal parallax, we can determine the distance to the Sun from the geometry of the Earth.<ref>
</ref>
The first person to estimate the mass of the Sun was Isaac Newton. In his work Principia, he estimated that the ratio of the mass of the Earth to the Sun was about 1/28,700. Later he determined that his value was based upon a faulty value for the solar parallax, which he had used to estimate the distance to the Sun (1 AU). He corrected his estimated ratio to 1/169,282 in the third edition of the Principia. The current value for the solar parallax is smaller still, yielding an estimated mass ratio of 1/332,946.[ref]
</ref>
As a unit of measurement, the solar mass came into use before the AU and the gravitational constant were precisely measured. This is because the relative mass of another planet in the Solar System or the combined mass of two binary stars can be calculated in units of Solar mass directly from the orbital radius and orbital period of the planet or stars using Kepler's third law, provided that orbital radius is measured in astronomical units and orbital period is measured in years.
The mass of the Sun has decreased since the time it formed. This has occurred through two processes in nearly equal amounts. First, in the Sun's core hydrogen is converted into helium by nuclear fusion, in particular the pp chain, and this reaction converts some mass into energy in the form of gamma ray photons. Most of this energy eventually radiates away from the Sun. Second, high energy protons and electrons in the atmosphere of the Sun are ejected directly into outer space as a solar wind. 
The original mass of the Sun at the time it reached the main sequence remains uncertain. The early Sun had much higher mass loss rates than at present, so it may have lost anywhere from 1–7% of its natal mass over the course of its main sequence lifetime. The Sun gains a very small mass through the impact of asteroids and comets; however the Sun already holds 99.86% of the Solar System's total mass, so these impacts cannot offset the mass lost by radiation and ejection.

[[Use–mention distinction]]
CATEGORIES: Analytic philosophy, Philosophy of language, Metalogic, Conceptual distinctions

The use–mention distinction is a foundational concept of analytic philosophy,Wheeler (2005) p. 568 according to which it is necessary to make a distinction between using a word (or phrase) and mentioning it,Devitt and Sterelny (1999) pp. 40-1W.V. Quine (1940) p. 24 and many philosophical works have been "vitiated by a failure to distinguish use and mention". The distinction is disputed by non-analytic philosophers.
The distinction between use and mention can be illustrated for the word cheese:
The first sentence is a statement about the substance called cheese; it uses the word "cheese" to refer to that substance. The second is a statement about the word cheese as a signifier; it mentions the word without using it to refer to anything other than itself.

[[Network News Transfer Protocol]]
CATEGORIES: Application layer protocols, Internet Standards, Usenet

The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is an  application protocol used for transporting Usenet news articles (netnews) between news servers and for reading and posting articles by end user client applications. Brian Kantor of the University of California, San Diego and Phil Lapsley of the University of California, Berkeley authored RFC 977, the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March 1986.  Other contributors included Stan O. Barber from the Baylor College of Medicine and Erik Fair of Apple Computer.
Usenet was originally designed based on the UUCP network, with most article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point telephone links between news servers, which were powerful time-sharing systems.  Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles directly from the local disk.
As local area networks and Internet participation proliferated, it became desirable to allow newsreaders to be run on personal computers connected to local networks. Because distributed file systems were not yet widely available, a new protocol was developed based on the client-server model. It resembled the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), but was tailored for exchanging newsgroup articles.
A newsreader, also known as a news client, is a software application that reads articles on Usenet, either directly from the news server's disks or via the NNTP.
The well-known TCP port 119 is reserved for NNTP. Well-known TCP port 433 (NNSP) may be used when doing a bulk transfer of articles from one server to another.  When clients connect to a news server with Transport Layer Security (TLS), TCP port 563 is often used. This is sometimes referred to as NNTPS.  Alternatively, a plain-text connection over port 119 may be changed to use TLS via the STARTTLS command.
In October 2006, the IETF released RFC 3977 which updates the NNTP protocol and codifies many of the additions made over the years since RFC 977.  At the same time, the IETF also released RFC 4642 which specifies the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) via STARTTLS over NNTP.

Scuderia Ferrari ([tpl]IPA-it|skudeˈria ferˈrari|pron[/tpl]) is the racing team division of the Ferrari automobile marque. The team mainly races in Formula One but has also competed in many other series in numerous levels of motorsport since its formation in 1929, including sportscar racing.
It is the oldest surviving team in Grand Prix racing, having competed since 1932, and statistically the most glorious and successful Formula One team in history with a record of 15 drivers' championships and 16 constructors' championships.
The team was founded by Enzo Ferrari, initially to race cars produced by Alfa Romeo, though by 1947 Ferrari had begun building its own cars.

This article focuses on  poetry written in English from the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (and Ireland before 1922). However, though the whole of Ireland was politically part of the United Kingdom between January 1801 and December 1922, it is controversial to describe Irish literature as British. For some this includes works by authors from Northern Ireland. The article does not include poetry from other countries where the English language is spoken.
The earliest surviving English poetry, written in Anglo-Saxon, the direct predecessor of modern English, may have been composed as early as the 7th century.

The DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) is an organization primarily responsible for the copy protection of DVDs. The Content Scramble System (CSS) was devised for this purpose to make copyright infringement difficult, but also presents obstacles to some legitimate uses of the media. The association is also responsible for the controversial Regional Playback Control (RPC), the region encoding scheme which gives movie studios geographic control over DVD distribution.
As of 2001, members included film distributors such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros.[tpl]cite web | title=Federal Register: August 3, 2001 (Volume 66, Number 150) | url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&docid=01-19392-filed | accessdate=December 19, 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=2001 copyright reform: CMPDA reply | url=http://www.flora.ca/copyright-2001-cmpda-reply.shtml | accessdate=December 19, 2007 [/tpl]
They filed the much publicized case versus Jon Johansen whom they alleged wrote DeCSS.  The case was dropped in January 2004.  CSS decrypting software (such as DVD Decrypter, AnyDVD, and DVD Shrink) allows a region-specific DVD to be copied as an all-region DVD. It also removes Macrovision, Content Scrambling System (CSS), region codes, and user operation prohibitions.  Additionally, they also filed a suit DVD CCA v. Bunner against people who distributed DeCSS, seeking injunction to stop further distribution based on trade secret claims. The injunction was eventually denied because CSS was no longer a secret by the time litigation occurred.

The original DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) is an automobile manufacturer formed by automobile industry executive John DeLorean in 1975. It is remembered for the one model it produced — the distinctive stainless steel DeLorean DMC-12 sports car featuring gull-wing doors—and for its brief and turbulent history, ending in receivership and bankruptcy in 1982. Near the end, in a desperate attempt to raise the funds his company needed to survive, John DeLorean was filmed appearing to accept money to take part in drug trafficking, but was subsequently acquitted of charges brought against him on the basis of entrapment.
The DeLorean DMC-12 featured memorably in the Back to the Future movie trilogy, as the model of car made into a time machine by eccentric scientist Doc Brown, although the company had ceased to exist before the first movie was made.
In 1995, Liverpool-born mechanic Stephen Wynne[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17428818 | work=BBC News | title=Back to the future as DeLorean goes electric | date=April 1, 2012[/tpl] started a separate company using the "DeLorean Motor Company" name and shortly thereafter acquired the remaining parts inventoryhttp://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/0811_de_lorean_motor_company_ceo_stephen_wynne/index.html and the stylized "DMC" logo trademark of DeLorean Motor Company.DeLorean Motor Company Home.

Geoffrey Ian "Geoff" Gallop AC (born 27 September 1951) is a former Australian politician who served as the 27th Premier of Western Australia.
Born in Geraldton, Western Australia, Gallop studied at the University of Western Australia, and later progressed to St John's College at the University of Oxford after winning a Rhodes Scholarship. Having joined the Australian Labor Party in 1971, he served as a councillor for the City of Fremantle between 1983 and 1986, and was elected to the seat of Victoria Park in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly at the 1986 state election. Having held several portfolios in the preceding Lawrence Ministry (including Minister for Education), Gallop replaced Jim McGinty as Leader of the Opposition in 1996 following McGinty's resignation.
At the 1996 election, Labor was heavily defeated by the incumbent Liberal Party led by Richard Court, but he remained as the party's leader, and at the 2001 election Labor was elected to government, with Gallop becoming premier. Having successfully contested the 2005 election, Gallop resigned as Premier, Labor leader and from parliament in early 2006 to aid his recovery from depression, and was replaced by Alan Carpenter.
After his resignation, he accepted a position as Professor and Director of the Graduate School of Government at the University of Sydney. Gallop is also the current chairman of the Australian Republican Movement.

He was best known for developing the Pontiac GTO muscle car, the Pontiac Firebird, Pontiac Grand Prix, Chevrolet Vega, and the DeLorean DMC-12 sports car, which was later featured in the 1985 film Back to the Future, and for his high profile 1982 arrest on charges of drug trafficking. The alleged drug trafficking was supposedly an attempt to raise funds for his struggling company, which declared bankruptcy that same year. He successfully defended himself against the drug trafficking charges, showing that his alleged involvement was a result of entrapment by federal agents.

38 Special (also written .38 Special or Thirty-Eight Special) is an American rock band that was formed by neighborhood friends Don Barnes and Donnie Van Zant in 1974 in Jacksonville, Florida.[ref]
</ref> The band's first two albums had a strong [[southern rock]] influence. By the early 1980s, 38 Special shifted to a more accessible [[arena rock]] style without abandoning its southern rock roots. This shift helped to usher in a string of successful albums and singles.
Their breakthrough hit was "Hold On Loosely" (1981). "Caught Up in You" (1982) and "If I'd Been the One" (1983) both hit No. 1 on Billboard magazine's Album Rock Tracks chart. "Back Where You Belong" (1984) continued the annual sequence of radio favorites. In 1985 they had another hit with "Teacher Teacher", written by Jim Vallance and Bryan Adams.  The song climbed to #4 on the Billboard Top Tracks Chart, spending 10 weeks on the chart from the soundtrack of the 1984 film Teachers. "Second Chance" was a No. 1 hit on Billboard's adult contemporary chart in 1989, followed by The Sound of Your Voice in 1991 (Billboard Hot 100 #33) from 'Bone Against Steel' and 'Fade to Blue' from the album 'Resolution' made it to #33 on the Mainstream Rock chart in 1997.
In 2007, 38 Special was the opening act on Lynyrd Skynyrd and Hank Williams Jr.'s Rowdy Frynds Tour, and on September 27, 2008, they filmed a CMT Crossroads special with country singer Trace Adkins, performing both artists' hits from over the years. In 2009, 38 Special opened for REO Speedwagon and Styx as part of the "Can't Stop Rockin' Tour."
As of 2014, the lineup consists of Don Barnes, guitarist Danny Chauncey, keyboardist Bobby Capps, drummer Gary Moffatt, and bassist Barry Dunaway.  According to 38 Special's website, Van Zant has not toured with the band since 2012 due to health issues related to inner-ear nerve damage, although he will write and record with the band.  Co-lead vocalist Barnes is now performing most of the vocals at concert appearances. As of 2013, after nearly a year of missing performances, it was confirmed that Donnie Van Zant has officially left 38 Special after 39 years, and is retiring from music. In 2014, longtime bassist Larry Junstrom was replaced by Barry Dunaway. Dunaway has filled in for Junstrom for a handful of shows in 2011, and a few shows in 2013 as well. Junstrom was forced to retire due to a hand injury, that required surgery. This leaves only Don Barnes as an original member, although Barnes was absent from the band from 1987 until 1992.

The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for four weeks, establishing her popularity in Japan.
Hamasaki's constantly changing image and tight control over her artistry has helped her popularity extend across Asia; music and fashion trends she has started have spread regionally to China, Singapore and other countries across Southeast Asia. She has appeared in or lent her songs to many advertisements and television commercials.

The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) was a fraternal organization composed of veterans of the Union Army, US Navy, Marines and Revenue Cutter Service who served in the American Civil War. Founded in 1866 in Decatur, Illinois, it was dissolved in 1956 when its last member died. Linking men through their experience of the war, the GAR became among the first organized advocacy groups in American politics, supporting voting rights for black veterans, lobbying the US Congress to establish veterans' pensions, and supporting Republican political candidates. Its peak membership, at more than 490,000, was in 1890, a high point of Civil War commemorative ceremonies. It was succeeded by the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW), composed of male descendants of Union veterans.

[[Growth hormone]]

CATEGORIES: Pfizer, Anterior pituitary hormones, Recombinant proteins, Peptide hormones, Growth hormones, Anti-aging substances

Growth hormone (GH or HGH), also known as somatotropin or somatropin, is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction and regeneration in humans and other animals. It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to certain kinds of cells.  Growth hormone is a 191-amino acid, single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized, stored, and secreted by somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland.
GH is a stress hormone that raises the concentration of glucose and free fatty acids.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ranabir S, Reetu K | title = Stress and hormones | journal = Indian J Endocrinol Metab | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–22 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21584161 | pmc = 3079864 | doi = 10.4103/2230-8210.77573 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Greenwood FC, Landon J | title = Growth hormone secretion in response to stress in man | journal = Nature | volume = 210 | issue = 5035 | pages = 540–1 |date=April 1966 | pmid = 5960526 | doi = 10.1038/210540a0 [/tpl] It stimulates IGF which raises proteins.
GH is used as a prescription drug in medicine to treat children's growth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency. In the United States, it is only available legally from pharmacies, by prescription from a doctor. In recent years in the United States, some doctors have started to prescribe growth hormone in GH-deficient older patients (but not on healthy people) to increase vitality.   While legal, the efficacy and safety of this use for HGH has not been tested in a clinical trial.   At this time, HGH is still considered a very complex hormone, and many of its functions are still unknown.[tpl]cite book | author = Powers M | authorlink = | editor = Leaver-Dunn D, Houglum J, Harrelson GL | title = Principles of Pharmacology for Athletic Trainers | edition = | language = | publisher = Slack Incorporated | location = | year = 2005 | origyear = | pages = 331–332 | chapter = Performance-Enhancing Drugs| quote = | isbn = 1-55642-594-5 [/tpl]
In its role as an anabolic agent, HGH has been abused by competitors in sports at least since 1982,  and it has been banned by the IOC and NCAA.  Traditional urine analysis could not detect doping with HGH, so the ban was unenforceable until the early 2000s when blood tests that could distinguish between natural and artificial HGH were starting to be developed. Blood tests conducted by WADA at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece targeted primarily HGH.  This use for the drug is not approved by the FDA.
GH has been studied for use in raising livestock more efficiently in industrial agriculture and several efforts have been made to obtain governmental approval to use GH in livestock production.  These uses have been controversial.  In the United States, the only FDA-approved use of GH for livestock is the use of a cow-specific form of GH called bovine somatotropin for increasing milk production in dairy cows. Retailers are permitted to label containers of milk as produced with or without bovine somatotropin.

Islamization of knowledge is a term which describes a variety of attempts and approaches to synthesize the ethics of Islam with various fields of modern thought.  Its end product would be a new ijma ("consensus") among Muslims on an appropriate fiqh ("jurisprudence") and a scientific method that did not violate Islamic ethical norms. However, some Muslims both liberal and traditional are skeptical of the approach, viewing the construction of fields such as Islamic science and Islamic economics largely as propaganda created to further the Islamist view that Islam is an all-encompassing social system.

CATEGORIES: Art Informel and Tachisme, Art genres, Outsider art

The term outsider art was coined by art critic Roger Cardinal in 1972 as an English synonym for art brut ([tpl]IPA-fr|aʁ bʁyt|lang[/tpl], "raw art" or "rough art"), a label created by French artist Jean Dubuffet to describe art created outside the boundaries of official culture; Dubuffet focused particularly on art by those on the outside of the established art scene, such as insane-asylum inmates and children.Roger Cardinal, Outsider Art, London, 1972Bibliography The 20th Century Art Book. New York, NY: Phaidon Press, 1996.
While Dubuffet's term is quite specific, the English term "outsider art" is often applied more broadly, to include certain self-taught or naïve art makers who were never institutionalized. Typically, those labeled as outsider artists have little or no contact with the mainstream art world or art institutions. In many cases, their work is discovered only after their deaths. Often, outsider art illustrates extreme mental states, unconventional ideas, or elaborate fantasy worlds.
Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category; an annual Outsider Art Fair has taken place in New York since 1993, and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to the subject. The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing label for art created by people who are outside the mainstream "art world" or "art gallery system", regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work.

[[The Anxiety of Influence]]

CATEGORIES: 1973 books, Books by Harold Bloom

The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry (ISBN 0-19-511221-0) is a book by Harold Bloom, published in 1973. It was the first in a series of books that advanced a new "revisionary" or antitheticalantithetical Presidential Lectures: Harold Bloom: Excerpts approach to literary criticism.
Bloom's central thesis is that poets are hindered in their creative process by the ambiguous relationship they necessarily maintained with precursor poets. While admitting the influence of extraliterary experience on every poet, he argues that "the poet in a poet" is inspired to write by reading another poet's poetry and will tend to produce work that is derivative of existing poetry, and, therefore, weak.  Because poets must forge an original poetic vision in order to guarantee their survival into posterity (i.e., to guarantee that future readers will not allow them to be forgotten), the influence of precursor poets inspires a sense of anxiety in living poets.
Thus Bloom attempts to work out the process by which the small minority of 'strong' poets manage to create original work in spite of the pressure of influence. Such an agon, he argues, depends on six revisionary ratios,revisionary ratios Presidential Lectures: Harold Bloom: Excerpts which reflect Freudian defense mechanisms and the tropes of classical rhetoric. Later books, especially Kabbalah and Criticism and A Map of Misreading connect each ratio to the Kabbalah.
Before writing this book, Bloom spent a decade studying the Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century.  This is reflected in the emphasis given to those poets and their struggle with the influence of John Milton. Other poets analyzed range from Lucretius and Dante to Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and John Ashbery.
In The Anxiety of Influence and other early books, Bloom claimed that influence was particularly important for post-enlightenment poets. Conversely, he suggested that influence was not as much of a problem for such poets as Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. He since has changed his mind, and the most recent editions of The Anxiety of Influence include a preface claiming that Shakespeare was troubled early in his career by the influence of Christopher Marlowe.
The book itself is divided into six major categories, called "six revisionary ratios" by Bloom.  They are clinamen, tessera, kenosis, daemonization, askesis, and apophrades.

Bernard Lortie (born c.1951) of Montreal, Quebec, Canada was a member of the Chenier Cell of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) who were responsible for a decade of bombings and armed robberies in the province of Quebec.
During what became known as the October Crisis, on October 5, 1970, members of the FLQ's Liberation Cell kidnapped the British Trade Commissioner James Cross, from his Montreal home as part of a violent attempt to overthrow the elected government and to establish a socialist Quebec state independent of Canada. On October 10, Bernard Lortie, along with Chenier Cell leader Paul Rose and his brother, Jacques Rose, and Francis Simard, kidnapped and then murdered Quebec Vice Premier and Cabinet Minister, Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, their goal was to create an independent state based on the ideals of Fidel Castro's Cuba.
On November 6, 1970, Bernard Lortie was arrested when the police raided the hiding place of the FLQ's Chenier cell. Although the other three members escaped the raid, they were later captured in St-Luc, Quebec in late December. All four members were charged with the kidnapping and murder of Pierre Laporte. For his part in the kidnapping and murder, Bernard Lortie was sentenced to 20 years in jail. He was granted parole by the Canadian Parole Board after seven years.

WebMacro was initially created and designed by Justin Wells at Semiotek Inc. in the mid-2000, when the project was taken over by a team at SourceForge. Extensive discussions of WebMacro on the Java Servlet-Interest mailing list at that time may have been influential in Sun Microsystems decision to move their Java Server Pages product to a Model-View-Controller architecture.[tpl]Fact|date=December 2007[/tpl]
WebMacro can also be used to generate arbitrary text output from templates (one of its uses is automated code generation).

The form [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Allāhu[/tpl] is the nominative of Allah, meaning "God". The form [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|akbar[/tpl] is the elative of the adjective [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|kabīr[/tpl], meaning "great", from the Semitic root [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|k-b-r[/tpl]. As used in the [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Takbīr[/tpl] it is usually translated as "greatest", but some authors prefer "greater".E. W. Lane, Arabic English Lexicon, 1893, gives for kabir: "greater, and greatest, in body, or corporeal substance, and in estimation or rank or dignity, and more, or most, advanced in age, older, and oldest" (p. 2587). The translator [tpl]Who|date=January 2011[/tpl] of Ibn Qayyim's The Way to Patience and Gratitude into English opts for "Allah is Greater". In the Second Edition on page 463, an explanation is given: "...I preferred using 'the Greater' to 'the Greatest', as it is commonly used. Allahu Akbar literally means, "Allah is Greater" with the comparative mode. Yet, this does not mean that He (Glory be to Him) is not the Greatest, nor does it mean that there is anything that is put in comparison with Him. This is because when the Muslim says it, he means He is "Greater" than anything else, which, consequently, means He is the Greatest. This use gives more influence. This may be why it is used in Arabic this way, otherwise it should have been used as "Allahu al-Akbar", in the superlative mode. Surely, Allah knows best."[tpl]cite book|title=A Practical Arabic Grammar|page=66|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ex4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=akbar+arabic+grammar&source=bl&ots=uCjTxeHCPG&sig=icroi8vf4Valyx2IF4XUeFoDAcE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gnXuUeb_ItGx4APKrIH4Cw&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=snippet&q=comparative&f=false|year=1887|author=A.O.Green|publisher=Clarendon Press[/tpl]

[[Galway Bay]]

CATEGORIES: Bays of County Galway, Bays of County Clare, Sea loughs of Ireland

Galway Bay (Irish: Loch Lurgan or Cuan na Gaillimhe) is a large bay (or sea lough) on the west coast of Ireland, between County Galway in the province of Connacht to the north and the Burren in County Clare in the province of Munster to the south. Galway city is located on the northeast side of the bay.  It is about [tpl]convert|50|km|mi[/tpl] long and from [tpl]convert|10|km|mi[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|30|km|mi[/tpl] in breadth. The Aran Islands (Oileáin Árann) are to the west across the entrance and there are numerous small islands within the bay. The approaches to the bay between the Aran Islands and the mainland are as follows; the North Sound (An Súnda ó Thuaidh) lies between Inishmore and Leitir Mealláin in Connemara; it was formerly known as Bealach Locha Lurgan in Irish. Gregory's Sound (Súnda Ghríoghóra) lies between Inishmore and Inishmaan; it was formerly known as Bealach na h-Áite. Foul Sound (An Súnda Salach) lies between Inishmaan and Inisheer; it was formerly known as Bealach na Fearbhaighe. South Sound (An Súnda ó Theas), formerly known as Bealach na Finnise, lies between Inisheer and County Clare.
Galway Bay is famous for its unique traditional sailing craft, the Galway Hooker.

[[Glossary of Islam]]

CATEGORIES: Arabic words and phrases, Glossaries of religion, Islam-related lists, Islamic terms

The following list consists of notable concepts that are derived from both Islamic and Arab tradition, which are expressed as words in the Arabic language. The main purpose of this list is to disambiguate multiple spellings, to make note of spellings no longer in use for these concepts, to define the concept in one or two lines, to make it easy for one to find and pin down specific concepts, and to provide a guide to unique concepts of Islam all in one place.
Separating concepts in Islam from concepts specific to Arab culture, or from the language itself, can be difficult. Many Arabic concepts have an Arabic secular meaning as well as an Islamic meaning. One example is the concept of dawah. Arabic, like all languages, contains words whose meanings differ across various contexts. The word Islam is itself a good example.
Arabic is written in its own alphabet, with letters, symbols, and orthographic conventions that do not have exact equivalents in the Latin alphabet (see Arabic alphabet). The following list contains transliterations of Arabic terms and phrases; variations exist, e.g. din instead of deen and aqidah instead of aqeedah. Most items in the list also contain their actual Arabic spelling.

Etymologically, the word is related to the verb "[tpl]lang|ru|кроить[/tpl]" (kroit), i.e., "to cut".Etymology of the word [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Historically, krais were vast territories located along the periphery of Russia, since the word krai also means border or edge, i.e., a place of the cut-off. In English, the term is often translated as "territory". Currently the administrative usage of the term is mostly traditional, as some oblasts also fit this description and there is no difference in legal status between the krais and the oblasts.

[[Public good]]
CATEGORIES: Market failure, Public economics, Goods, Community building

In economics, a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others.For current definitions of public goods see any mainstream microeconomics textbook, e.g.: Hal R. Varian, Microeconomic Analysis ISBN 0-393-95735-7; Mas-Colell, Whinston & Green,  Microeconomic Theory ISBN 0-19-507340-1; or Gravelle & Rees, Microeconomics ISBN 0-582-40487-8. Examples of public goods include fresh air, knowledge, lighthouses, national defense, flood control systems and street lighting. Public goods that are available everywhere are sometimes referred to as global public goods.
Many public goods may at times be subject to excessive use resulting in negative externalities affecting all users; for example air pollution and traffic congestion. Public goods problems are often closely related to the "free-rider" problem, in which people not paying for the good may continue to access it, or the tragedy of the commons, where consumption of a shared resource by individuals acting in their individual and immediate self-interest diminishes or even destroys the original resource. Thus, the good may be under-produced, overused or degraded.Rittenberg and Tregarthen. Principles of Microeconomics: Chapter 6, Section 4. pp. 2 http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON101-3.2.pdf Accessed June 20, 2012  Public goods may also become subject to restrictions on access and may then be considered to be club goods or private goods; exclusion mechanisms include copyright, patents, congestion pricing, and pay television.
There is a good deal of debate and literature on how to measure the significance of public goods problems in an economy, and to identify the best remedies.

[[Lens flare]]
CATEGORIES: Science of photography, Lenses

Lens flare is the light scattered in lens systems through generally unwanted image formation mechanisms, such as internal reflection and scattering from material inhomogeneities in the lens. These mechanisms differ from the intended image formation mechanism that depends on refraction of the image rays. Flare manifests itself in two ways: as visible artifacts, and as a haze across the image. The haze makes the image look "washed out" by reducing contrast and color saturation (adding light to dark image regions, and adding white to saturated regions, reducing their saturation). Visible artifacts, usually in the shape of the lens iris, are formed when light follows a pathway through the lens than contains one or more reflections from the lens surfaces.
Flare is particularly caused by a very bright light sources either in the image – which produces visible artifacts – or shining into the lens but not in the image – which produces a haze.[tpl]Dubious|Polygon reflections appear even when the sun is not in the image.|date=June 2013[/tpl] Most commonly, this occurs when shooting into the sun (when the sun is in frame or the lens is pointed in the direction of the sun), and is reduced by using a lens hood or other shade.
For good optical systems and most images (which do not have a bright light shining into the lens), flare is a secondary effect that is widely distributed across the image and thus not visible, though it reduces contrast. Lenses with large numbers of elements such as zooms tend to exhibit greater lens flare, as they contain multiple surfaces at which unwanted internal scattering occurs.

In medicine, a spasm is a sudden, involuntary contraction of a muscle, a group of muscles,[tpl]DorlandsDict|seven/000098803|spasm[/tpl] or a hollow organ such as a heart, or a similarly sudden contraction of an orifice.  It most commonly refers to a muscle cramp which is often accompanied by a sudden burst of pain, but is usually harmless and ceases after a few minutes. There is a variety of other causes of involuntary muscle contractions, which may be more serious, depending on the cause.
The word "spasm" may also refer to a temporary burst of energy, activity, emotion, Eustress, stress, or anxiety unrelated to, or as a consequence of, involuntary muscle activity.

==Description==

[[Riemann surface]]

CATEGORIES: Riemann surfaces

In mathematics, particularly in complex analysis, a Riemann surface, first studied by and named after Bernhard Riemann, is a one-dimensional complex manifold. Riemann surfaces can be thought of as "deformed versions" of the complex plane: locally near every point they look like patches of the complex plane, but the global topology can be quite different. For example, they can look like a sphere or a torus or several sheets glued together.
The main point of Riemann surfaces is that holomorphic functions may be defined between them. Riemann surfaces are nowadays considered the natural setting for studying the global behavior of these functions, especially multi-valued functions such as the square root and other algebraic functions, or the logarithm.
Every Riemann surface is a two-dimensional real analytic manifold (i.e., a surface), but it contains more structure (specifically a complex structure) which is needed for the unambiguous definition of holomorphic functions. A two-dimensional real manifold can be turned into a Riemann surface (usually in several inequivalent ways) if and only if it is orientable and metrizable. So the sphere and torus admit complex structures, but the Möbius strip, Klein bottle and projective plane do not.
Geometrical facts about Riemann surfaces are as "nice" as possible, and they often provide the intuition and motivation for generalizations to other curves, manifolds or varieties. The Riemann–Roch theorem is a prime example of this influence.

In the field of electronic devices, Roll-to-roll processing, also known as web processing, reel-to-reel processing or R2R, is the process of creating electronic devices on a roll of flexible plastic or metal foil. In other fields predating this use, it can refer to any process of applying coatings, printing, or performing other processes starting with a roll of a flexible material and re-reeling after the process to create an output roll. These processes can be grouped together under the general term converting. Once the rolls of material have been coated, laminated or printed they are normally slit to their finished size on a slitter rewinder.

Jingoism is patriotism in the form of aggressive foreign policy.Catherine Soanes (ed.), Compact Oxford English Dictionary for University and College Students (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 546. Jingoism also refers to a country's advocation of the use of threats or actual force against peaceful relations, either economic or political, with other countries in order to safeguard what it perceives as its national interests. Colloquially, it refers to excessive bias in judging one's own country as superior to others—an extreme type of nationalism.
The term originated in Britain, expressing a pugnacious attitude toward Russia in the 1870s, and appeared in the American press by 1893.

[[Duet]]

CATEGORIES: Duets, Musical terminology

A duet is a musical composition for two performers. In classical music, the term is most often used for a composition for two singers or pianists. A piece performed by two pianists performing together on the same piano is referred to as "piano duet" or "piano four hands".Christensen, T. (1999). "Four-Hand Piano". Journal of the American Musicological Society, 52(2) 255–298 A piece for two pianists performing together on separate pianos is referred to as a "piano duo".
When Mozart was young, he and his sister Marianne played a duet of his composition at a London concert in 1765. While young, he helped introduce what a duet is. The four-hand, described as a duet, was in many of his compositions which included five sonatas; a set of variations, two performers and one instrument, and a sonata for two pianos. These mark the beginning of duet history. The first published sonata or duet was in 1777.Miller, H.-M. (1943). The Earliest Keyboard Duets. The Musical Quarterly, 29(4), 438–457.
"Duet" is also used as a verb for the act of performing a musical duet, or colloquially as a noun to refer to the performers of a duet. The word is also occasionally used in reference to non-musical activities performed together by two people.
In Renaissance music, a duet specifically intended as a teaching tool, to be performed by teacher and student, was called a bicinium (see Étude).

CATEGORIES: 1889 births, 1938 deaths, American geneticists

Calvin Blackman Bridges (January 11, 1889 – December 27, 1938) was an American scientist, known for his contributions to the field of genetics. Along with Alfred Sturtevant and H.J. Muller, Bridges was part of the famous fly room of Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia University.

Bridges wrote a masterful Ph.D. thesis on "Non-disjunction as proof of the chromosome theory of heredity." It appeared as the first paper in the first issue of the journal Genetics in 1916. 
His work with sex linked traits in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster suggested that chromosomes contained genes. Later Nettie Maria Stevens was able to prove this hypothesis by examining the chromosomes of the fruit flies. Bridges wrote a couple of papers presenting the proof. He thanked her as "Miss Stevens" without stating what her contribution was nor referring to her PhD.
Bridges' best-known contribution among Drosophila researchers is his observation and documentation of the polytene chromosomes found in larval salivary gland cells.  The banding patterns of these chromosomes are still used as genetic landmarks even by contemporary researchers.

[[Spin network]]

CATEGORIES: Loop quantum gravity, Mathematical physics, Quantum field theory, Diagram algebras, Diagrams

In physics, a spin network is a type of diagram which can be used to represent states and interactions between particles and fields in quantum mechanics. From a mathematical perspective, the diagrams are a concise way to represent multilinear functions and functions between representations of matrix groups. The diagrammatic notation often simplifies calculation because simple diagrams may be used to represent complicated functions. Roger Penrose is credited with the invention of spin networks in 1971, although similar diagrammatic techniques existed before that time.
Spin networks have been applied to the theory of quantum gravity by Carlo Rovelli, Lee Smolin, Jorge Pullin and others. They can also be used to construct a particular functional on the space of connections which is invariant under local gauge transformations.

Drosophila melanogaster is a species of Fly (the taxonomic order Diptera) in the family Drosophilidae. The species is known generally as the common fruit fly or vinegar fly. Starting with Charles W. Woodworth's proposal of the use of this species as a model organism, D. melanogaster continues to be widely used for biological research in studies of genetics, physiology, microbial pathogenesis and life history evolution.  It is typically used because it is an animal species that is easy to care for, has four pairs of chromosomes, breeds quickly, and lays many eggs.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author=James H.

The most common types of chess game collections are collected games of a single player (e.g. My Best Games of Chess 1908-1937 by Alexander Alekhine), annotations of games from a single tournament, collections of chess games covering a certain period of time (e.g. Oxford Encyclopaedia of Chess Games. Vol.1 1485-1866 by Levy and O'Connell), opening move collections, or collections centered on  tactical or strategic themes (e.g. games featuring brilliant defense, attacking play, endgame technique, and so on).
Chess Informant is a series which collects chess games annotated by top players and publishes them in a language independent format.

The Cardigans are a Swedish rock band formed in Jönköping, Sweden, in 1992,[tpl]Cite book|first= Martin C.|last= Strong|year= 2000|title= The Great Rock Discography|edition= 5th|publisher= Mojo Books|location= Edinburgh|pages= 152–153|isbn= 1-84195-017-3[/tpl] by guitarist Peter Svensson, bassist Magnus Sveningsson, drummer Bengt Lagerberg, keyboardist Lars-Olof Johansson and lead singer Nina Persson, with the line-up remaining unchanged to this day.
Their debut album Emmerdale (1994) gave them a solid base in their home country and enjoyed some success abroad, especially in Japan. It was not until their second album Life (1995) that an international reputation was secured. Their popularity rose when their single "Lovefool", from the album First Band on the Moon (1996), was included in the soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet.  Other singles included "Erase/Rewind" and "My Favourite Game" from the album Gran Turismo (1998). After a five-year hiatus the band returned with Long Gone Before Daylight (2003) a mellower country-laden record. Their last album Super Extra Gravity (2005), a continuation of the country music infused by pop sensibility and further maturing in the band's sound, was the best-selling Swedish album of that year.[tpl]fact|date=October 2012[/tpl] After a 2006 tour, the band embarked on a long five-year break from musical activities, before reuniting in 2012 to play several concerts. Overall the band sold over 15 million albums worldwide.

Bolo is a video game created for the BBC Micro computer by Stuart Cheshire in 1987, and later ported to the Macintosh in its most popular incarnation. It is a networked multiplayer game that simulates a tank battlefield.
A similarly named tank game was created for the Apple II in 1982. Cheshire says this was "an unfortunate coincidence", and that his Indian wife inspired the name.  As Cheshire noted in his original documentation for the game, "Bolo is the Hindi word for communication. Bolo is about computers communicating on the network, and more important about humans communicating with each other, as they argue, negotiate, form alliances, agree stategies, etc."

[[Loyd Jowers]]
CATEGORIES: 1926 births, 2000 deaths, Cardiovascular disease deaths in Tennessee, Deaths from myocardial infarction, Martin Luther King, Jr., People from Memphis, Tennessee

Loyd Jowers (November 20, 1926Indexed at SSDI[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]May 20, 2000) was the owner of a restaurant (Jim's Grill) near the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. In December 1993, Jowers appeared on ABC's Prime Time Live and related the details of an alleged conspiracy involving the Mafia and the U.S. government to kill King. According to Jowers, James Earl Ray was a scapegoat, and was not involved in the assassination. Jowers believed that Memphis police officer Lieutenant Earl Clark fired the fatal shot.
The United States Department of Justice published the results of its investigation into Jowers' allegations and concluded that they were not substantiated nor credible and that they found significant evidence to refute them. According to the DOJ report,[ref][tpl]cite journal| title=United States Department of Justice Investigation of Recent Allegations Regarding the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr|chapter=Overview|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|date=June 2000|url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part1.php|chapterurl=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part2.php#over|accessdate=2013-03-21 |archivedate=2013-01-09 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DXx6C0YY |deadurl=no[/tpl]
[/ref] Jowers contradicted himself on virtually every key point about the alleged conspiracy:   In these statements, Jowers has repeatedly changed key aspects of his new story, disavowed his confession, and even retreated to his long-standing account of the previous 25 years. For example, he not only identified two different people as the assassin, but also most recently claimed that he saw the assassin and did not recognize him. Jowers also abandoned his initial allegation that he received $100,000 with which he hired a hit man to kill Dr. King, claiming instead that he merely held the money for the conspirators. Additionally, Jowers has been inconsistent about other aspects of the alleged conspiracy, including his role in it, Raoul's responsibilities, whether and how Memphis police officers were involved, and the disposal of the alleged murder weapon.http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part3.php PART IV. JOWERS' ALLEGATIONS 
According to the same report, Jowers initially sought compensation for his story, and his friends and relatives acknowledge that he hoped to make money from his account. He also refused to cooperate with the DOJ investigation. Even though he repeatedly confessed publicly without immunity from prosecution, he was unwilling to provide a final, definitive version of his story in order to be granted immunity by the Department of Justice. Jowers has never made his conspiracy claims under oath according to the report.
In 1998, the King family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers and "other unknown co-conspirators" for the murder of King. A Memphis jury found Jowers responsible on December 8, 1999, and that the assassination plot also involved "governmental agencies.""Memphis Jury Sees Conspiracy in Martin Luther King's Killing", New York Times, December 09, 1999
The Memphis county prosecutor said on several occasions that Mr. Jowers' claims were without merit and that his motivation was to sell his story for a book or a movie. Both sisters that worked at Jowers' restaurant recanted their support for the case. Their conversation in which the main witness for Jowers admitted that the story was false was taped by the authorities. The sister admitted that Jowers had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, and she in turn corroborated his story in order to get some money to pay her income tax.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/mlk/memphis/memphis2.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=Washingtonpost.com: Martin Luther King Jr.: The Legacy | date=January 30, 1999[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/23/us/loyd-jowers-73-who-claimed-a-role-in-the-killing-of-dr-king.html | work=The New York Times | title=Loyd Jowers, 73, Who Claimed A Role in the Killing of Dr. King | date=May 23, 2000[/tpl]
Following the above-stated verdict, John Campbell, an assistant district attorney in Memphis who was part of the criminal trial said:  I'm not surprised by the verdict. This case overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was presented, what other option did the jury have but to accept Mr. Pepper's version? 
At a 1999 press conference following this verdict, Coretta Scott King stated that "there is abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr... the conspiracy of the Mafia, local, state and federal government agencies, were deeply involved in the assassination of my husband. The jury also affirmed overwhelming evidence that identified someone else, not James Earl Ray, as the shooter, and that Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/assassination-conspiracy-trial | work=The King Center | title=Assassination Conspiracy Trial | date=December 9, 1999[/tpl]
Following statements by Dexter King and other family members, Dexter was subsequently asked by a reporter, "there are many people out there who feel that as long as these conspirators remain nameless and faceless there is no true closure, and no justice." He replied:
 "No, he Lloyd Jowers named the shooter. The shooter was the Memphis Police Department Officer, Lt. Earl Clark who he named as the killer. Once again, beyond that you had credible witnesses that named members of a Special Forces team who didn't have to act because the contract killer succeeded, with plausible denial, a Mafia contracted killer". 
Gerald Posner, an investigative journalist who wrote the book Killing the Dream in which he makes the case that Ray is the killer, said after the verdict:   It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it.  
Author, activist, and Christian theologian Jim Douglass who attended the trial commented in The Fellowship of Reconciliation magazine:
 This historic trial was so ignored by the media that, apart from the courtroom participants, I was the only person who attended it from beginning to end. What I experienced in that courtroom ranged from inspiration at the courage of the Kings, their lawyer-investigator William F. Pepper, and the witnesses, to amazement at the government's carefully interwoven plot to kill Dr. King. The seriousness with which US intelligence agencies planned the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. speaks eloquently of the threat King and nonviolence represented to the powers that be in the spring of 1968.The King Trial

[[Normal (geometry)]]

CATEGORIES: Surfaces, Vector calculus, 3D computer graphics

In geometry, a normal is an object such as a line or vector that is perpendicular to a given object. For example, in the two-dimensional case, the normal line to a curve at a given point is the line perpendicular to the tangent line to the curve at the point.
In the three-dimensional case a surface normal, or simply normal, to a surface at a point P is a vector that is perpendicular to the tangent plane to that surface at P. The word "normal" is also used as an adjective: a line normal to a plane, the normal component of a force, the normal vector, etc. The concept of normality generalizes to orthogonality.
The concept has been generalized to differentiable manifolds of arbitrary dimension embedded in a Euclidean space. The normal vector space or normal space of a manifold at a point P is the set of the vectors which are orthogonal to the tangent space at P. In the case of differential curves, the curvature vector is a normal vector of special interest.
The normal is often used in computer graphics to determine a surface's orientation toward a light source for flat shading, or the orientation of each of the corners (vertices) to mimic a curved surface with Phong shading.

Alan Lomax (January 31, 1915 – July 19, 2002) was one of the great American field collectors of folk music of the 20th century. He was also a folklorist, ethnomusicologist, archivist, writer, scholar, political activist, oral historian, and film-maker. Lomax also produced recordings, concerts, and radio shows in the US and in England, which played an important role in both the American and British folk revivals of the 1940s, '50s and early '60s. During the New Deal, with his father, famed folklorist and collector John A. Lomax and later alone and with others, Lomax recorded thousands of songs and interviews for the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress on aluminum and acetate discs.
After 1942, when Congress cut off the Library of Congress's funding for folk song collecting, Lomax continued to collect independently in Britain, Ireland, the Caribbean, Italy, and Spain, as well as the United States, using the latest recording technology, assembling a treasure trove of American and international culture. With the start of the Cold War, Lomax continued to speak out for a public role for folklore,During the New Deal called "applied folklore" or "functionalism" by Benjamin Botkin, see John Alexander Williams, "The Professionalization of Folklore Studies: a Comparative Perspective", Journal of the Folklore Institute 11: 3 (Mar. 1975); 211–34. even as academic folklorists turned inward. He devoted much of the latter part of his life to advocating what he called Cultural Equity, which he sought to put on a solid theoretical foundation through to his Cantometrics research (which included a prototype Cantometrics-based educational program, the Global Jukebox). In the 1970s and 80s Lomax advised the Smithsonian Institution's Folklife Festival and produced a series of films about folk music, American Patchwork, which aired on PBS in 1991. In his late seventies, Lomax completed a long-deferred memoir, The Land Where the Blues Began (1995), linking the birth of the blues to debt peonage, segregation, and forced labor in the American South.

Rabbi Dov Ber ben Avraham of Mezeritch ([tpl]lang-he|דֹּב בֶּר מִמֶּזְרִיטְשְׁ[/tpl]) (died December 1772 OS), also known as the Maggid of Mezritch, was a disciple of Rabbi Yisrael Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidic Judaism, and was chosen as his successor to lead the early movement. Rabbi Dov Ber is regarded as the first systematic exponent of the mystical philosophy underlying the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, and through his teaching and leadership, the main architect of the movement.see Kaufmann Kohler & Louis Ginzberg. "Baer (Dob) of Meseritz", Jewish Encyclopedia, retrieved May 20, 2006 He established his base in Mezhirichi (in Volynia), which moved the centre of Hasidism from the Baal Shem Tov's Medzhybizh (in Podolia), where he focused his attention on raising a close circle of great disciples to spread the movement. After his death, avoiding the unified leadership of the first two generations, this third generation of leadership took their different interpretations and disseminated across appointed regions of Eastern Europe. Under the inspiration of their teacher, this rapidly spread Hasidism beyond the Ukraine, to Poland, Galicia and Russia.
His teachings appear in Magid Devarav L'Yaakov, Or Torah, Likutim Yekarim, Or Ha'emet, Kitvei Kodesh, Shemuah Tovah, and in the works authored by his disciples. His inner circle of disciples, known as the Chevraia Kadisha ("Holy Brotherhood"), included his son Rabbi Avraham HaMalach (The Angel), Rabbi Nachum of Czernobyl, Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk, Rabbi Zusha of Hanipol, Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev, Rabbi Boruch of Medzhybizh, Rabbi Aharon (HaGadol) of Karlin, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, Rabbi Shmuel Shmelke of Nikolsburg and Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi.

Specifically, a command named uucp is one of the programs in the suite; it provides a user interface for requesting file copy operations.  The UUCP suite also includes uux (user interface for remote command execution), uucico (the communication program that performs the file transfers), uustat (reports statistics on recent activity), uuxqt (execute commands sent from remote machines), and uuname (reports the UUCP name of the local system).  Some versions of the suite include uuencode/uudecode (convert 8-bit binary files to 7-bit text format and vice versa).
Although UUCP was originally developed on Unix in the 1970s and 1980s, and is most closely associated with Unix-like systems, UUCP implementations exist for several non-Unix-like operating systems, including Microsoft's MS-DOS, Digital's VAX/VMS, Commodore's AmigaOS, classic Mac OS, and even CP/M.

MIX is a hypothetical computer used in Donald Knuth's monograph, The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP).  MIX's model number is 1009, which was derived by combining the model numbers and names of several contemporaneous, commercial machines deemed significant by the author.  ("MIX" also represents the value 1009 in Roman numerals.)
The 1960s-era MIX has since been superseded by a new (also hypothetical) computer architecture, MMIX, to be incorporated in forthcoming editions of TAOCP.  Software implementations for both the MIX and MMIX architectures have been developed by Knuth and made freely available (named "MIXware" and "MMIXware", respectively).
Several derivatives of Knuth's MIX/MMIX emulators also exist.  GNU MDK is one such software package; it is free and runs on a wide variety of platforms.
Their purpose for education is quite similar to John L. Hennessy's and David A. Patterson's DLX architecture, from Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware Software Interface.

Ferdinand I (12 January 1751 – 4 January 1825) was the King of the Two Sicilies from 1816, after his restoration following victory in the Napoleonic Wars. Before that he had been, since 1759, Ferdinand IV of the Kingdom of Naples and Ferdinand III of the Kingdom of Sicily. He was deposed twice from the throne of Naples: once by the revolutionary Parthenopean Republic for six months in 1799 and again by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805.
Ferdinand was the third son of King Charles III of Spain, Naples and Sicily by his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony. On 10 August 1759, Charles succeeded his elder brother, Ferdinand VI, but treaty provisions made Charles ineligible to hold all three crowns. On 6 October, he abdicated his Neapolitan and Sicilian titles in favour of his third son, because his eldest son, Philip had been excluded from succession and his second son, Charles, was heir to the Spanish throne. Ferdinand was the founder of the cadet House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.

High-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI or HDR) is a set of techniques used in imaging and photography to reproduce a greater dynamic range of luminosity than possible using standard digital imaging or photographic techniques. HDR images can represent more accurately the range of intensity levels found in real scenes, from direct sunlight to faint starlight, and is often captured by way of a plurality of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter.[tpl]cite book |author=Reinhard, Erik; Ward, Greg; Pattanaik, Sumanta; Debevec, Paul |title=High dynamic range imaging: acquisition, display, and image-based lighting |year=2005 |quote=Images that store a depiction of the scene in a range of intensities commensurate with the scene are what we call HDR, or "radiance maps".

Goguryeo or Koguryo ([tpl]Ko-hhrm|hanja=高句麗, 高句驪|hangul=고구려[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ko|koɡuɾjʌ[/tpl]) (37 BC – 668 AD) was one of the ancient Three Kingdoms of Korea,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321038/Koguryo |title=Koguryo |work=Encylopaedia Britannica |accessdate=October 15, 2013[/tpl]Byeon, Tae-seop (1999) 韓國史通論(Outline of Korean history), 4th ed, Unknown Publisher, ISBN 89-445-9101-6.Doosan Encyclopedia Online [tpl]ko[/tpl][ref]
</ref> located in the northern and central parts of the [[Korean Peninsula]] and the southern and central parts of inner and outer [[Manchuria]]. Goguryeo was an active participant in the power struggle for control of the Korean peninsula and was also associated with the foreign affairs of neighboring polities in [[Han dynasty|China]] and [[Yamato period|Japan]].
The kingdom is one of the longest lasting in world history.
The Samguk Sagi, a 12th-century Goryeo text, indicates that Goguryeo was founded in 37 BC by Jumong, a prince from Buyeo, although there is archaeological and textual evidence from Chinese geographic monographs that suggests that Goguryeo may have been in existence since the 2nd century BC around the fall of Gojoseon, an earlier kingdom which also occupied southern Manchuria and northern Korea.
Goguryeo was a major dynasty in Northeast Asia, until it was defeated by a Silla-Tang alliance in 668 AD. After its fall, its territory was divided among Unified Silla, Balhae, and the Tang dynasty.
The shortened name for Goguryeo was adopted by the Goryeo dynasty (A.D. 918-1392), whose territory was in the southern portion of Goguryeo, and would be the foundation of the English word "Korea."

The Pilgrimage Church of Wies ([tpl]lang-de|Wieskirche[/tpl]) is an oval rococo church, designed in the late 1740s by Dominikus Zimmermann, who for the last eleven years of his life lived nearby. It is located in the foothills of the Alps, in the municipality of Steingaden in the Weilheim-Schongau district, Bavaria, Germany.
It is said that, in 1738, tears were seen on a dilapidated wooden figure of the Scourged Saviour. This miracle resulted in a pilgrimage rush to see the sculpture. In 1740, a small chapel was built to house the statue but it was soon realized that the building would be too small for the number of pilgrims it attracted, and so Steingaden Abbey decided to commission a separate shrine. Many who have prayed in front of the statue of Jesus on the altar have claimed that people have been miraculously cured of their diseases, which has made this church even more of a pilgrimage site.
Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the Wessobrunner School. "Everything was done throughout the church to make the supernatural visible. Sculpture and murals combined to unleash the divine in visible form". 
There is a popular belief that the Bavarian government planned to sell or demolish the rococo masterpiece during the secularization of Bavaria at the beginning of the 19th century, and that only protests from the local farmers saved it from destruction. Available sources, however, document that the responsible state commission clearly advocated the continuation of Wies as a pilgrimage site, even in spite of economic objections from the abbot of Steingaden.
The Wieskirche was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983 and underwent extensive restoration between 1985 and 1991.

Similar practices exist in other cultures, including the Chinese tradition of penjing from which the art originated, and the miniature living landscapes of Vietnamese hòn non bộ. The Japanese tradition dates back over a thousand years, and has its own aesthetics and terminology.
"Bonsai" is a Japanese pronunciation of the earlier Chinese term penzai. A "bon" is a tray-like pot typically used in bonsai culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phoenixbonsai.com/Terms/Bonsai.html |title=bonsai |publisher=Phoenixbonsai.com |accessdate=2009-04-28[/tpl] The word bonsai is often used in English as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots. This article focuses on bonsai as defined in the Japanese tradition.
The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower).[tpl]cite book | last= Chan | first= Peter | title=Bonsai Masterclass | publisher=Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. | year=1987| isbn=0-8069-6763-3 | ref=bonsai_masterclass_peter_chan[/tpl]  By contrast with other plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food, for medicine, or for creating yard-size or park-size gardens or landscapes. Instead, bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees growing in a container.
A bonsai is created beginning with a specimen of source material. This may be a cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species[tpl]cite book | last= Owen | first=Gordon | title=The Bonsai Identifier | publisher=Quintet Publishing Ltd. | year=1990 | isbn=0-88665-833-0 | page = 11[/tpl] that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai.
The source specimen is shaped to be relatively small and to meet the aesthetic standards of bonsai. When the candidate bonsai nears its planned final size it is planted in a display pot, usually one designed for bonsai display in one of a few accepted shapes and proportions. From that point forward, its growth is restricted by the pot environment. Throughout the year, the bonsai is shaped to limit growth, redistribute foliar vigor to areas requiring further development, and meet the artist's detailed design.
The practice of bonsai is sometimes confused with dwarfing, but dwarfing generally refers to research, discovery, or creation of plant cultivars that are permanent, genetic miniatures of existing species. Bonsai does not require genetically dwarfed trees, but rather depends on growing small trees from regular stock and seeds. Bonsai uses cultivation techniques like pruning, root reduction, potting, defoliation, and grafting to produce small trees that mimic the shape and style of mature, full-size trees.

[[Ley line]]

Ley lines [tpl]IPAc-en|l|eɪ|_|l|aɪ|n|z[/tpl] are supposed alignments of numerous places of geographical and historical interest, such as ancient monuments and megaliths, natural ridge-tops and water-fords. The phrase was coined in 1921 by the amateur archaeologist Alfred Watkins, in his books Early British Trackways and The Old Straight Track. He sought to identify ancient trackways in the British landscape. Watkins later developed theories that these alignments were created for ease of overland trekking by line-of-sight navigation during neolithic times, and had persisted in the landscape over millennia.
In a book called The View Over Atlantis (1969), the writer John Michell revived the term "ley lines", associating it with spiritual and mystical theories about alignments of land forms, drawing on the Chinese concept of feng shui. He believed that a mystical network of ley lines existed across Britain.
Since the publication of Michell's book, the spiritualised version of the concept has been adopted by other authors and applied to landscapes in many places around the world. Both versions of the theory have been criticised on the grounds that a random distribution of a sufficient number of points will inevitably create "alignments".

The Minimoog is a monophonic analog synthesizer, invented by Bill Hemsath and Robert Moog. It was released in 1970 by R.A. Moog Inc.

The Minimoog was designed in response to the use of synthesizers in rock and pop music. Large modular synthesizers were expensive, cumbersome, and delicate, and not ideal for live performance; the Minimoog was designed to include the most important parts of a modular synthesizer in a compact package, without the need for patch cords. It later surpassed this original purpose, however, and became a distinctive and popular instrument in its own right. It remains in demand today, over four decades after its introduction, for its intuitive design and powerful bass and lead sounds.

Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a transparent thermoplastic, often used as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass.
Although it is not technically a type of glass, the substance has sometimes historically been called acrylic glass. Chemically, it is the synthetic polymer of methyl methacrylate. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists such as William Chalmers, Otto Röhm and Walter Bauer and was first brought to market in 1933 by the Rohm and Haas Company, under the trademark Plexiglas.Rohm and Haas Innovation – Plexiglas Triumphs. Rohmhaas.com. Retrieved on 2010-08-29. It has since been sold under many different names, including Acrylite, Lucite, and Perspex.
PMMA is an economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when extreme strength is not necessary. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when loaded, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA can achieve high scratch and impact resistance.
The often-seen[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] spelling poly(methyl 2-methylpropanoate)—that is, spelled with an instead of en—is a misspelling of poly(methyl 2-methylpropenoate).

[[Extropianism]]

Extropianism, also referred to as the philosophy of Extropy, is an evolving framework of values and standards for continuously improving the human condition.  
Extropians believe that advances in science and technology will some day let people live indefinitely. An extropian may wish to contribute to this goal, e.g. by doing research and development or volunteering to test new technology.
Extropianism describes a pragmatic consilience of transhumanist thought guided by a proactionary approach to human evolution and progress. 
Originated by a set of principles developed by Dr. Max More, The Principles of Extropy,[tpl]Cite document |url=http://www.extropy.org/principles.htm |title=Principles of Extropy (Version 3.11) : An evolving framework of values and standards for continuously improving the human condition |year=2003 |author=Max More |publisher=Extropy Institute |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] extropian thinking places strong emphasis on rational thinking and practical optimism. According to More, these principles "do not specify particular beliefs, technologies, or policies". Extropians share an optimistic view of the future, expecting considerable advances in computational power, life extension, nanotechnology and the like.  Many extropians foresee the eventual realization of unlimited maximum life spans, and the  recovery, thanks to future advances in biomedical technology or mind uploading, of those whose bodies/brains have been preserved by means of cryonics.

Darren Aronofsky (born February 12, 1969) is an American film director, screenwriter and film producer. He has received acclaim for his often surreal, disturbing films and has been noted for frequent collaborations with cinematographer Matthew Libatique, film editor Andrew Weisblum and composer Clint Mansell. His films have generated controversy and are well known for their often violent, bleak subject matter.
Aronofsky attended Harvard University, where he studied film and social anthropology, and the American Film Institute to study directing. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, Supermarket Sweep, which went on to become a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky's feature debut, Pi, was shot in November 1997. The low-budget, $60,000 production, starring Sean Gullette, was sold to Artisan Entertainment for $1 million, and grossed over $3 million; Aronofsky won the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and an Independent Spirit Award for best first screenplay. Aronofsky's followup, Requiem for a Dream, was based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. The film garnered strong reviews and received an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn's performance. After turning down an opportunity to direct an entry in the Batman franchise and writing the World War II horror film Below, Aronofsky began production on his third film, The Fountain. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box-office, but has since garnered a cult following.
His fourth film, The Wrestler, was released to critical acclaim and both of the film's stars, Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei, received Academy Award nominations. In 2010 Aronofsky was an executive producer on The Fighter and his fifth feature film, Black Swan, received further critical acclaim and many accolades, being nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director and winning Best Actress for Natalie Portman's performance in the film. Aronofsky received nominations for Best Director at the Golden Globes, and a DGA nomination. His sixth film, Noah, was released in theaters on March 28, 2014.

[[Panopticon]]

CATEGORIES: Prisons, Philosophical concepts, Surveillance, Penal imprisonment

The Panopticon is a type of institutional building designed by the English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham in the late 18th century. The concept of the design is to allow a single watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without them being able to tell whether they are being watched or not. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that all inmates must act as though they are watched at all times, effectively controlling their own behaviour constantly. The name is also a reference to Panoptes from Greek mythology; he was a giant with a hundred eyes and thus was known to be a very effective watchman.
The design consists of a circular structure with an “inspection house” at its centre, from which the manager or staff of the institution are able to watch the inmates, who are stationed around the perimeter. Bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals, schools, sanatoriums, daycares, and asylums, but he devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a Panopticon prison, and it is his prison which is most widely understood by the term.
Bentham himself described the Panopticon as “a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example.”Bentham, Jeremy. Panopticon (Preface). In Božovič 1995, pp. 29–95. Elsewhere, he described the Panopticon prison as “a mill for grinding rogues honest”.Semple 1993, p. 152.

It has ten seats in the Finnish Parliament and two in the European Parliament. The current chairperson is Ville Niinistö.
Founded in 1987, the party absorbed a number of green organisations, including four MPs elected in 1987.  The party won ten seats in the 1991 election. Despite falling to nine seats in 1995, Pekka Haavisto, joined Paavo Lipponen's rainbow coalition first cabinet, making the Green League the first Green party in a national cabinet. The party remained in government until 2002, when it left in opposition to nuclear power. In 2007, the party peaked at 15 seats, and joined the centre-right government. At the 2011 election, the party fell to ten seats. Nevertheless, since the only winner of the 2011 elections chose to remain in opposition, the Greens were invited to join a six-party rainbow coalition government.
The party sits in the centre of the political spectrum, criticising both socialism and the free market. The party is a member of the Global Greens and the European Green Party, while its two MEPs sit with The Greens–European Free Alliance in the European Parliament. Originally split on whether Finland should join the European Union, the Green League is now pro-European and was the first Finnish party to support a federal Europe.[tpl]cite book |title=Finland in the European Union |last1=Raunio |first1=Tapio |last2=Tiilikainen  |first2=Teija |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-7146-5375-4 |page=52 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PXbKkH8cTUsC |accessdate=[/tpl]

It is the tallest building in Frankfurt, the tallest building in Germany and the  second tallest building in the European Union. It had been the tallest building in Europe from its completion in 1997 until 2003 when it was surpassed by the Triumph-Palace in Moscow. The Commerzbank Tower is only two metres taller than the Messeturm, which is also located in Frankfurt. The Messeturm had been the tallest building in Europe before the construction of the Commerzbank Tower.
Commerzbank Tower was designed by Foster & Partners, with Arup and Krebs & Kiefer (structural engineering), J. Roger Preston with P&A Petterson Ahrens (mechanical engineering), Schad & Hölzel (electrical engineering). Construction of the building began in 1994 and took three years to complete. The building provides [tpl]convert|121000|m²|abbr=on[/tpl] of office space for the Commerzbank headquarters, including winter gardens and natural lighting and air circulation. The building is lighted at night with a yellow lighting scheme that was designed by Asadullah Aftab who was allowed to display this sequence as a result of a competition.
In its immediate neighbourhood are other skyscrapers including the Eurotower (home of the European Central Bank), the Main Tower, the Silberturm, the Japan Center and the Gallileo, the latter being also owned and used by Commerzbank. The area forms Frankfurts central business district, commonly known as Bankenviertel.

[[Overfitting]]
CATEGORIES: Statistical inference, Regression analysis, Machine learning

In statistics and machine learning, overfitting occurs when a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting generally occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model which has been overfit will generally have poor predictive performance, as it can exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.
The possibility of overfitting exists because the criterion used for training the model is not the same as the criterion used to judge the efficacy of a model. In particular, a model is typically trained by maximizing its performance on some set of training data. However, its efficacy is determined not by its performance on the training data but by its ability to perform well on unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model begins to memorize training data rather than learning to generalize from trend. As an extreme example, if the number of parameters is the same as or greater than the number of observations, a simple model or learning process can perfectly predict the training data simply by memorizing the training data in its entirety, but such a model will typically fail drastically when making predictions about new or unseen data, since the simple model has not learned to generalize at all.
The potential for overfitting depends not only on the number of parameters and data but also the conformability of the model structure with the data shape, and the magnitude of model error compared to the expected level of noise or error in the data.
Even when the fitted model does not have an excessive number of parameters, it is to be expected that the fitted relationship will appear to perform less well on a new data set than on the data set used for fitting.Everitt B.S. (2002) Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, CUP. ISBN 0-521-81099-X (entry for "Shrinkage") In particular, the value of the coefficient of determination will shrink relative to the original training data.
In order to avoid overfitting, it is necessary to use additional techniques (e.g. cross-validation, regularization, early stopping, pruning, Bayesian priors on parameters or model comparison), that can indicate when further training is not resulting in better generalization. The basis of some techniques is either (1) to explicitly penalize overly complex models, or (2) to test the model's ability to generalize by evaluating its performance on a set of data not used for training, which is assumed to approximate the typical unseen data that a model will encounter.

Stoke-on-Trent ([tpl]Audio|en-uk-StokeOnTrent.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl]; often abbreviated to Stoke), also called the Potteries, is a city in Staffordshire, England, which forms a linear conurbation stretching for 12 miles (19 km), with an area of [tpl]convert|36|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl]. Together with Newcastle-under-Lyme and Kidsgrove, Stoke forms the Stoke-on-Trent Built-up Area. With the neighbouring boroughs of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Staffordshire Moorlands, the three form North Staffordshire, which in 2011 had a population of 469,000.
The conurbation continues to be polycentric, having been formed by a federation of six separate towns and numerous villages in the early 20th century. The settlement from which the federated town (it was not a city until 1925) took its name was Stoke-upon-Trent, where the administration and chief mainline railway station were located. After the union, Hanley emerged as the primary commercial centre in the city, despite the efforts of its rival, Burslem. The three other component towns are Tunstall, Longton and Fenton.
Stoke-on-Trent is considered to be the home of the pottery industry in England and is commonly known as the Potteries. Formerly a primarily industrial conurbation, it is now a centre for service industries and distribution centres.

A laboratory ([tpl]IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|b|ɒr|ə|t|ər|i[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|b|ər|ə|t|r|i[/tpl]; informally, lab) is a facility that  provides controlled conditions in which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement may be performed.
Labs used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering. A physics lab might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber, while a metallurgy lab could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength. A chemist or biologist might use a wet laboratory, while a psychologist's lab might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior. In some laboratories, such as those commonly used by computer scientists, computers (sometimes supercomputers) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data collected elsewhere. Scientists in other fields will use still other types of laboratories. Engineers use labs as well to design, test, and build technological devices.
Despite the great differences among laboratories, some features are common. The use of workbenches or countertops at which scientists may choose to either sit or stand is a common way to ensure comfortable working conditions. Cabinets for the storage of laboratory equipment are also found in laboratories. It is traditional for a scientist to record an experiment's progress in a laboratory notebook, but modern labs almost always contain at least one computer workstation for data collection and analysis.
Scientific laboratories can be found in schools and universities, in industry, in government or military facilities, and even aboard ships and spacecraft. A laboratory might offer work space for just one to more than thirty researchers depending on its size and purpose. Recently, a new type of laboratory called Open Laboratory has emerged.[tpl]when|date=September 2013[/tpl] Its format allows the sharing of space, equipment, support staff between different research groups and also fosters information exchange through communications across fields. There is also an open source lab, which is a lab that is made up of open source scientific hardware.

Automation or automatic control, is the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers and heat treating ovens, switching in telephone networks, steering and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications with minimal or reduced human intervention.  Some processes have been completely automated.
The biggest benefit of automation is that it saves labor, however, it is also used to save energy and materials and to improve quality, accuracy and precision.
The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when General Motors established the automation department.[tpl]cite book| author = Rifkin, Jeremy | title = The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era | publisher = Putnam Publishing Group | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-87477-779-8|pages=66, 75[/tpl]  It was during this time that industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.
Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic and computers, usually in combination.  Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes and ships typically use all these combined techniques.

The Sharpless epoxidation reaction is an enantioselective chemical reaction to prepare 2,3-epoxyalcohols from primary and secondary allylic alcohols.[tpl]cite journal|author=Katsuki, T.; Sharpless, K. B. |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|year=1980|volume=102|pages= 5974| doi=10.1021/ja00538a077|title=The first practical method for asymmetric epoxidation|issue=18[/tpl]Hill, J. G.; Sharpless, K. B.; Exon, C. M.; Regenye, R. Org. Syn., Coll. Vol. 7, p. 461 (1990); Vol. 63, p. 66 (1985). (Article)  
The stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide is determined by the diastereomer of the chiral tartrate diester (usually diethyl tartrate or diisopropyl tartrate) employed in the reaction. The oxidizing agent is tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Enantioselectivity is achieved by a catalyst formed from titanium tetra(isopropoxide) and diethyl tartrate. Only 5–10 mol% of the catalyst in the presence of 3Å molecular sieves (3Å MS) is necessary.[tpl]cite journal|author=Gao, Y.; Hanson, R. M.; Klunder, J. M.; Ko, S. Y.; Masamune, H.; Sharpless, K.

The Sharpless epoxidation's success is due to five major reasons. First, epoxides can be easily converted into diols, aminoalcohols or ethers, so formation of chiral epoxides is a very important step in the synthesis of natural products. Second, the Sharpless epoxidation reacts with many primary and secondary allylic alcohols. Third, the products of the Sharpless epoxidation frequently have enantiomeric excesses above 90%. Fourth, the products of the Sharpless epoxidation are predictable using the Sharpless Epoxidation model. Finally, the reactants for the Sharpless epoxidation are commercially available and relatively cheap.[tpl]cite journal|author=Uetikon, C.

Grouping vehicles into platoons is a method of increasing the capacity of roads.

Platoons decrease the distances between cars using electronic, and possibly mechanical, coupling. This capability would allow many cars to accelerate or brake simultaneously.  Instead of waiting after a traffic light changes to green for drivers ahead to react, a synchronized platoon would move as one, allowing up to a fivefold increase in traffic throughput if spacing is diminished that much. This system also allows for a closer headway between vehicles by eliminating reacting distance needed for human reaction.
Platoon capability might require buying new cars, or it may be something that can be retrofitted. Drivers would probably need a special license endorsement on account of the new skills required and the added responsibility when driving in the lead.
Smart cars with artificial intelligence could automatically join and leave platoons. The automated highway system is a proposal for one such system, where cars organise themselves into platoons of eight to twenty-five.

[[Mechanization]]
CATEGORIES: Industry, Agricultural machinery, Armoured warfare

Mechanization or mechanisation (BE) is the process of doing work with machinery.  In an early engineering text a machine is defined as follows:
 “Every machine is constructed for the purpose of performing certain mechanical operations, each of which supposes the existence of two other things besides the machine in question, namely, a moving power, and an object subject to the operation, which may be termed the work to be done.
 Machines, in fact, are interposed between the power and the work, for the purpose of adapting the one to the other.”
In some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools.  In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an un-geared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as gears, pulleys or sheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, usually are considered machines.  After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines.Jerome (1934) gives the industry classification of machine tools as being "other than hand power".  Beginning with the 1900 U.S. census, power use was part of the definition of a factory, distinguishing it from a workshop.

Helliwell|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc|year=2006|isbn=0-486-44572-0[/tpl] Originally published by Stanford University Press, Stanford, California (1965). Frequencies of terrestrial whistlers are 1 kHz to 30 kHz, with a maximum amplitude usually at 3 kHz to 5 kHz.  Although they are electromagnetic waves, they occur at audio frequencies, and can be converted to audio using a suitable receiver. They are produced by lightning strokes (mostly intracloud and return-path) where the impulse travels along the Earth's magnetic field lines from one hemisphere to the other. They undergo dispersion of several kHz due to the slower velocity of the lower frequencies through the plasma environments of the ionosphere and magnetosphere.  Thus they are perceived as a descending tone which can last for a few seconds. The study of whistlers categorizes them into Pure Note, Diffuse, 2-Hop, and Echo Train types.
Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft detected whistler-like activity in the vicinity of Jupiter, implying the presence of lightning there.

Filter design is the process of designing a signal processing filter that satisfies a set of requirements, some of which are contradictory.  The purpose is to find a realization of the filter that meets each of the requirements to a sufficient degree to make it useful.
The filter design process can be described as an optimization problem where each requirement contributes with a term to an error function which should be minimized.  Certain parts of the design process can be automated, but normally an experienced electrical engineer is needed to get a good result.

[[Anselm of Laon]]

CATEGORIES: 11th-century births, 1117 deaths, People from Laon, Christian theologians, Scholastic philosophers

Anselm of Laon (died 1117) was a French theologian and founder of a school of scholars who helped to pioneer biblical hermeneutics.
Remembered in the century after his death as "Anselmus" or "Anselm", his name was more properly "Ansellus" or, in Modern French, "Anseau."
Born of very humble parents at Laon before the middle of the 11th century, he is said to have studied under Saint Anselm at Bec, though this is almost certainly incorrect. Other potential teachers of Anselm have been identified, including Bruno of Cologne and Manegold of Lautenbach. By ca. 1080, he had moved back to his place of birth and was teaching at the cathedral school of Laon, with his brother Ralph. In ca. 1109 he became dean and chancellor of the cathedral, and in 1115 he was one of Laon's two archdeacons. His school for theology and exegesis rapidly became the most famous in Europe. Famously, in 1113 he expelled Peter Abelard from his school.
The Liber Pancrisi (c. 1120) names him, with Ivo of Chartres and William of Champeaux, as one of the three modern masters.

The Hazarajat ([tpl]lang-fa|هزارستان[/tpl], [tpl]lang-haz|هزارستان[/tpl], also referred to as Hazaristan- Some Hazara prefer to call the area Hazaristan, using the more modern “istan” ending.) is a regional name for the territory inhabited by the Hazara people, which lies in the central highlands of Afghanistan, among the Koh-i-Baba mountains and the western extremities of the Hindu Kush. Its physical boundaries are roughly marked by Bamiyan to the north, the headwaters of the Helmand River to the south, Firuzkuh in Ghor to the west, and the Unai Pass to the east. "Hazārajāt denotes an ethnic and religious zone rather than a geographical one—that of Afghanistan's Turko-Mongol Shiʿites."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-i |title=HAZĀRA i.

Hazarajat is primarily made up of Bamyan, Maidan, Ghazni and Daykundi but also include varying parts of Ghor, Oruzgan, Parwan, Samagan, Baghlan, Balkh, Badghis and Sar-i-pul provinces.  The region has also been known as Paropamizan. The name Hazarajat first appears in the 16th century Baburnama, written by Mughal Emperor Babur. When the famous geographer Ibn Battuta arrived to Afghanistan in 1333, he travelled across the country but did not record any place by the name of Hazarajat or Hazara people. It was also not mentioned by previous geographers, historians, adventurers or invaders.

The Indian National Army (INA; Azad Hind Fauj; [tpl]lang-hi|आज़ाद हिन्द फ़ौज[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ur|آزاد ہند فوج[/tpl]) was an armed force formed by Indian nationalists in 1942 in Southeast Asia during World War II. The aim of the army was to secure Indian independence with Japanese assistance. Initially composed of Indian prisoners of war captured by Japan in the Malayan campaign and at Singapore, it later drew volunteers from Indian expatriate population in Malaya and Burma.  The INA was also at the forefront of women's equality and the formation of a women's regiment, the Rani of Jhansi regiment was formed as an all volunteer women's unit to fight the British Raj as well as provide medical services to the INA.
Initially formed in 1942 immediately after the fall of Singapore under Mohan Singh, the first INA collapsed in December that year before it was revived under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose in 1943 and proclaimed the army of Bose's Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind (the Provisional Government of Free India). This second INA fought along with the Imperial Japanese Army against the British and Commonwealth forces in the campaigns in Burma, Imphal and Kohima, and later, against the successful Burma Campaign of the Allies. The end of the war saw a large number of the troops repatriated to India where some faced trial for treason and became a galvanising point of the Indian Independence movement.[tpl]Harvnb|Sarkar|1983|p=420[/tpl]
The legacy of the INA is controversial given its associations with Imperial Japan, the course of Japanese occupations in Burma, Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia, its alliance with the Axis in Europe, as well as Japanese war crimes and the alleged complicity of the troops of the INA in these. However, after the war, the Red Fort trials of captured INA officers in India provoked massive public outcries in support of their efforts to fight for Indian independence against the Raj, eventually triggering the Bombay mutiny in the British Indian forces.[tpl]Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=496,498,499[/tpl] These events in the twilight of the Raj are accepted by historians to have played a crucial role in its relatively rapid end.[tpl]Harvnb|Chaudhuri|1953|p=349[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Sarkar|1983|p=411[/tpl]

[[Appeal to tradition]]

CATEGORIES: Conservatism, Genetic fallacies, Traditions

Appeal to tradition (also known as argumentum ad antiquitatem,Logical Fallacies and the Art of Debate appeal to antiquity, or appeal to common practice) is a common fallacy in which a thesis is deemed correct on the basis that it correlates with some past or present tradition. The appeal takes the form of "this is right because we've always done it this way."Trufant 1917.
An appeal to tradition essentially makes two assumptions that are not necessarily true:
The opposite of an appeal to tradition is an appeal to novelty, claiming something is good because it is new.

[[Single malt Scotch]]

CATEGORIES: Scottish malt whisky

Single Malt Scotch is single malt whisky made in Scotland using a pot still distillation process at a single distillery, with malted barley as the only grain ingredient. As with any Scotch whisky, a single malt Scotch must be distilled in Scotland and matured in oak casks in Scotland for at least three years (most single malts are matured longer).
Until the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 (SWR 2009), the word "blended" only appeared (in the context of Scotch whisky) on bottles of whisky that contained a mixture of both barley and non-barley grain whisky, but this is no longer the case. Under the terminology established by the SWR 2009, a "blended malt Scotch whisky" is a mixture of single malt Scotch whiskies, not a mixture of malted barley whisky and non-barley whisky; those are called "blended Scotch whisky", without the word "malt". The term "blended malt" replaced "vatted malt" used under the prior labelling conventions.
The age statement on a bottle of single malt Scotch is the number of years the whisky spent maturing in cask.  As very few whiskies are bottled from a single cask  the age statement reflects the age of the youngest malt in the mix.

This version of the Holy Bible is significant because, for the very first time, a mechanically printed, mass-produced Bible was made available directly to the general public which came with a variety of scriptural study guides and aids (collectively called an apparatus), which included verse citations which allow the reader to cross-reference one verse with numerous relevant verses in the rest of the Bible, introductions to each book of the Bible which acted to summarize all of the material that each book would cover, maps, tables, woodcut illustrations, indexes, as well as other included features — all of which would eventually lead to the reputation of the Geneva Bible as history's very first study Bible.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]

[[Bead stringing]]

CATEGORIES: Beadwork

Bead stringing is the putting of beads on string.
It can range from simply sliding a single bead onto any thread-like medium (string, silk thread, leather thong, thin wire, multi-stranded beading wire, or a soft, flexible wire) to complex creations that have multiple strands or interwoven levels.  The choice of stringing medium can be an important point in the overall design, since string-type mediums might be subject to unwanted stretching if the weight of the beads is considerable.  Similarly, certain bead types with sharp edges, such as hollow metal beads or some varieties of stone or glass, might abrade string and cause the strand to eventually break.
The simplest design would be a single bead centered as a focal point on the string medium.  The ends of the string could be simply knotted together or components of a clasp might be attached to each end.  
Next in complexity would be stringing multiple beads onto a single strand.  Here alone are numerous opportunities for adding elements to the design concept.  All the beads might be identical.  The beads might be varied (in shape, color, type or any combination thereof) and used either in a random assortment or in a deliberate repeating pattern.  Items not strictly defined as beads, such as pendants or "drops", might be placed within the strand to serve as focal points or accent elements in the design.
Knotting is a next level of proficiency in creating strands.  Here the stringing medium (traditionally silk thread or another similar, synthetic medium) has knots tied into it as a means of separating the individual beads from each other.  The traditional strand of pearls is a well-known example of this technique.  Pearls are threaded onto silk, and a knot is tied between each one to not only space them for greater individual prominence but to also keep them from rubbing directly against each other and risking the abrasion of the nacre that gives them their luster.  This classic design can be varied by adding or using other varieties of beads or varying the number and placement of knots used.
Multiple strands can be created using either the simple stringing or the knotting technique.  Here, depending on the overall design, more planning may be called for.  If the bead pattern is random, the only concern would generally be that one strand be sized shorter than the next, so they will all lay flat and not interfere with each other when worn or displayed.  However, if a specific repeating pattern is planned, then careful planning will be required so that the placement of matching portions of the pattern between the strands are aligned properly.  A beading board, generally a flat panel with measured curved indentations in several staggered lengths, is a useful tool for spacing the beads to work out the desired pattern.  Once the design has been worked out, joining the strands together might require special multiple-strand clasp fixtures unless there is a single knotting point or specific design element that will accommodate it.
There is another way of using smallest size of beads which is naïve and locally it is merely called “Motikaari” (Urdu word for beadwork). It is a medium for artistic expression i.e. calligraphy, portraiture etc. by arranging patterns of smallest size of beads of different textures and hues in the length of adjoined strings.
“Motikaari” is a craft as well as an art. The method of making a pattern involves three stages.
The first stage in this art form is to prepare a desired pattern on paper. Then it is pasted on a flat panel hardboard sheet. Preparation of hardboard sheet is the second important stage of the work. In the third stage, the beads of different colors are strung together according to the sketched pattern with the help of needle and thread in the form of independent but parallel columns of strings. (This method discovered by Motikaar'' Malik Nisar Ahmed of Pakistan is the simplest and easiest so far. Malik Nisar Ahmed claimed to be the creator of this form of bead stringing as he made countless items of Motikaari compared to anybody else in the world. He is the member of Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA). upcoming )
''thumb|Describing Motikaari
Finally, after the consummation of the artistic pattern, it is removed from the hardboard so that it can be displayed in the shape of hanging strings of beads. You may have seen curtain hanging on an opening made of beads and likewise material as a decoration. Imagine the described form on a small scale.
Among the types of wire used for bead stringing, tiger tail wire is the most common.[tpl]Cite book|page=498|title=The Michaels Book of Arts & Crafts|author=Dawn Cusick|author2=Megan Kirb|publisher=Sterling Publishing|year=2003|isbn=1579905307[/tpl]

[[Analog sampled filter]]

CATEGORIES: Linear filters, Electronic circuits

An analog sampled filter an electronic filter that is a hybrid between an analog and a digital filter. The input signal is analog, and usually stored in capacitors. The time domain is discrete, however. Distinct analog samples are shifted through an array of holding capacitors as in a bucket brigade. Analog adders and amplifiers do the arithmetic in the signal domain, just as in an analog computer.
Note that these filters are subject to aliasing phenomena just like a digital filter, and anti-aliasing filters will usually be required. See: Filter design
Companies such as Linear Technology and Maxim produce integrated circuits that implement this functionality. Filters up to the 8th order may be implemented using a single chip. Some are fully configurable; some are pre-configured, usually as low-pass filters.
Due to the high filter order that can be achieved in an easy and stable manner, single chip analog sampled filters are often used for implementing anti-aliasing filters for digital filters. The analog sampled filter will in its turn need yet another anti-aliasing filter, but this can often be implemented as a simple 1st order low-pass analog filter consisting of one series resistor and one capacitor to ground.

An oscilloscope is a tool commonly used to visualize real-world signals in the time domain.  A time-domain graph shows how a signal changes with time, whereas a frequency-domain graph shows how much of the signal lies within each given frequency band over a range of frequencies.

[tpl]nihongo|SoulCalibur|ソウルキャリバー|SōruKyaribā[/tpl] is a weapon-based 3D fighting game developed by Project Soul and produced by Namco. It is the second game in the Soul series, preceded by Soul Edge (1996). Originally released in arcades in 1998, it ran on the Namco System 12 hardware. In 1999 it was ported to the Dreamcast with improved graphics and new features. The North American version was released in September 1999 as a launch title for the Dreamcast and was part of the successful launch of the new console. It became available as a downloadable title on Xbox 360's Xbox Live Marketplace in 2008.
Developed closely with Namco's Tekken development team, it is one of few home console ports that outdid their arcade parent graphics-wise. The title brought many innovations to the fighting game genre that include a heavy emphasis on weapons and a unique eight-way movement system. Soulcalibur is widely regarded as one of the best Dreamcast titles and is one of the most critically acclaimed fighting games of all time.

The M1 carbine (formally the United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1) is a lightweight, easy-to-use semi-automatic carbine that became a standard firearm for the U.S. military during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was produced in several variants. It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian firearm.
In selective-fire versions capable of fully automatic firing, the carbine is designated the M2 carbine. The M3 carbine was an M2 with an active infrared scope system. Unlike conventional carbines, which are generally a version of a parent rifle with a shorter barrel (like the earlier .30-40 U.S. Krag rifle and carbine and the later M16 rifle and M4 carbine), the M1 carbine has only one minor part in common with the M1 rifle, a short buttplate screw, and fires a different cartridge.

[[Simon Says]]

CATEGORIES: Children's games

Simon Says (or Simple Simon Says) is a child's game for 3 or more players where 1 player takes the role of "Simon" and issues instructions (usually physical actions such as "jump in the air" or "stick out your tongue") to the other players, which should only be followed if prefaced with the phrase "Simon says", for example, "Simon says, jump in the air".  Players are eliminated from the game by either following instructions that are not immediately preceded by the phrase, or by failing to follow an instruction which does include the phrase "Simon says". It is the ability to distinguish between valid and invalid commands, rather than physical ability, that usually matters in the game; in most cases, the action just needs to be attempted.
The object for the player acting as Simon is to get all the other players out as quickly as possible; the winner of the game is usually the last player who has successfully followed all of the given commands.  Occasionally however, 2 or more of the last players may all be eliminated by following a command without "Simon Says", thus resulting in Simon winning the game.
The game is well embedded in popular culture, with numerous references in films, music and literature.

[[Fin de siècle]]
CATEGORIES: Fin de siècle, French words and phrases, Literary modernism

Fin de siècle ([tpl]IPA-fr|fɛ̃ də sjɛkl[/tpl]) is French for end of the century. The term typically encompasses not only the meaning of the similar English idiom turn of the century, but also both the closing and onset of an era, as the end of the 19th century was felt to be a period of degeneration, but at the same time a period of hope for a new beginning.Schaffer, Talia. Literature and Culture at the Fin de Siècle. New York: Longman, 2007. 3. The "spirit" of fin de siècle often refers to the cultural hallmarks that were recognized as prominent in the 1880s and 1890s, including 'ennui', 'cynicism', 'pessimism', and "...a widespread belief that civilization leads to decadence."Meštrović, Stjepan G.  The Coming Fin de Siecle: An Application of Durkheim's Sociology to modernity and postmodernism. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge (1992 1991: 2). Pireddu, Nicoletta. "Primitive marks of modernity: cultural reconfigurations in the Franco-Italian fin de siècle,” _Romanic Review_, 97 (3-4), 2006: 371-400.
The term "fin de siècle" is commonly applied to French art and artists as the traits of the culture first appeared there, but the movement affected many European countries.McGuinness, Patrick (Ed.)Symbolism, Decadence and the Fin de Siècle: French and European Perspectives. Exeter: University Press, 2000: 9. Pireddu, Nicoletta.  Antropologi alla corte della bellezza. Decadenza ed economia simbolica nell'Europa fin de siècle. Verona: Fiorini, 2002. The term becomes applicable to the sentiments and traits associated with the culture as opposed to focusing solely on the movement’s initial recognition in France. The ideas and concerns developed by fin de siècle artists provided the impetus for movements like symbolism and modernism.Has-Ellison, J.Trygve. Nobles, Modernism, and the Culture of fin-de-siècle Munich. German History 26(1), 2008:1-23, 2.
The themes of fin de siècle political culture were very controversial and have been cited as a major influence on fascism.Sternhell, Zeev. "Crisis of Fin-de-siècle Thought." International Fascism: Theories, Causes and the New Consensus. London and New York (1998): 169.Payne, Stanley G. A history of fascism, 1914-1945. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, (1995, 2005): 23-24. The major political theme of the era was that of revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society and liberal democracy.Sternhell, Zeev. "Crisis of Fin-de-siècle Thought." International Fascism: Theories, Causes and the New Consensus. London and New York (1998): 169. The fin-de-siècle generation supported emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism and vitalism,A history of fascism, 1914-1945. while the mindset of the age saw civilization as being in a crisis that required a massive and total solution.Sternhell, Zeev. "Crisis of Fin-de-siècle Thought." International Fascism: Theories, Causes and the New Consensus. London and New York (1998): 169.
Fin de siècle culture has been perceived to have influenced 20th century culture, such as Bohemian counterculture having similarities to punk counterculture in that both celebrate a romantic and willful sense of decay and rejection of social order.Ensminger, David A.

Koxinga or Coxinga (a westernization of [tpl]zh|t=國姓爺|s=国姓爷|hp=Guóxìngye|l=Lord of the Imperial Surname[/tpl]; August 1624 – 23 June 1662) or Zheng Chenggong was a Chinese military leader who was born in Hirado, Japan to the Chinese merchant/pirate Zheng Zhilong and his Japanese wife, and died on Taiwan.
A Ming loyalist and the chief commander of the Ming troops on the maritime front for the later emperors of the withering dynasty, Koxinga devoted the last 16 years of his life to resisting the conquest of China by the Manchus.  Upon defeating the forces of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) on Taiwan in his last campaign in 1661–1662, Koxinga took over the island in order to support his grand campaign against the Manchu-ruled Qing dynasty.  After Koxinga's death, his son and successor, Zheng Jing, gradually became the ruler of an independent Kingdom of Tungning, the first Chinese state to rule the island.

Trinitron was Sony's brand name for its line of aperture grille based CRTs used in television sets and computer display monitors. One of the first truly new television systems to enter the market since the 1950s, the Trinitron was announced in 1968 to wide acclaim for its bright images, about 25% brighter than common shadow mask televisions of the same era. Constant improvement in the basic technology and attention to overall quality allowed Sony to charge a premium for Trinitron devices into the 1990s.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Patent protection on the basic Trinitron design ran out in 1996, and it quickly faced a number of competitors at much lower prices. Sony responded by introducing their flat-screen FD Trinitron designs (WEGA), which maintained their premier position in the market into the early 2000s. However, these designs were surpassed relatively quickly by plasma and LCD designs. Sony removed the last Trinitron televisions from their product catalogs in 2006, and ceased production in early 2008. Video monitors are the only remaining Trinitron products being produced by Sony, at a low production rate, although the basic technology can still be found in downmarket televisions from third parties.
The name Trinitron was derived from trinity, meaning the union of three, and tron from electron tube, after the way that the Trinitron combined the three separate electron guns of other CRT designs into one."You Guys Can Do It!" - Sony Global - Sony History

Egon Zakrajšek (July 7, 1941 – September 2002) was a Slovene mathematician and computer scientist.
Zakrajšek was born in Ljubljana, SFR Yugoslavia (today Slovenia). He became an orphan even before he started to attend school. He went to elementary school and gymnasium in Jesenice. He was a good student and he showed his talent and abilities very early. He graduated from technical mathematics at the Department of mathematics and physics of then Faculty for natural sciences and technology (FNT) of the University of Ljubljana. He received his Master's degree at the University of Zagreb with a work Numerična realizacija Ritzovega procesa (Numerical realization of the Ritz process) and his doctorate in 1978 in Ljubljana with a dissertation O invariantni vložitvi pri reševanju diferencialnih enačb (About the invariable embedding in solving of differential equations).
Professor Zakrajšek was one of the pioneers of computer science in Slovenia. He became an expert about the first computers of the University of Ljubljana, the Zuse Z-23 and its successor the IBM 1130. Later on he participated in the development of programming languages, tools and operating systems. He wrote textbooks and manuals for them simultaneously: for Z-23 assembler, Algol, Fortran, Algol 68, Pascal, for domestic structran. In 1982 he set off for United States and he became the manager of the programming equipment at the firm Cromemco. In 1994 he returned to homeland, where he occupied professorship again. With his advocacies about the C and open operating systems, that is, Unix and Linux, he helped to modernize the lessons of computer science. He became an expert again for TeX, LaTeX and MATLAB.
Beside his computer science skills he was also an excellent mathematician with a broad profile. He taught and solved problems from many fields: the usage of mathematics in natural and social sciences, statistics, mechanics, classical applied mathematics, discrete mathematics, graph and network theory, linear programming, operational researches, numerical analysis.

CATEGORIES: Film formats, ISO standards, Eastman Kodak photographic films

135 is photographic film in a film format used for still photography. It is a cartridge film with a film gauge of 35 mm, typically used for hand-held photography in 35 mm film cameras.
The term 135 (ISO 1007) was introduced by Kodak in 1934[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brownie-camera.com/film.shtml |title=The History of Kodak Roll Films |accessdate=February 8, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090222042720/http://brownie-camera.com/film.shtml| archivedate= February 22, 2009 [/tpl] as a designation for the cassette for 35 mm film, specifically for still photography. It quickly grew in popularity, surpassing 120 film by the late 1960s to become the most popular photographic film size. Despite competition from formats such as 828, 126, 110, and APS, it remains so today.
135 camera film always comes perforated with Kodak Standard perforations.
The size of the 135 film frame has been adopted by many high-end digital single-lens reflex cameras, referred to as full-frame digital SLRs.

Axis & Allies is a popular series of World War II strategy board games, with nearly two million copies printed. Originally designed by Larry Harris and published by Nova Game Designs in 1981,[tpl]cite journal|title=25 Years of Axis & Allies|last=Whitehall| first=Bruce| journal= Knucklebones|date=March 2008|volume=3|issue=2| pages=22–24| publisher=Jones Publishing[/tpl] the game was republished by the Milton Bradley Company in 1984 as part of the Gamemaster Series of board games. This edition would be retroactively named Axis & Allies: Classic to differentiate it from later revisions. In 1996, Axis & Allies: Classic was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1995/list-of-winners| title=Origins Award Winners (1995)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=2007-11-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080102044110/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1995/list-of-winners  |archivedate = 2008-01-02[/tpl] Games magazine also has inducted Axis & Allies into their buyers' guide Hall of Fame.,GAMES Magazine Hall of Fame. Retrieved 2010-07-26 an honor the magazine extends to "games that have met or exceeded the highest standards of quality and play value and have been continuously in production for at least 10 years; i.e., classics."
Axis & Allies: Classic was the most successful of the five Gamemaster Series of board games. Long after the Gamemaster name was retired, A&A: Classic lives on having been moved to the Avalon Hill lineup following the acquisition of Milton Bradley Company and Avalon Hill by Hasbro. The game itself has gone through several revisions, most recently in 2013. The object of the game and its spinoffs, is to win the war by capturing enough critical territories to gain the advantage over the enemy in a recreation of World War II.
After acquiring Milton Bradley (1984) and Avalon Hill (1998), Hasbro transferred the Axis & Allies: Classic (1984) board game from the Milton Bradley division to the Avalon Hill division in 1999. In 1999, Hasbro acquired Wizards of the Coast. In 2004, Hasbro made Avalon Hill a subsidiary of Wizards of the Coast (WotC).
The Axis & Allies (1984–present) board game series is currently produced by WotC under the Avalon Hill label. Hasbro is the parent company. There are a total of 11 board games in the Axis & Allies series, 8 of which are currently available from many game resellers. The two out-of-print A&A board games, Axis & Allies: Classic (1984) and Axis & Allies: 50th Anniversary Edition (2008) can be found on various auction websites.
The original Axis & Allies: Classic board game has been followed by ten spinoff games using more or less the same mechanics: in 1999, Axis & Allies: Europe was released, with slightly updated rules and focus on the European theater of World War II; this was followed in 2001 by Axis & Allies: Pacific with similar rules and focus shifted to the Pacific theater. Axis & Allies: D-Day (2004) focused on the Allied liberation of France. In 2004, the first major revision to the core game, Axis & Allies: Revised was released, with elements taken from A&A: Europe and A&A: Pacific, also celebrating the 20th anniversary of Axis & Allies itself. Axis & Allies: Battle of the Bulge (2006) focused on the Battle of the Bulge in Europe while Axis & Allies: Guadalcanal (2007) focused on the Solomon Islands Campaign in the Pacific. In 2008, Axis & Allies: 50th Anniversary Edition was released as one of the three games celebrating the 50th anniversary of its publisher, Avalon Hill (the other two games were Acquire and Diplomacy). This was followed by Axis & Allies: 1942 in 2009, the second major revision to the core game, with mechanics taken from the anniversary edition, also celebrating the 25th anniversary of Axis & Allies itself. Axis & Allies: Pacific 1940 was released in December 2009 and Axis & Allies: Europe 1940 was released in the second half of 2010.
The 11th A&A board game in the series, Axis & Allies: Europe 1940 was released in August, 2010. The game can be combined with Pacific 1940 to form a Global game of World War II on a combined 175x80 cm (70" x 32") map. All nine major powers of World War II, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and the ANZAC forces, are represented in the combined global game with unique units and colors. To streamline the game and correct balance issues, Global 1940 was revised and a new rule set was released on the Axis & Allies forums in January 2011.
Axis & Allies is not a strict historical wargame, due to its streamlining for ease of play and balancing so that both sides have a chance to win. For instance, the economic model is simplistic, with each territory producing a number of Industrial Production Certificates (IPCs) for the purchase of new units. Moreover, the game is supposed to start in the spring of 1942, but Japan is immediately in position to attack Hawaii again, while Germany is pressed well into the Soviet Union with an initially superior force. If the game were truer to history, the Axis empires would be at their climax in 1942, about to be pushed back by the Allies.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is an American live action children's television series that premiered on August 28, 1993, on the Fox Kids weekday afternoon block. The show is about a group of teenagers who were chosen to protect the world from a group of alien invaders and were given the ability to "morph" into super-powered warriors and to pilot giant robots called "Zords." It was adapted and used stock footage from the Japanese television show Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger, which was the 16th installment of Bandai Visual and Toei Company's Super Sentai franchise.[tpl]cite news|title= Pop culture: For two decades, Toei Studios of Japan has churned out versions of those ubiquitous Power Rangers-- and as long there are kids, they'll keep right on going.|work= Los Angeles Times|date=1995-03-09|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-09/news/ls-40804_1_power-ranger|accessdate=2010-08-22 | first=Teresa | last=Watanabe[/tpl] Both the show and its related merchandise saw unbridled overnight success, becoming a staple of 1990s pop culture in mere months.[tpl]cite news|title= Mighty Raters|work=Time|date=1993-12-06|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979778,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03 | first=Ginia | last=Bellafante[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Ninja Turtles, Eat Our Dust|work=Newsweek|date=|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/115680|accessdate=2010-03-03[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= With Power Rangers Scarce, A Frenzied Search by Parents|work= The New York Times|date=1994-12-05|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/us/with-power-rangers-scarce-a-frenzied-search-by-parents.html?scp=6&sq=Mighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers&st=cse&pagewanted=2|accessdate=2010-08-07 | first=Glenn | last=Collins[/tpl] Under the original name, "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," the series ran from 1993 to 1995 and spawned the feature film Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.[tpl]cite news|title= FILM REVIEW; For Power Rangers, Bikinis Are Not The Issue|work= The New York Times|date=1995-06-30|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/30/movies/film-review-for-power-rangers-bikinis-are-not-the-issue.html?scp=2&sq=Mighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08 | first=Caryn | last=James[/tpl]
The second and third seasons of the show drew on footage and elements from the Super Sentai series Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger respectively, though the Zyuranger costumes were still used for the lead cast. Only the mecha and the Kiba Ranger costume (worn by the White Ranger) were retained from Dairanger for the second season, while only the mecha from Kakuranger were featured in the third season. However the Kakuranger costumes were later used for the title characters of the mini-series, Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers. The series was produced by MMPR Productions, distributed by Saban Entertainment, and aired on Fox Kids. The show's merchandise was produced and distributed by Bandai Entertainment.
In 1996, the series was rebranded as the Power Rangers franchise, renaming the series every year after, and using costumes, props, and footage from subsequent Super Sentai series, as well as changing the cast and story line. While an overarching story line would continue until Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, subsequent series after MMPR are not sequels or spin-offs in the traditional sense.
In 2010, a re-version of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, with a new logo, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative special effects, was broadcast on ABC Kids, and Bandai produced brand new toys to coincide with the series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20091001006376&newsLang=en|title=Correcting and replacing photos Bandai America Powers up Like It’s 1993; Brings Back Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in New Toy Line|accessdate=2009-10-01|date=2009-10-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bandai.com/blog/press-release/mighty-morphin|title=Press release: Bandai America Powers Up Like It’s 1993; Brings Back Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in New Toy Line [tpl]![/tpl] Bandai America|date=2009-10-01|accessdate=2009-10-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/mighty-morphin-power-rangers/tv-listings/203104|title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: TV Listings|work=TV Guide|accessdate=20 December 2009[/tpl]

[[Open patent]]

CATEGORIES: Intellectual property law, Copyleft, Free culture

The open patent movement seeks to build a portfolio of patented inventions that can freely be distributed under a copyleft-like license.Open Patent license proposal at openpatents.org  These works could be used as is, or improved, in which case the patent improvement would have to be re-licensed to the institution that holds the original patent, and from which the original work was licensed.  This frees all users who have accepted the license from the threat of lawsuits for patent infringement, in exchange for their surrendering the right to build up new patents of their own (in the specific domain for which the original license applies).[tpl]cn|date=November 2011[/tpl]
The open patent idea is designed to be practiced by consortia of research-oriented companiesCambia Biosciences Initiative and increasingly by standards bodies.  These also commonly use open trademark methods to ensure some compliance with a suite of compatibility tests, e.g. Java, X/Open both of which forbid use of the mark by the non-compliant.[tpl]cn|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Critics[tpl]unspecific|date=November 2011[/tpl] question whether the promoters of truly 'open' and mandatory improvement licensing, having spent most of their lives opposed to software patents, can actually attract donors of patents, or would actually participate in a process that they claim to despise.  This criticism probably focuses unduly on the personality and ideology of Richard Stallman, who has nonetheless sought to solicit donors for such schemes.   
On October 12, 2001 the Free Software Foundation and Finite State Machine Labs Inc.

The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a dwarf galaxy. It is classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy. It has a diameter of about 7,000 light-years"Magellanic Cloud." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 30 Aug. 2009 . and contains several hundred million stars.APOD: 2005 June 17 - The Small Cloud of Magellan It has a total mass of approximately 7 billion times the mass of the Sun.NASA ADS - The total mass and dark halo properties of the Small Magellanic Cloud
Some speculate that the SMC was once a barred spiral galaxy that was disrupted by the Milky Way to become somewhat irregular.[ref]
</ref> It contains a central bar structure.
At a distance of about 200,000 light-years, it is one of the Milky Way's nearest neighbors. It is also one of the most distant objects that can be seen with the naked eye.
With a mean declination of approximately −73 degrees, it can only be viewed from the Southern Hemisphere and the lower latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. It is located in the constellation of Tucana and appears as a hazy, light patch in the night sky about 3 degrees across. It looks like a detached piece of the Milky Way. Since it has a very low surface brightness, it is best viewed from a dark site away from city lights.
It forms a pair with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which lies a further 20 degrees to the east. The Small Magellanic Cloud is a member of the Local Group.

We're Only in It for the Money is the third studio album by The Mothers of Invention. Released on March 4, 1968 on Verve Records, it was subsequently remixed and re-recorded by Frank Zappa and reissued independently by Rykodisc Records in 1986.
As with the band's previous two albums, We're Only in It for the Money is a concept album, and satirizes left and right-wing politics, particularly the hippie subculture, as well as The Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was conceived as part of a project called No Commercial Potential, which produced three other albums: Lumpy Gravy, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets and Uncle Meat.
We're Only in It for the Money encompasses rock, orchestral and experimental music, with its orchestral segments deriving from the recording sessions for Lumpy Gravy, which was previously issued as a solo instrumental album by Capitol Records and was subsequently reedited by Zappa and released by Verve; the reedited Lumpy Gravy was produced simultaneously with We're Only in It for the Money and is the first part of a conceptual continuity, continued with the reedited Lumpy Gravy and concluded with Zappa's final album, Civilization Phaze III (1994).

Just War theory (jus bellum iustum) is a doctrine, also referred to as a tradition, of military ethics studied by theologians, ethicists, policy makers and military leaders. The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure war is morally justifiable through a series of criteria, all of which must be met for a war to be considered just. The criteria are split into two groups: ‘the right to go to war’ (jus ad bellum) and ‘right conduct in war’ (jus in bello). The first concerns the morality of going to war and the second with moral conduct within war.[tpl]cite book |last1=Guthrie |first1=Charles |last2=Quinlan |first2=Michael |date=26 Sep 2007 |title=Just War: The Just War Tradition: Ethics in Modern Warfare  |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing PLC |isbn=978-0747595571 |pages=11–15 |chapter=III: The Structure of the Tradition [/tpl]  Recently there have been calls for the inclusion of a third category of just war theory - jus post bellum - dealing with the morality of post-war settlement and reconstruction.

A road verge, (also verge, boulevard, city grass, devil's strip, nature strip,  parking strip, planting strip, sidewalk buffer, tree belt, tree lawn, utility strip, parkway,  etc.) is a narrow strip of grass or plants and sometimes also trees located between the carriageway (roadway) curb (or road surface edge or shoulder) and the boundary (right-of-way line) of a road.
The land is often public property with maintenance usually being a municipal responsibility; however some municipal authorities require that abutting property owners maintain these areas and also the footpath / sidewalks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/sidewalk2/sidewalks210.htm|publisher=Federal Highways Administration|title=Designing Sidewalks and Trails for Access, Part II Section 10.1.3: Maintenance responsibilities|accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl]
Benefits include visual aesthetics, increased safety and comfort of sidewalk users, protection from spray from passing vehicles, and a space for benches, bus shelters, street lights and other public amenities. It is also often part of sustainability for water conservation or the management of urban runoff and water pollution[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rainwatercollecting.com/blog/?p=448|title=Passive Rainwater Harvesting|accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Departments/OSE/Categories/Landscape/PLP%2005.27.09.pdf|title=Parkway Landscaping Policy|accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enewsbuilder.net/watercon/e_article000771115.cfm?x=bbrDcbK,b2FRwTrq,w|title=Pruning the Parkway Strip |accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl] and may provide useful wildlife habitat. Snow that has been ploughed off the street in colder climates may be stored in the area.
The main disadvantage of the road verge is that the right-of-way must be wider, increasing the cost of the road. In some localities a wider verge offers opportunity for later road widening, should the traffic usage of a road demand this. For this reason the footpaths are sited a significant distance from the curb.

[[Gambit]]

CATEGORIES: Chess openings, Chess terminology

A gambit (from ancient Italian gambetto, meaning tripping) is a chess opening in which a player, more often White, sacrifices material, usually a pawn, with the hope of achieving a resulting advantageous position.Edward R. Brace, An Illustrated Dictionary of Chess, Hamlyn, 1979, p. 114. ISBN 0-600-32920-8. Some well-known examples are the King's Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.f4), Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4), and Evans Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4). A gambit used by Black may also be called a gambit (e.g. the Latvian Gambit—1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5 or Englund Gambit—1.d4 e5), but is sometimes called a "countergambit" (e.g. the Albin Countergambit—1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5 and Greco Counter-Gambit, an old-fashioned name for the Latvian Gambit).
The word "gambit" was originally applied to chess openings in 1561 by Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura, from an Italian expression dare il gambetto (to put a leg forward in order to trip someone). Lopez studied this maneuver, and so the Italian word gained the Spanish form gámbito that led to French gambit, which has influenced the English spelling of the word. The broader sense of "opening move meant to gain advantage" was first recorded in English in 1855.[tpl]cn|date=May 2014[/tpl]

[[Delaunay-Belleville]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of France

Automobiles Delaunay-Belleville was a French luxury automobile manufacturer at Saint-Denis, France, north of Paris. At the beginning of the 20th century they were among the most prestigious cars produced in the world, and perhaps the most desirable French marque.
Julien Belleville had been a maker of marine boilers from around 1850. Louis Delaunay joined the firm in 1867 and married Delaunay's daughter, changing his name to Delaunay-Belleville and succeeded Belleville in charge of the company.[ref]
</ref> 
S.A. des Automobiles Delaunay-Belleville was formed in 1903 by Louis Delaunay and Marius Barbarou. Barbarou's family owned the boiler making company St. Denis in Belleville, with boiler design influences inspired by the company. Barbarou, then 28,Wise, David Burgess. "Delaunay-Belleville: The Car Magnificent", in Ward, Ian, executive editor. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.525. had experience working for Clément, Lorraine-Dietrich and Benz and was responsible for design and styling, including the trademark round grille shell.Wise, p.525 caption. The first car was exhibited at the 1904 Paris Salon, and it received enormous acclaim.Wise, p.525.
The company started with three models, all fours:Wise, p.525 and p.526. a live axled [tpl]convert|16|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] and a [tpl]convert|24|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|40|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] model, both chain-driven.Wise, p.525 and 526. These were likely the first automobiles to have pressure-lubricated camshafts.Wise, p.526. The bodies were attached with just four bolts, and the brakes were water-cooled, from a [tpl]convert|2|impgal|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl] reservoir.
Delaunay-Belleville were a prestige marque, and one of the world's leaders, from the outset, and by 1906, Tsar Nicholas II. had purchased a 40. Other royal owners included King George I of Greece and King Alphonso XIII of Spain. 
The first French car maker to offer a six-cylinder engine, Delaunay-Belleville's [tpl]convert|70|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] became available only in 1909, and then only in small numbers, remaining in limited production until 1912. This model came to be known as the Type SMT, or Sa Majesté le Tsar, because Nicholas purchased one of the last 70s built. He also ordered another in 1909; the demand for a silent starter, operable from the driving seat, became known as a Barbey starter, and was made standard at the end of 1910.
Like most prestige marques, the cars were sold as bare chassis and bodies were coachbuilt for them. Between 1906 and 1914, British imports were mainly bodied by Shinnie Brothers, a Burlington subsidiary, in Aberdeen, then shipped to London for sale.
Postwar, Continental bodies gained popularity, at least in Britain, as Belgium's D'Ieteren Fréres became most associated with the company: their landaulette, on a [tpl]convert|26|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] chassis, was priced in Britain at ₤900, between Napier and Rolls-Royce.
After Barbarou resigned, Delaunay-Belleville quality began to slip. In 1919, the company offered a [tpl]convert|10|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] four-cylinder, undoubtedly the most expensive voiturette on the market, as well as a [tpl]convert|15.9|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] four, the P4B, in 1922.
French anarchist gangster Jules Bonnot used a Delaunay-Belleville for his first hold-up.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
New four-cylinder overhead valve 14/40 and 16/60 models appeared in 1926, and the prewar [tpl]convert|20|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|10|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] six-cylinder models continued to be produced until 1927. The last gasps were the [tpl]convert|3180|cc|cid|abbr=on[/tpl] [tpl]convert|21|hp|kW PS|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] six of 1928 and the [tpl]convert|3619|cc|cid|abbr=on[/tpl] 21/75 OHV six of 1930. In 1931, Continental engines, imported from the U.S., were offered, being quieter and cheaper. 
By the late 1920s, Delaunay-Belleville had lost its prestige, and converted to truck and military vehicle production. In 1936 the previously separate car company was merged with the Delaunay Belleville parent.  Production of the Delaunay-Belleville RI-6 continued through the late 1930s and was revived after the Second World War. This was a six-cylinder-engined car strongly resembling the Mercedes-Benz 230, featuring independent suspension all-round; revived postwar, it featured Cotal preselector gearbox and a front grille design apparently copied from the 1939 Buick. However, the business was in decline:  anyone buying a RI-6 in the 1940s would have done so in the knowledge after-sales service might disappear soon.  Six cars were completed in 1947 and this sank to four during the first part of 1948. 
The company continued to advertise new cars for sale until 1950, but the factory was sold to Robert de Rovin in 1948 and thereafter used to make cyclecars.[tpl]cite journal| authorlink = René Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures françaises 1948 (salon Paris oct 1947)| volume = Nr. 7| pages = Page 40|year = 1998|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris [/tpl]

[[Far-infrared astronomy]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical imaging, Observational astronomy

Far-infrared astronomy is the branch of astronomy and astrophysics that deals with objects visible in far-infrared radiation (extending from 30 µm towards submillimeter wavelengths around 450 µm).
In the far-infrared, stars are not especially bright, but we can see emission from very cold matter (140 Kelvins or less) that is not seen at shorter wavelengths.
Huge, cold clouds of gas and dust in our own galaxy, as well as in nearby galaxies, glow in far-infrared light. This is due to thermal radiation of interstellar dust contained in molecular clouds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/outreach/Edu/Regions/irregions.html|title=Near, Mid and Far-Infrared|accessdate=2013-01-28|publisher=Caltech Infrared Processing and Analysis Center[/tpl]
In some of these clouds, new stars are just beginning to form. Far-infrared observations can detect these protostars long before they "turn on" visibly by sensing the heat they radiate as they contract.
The center of our galaxy also shines brightly in the far-infrared: These emissions are from dust in circumstellar shells around numerous old red giant stars. These stars heat up the dust and cause it to glow brightly in the infrared. The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey mapped the galaxy for the first time in the far-infrared.
Except for the plane of our own galaxy, the brightest far-infrared object in the sky is central region of a galaxy called Messier 82. The nucleus of M82 radiates as much energy in the far-infrared as all of the stars in our galaxy combined. This far-infrared energy comes from dust heated by a source that is hidden from view. The central regions of most galaxies shine very brightly in the far-infrared. Many galaxies ("active galaxies") have active nuclei hidden in dense regions of dust. Others, called starburst galaxies, have an extremely high number of newly forming stars heating interstellar dust clouds. These galaxies, far outshine all others galaxies in the far-infrared.
The Earth's atmosphere is opaque over most of the far-infrared, so that ground-based observations are limited to submillimetre wavelengths using high-altitude telescopes such as the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, and the Submillimeter Array. Most far-infrared astronomy is performed by satellites such as the Herschel Space Observatory, Spitzer, IRAS, and ISO. Upper-atmosphere observations are also possible, as conducted by the airborne SOFIA telescope.

[[Ultraviolet astronomy]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical imaging, Observational astronomy, Ultraviolet radiation

Ultraviolet astronomy is generally used to refer to observations of electromagnetic radiation at ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 10 and 320 nanometres; shorter wavelengths—higher energy photons—are studied by X-ray astronomy and gamma ray astronomy.[ref]
</ref>   Light at these wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space.<ref name="cox2000"/>
Ultraviolet line spectrum measurements are used to discern the chemical composition, densities, and temperatures of the interstellar medium, and the temperature and composition of hot young stars.  UV observations can also provide essential information about the evolution of galaxies.
The ultraviolet Universe looks quite different from the familiar stars and galaxies seen in visible light.
Most stars are actually relatively cool objects emitting much of their electromagnetic radiation in the visible or near-infrared part of the spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation is the signature of hotter objects, typically in the early and late stages of their evolution.
If we could see the sky in ultraviolet light, most stars would fade in prominence. We would see some very young massive stars and some very old stars and galaxies, growing hotter and producing higher-energy radiation near their birth or death. Clouds of gas and dust would block our vision in many directions along the Milky Way.
The Hubble Space Telescope and FUSE have been the most recent major space telescopes to view the near and far UV spectrum of the sky, though other UV instruments have flown on sounding rockets and the Space Shuttle.
Charles Stuart Bowyer is generally given credit for starting this field.

The Nissan Skyline GT-R is a Japanese Grand Tourer based on the Nissan Skyline range.
The first GT-Rs were produced from 1969–1973. After a 16 year hiatus since the KPGC110 in 1972, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 with the Skyline R32. This car was nicknamed "Godzilla" by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition. The BNR32 (R32 GT-R) would end up winning 29 straight victories out of 29 races in the Japanese motorsport. The GT-R proceeded to win the JGTC Group A series championship 4 years in a row, and also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship winning from 1990–1992, until a regulation change excluded the GT-R in 1993.
The Skyline GT-R became the flagship of Nissan performance,and showcasing many advanced technologies including the ATTESA E-TS 4WD system and the Super-HICAS four-wheel steering. The GT-Rs remained inexpensive compared to its European rivals, with a list-price of [tpl]JPY|4,500,000[/tpl] ([tpl]USD|31,000[/tpl])[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]. Today, the car is popular for import Drag Racing, Circuit Track, Time Attack and events hosted by tuning magazines. The GT-R is the winner in the 2007 Tsukuba Time Attack held in Japan—the M-Speed GT-R (9 out of the top 15 cars consists of GT-Rs). Production of the Skyline GT-R ended in August 2002. The car was replaced by the Nissan GT-R, an independent vehicle not sold as a Skyline.
The Skyline GT-R was never manufactured outside of Japan, and the sole export markets were Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, in 1991,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.uniquecars.carpoint.com.au/portal/alias203009/ArticleID__5004/DesktopDefault.aspx/ |title=What to know and look out for when buying the unstoppable Nissan Skyline GT-R (R32 - R34) |first=Cliff |last=Chambers |publisher=uniquecars |accessdate=5 March 2012 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] and the UK (in 1997, thanks to the Single Vehicle Approval scheme[tpl]cite news|first=Andrew |last=English |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/carreviews/2749815/Nissan-GT-R-Street-racer.html |title=Nissan GT-R: Street racer |publisher=Telegraph |date= December 1, 2007|accessdate=5 March 2012[/tpl]) as used Japanese imports.

[[Probabilistic method]]

CATEGORIES: Combinatorics, Mathematical proofs, Probabilistic arguments

The probabilistic method is a nonconstructive method, primarily used in combinatorics and pioneered by Paul Erdős, for proving the existence of a prescribed kind of mathematical object. It works by showing that if one randomly chooses objects from a specified class, the probability that the result is of the prescribed kind is more than zero. Although the proof uses probability, the final conclusion is determined for certain, without any possible error.
This method has now been applied to other areas of mathematics such as number theory, linear algebra, and real analysis, as well as in computer science (e.g. randomized rounding), and information theory.

Sir Henry Vane (baptised 26 March 1613 – 14 June 1662), son of Henry Vane the Elder (often referred to as Harry Vane to distinguish him from his father), was an English politician, statesman, and colonial governor.  He was briefly present in North America, serving one term as the Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and supported the creation of Roger Williams' Rhode Island Colony and Harvard College.  A proponent of religious tolerance, he returned to England in 1637 following the Antinomian controversy that led to the banning of Anne Hutchinson from Massachusetts.
He was a leading Parliamentarian during the English Civil War and worked closely with Oliver Cromwell.  He played no part in the execution of King Charles I, and refused to take oaths that expressed approval of the act.  Vane served on the Council of State that functioned as the government executive during the Interregnum, but split with Cromwell over issues of governance and removed himself from power when Cromwell dissolved Parliament in 1653.  He returned to power during the short-lived Commonwealth period in 1659–1660, and was arrested under orders from King Charles II following his restoration to the throne.  After long debate, Vane was exempted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, and was thus denied amnesty granted to most people for their roles in the Civil War and Interregnum.
Although he was formally granted clemency by Charles II, he was charged with high treason by Parliament in 1662.  In a court proceeding in which he was denied counsel and the opportunity to properly prepare a defence, he was convicted by a partisan jury.  Charles withdrew his earlier clemency, and Vane was beheaded on Tower Hill on 14 June 1662.
Vane was recognised by his political peers as a competent administrator and a wily and persuasive negotiator and politician.  His politics was driven by a desire for religious tolerance in an era when governments were used to establish official churches and suppress dissenting views.  Although his views were in a small minority, he was able to successfully build coalitions to advance his agenda.  His actions were often ultimately divisive, and contributed to both the rise and downfall of the English Commonwealth.  His books and pamphlets written on political and religious subjects are still analyzed today, and Vane is remembered in Massachusetts and Rhode Island as an early champion of religious freedom.

Romanization or latinization (or romanisation, latinisation: see spelling differences), in linguistics, is the conversion of writing from a different writing system to the Roman (Latin) script, or a system for doing so. Methods of romanization include transliteration, for representing written text, and transcription, for representing the spoken word, and combinations of both. Transcription methods can be subdivided into phonemic transcription, which records the phonemes or units of semantic meaning in speech, and more strict phonetic transcription, which records speech sounds with precision.

[[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]]

In linear algebra, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem (named after the mathematicians Arthur Cayley and William Rowan Hamilton) states that every square matrix over a commutative ring (such as the real or complex field) satisfies its own characteristic equation.
More precisely,A proof from PlanetMath.The Cayley–Hamilton Theorem at MathPages[tpl]springer|title=Cayley–Hamilton theorem|id=p/c120080[/tpl] if [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl] is a given [tpl]math|n×n[/tpl] matrix and [tpl]math|In [/tpl] is the  [tpl]math|n×n[/tpl] identity matrix, then the  characteristic polynomial of [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl] is defined as
where "det" is the determinant operation. Since the entries of the matrix are (linear or constant) polynomials in [tpl]mvar|λ[/tpl], the determinant is also an [tpl]mvar|n[/tpl]-th order polynomial in [tpl]mvar|λ[/tpl]. 
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that "substituting" the matrix [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl] for [tpl]mvar|λ[/tpl] in this polynomial results in the zero matrix,
The powers of [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl], obtained by substitution from powers of [tpl]mvar|λ[/tpl], are defined by repeated matrix multiplication; the constant term of [tpl]math| p(λ)[/tpl] gives a multiple of the power [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl]0, which power is defined as the identity matrix.
The theorem allows [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl][tpl]mvar|n[/tpl] to be expressed as a linear combination of the lower matrix powers of [tpl]mvar|A[/tpl].
When the ring is a field, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem is equivalent to the statement that the minimal polynomial of a square matrix divides its characteristic polynomial.

Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a plant species in the genus Foeniculum (treated as the sole species in the genus by most botanists).  It is a member of the family Apiaceae (formerly the Umbelliferae). It is a hardy, perennial, umbelliferous herb, with yellow flowers and feathery leaves. It is indigenous to the shores of the Mediterranean but has become widely naturalized in many parts of the world, especially on dry soils near the sea-coast and on riverbanks.
It is a highly aromatic and flavorful herb with culinary and medicinal uses and, along with the similar-tasting anise, is one of the primary ingredients of absinthe.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Florence fennel or finocchio is a selection with a swollen, bulb-like stem base that is used as a vegetable.
Fennel is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the mouse moth and the anise swallowtail.

[[Shortstop]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball positions

Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base. Shortstop is often regarded as the most dynamic defensive position in baseball, because there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters, and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly, so more balls go to the shortstop than any other position. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.

The Playfair cipher or Playfair square is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher.
The technique encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher and rather more complex Vigenère cipher systems then in use. The Playfair is thus significantly harder to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it.  Frequency analysis can still be undertaken, but on the 600No duplicate letters are allowed, and one letter is omitted (Q) or combined (I/J), so the calculation is 600 = 25×24. possible digraphs rather than the 26 possible monographs.  The frequency analysis of digraphs is possible, but considerably more difficult – and it generally requires a much larger ciphertext in order to be useful.

[[Suzanne Duchamp]]

CATEGORIES: 1889 births, 1963 deaths, Dada, French women painters, People from Seine-Maritime

Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti (20 October 1889 – 11 September 1963) was a French Dadaist painter. Born in Blainville-Crevon, Seine-Maritime in the Haute-Normandie Region of France, she was the fourth of six children born into the artistic family of Eugene and Lucie Duchamp.
Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti was the younger sister of:
She began her studies at the École des Beaux-Arts in her native Rouen when she was 16. Her early works reflected Impressionism and cubism. At age 21, she married a local pharmacist but quickly divorced, moving to the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris to be near her brother Marcel and to expand her artistic career.
For female painters at the time it was difficult to get full consideration. However, because of her older brothers' growing prominence in the arts community, at age 22, she had her first major exhibit at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris.
After the outbreak of World War I, she served as a nurse in Paris producing virtually nothing until 1916 when Jean Crotti returned to Paris, bearing news of Marcel and of the exciting art being made in New York. After the war, the first of her Dadaist works appeared. 
Completed in 1919, Multiplication Broken and Restored is a prime example of her Dada work. That same year, she married artist Jean Crotti, whose painting she would greatly influence.
As a wedding present, Marcel sent them instructions for a readymade which involved suspending a geometry textbook on the porch and letting the wind and rain gradually tear it apart.
In 1920 Suzanne showed several of her works at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris, along with Francis Picabia and Crotti.
In 1967, in Rouen, France, her brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp. Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris.
She died in Neuilly-sur-Seine (Seine-Saint-Denis), France in 1963.

[[Helm's Deep]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional valleys, Middle-earth locations, Middle-earth castles and fortresses

In J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth high fantasy writings, Helm's Deep  was a large valley in the north-western Ered Nimrais (White Mountains).
The valley was described as being blocked over its entire width by the natural series of hills called Helm's Dike and behind that lay the fortress of Aglarond or the Hornburg, at the entrance to the Glittering Caves.
In the Appendices of The Lord of the Rings, the history of the valley states that it was home to a small Gondorian regiment, but after the place which was called Calenardhon became Rohan, it became an encampment of the Rohirrim, where the guards of the Fords of Isen lived.
It also states that during the war with the Dunlendings under Wulf, the Rohirrim under King Helm Hammerhand and many of his people sought refuge in the keep, where they held out during the winter of [tpl]ME-date|TA|2758–2759[/tpl].
The castle itself was described as having a long causeway which wound up to the great gate of the fortress itself.  Inside the keep there were stables and an armoury, as well as a great hall in the rear which was dug out of the mountainside.  There also was a great tower (the Hornburg) the top of which consisted of the great horn of Helm Hammerhand.  The Deep, which was described as standing next to the fortress, was barred by the long Deeping Wall, which was described as consisting of solid rock except for a small culvert which allowed water from the Deeping Stream to enter; this rendered a fresh supply in sieges of great length. The Deeping Wall itself is described as standing 20 feet tall; and also being wide enough for four men to stand side by side. Access to the fortress from within the Deep was made possible by a long stair which led to the Hornburg's rear gate.
In The Two Towers, the fortress guarding Helm's Deep becomes the refuge of the main army of the Rohirrim, under King Théoden during the War of the Ring.  Aragorn said that "Helm's Deep would never fall while men defended it," giving an impression of invulnerability. This was tested during the Battle of the Hornburg, as a massive army of Uruk-hai sent by Saruman almost overwhelmed the defences of the Rohirrim. Saruman's orcs used an explosive blast of fire within the culvert which, when detonated, breached the long Deeping Wall. The origin of this explosion is unclear and Tolkien denotes it as "Saruman's devilry". The Rohirrim defenders held out long enough in the fortress until dawn, giving Gandalf time to gather and lead a counter-attack, while Théoden led a cavalry charge that drove the Orcs from the fortress.

Law & Order is an American police procedural and legal drama television series, created by Dick Wolf and part of the Law & Order franchise. It originally aired on NBC and, in syndication, on various cable networks. Law & Order premiered on September 13, 1990, and completed its 20th and final season on May 24, 2010. At the time of its cancellation, Law & Order was the longest-running crime drama on American primetime television.  Its record of 20 seasons is a tie with Gunsmoke for the longest-running live-action scripted American prime-time series with ongoing characters, although it had fewer episodes than Gunsmoke, and both series are surpassed by the animated series The Simpsons (renewed for a 26th season in October 2013).
Set and filmed in New York City, the series follows a two-part approach: The first half hour is the investigation of a crime (usually murder) and apprehension of a suspect by New York City Police Department homicide detectives; the second half is the prosecution of the defendant by the New York County Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Plots are often based on real cases that recently made headlines, although the motivation for the crime and the perpetrator may be different.
The show has been noted for its revolving cast over the years. Season 1 starred George Dzundza as Sergeant Max Greevey, Chris Noth as Detective Mike Logan, Dann Florek as Captain Donald Cragen, Michael Moriarty as Executive Assistant District Attorney Benjamin Stone, Richard Brooks as Assistant District Attorney Paul Robinette and Steven Hill as District Attorney Adam Schiff. After numerous cast shuffles, its final season starred Jeremy Sisto as Detective Cyrus Lupo, Anthony Anderson as Detective Kevin Bernard, S. Epatha Merkerson as Lieutenant Anita Van Buren, Linus Roache as Executive Assistant District Attorney Michael Cutter, Alana de la Garza as Assistant District Attorney Connie Rubirosa, and Sam Waterston as District Attorney Jack McCoy. Another one of the series' most notable cast members was the late Jerry Orbach as Detective Lennie Briscoe, who starred on the show for twelve years (1992-2004).
The success of the series has led to the creation of additional shows, making Law & Order a franchise, with also a television film, several video games, and international adaptations of the series. It has won and has been nominated for numerous awards over the years, including a number of Emmy Awards. On May 14, 2010, NBC announced that it had cancelled Law & Order and would air the final episode on May 24, 2010.[tpl]Cite news|title=Law & Order cancelled|publisher=The Spy Report|date=May 15, 2010|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/05/15/law-order-cancelled/|accessdate=May 15, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/arts/television/15law.html|title=One 'Law & Order' Gets a Death Sentence, as Another Joins the Force|author=Brian Stelter|coauthors=Bill Carter|authorlink=Brian Stelter|work=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/nbc-cancels-law-order/|title=NBC Cancels 'Law & Order'|author=Brian Stelter|coauthors=Bill Carter|authorlink=Brian Stelter|work=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|url=https://www.nbcumv.com/mv/#1274052289516|title=NBC announces pickups for new drama 'LOLA' ('Law & Order: Los Angeles') and returning 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' and 'Law & Order' ends its historic run on NBC May 24|publisher=NBC Universal|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010[/tpl] Immediately following the show's cancellation, Wolf stated that he was attempting to find a new home for the series and would also consider a "last resort" plan to conclude the show with a two-hour TV film to air on NBC.[tpl]cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/law-order-creator-still-looking-to-bring-original-back/ | work=The New York Times | title='Law & Order' Creator Still Looking to Bring Original Back | first=Bill | last=Carter | date=May 17, 2010[/tpl] In July 2010, however, he indicated that those attempts had failed and declared that the series had now "moved to the history books".[tpl]Cite news  |title=Law & Order is dead, says Wolf|publisher=The Spy Report |date=July 31, 2010|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/31/us-law-order-is-dead-says-wolf/|accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl]

[[Belshazzar]]

CATEGORIES: 6th-century BC biblical rulers, Babylonia, Monarchs of the Hebrew Bible, Book of Daniel

Belshazzar ([tpl]IPAc-en|b|ɛ|l|ˈ|ʃ|æ|z|ər[/tpl]; Biblical Hebrew בלשאצר; Akkadian: Bēl-šarra-uṣur) "Bel, protect the king", sometimes called Balthazar [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|l||θ|ə|ˌ|z|ɑr[/tpl], was a 6th-century BC prince of Babylon, the son of Nabonidus and the last king of Babylon according to the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible. In Daniel 5 and 8, Belshazzar is the King of Babylon before the advent of the Medes and Persians.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/60121/Belshazzar Although there is evidence that Belshazzar existed, his famous narrative and its details are only recorded in the Book of Daniel, which tells the story of Belshazzar seeing the writing on the wall. In Daniel Chapter 5, the details start off by there being a banquet for a thousand of his lords. Belshazzar next orders the vessels of gold that were taken from the Temple in Jerusalem, to be brought so that everyone can drink wine from them. 
It is at this moment that a man's hand appears and starts to write on a wall. Belshazzar's countenance is stated to have changed and he cries out to bring in his astrologers, Chaldeans and Soothsayers and that whoever interprets the writing will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom. 
The queen comes in and suggests that he call for Daniel who is by now an old man because Nebuchadnezzar made him his chief of the Magicians, Astrologers, Chaldeans, and Soothsayers. 
Belshazzar offers Daniel the position of third highest ruler in the kingdom if he can interpret the writing but Daniel doesn't want to be rewarded. Daniel interprets the writing, what it means for Belshazzar and consequences for him. 
Belshazzar immediately makes Daniel the third highest ruler in the kingdom anyway.
The last two verses state that that very night Belshazzar was slain and Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty two years old.
Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus, who after ruling only three years, went to the oasis of Tayma and devoted himself to the worship of the moon god Sin. He made Belshazzar co-regent in 553 BC, leaving him in charge of Babylon's defense.The Verse Account of Nabonidus In 540 BC, Nabonidus returned from Tayma, hoping to defend his kingdom from the Persians who were planning to advance on Babylon.

Sexual slavery is slavery for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Sexual slavery may involve single-owner sexual slavery; ritual slavery, sometimes associated with certain religious practices, such as trokosi in Ghana, Togo and Benin; slavery for primarily non-sexual purposes but where non-consensual sexual activity is common; or forced prostitution. Concubines were a traditional form of sexual slavery in many cultures, in which women spent their lives in sexual servitude. In some cultures, concubines and their children had distinct rights and legitimate social position.
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action calls for an international response in order to attempt to eradicate sexual slavery on the basis that it is a human rights issue. The incidence of sexual slavery by country has been studied and tabulated by UNESCO, with the cooperation of various international agencies.UNESCO Trafficking Project

She was considered the world's oldest living person by Guinness World Records from April 16, 1998, the date of the death of 117-year-old Canadian Marie-Louise Meilleur, until her own death. At age 117, she also set the record for the world's oldest "new" title-holder (which corresponds to the highest "valley" on a graph of the oldest living persons over time). Knauss is the second-oldest fully documented person ever, behind Jeanne Calment, and the oldest person ever from the western hemisphere.

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari ([tpl]lang-de|Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari[/tpl]) is a 1920 German silent horror film directed by Robert Wiene from a screenplay by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer. It is one of the most influential films of the German Expressionist movement and is often considered to be one of the greatest horror films of the silent era in film.
The film used stylized sets, with abstract, jagged buildings painted on canvas backdrops and flats. To add to this strange style, the actors used an unrealistic technique that exhibited "jerky" and dance-like movements.
This film is cited as having introduced the 'twist' ending in cinema.
The premiere of a digitally restored version of the film took place at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_20308.html |title=Berlinale Classics: Restoration of Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari |accessdate=15 December 2013 |work=berlinale.de[/tpl]

Bard College at Simon's Rock, more commonly known as Simon's Rock (see below), is a residential four-year liberal arts college located in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, USA. Simon's Rock is an "early college", designed for students to enroll immediately after completing the tenth or eleventh grade, rather than after graduating from high school.
The college's founder, Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, had formerly been a private girls' school headmistress at Concord Academy. She concluded from her experience, and that of her colleagues, that for many students the latter two years of high school are wasted on repetitious and overly constrained work. Many young students, she thought, are ready to pursue college-level academic work some time before the usual system asks it of them.
Simon's Rock is the only accredited four-year early college to date and still the singular college or university to take this approach with all of its students.  It is one of a number of early college entrance programs that provide opportunities for students to enter college one or more years ahead of their traditional high school graduation date. A majority of students transfer to larger institutions after receiving an Associate of Arts degree after two years, although many stay for four to receive a Bachelor of Arts.

In their normal state, they act as a cushion composed of arterio-venous channels and connective tissue.
The symptoms of pathological hemorrhoids depend on the type present. Internal hemorrhoids usually present with painless rectal bleeding while external hemorrhoids may produce few symptoms or if thrombosed significant pain and swelling in the area of the anus. Many people incorrectly refer to any symptom occurring around the anal-rectal area as "hemorrhoids" and serious causes of the symptoms should be ruled out. While the exact cause of hemorrhoids remains unknown, a number of factors which increase intra-abdominal pressure, in particular constipation, are believed to play a role in their development.
Initial treatment for mild to moderate disease consists of increasing fiber intake, oral fluids to maintain hydration, NSAIDs to help with the pain, and rest. A number of minor procedures may be performed if symptoms are severe or do not improve with conservative management. Surgery is reserved for those who fail to improve following these measures. Up to half of people may experience problems with hemorrhoids at some point in their life. Outcomes are usually good.

[[110 film]]

CATEGORIES:  Film formats, ISO standards, Film formats

110 is a cartridge-based film format used in still photography. It was introduced by Kodak in 1972. 110 is essentially a miniaturised version of Kodak's earlier 126 film format. Each frame is [tpl]convert|13|x|17|mm|abbr=on[/tpl], with one registration hole.
The film is fully housed in a plastic cartridge, which also registers the image when the film is advanced. There is a continuous backing paper, and the frame number and film type are visible through a window at the rear of the cartridge. The film does not need to be rewound and is very simple to load and unload. It is pre-exposed with frame lines and numbers, a feature intended to make it easier and more efficient for photofinishers to print.
Unlike later competing formats, such as disc and APS film, processed 110 negatives were returned in strips, without the original cartridge.

[[Grokster]]

CATEGORIES: File sharing programs, Defunct software companies

Grokster Ltd. was a privately owned software company based in Nevis, West Indies that created the Grokster peer-to-peer file-sharing client in 2001 that utilized the FastTrack protocol. Grokster Ltd. was rendered extinct in late 2005 by the United States Supreme Court's decision in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. The court ruled against Grokster's peer-to-peer file sharing program for computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system, effectively forcing the company to cease operations. The product was similar in look and feel to Kazaa which is marketed by Sharman Networks and Morpheus which was distributed by StreamCast. Grokster along with Morpheus and Kazaa are considered second-generation peer-to-peer file sharing programs because unlike their predecessor Napster these file sharing programs allowed users to trade files directly between one another without these transactions passing through a centralized server.   Because Napster maintained this fraction of control over the transaction of files through its server it was ruled illegal because it should have exercised its power over the server to stop the sharing of copyright infringing files.  Grokster and this second generation of peer-to-peer file sharing programs sought to avoid this legal obstacle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/technology/articles/groksterprimer_033805.htm |title=TechNews.com's Grokster Case At a Glance |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2005-03-28 |accessdate=2012-04-17[/tpl]

The Pyrgi Tablets, found in a 1964 excavation of a sanctuary of ancient Pyrgi on the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy (today the town of Santa Severa), are three golden leaves that record a dedication made around 500 BCE by Thefarie Velianas, king of Caere, to the Phoenician goddess ʻAshtaret. Pyrgi was the port of the southern Etruscan town of Caere. Two of the tablets are inscribed in the Etruscan language, the third in Phoenician.The specific dialect has been called "Mediterranean Phoenician" by Philip C. Schmitz, "The Phoenician Text from the Etruscan Sanctuary at Pyrgi" Journal of the American Oriental Society 115.4 (October - December 1995), pp. 559-575. Full bibliography of Pyrgi and the tablets
These writings are important in providing both a bilingual text that allows researchers to use knowledge of Phoenician to interpret Etruscan, and evidence of Phoenician or Punic influence in the Western Mediterranean. They may relate to Polybius's report (Hist. 3,22) of an ancient and almost unintelligible treaty between the Romans and the Carthaginians, which he dated to the consulships of L. Iunius Brutus and L. Tarquinius Collatinus (509 BCE).
The tablets are now held at the National Etruscan Museum, Villa Giulia, Rome.

Although distrustful of his allies Stilwell showed himself to be a capable and daring tactician in the field but a lack of resources meant he was continually forced to improvise. He famously differed as to strategy, ground troops versus air power, with his subordinate, Claire Chennault, who had the ear of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. George Marshall acknowledged he had given Stilwell "one of the most difficult" assignments of any theater commander.Eldridge, p. 160.

[[Disc film]]

CATEGORIES: Film formats, Eastman Kodak photographic films

Disc film was a still-photography film format aimed at the consumer market, and introduced by Kodak in 1982.
The film was in the form of a flat disc, and was fully housed within a plastic cartridge. Each disc held fifteen 11 × 8 mm exposures, arranged around the outside of the disc, with the disc being rotated 24° between each image.
The system was primarily a consumer-oriented product, and most cameras were self-contained units with no expansion capability. The cameras were very simple to load and unload, and were generally completely automated. The cassette had a built-in dark slide to prevent stray light reaching the film when the disc was removed.
As the film was rotated on a disc instead of over a spool, the cassette was very thin, as were most of the cameras. The completely flat nature of the format also led to the (potential) advantage of greater sharpness over spool-based cassette formats (such as 110 and 126 film). Disc film has a very thick acetate base, comparable with 4×5" sheet film, which holds the film much flatter than the other formats.
Disc film did not prove hugely successful, mainly because the image on the negative was only 11 mm by 8 mm, leading to generally unacceptable grain and poor definition in the final prints. The film was intended to be printed with special 6-element lenses from Kodak, but many labs simply printed discs with standard 3-element lenses used for larger negative formats.  The resulting prints often disappointed the consumer.
The film was officially discontinued by the last manufacturer, Kodak, on December 31, 1999, though the cameras had disappeared from the market long before then.
There were several different manufacturers of Disc film.  Kodak produced films throughout the complete lifespan of the format, but 3M, Konica and Fuji also produced Disc film.  While Kodak film was always eponymous, 3M and Konica made Disc film for many third parties, branded with the retailer's logo. As with most photographic film, for such white-label products the country of manufacture provides the best indication as to the actual manufacturer.
Kodak's newest ideas with sharp fine-grained negative film were always tested in Disc format first, typically being one or two generations ahead of the equivalent 135 films.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

This is reflected in the fact that he is clearly a significant figure in the Qur’an (appearing in 93 ayaat verses), though Noah, Adam and Moses appear with even greater frequency.Gregory A. Barker and Stephen E. Gregg, "Jesus Beyond Christianity: The Classic Texts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 84. It states that Jesus was born to Mary (Arabic: Maryam) as the result of virginal conception, a miraculous event which occurred by the decree of God (Arabic: Allah). To aid in his ministry to the Jewish people, Jesus was given the ability to perform miracles (such as healing the blind, bringing dead people back to life, etc.), all by the permission of God rather than of his own power. According to the Quran, Jesus, although appearing to have been crucified, was not killed by crucifixion or by any other means; instead, "God raised him unto Himself".  Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim (i.e., one who submits to the will of God), as he preached that his followers should adopt the "straight path" as commanded by God. Islam rejects the Trinitarian Christian view that Jesus was God incarnate or the son of God, that he was ever crucified or resurrected, or that he ever atoned for the sins of mankind. The Quran says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the Last Judgment, and God will vindicate him.Quran, 5th Surah, vs. 116. The Quran emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human being who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. Islamic texts forbid the association of partners with God (shirk), emphasizing a strict notion of monotheism (tawhīd). An alternative  interpretation of this theology is held by Messianic Muslims.
Numerous titles are given to Jesus in the Quran and in Islamic literature, the most common being al-Masīḥ ("the Messiah"). Jesus is also, at times, called "Seal of the Israelite Prophets", because, in general Muslim belief, Jesus was the last prophet sent by God to guide the Children of Israel. Jesus is seen in Islam as a precursor to Muhammad, and is believed by Muslims to have foretold the latter's coming.Fasching, deChant (2001) p. 241

[[Hawking radiation]]
CATEGORIES: Black holes, Quantum field theory, Stephen Hawking, Astronomical hypotheses

Hawking radiation is black body radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes, due to quantum effects near the event horizon.
It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974,Charlie Rose: A conversation with Dr. Stephen Hawking & Lucy Hawking and sometimes also after Jacob Bekenstein, who predicted that black holes should have a finite, non-zero temperature and entropy.[tpl]cite news|last=Levi Julian|first=Hana|title='40 Years of Black Hole Thermodynamics' in Jerusalem|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/159585#.UErd_yJipNs|accessdate=8 September 2012|newspaper=Arutz Sheva|date=3 September 2012[/tpl]
Hawking's work followed his visit to Moscow in 1973 where the Soviet scientists Yakov Zeldovich and Alexei Starobinsky showed him that according to the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle, rotating black holes should create and emit particles.A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking, Bantam Books, 1988. Hawking radiation reduces the mass and the energy of the black hole and is therefore also known as black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that lose more mass than they gain through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish. Micro black holes (MBHs) are predicted to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes and should shrink and dissipate faster.
In September 2010, a signal that is closely related to black hole Hawking radiation (see analog gravity) was claimed to have been observed in a laboratory experiment involving optical light pulses. However, the results remain unverified and debatable.[ref]Hawking radiation from ultrashort laser pulse filaments

In June 2008, NASA launched the Fermi space telescope, which will search for the terminal gamma-ray flashes expected from evaporating primordial black holes.

[[The Battle of the Little Giants]]

CATEGORIES: Boxing fights, 1981 in boxing, Boxing in the Las Vegas Valley, 1981 in Nevada

The Battle of the Little Giants was a 1981 boxing event with a deep social impact.
Fought on August 21, 1981, at the Caesars Palace hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, it pitted Wilfredo Gómez, a Puerto Rican who had a record of 32 wins, 0 losses, 1 draw, and all his wins by knockout, and who was the world's Jr. Featherweight champion, against the lesser known Salvador Sánchez, who hailed from Mexico with a record of 40 wins, 1 loss, 1 draw. Salvador Sanchez was defending his WBC world Featherweight crown.
Gómez was the strong favorite at the betting windows due to his knockout win streak of 32 fights in a row and Sánchez's relative obscurity. During the build-up to the fight, Gomez talked often of his intention to score an early knockout over Sanchez and the betting public seemed to be in agreement.
The fight was broadcast on closed-circuit television to all of the United States and through many Latin American countries. Sánchez began by surprising most fans and dropping Gómez 40 seconds into round one. Gómez got up but was battered around the ring by Sanchez for the remainder of the round, nearly going down again from an overhand right in Wilfredo's own corner. Gomez began to recover in round three and had his moments over the next three rounds, continually going forward and throwing combinations in an effort to turn the fight. However, Gómez's right eye started to swell by the third round and was nearly closed by the seventh. Sánchez started zeroing into that area and landed a number of hard punches that repeatedly rocked Gomez. In the seventh round, Gomez finally landed the combination he wanted, a right-left to the chin that partially lifted Sanchez off his feet; however, he was able to shake off the effects and move away from the corner without further trouble.
Round eight proved to be the final round. With Gómez almost blinded by his swollen eyes and the Mexican partisans shouting "Ole!" with every volley of punches, Sánchez landed a straight right hand that had Gomez teetering and badly hurt on the ropes, followed by a series of punches that almost sent Gómez off the ring. Though Gómez was able to beat the count, referee Carlos Padilla stepped in and stopped the fight, giving Sánchez an eighth round technical knockout (TKO) win.
In Mexico, a new legend was born. Sánchez had, in their eyes, avenged the loss that Gómez had inflicted to Carlos Zarate some years before. He became recognized by many Mexicans and international fans as Mexico's greatest world champion ever, but that moment of glory was short lived, because almost a year after his fight with Gómez, on August 12 of 1982, Sánchez was killed in a car accident. Soon, Julio César Chávez would replace him in the hearts of many Mexican boxing fans as their greatest fighter ever.
In Puerto Rico, it was a moment to mourn for most boxing fans. Many businesses and stores were closed the day after, as Gómez was a national hero to most Puerto Ricans, and he was seen by many as invincible. It took, in the eyes of Puerto Rican boxing fans, 18 years to really avenge Gómez's defeat against Sánchez, and that was when Félix Trinidad beat Oscar de la Hoya in 1999. Gómez went into a depression, but he roared back the next year and posted world title wins against many other boxers from there on until he retired in 1989. Among the fighters he would beat later were Lupe Pintor (who also is Mexican) at the Carnival of Champions, and Juan Laporte. Gómez joined the exclusive group of fighters to win titles in three different boxing divisions.
It could be said that Sánchez, in between the moment he beat Gómez and the moment he died almost a year later, warmed himself to the hearts of many Puerto Ricans. He granted interviews to many Puerto Rican television news shows, and was known for speaking well about Puerto Rico and its people. When Sánchez died, news of his death were heard across Latin America, and many people both in Mexico and Puerto Rico were saddened by his passing. His funeral was shown live in Mexico, and in Puerto Rico, a tribute show to him was aired by WAPA-TV five days after his death, featuring his past interviews with that network's sportscasters, his story, and clips of his fights.
Gómez himself also became a dear person to the people of Mexico after this fight. Although they knew him as the Mexican beater because of the many other fights he won against Mexican boxers, Gómez showed no ill feelings towards the people of Mexico by offering Sánchez flowers after Sánchez died, and becoming a frequent visitor to the Sánchez family thereafter. On Sánchez's small town, there is always a festival to commemorate Sánchez's memory every year, around the week of August 12. Gómez has been named Grand Marischal of that festival three times already, and has been a guest of honor the thirty one times it has been celebrated after Sánchez's passing.
There had always been talks of a rematch between the two before Sánchez died. What would have happened in a rematch will never be known, but the fact is that both Gómez and Sánchez are now together in a place far different from a boxing ring: They are both in the International Boxing Hall Of Fame.

There was some disagreement about whether all pages should be in HTML, plain text, or whether all formats should be allowed (e.g., as with Gopher). Another point of discussion was whether outside Internet resources not specifically written for the Interpedia could become part of it by simply including them in the catalog.
Furthermore, several independent "Seal-of-approval" (SOAP) agencies were envisioned which would rate Interpedia articles based on criteria of their own choosing; users could then decide which agencies' recommendations to follow.Interpedia FAQ 15-MAR-94, section 4.2: "What are Seals of Approval (SOAP)?"

Ernest Taylor "Ernie" Pyle (August 3, 1900 – April 18, 1945) was an American journalist who was known for his columns as a roving correspondent from 1935 for the Scripps Howard newspaper chain, especially during World War II, when he reported both from Europe and the Pacific, until his death in combat on a Pacific island. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1944.
His travel articles, about the out-of-the-way places he visited and the people who lived there, were written in a folksy style, much like a personal letter to a friend; many were collected in Home Country (1947). By the war, he enjoyed a following in some 300 newspapers and was among the best-known American war correspondents in Europe.

[[Nikon F]]
CATEGORIES: Nikon SLR cameras

The Nikon F camera, introduced in April 1959,Nikon F Mir was Nikon's first SLR camera.  It was one of the most advanced cameras of its day. Although many of the concepts had already been introduced elsewhere, it was revolutionary in that it was the first to combine them all in one camera.Lothrop & Schneider, "The SLR Saga (part 2)," p 51. "in 1959, Nikon announced what was undoubtedly the most important SLR of its era–the legendary Nikon F. Although it didn't embody any technological breakthroughs, it is generally credited as the cornerstone of the world's first professional caliber 35mm SLR system."  It was produced until October 1973 and was replaced by the quite similar Nikon F2. Aspects of its design remain in all of Nikon's subsequent SLR cameras, through the current Nikon F6 film and Nikon D4 digital models (which still share its Nikon F-mount for lenses).  The "F" in Nikon F was selected by Nippon Kogaku from the letter F in 'Reflex.'  That tradition was carried all the way through their top line of Nikon cameras until the introduction of the Nikon D1 (digital) cameras decades later.

[[Norwegian Forest Cat]]
CATEGORIES: Cat breeds, Cat breeds originating in Norway, Natural cat breeds

The Norwegian Forest Cat or skogkatt is a breed of domestic cat native to Northern Europe. This natural breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with top coat of glossy, long, water-shedding hairs, and a woolly undercoat for insulation. Although this is uncertain, the breed's ancestors may have been a landrace of short-haired cats brought to Norway by the Vikings around 1000 AD, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora breeds. During World War II, the breed became nearly extinct until efforts by the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed by creating an official breeding program. It was not registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline until the 1970s, when a local cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. Currently, the Norwegian Forest Cat is very popular in Norway, Sweden, Iceland and France.
It is a big, strong cat, similar to the American Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a sturdy body. The breed is very good at climbing, since they have strong claws. The lifespan is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases have been reported in the breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.

Rosa Luxemburg (also Rozalia Luxenburg; [tpl]lang-pl|Róża Luksemburg[/tpl]; 5 March 1871Luxemburg biography at marxists.org – 15 January 1919) was a Marxist theorist, philosopher, economist and revolutionary socialist of Polish Jewish descent who became a naturalized German citizen. She was successively a member of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).
In 1915, after the SPD supported German involvement in World War I, she and Karl Liebknecht co-founded the anti-war Spartakusbund ("Spartacus League") which eventually became the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). During the German Revolution she founded the Die Rote Fahne ("The Red Flag"), the central organ of the Spartacist movement.
She considered the 1919 Spartacist uprising a blunder,Frederik Hetmann: Rosa Luxemburg. Ein Leben für die Freiheit, p. 308 but supported it after Liebknecht ordered it without her knowledge. When the revolt was crushed by the social democratic government and the Freikorps (World War I veterans who banded together into right-wing paramilitary groups), Luxemburg, Liebknecht and some of their supporters were captured and murdered. Luxemburg was shot and her body thrown in the Landwehr Canal in Berlin.
Due to her pointed criticism of both the Marxist-Leninist and more moderate social democrat schools of socialism, Luxemburg has had a somewhat ambivalent reception among scholars and theorists of the political left.Leszek Kołakowski (1981, 2008), Main Currents of Marxism, Vol. 2: The Golden Age, W. W. Norton & Company, Ch III: "Rosa Luxemburg and the Revolutionary Left" Nonetheless, some Marxists came to regard Luxemburg and Liebknecht as martyrs: according to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, commemoration of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht continues to play an important role among the German political left.Gedenken an Rosa Luxemburg und Karl Liebknecht – ein Traditionselement des deutschen Linksextremismus, BfV-Themenreihe, Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, 2008

Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses).[tpl]cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|others=Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|page=377[/tpl]

Sunglasses have long been associated with celebrities and film actors primarily from a desire to mask their identity. Since the 1940s sunglasses have been popular as a fashion accessory, especially on the beach.

[[Nebelung]]

CATEGORIES: Rare cat breeds

The Nebelung is a rare breed of the domestic cat. Nebelungs have long bodies, wide-set green eyes, long and dense fur, and mild dispositions. The name Nebelung — apparently a portmanteau of the German word (Nebel) for Mist or Fog and a medieval Germanic saga, Nibelungenlied — is perhaps derived from the cat's distinctive silky blue-grey coat and from the breed's progenitors, who were named after the two major figures in the Nibelungenlied, the German warrior Siegfried and the Icelandic queen Brunhilde.

[[Cataclysmic variable star]]
CATEGORIES: Binary stars, Cataclysmic variable stars, Semidetached binaries, Stellar phenomena

Cataclysmic variable stars (CV) are stars which irregularly increase in brightness by a large factor, then drop back down to a quiescent state.  They were initially called novae, from the Latin 'new', since ones with an outburst brightness visible to the naked eye and an invisible quiescent brightness appeared as new stars in the sky.
Cataclysmic variable stars are binary stars that consist of two components; a white dwarf primary, and a mass transferring secondary. The stars are so close to each other that the gravity of the white dwarf distorts the secondary, and the white dwarf accretes matter from the companion. Therefore, the secondary is often referred to as the donor star. The infalling matter, which is usually rich in hydrogen, forms in most cases an accretion disc around the white dwarf. Strong UV and X-ray emission is often seen from the accretion disc. The accretion disk may be prone to an instability leading to dwarf nova outbursts, when a portion of the disk material falls onto the white dwarf; these cataclysmic outbursts occur when the density and temperature at the bottom of the accumulated hydrogen layer rise high enough to ignite nuclear fusion reactions, which rapidly convert the hydrogen layer to helium.
If the accretion process continues long enough to bring the white dwarf close to the Chandrasekhar limit, the increasing interior density can ignite runaway carbon fusion and trigger a Type Ia supernova explosion, which completely destroys the white dwarf.

[[Wolf interval]]
CATEGORIES: Intervals

In music theory, the wolf fifth (sometimes also called Procrustean fifth,
or imperfect fifth)[ref]

Paul, Oscar (1885). A manual of harmony for use in music-schools and seminaries and for self-instruction, p.165. Theodore Baker, trans. G. Schirmer.[/ref]
is a particularly dissonant musical interval spanning seven semitones. Strictly, the term refers to an interval produced by a specific tuning system, widely used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: the quarter-comma meantone temperament.The wolf fifth More broadly, it is also used to refer to similar intervals produced by other tuning systems, including most meantone temperaments.
When the twelve notes within the octave of a chromatic scale are tuned using the quarter-comma meantone tuning system, one of the twelve intervals spanning seven semitones (classified as a diminished sixth) turns out to be much wider than the others (classified as perfect fifths). Typically, this interval is from G[tpl]music|#[/tpl] to E[tpl]music|b[/tpl].[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Likely true but should be supported|date=March 2014[/tpl] The eleven perfect fifths sound almost perfectly consonant. Conversely, the diminished sixth is severely dissonant and seems to howl like a wolf, because of a phenomenon called beating. Since the diminished sixth is meant to be enharmonically equivalent to a perfect fifth, this anomalous interval has come to be called the wolf fifth.
Besides the above-mentioned quarter comma meantone, other tuning systems may produce severely dissonant diminished sixths. Conversely, in 12-tone equal temperament, which is currently the most commonly used tuning system, the diminished sixth is not a wolf fifth, as it has exactly the same size as a perfect fifth.
By extension, any interval which is perceived as severely dissonant and may be regarded as howling like a wolf may be called a wolf interval. For instance, in quarter comma meantone, the augmented second, augmented third, augmented fifth, diminished fourth and diminished seventh may be considered wolf intervals, as their size significantly deviates from the size of the corresponding justly tuned interval (see Size of 1/4-comma meantone intervals).

Qinghai ([tpl]zh|c=青海|p=Qīnghǎi|w=Ch'ing-Hai[/tpl]; pronounced [tpl]IPAc-cmn|q|ing|1|h|ai|3[/tpl]), also known as Tsinghai, formerly known in English as Kokonor, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the northwest of the country. As one of the largest province-level administrative division of China by area, the province is ranked fourth-largest in size, but has the third-smallest population.
Located mostly on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, the province has long been a melting pot for a number of ethnic groups including the Han, Tibetans, Hui, Tu, Mongols, and Salars.  Qinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, the Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 under the Republic of China period during which it was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name, "Qinghai" is named after Qinghai Lake (cyan sea lake), the largest lake in China. The province was known formerly as Kokonur in English, derived from the Oirat name for Qinghai Lake.

[tpl]pp-blp|small=yes[/tpl][tpl]pp-move-indef[/tpl]

George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd with drummer Nick Mason, keyboardist Richard Wright and guitarist, singer and songwriter Syd Barrett. Waters initially served as the group's bassist and co-lead vocalist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist and conceptual leader.
Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall and The Final Cut. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling acts in the history of popular music; as of 2013, they have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million units sold in the United States. Amid creative differences within the group, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their intended use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years had passed before he performed with them again.
Waters' solo career has included three studio albums: The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Radio K.A.O.S. and Amused to Death. In 1990, he staged one of the largest and most extravagant rock concerts in history, The Wall – Live in Berlin, with an official attendance of 200,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. That same year he released [tpl]lang|fr|Ça Ira[/tpl], an opera in three acts translated from Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gils' libretto about the French Revolution. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Mason, Wright and David Gilmour for the Live 8 global awareness event; it was the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999 and played The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety for his world tour of 2006–2008. In 2010, he began The Wall Live and in 2011 Gilmour and Mason appeared with him during a performance of the double album in London. As of 2013, the tour is the highest-grossing of all time by a solo artist.
Waters has been married four times; first in 1969 to his childhood sweetheart Judy Trim; they had no children together and divorced in 1975. The following year he married Lady Carolyne Christie; the marriage produced a son, Harry Waters, a musician who has played keyboards with his father's touring band since 2006, and a daughter, India Waters, who has worked as a model. Christie and Waters divorced in 1992, and in 1993, he married Priscilla Phillips. They had one son together, Jack Fletcher, before getting divorced in 2001. In 2012, Waters married actress and filmmaker Laurie Durning.

Over time, however, the word has come to have a more generic meaning.  It can be anything from a noun describing a plausible yet fictional country, to an adjective ("Freedonian") used to characterize a place like the Freedonia of Duck Soup.  Because the Marx Brothers' Freedonia had so many qualities—autocracy, diminutiveness, and obscurity, to name but a few — a place can be described as "Freedonian" for having any one of these qualities.

A "woman of letters" who published in multiple genres, Barbauld had a successful writing career at a time when female professional writers were rare. She was a noted teacher at the Palgrave Academy and an innovative children's writer; her primers provided a model for pedagogy for more than a century.McCarthy, William. "Mother of All Discourses: Anna Barbauld's Lessons for Children." Culturing the Child, 1690–1914: Essays in Memory of Mitzi Myers. Ed. Donelle Ruwe. Lanham, MD: The Children's Literature Association and the Scarecrow Press, Inc. (2005). Her essays demonstrated that it was possible for a woman to be publicly engaged in politics, and other women authors such as Elizabeth Benger emulated her.Armstrong, Isobel.

Hanover: University Press of New England (1995) and Anne K. Mellor. "A Criticism of Their Own: Romantic Women Literary Critics." Questioning Romanticism. Ed. John Beer. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press (1995). Barbauld's literary career spanned numerous periods in British literary history: her work promoted the values of both the Enlightenment and Sensibility, and her poetry was foundational to the development of British Romanticism.Janowitz, Anne. Women Romantic Poets: Anna Barbauld and Mary Robinson. Tavistock: Northcote House (2003). Barbauld was also a literary critic, and her anthology of 18th-century British novels helped establish the canon as known today.
Barbauld's career as a poet ended abruptly in 1812 with the publication of Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticized Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. Vicious reviews shocked Barbauld, and she published nothing else during her lifetime.Barbauld, Anna Letitia. Anna Letitia Barbauld: Selected Poetry and Prose. Eds. William McCarthy and Elizabeth Kraft. Peterborough: Broadview Press Ltd. (2002), 160. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative, years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer during the 19th century, and largely forgotten during the 20th century, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.McCarthy, William.

Tottenham Court Road is a major road in central London, running from St Giles Circus (the junction of Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road) north to Euston Road, near the border of the City of Westminster and the London Borough of Camden, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile. It has for many years been a one-way street: all three lanes are northbound only, the equivalent southbound traffic using the parallel Gower Street. It is generally regarded as marking the boundary between Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia, linking Somers Town with Soho at either end.
The south end of the road is close to the British Museum and to Centre Point, the West End's tallest building. There are a number of buildings belonging to University College London along the road, and University College Hospital is at the north end of the road at the junction with Euston Road.
The road is served by three stations on the London Underground—from south to north these are Tottenham Court Road, Goodge Street and Warren Street—and by numerous bus routes.

Mary Osborne, Duchess of Leeds (1723 – 3 August 1764), born Lady Mary Godolphin, was a daughter of Henrietta Godolphin, née Churchill, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, and Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin, making her granddaughter to the powerful government trio during the reign of Queen Anne of Great Britain: the famous general and politician John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and his wife Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, through her mother; and Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin, through her father.
Lady Mary was considered to be the illegitimate child of the famous playwright William Congreve, with whom Henrietta, Duchess of Marlborough, was having a long-term relationship. She was, however, recognised by Francis as his own daughter, and was raised by him with the other Godolphin children. Despite this, gossip spread rapidly about Lady Mary's paternity, and her maternal grandmother did not recognise her until 1740, when the two reconciled their differences. It was at this time that Sarah, Dowager Duchess of Marlborough, arranged Lady Mary's marriage to Thomas Osborne, 4th Duke of Leeds; they were married on 26 June 1740. They had one surviving child, Francis Godolphin Osborne (styled Marquess of Carmarthen, later 5th Duke of Leeds and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), who was born on 29 January 1751.
Mary, Duchess of Leeds, died in 1764, aged 41.

An early photograph (Wilkes 1956:16 figure 1-7) displays the name as IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. was a general purpose electro-mechanical computer that was used in the war effort during the last part of World War II.
The original concept was presented to IBM by Howard Aiken in November 1937.Bernard Cohen, p. 53 (2000)  After a feasibility study by IBM's engineers, Thomas Watson Sr. personally approved the project and its funding in February 1939.
Howard Aiken had started to look for a company to design and build his calculator in early 1937.  After two rejections,Bernard Cohen, p.39 (2000) It was first rejected by the Monroe Calculator Company and then by Harvard University. he was shown a demonstration set that Charles Babbage's son had given to Harvard university 50 years earlier.  This led him to study Babbage and to add references of the analytical engine to his proposal ; the resulting machine "brought Babbage's principles of the analytical engine almost to full realization, while adding important new features."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/markI/markI_intro2.html |title=IBM's ASCC introduction 2|accessdate=14 December 2013[/tpl]
The ASCC was developed and built by IBM at their Endicott plant and shipped to Harvard in February 1944. It began computations for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships in May and was officially presented to the university on August 7, 1944.
One of the first programs to run on the Mark I was initiated on 29 March 1944Bernard Cohen, p.164 (2000) by John von Neumann, who worked on the Manhattan project at the time, and needed to determine whether implosion was a viable choice to detonate the atomic bomb a year before its use.  The Mark I also computed and printed mathematical tables which was Charles Babbage's initial goal for his analytical engine.
The Mark I was officially retired, after 15 years of service, in 1959.

Keeping Up Appearances is a BBC television sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC. Centred on the life of eccentric, social-climbing snob Hyacinth Bucket (who insists that her surname is pronounced "Bouquet"), the sitcom follows an obsessive and determined snobbish middle class woman who desperately and continually looks for opportunities to climb the social ladder by attempting to impress people (particularly rich people) and portray herself as more affluent than she truly is, despite being wedged between a working class background and upper class aspirations.
The show stars Patricia Routledge, who received two BAFTA nominations for her performance as Hyacinth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/keepingupappearances/ |title=BBC Keeping Up Appearances page [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Search results|url=http://www.bafta.org/search.html?pageNo=1234&q=television&w=true|work=Bafta.org|accessdate=18 July 2013[/tpl] Broadcast between 1990 and 1995 on BBC One, the sitcom spawned five series and 44 episodes—4 of which are Christmas specials. Keeping Up Appearances was a great success in the UK and also captured large audiences in the US, Canada, and Australia, but ceased production in 1995 when Routledge wanted to move on to other projects. Since its original release, all five series—including Christmas specials—are available on DVD.

Mr. Bean is a British sitcom television programme series of fourteen 25-minute episodes written by and starring Rowan Atkinson as the title character. Different episodes were also written by Robin Driscoll, Richard Curtis and one by Ben Elton. Thirteen of the episodes were broadcast on ITV, from the pilot on 1 January 1990, until "Goodnight Mr. Bean" on 31 October 1995. A clip show, "The Best Bits of Mr. Bean", was broadcast on 15 December 1995, and one episode, "Hair by Mr. Bean of London" was not broadcast until 2006 on Nickelodeon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/mr_bean/episodes/1/17/|title=Mr. Bean - Episode Guides - Series 1 - Episode 14|publisher=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=28 February 2013[/tpl]
Based on a character originally developed by Atkinson while he was studying for his master's degree at Oxford University, the series follows the exploits of Mr. Bean, described by Atkinson as "a child in a grown man's body", in solving various problems presented by everyday tasks and often causing disruption in the process."Atkinson has Bean there and he's done with that", interview by Lucy Cavendish in The Scotsman (30 November 2005). Retrieved 3 August 2006. Bean rarely speaks, and the largely physical humour of the series is derived from his interactions with other people and his unusual solutions to situations. The series was influenced by physical performers such as Jacques Tati and comic actors from silent films.
During its five-year run, the series gained large UK audience figures, including 18.74 million for the 1991 episode "The Trouble with Mr. Bean".Viewing figures at the Internet Movie Database. Retrieved 14 March 2008. The series has been the recipient of a number of international awards, including the Rose d'Or.

CATEGORIES: Organic redox reactions, Name reactions

The Swern oxidation, named after Daniel Swern, is a chemical reaction whereby a primary or secondary alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde or ketone using oxalyl chloride, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and an organic base, such as triethylamine.[tpl]cite journal | title = Oxidation of alcohols by "activated" dimethyl sulfoxide.

The by-products are dimethyl sulfide (Me2S), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and — when triethylamine is used as base — triethylammonium chloride (Et3NHCl). Two of the by-products, dimethyl sulfide and carbon monoxide, are very toxic volatile compounds, so the reaction and the work-up needs to be performed in a fume hood. Dimethyl sulfide is a volatile liquid (B.P. 37 °C) with an extremely unpleasant odour.

[[Non-volatile random-access memory]]
CATEGORIES: Non-volatile memory, Computer memory

Non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) is random-access memory that retains its information when power is turned off (non-volatile). This is in contrast to  dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and static random-access memory (SRAM), which both   maintain data only for as long as power is applied. 
The best-known form of NVRAM memory today is flash memory. Some drawbacks to flash memory include the requirement to write it in larger blocks than many computers can automatically address, and the relatively limited longevity of flash memory due to its finite number of write-erase cycles (most consumer flash products at the time of writing can withstand only around 100,000 rewrites before memory begins to deteriorate).  Another drawback is the performance limitations preventing flash from matching the response times and, in some cases, the random addressability offered by traditional forms of RAM. Several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles, and some even claim to be a truly universal memory, offering the performance of the best SRAM devices with the non-volatility of flash. To date these alternatives have not yet become mainstream.

[[Killer heuristic]]
CATEGORIES: Game artificial intelligence, Heuristics, Optimization algorithms and methods

In competitive two-player games, the killer heuristic is a technique for improving the efficiency of alpha-beta pruning, which in turn improves the efficiency of the minimax algorithm.  This algorithm has an exponential search time to find the optimal next move, so general methods for speeding it up are very useful.
Alpha-beta pruning works best when the best moves are considered first.  This is because the best moves are the ones most likely to produce a cutoff, a condition where the game playing program knows that the position it is considering could not possibly have resulted from best play by both sides and so need not be considered further.
The killer heuristic attempts to produce a cutoff by assuming that a move that produced a cutoff in another branch of the game tree at the same depth is likely to produce a cutoff in the present position, that is to say that a move that was a very good move from a different (but possibly similar) position might also be a good move in the present position.  By trying the killer move before other moves, a game playing program can often produce an early cutoff, saving itself the effort of considering or even generating all legal moves from a position.
In practical implementation, game playing programs frequently keep track of two killer moves for each depth of the game tree (greater than depth of 1) and see if either of these moves, if legal, produces a cutoff before the program generates and considers the rest of the possible moves.  If a non-killer move produces a cutoff, it replaces one of the two killer moves at its depth.  This idea can be generalized into a set of refutation tables.
A generalization of the killer heuristic is the history heuristic. The history heuristic can be implemented as a table that is indexed by some characteristic of the move, for example "from" and "to" squares or piece moving and the "to" square. When there is a cutoff, the appropriate entry in the table is incremented, such as by adding d² or 2d where d is the current search depth. This information is used when ordering moves.

The epicenter or epicentre [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|p|ɪ|s|ɛ|n|t|ər[/tpl] is the point on the Earth's surface that is directly above the hypocenter or focus, the point where an earthquake or underground explosion originates. The word derives from the New Latin noun epicentrum,[tpl]Cite book | title = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary | chapter = epicenter | year = 2009 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epicenter | accessdate = 2009-10-19[/tpl] the latinisation of the ancient Greek adjective ἐπίκεντρος (epikentros), "occupying a cardinal point, situated on a centre",ἐπίκεντρος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus from ἐπί (epi) "on, upon, at"ἐπί, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and κέντρον (kentron) "centre".epicentre, on Oxford Dictionaries
In the case of earthquakes, the epicenter is directly above the point where the fault begins to rupture, and in most cases, it is the area of greatest damage. However, in larger events, the length of the fault rupture is much longer, and damage can be spread across the rupture zone.  For example, in the magnitude 7.9, 2002 Denali earthquake in Alaska, the epicenter was at the western end of the rupture, but the greatest damage occurred about 330 km away at the eastern end of the rupture zone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2003/fs014-03/|title=Rupture in South-Central Alaska—The Denali Fault Earthquake of 2002|publisher=USGS|first=Gary|last=Fuis|coauthors=Wald, Lisa|accessdate=2008-04-20[/tpl]

The Green Party of Alaska is the state party organization for Alaska of the Green Party of the United States.  Alaska was the first state to gain Green Party ballot access, in 1990, when Jim Sykes ran for governor.  Sykes had previously filed a ballot access lawsuit, citing an earlier case, Vogler v. Miller.
Like the Alaska Libertarian Party, the Green Party organizes local affiliate groups by regions of the state rather than election districts.  It is known for calling these groups bioregions.  The organized bioregions of the GPAK include the Southcentral Bioregion (Anchorage area) and the Tanana-Yukon Bioregion (the Interior, around the Tanana and Yukon River areas).
The Green Party of Alaska has gained more than 10% of the votes in past presidential and congressional elections.  The most notable example was in 2000, when Alaska voters gave presidential candidate Ralph Nader his highest state percentage.  Nader made headlines when he carried the Girdwood precinct, located at the extreme southern end of Anchorage corporate limits.  In 1996, the party's U.S. Senate nominee Jed Whittaker came in second, out-polling Democratic nominee Theresa Obermeyer, who had been disowned by her party.
The first election victory associated with the party was in 1991, when Kelley Weaverling was elected mayor of Cordovahttp://www.feinstein.org/greenparty/greenmayors.html.  Municipal elections in Alaska are nonpartisan, though Weaverling's association with the party was highly publicized at the time.

[[Inductive bias]]
CATEGORIES: Machine learning, Bias

The inductive bias of a learning algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs given inputs that it has not encountered (Mitchell, 1980).
In machine learning, one aims to construct algorithms that are able to learn to predict a certain target output. To achieve this, the learning algorithm is presented some training examples that demonstrate the intended relation of input and output values. Then the learner is supposed to approximate the correct output, even for examples that have not been shown during training.  Without any additional assumptions, this task cannot be solved exactly since unseen situations might have an arbitrary output value. The kind of necessary assumptions about the nature of the target function are subsumed in the phrase inductive bias (Mitchell, 1980; desJardins and Gordon, 1995). 
A classical example of an inductive bias is Occam's Razor, assuming that the simplest consistent hypothesis about the target function is actually the best. Here consistent means that the hypothesis of the learner yields correct outputs for all of the examples that have been given to the algorithm.
Approaches to a more formal definition of inductive bias are based on mathematical logic. Here, the inductive bias is a logical formula that, together with the training data, logically entails the hypothesis generated by the learner. Unfortunately, this strict formalism fails in many practical cases, where the inductive bias can only be given as a rough description (e.g. in the case of neural networks), or not at all.

[[Cosmological principle]]

CATEGORIES: Physical cosmology, Principles

In modern physical cosmology, the cosmological principle is an axiom that embodies the working assumption or premise that the distribution of matter in the universe is homogeneous and isotropic when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe, and should, therefore, produce no observable irregularities in the large scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the Big Bang.
Astronomer William Keel explains:
 The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the Universe are the same for all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the Universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the same physical laws apply throughout. In essence, this in a sense says that the Universe is knowable and is playing fair with scientists.[tpl]cite book |title=The Road to Galaxy Formation (2nd ed.) |author=William C. Keel |isbn=978-3-540-72534-3 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis[/tpl]. p. 2. 
The cosmological principle contains three implicit qualifications and two testable consequences. The first implicit qualification is that "observers" means any observer at any location in the universe, not simply any human observer at any location on Earth: as Andrew Liddle puts it, "the cosmological principle that the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are."[tpl]cite book |title=An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.) |author=Andrew Liddle |isbn=978-0-470-84835-7 |year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons[/tpl]. p. 2.
The second implicit qualification is that "looks the same" does not mean physical structures necessarily, but the effects of physical laws in observable phenomena. Thus, wavelength ratios observed for different ionic species in the absorption spectra of quasi stellar objects (QSO or quasars) place a limit on any variation in the fine-structure constant to less than 1 part in 1 million out to a distance in space (and time) of z = 3 (about 6500 megaparsecs or 11.5 billion light years); as the fine-structure constant is determined by the relation between the speed of light (c), Planck's constant (h) and the electron charge (e), these physical constants are constrained as well.[tpl]p.2[/tpl]
The third qualification, related to the second, is that variation in physical structures can be overlooked, provided this does not imperil the uniformity of conclusions drawn from observation: the sun is different from the Earth, our galaxy is different from a black hole, some galaxies advance toward rather than recede from us, and the universe has a "foamy" texture of galaxy clusters and voids, but none of these different structures appears to violate the basic laws of physics.
The two testable structural consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ("the part of the Universe which we can see is a fair sample"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ("the same physical laws apply throughout"). The principles are distinct but closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous.
The cosmological principle is first clearly asserted in the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687) of Isaac Newton. In contrast to earlier classical or medieval cosmologies, in which Earth rested at the center of Universe, Newton conceptualized the earth as a sphere in orbital motion around the sun within an empty space that extended uniformly in all directions to immeasurably large distances. He then showed, through a series of mathematical proofs on detailed observational data of the motions of planets and comets, that their motions could be explained by a single principle of "universal gravitation" that applied as well to the orbits of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, the moon around the earth, the earth around the sun, and to falling bodies on earth. That is, he asserted the equivalent material nature of all bodies within the solar system, the identical nature of the sun and distant stars ("the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the light of the sun, ... and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their gravity, fall on each other, God hath placed those systems at immense distances from one another"), and thus the uniform extension of the physical laws of motion to a great distance beyond the observational location of earth itself.
