[[RISK (graffiti artist)]]
CATEGORIES: American graffiti artists, Living people

RISK (born Kelly Graval), also known as RISKY, is a Los Angeles-based graffiti artist and fashion entrepreneur. In the 1980s, RISK gained notoriety for his unique style and pushed the limits of graffiti: He was one of the first writers in Southern California to paint freight trains, and he pioneered writing on "heavens", or freeway overpasses. At the peak of his career he took graffiti from the streets and into the gallery with the launch of the Third Rail series of art shows, and later parlayed the name into a line of graffiti-inspired clothing.
When his family moved to Los Angeles from Louisiana in 1983, 16-year-old RISK enrolled at University High School on the city’s west side.[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/05/risk_legendary_la_street_artis.php|title=RISK, Legendary L.A. Street Artist, Laments What He Sees As L.A. City Crackdown in Shadow of MOCA's 'Art in the Streets' Show[/tpl] RISK made the high school his personal canvas, tagging his name everywhere during the day and returning at night to do pieces. In 1985, RISK and RIVAL started the graffiti crew WCA (West Coast Artists).
RISK was one of seven high school students who received a scholarship to attend the Pasadena Art Institute. RISK would later go on to study fine art at USC.
Later, RISK became involved in various Hollywood projects. His first was a photo shoot for Hot Rod magazine, and after the issue hit newsstands, he started getting more recognition as an artist outside the graffiti world. RISK continued to work on movie and music video sets, including the film Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure and videos for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ice Cube, Bad Religion and Michael Jackson.
In 1988, RISK went to New York and painted subway cars, making him the first L.A. writer to have his work run, and probably the last (in 1989, the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority mandated that all subway cars be free of graffiti before they ran). The following year, RISK and SLICK were invited to travel to the U.K. to represent the U.S. at the Bridlington International Street Art Competition. They won the competition and took home a silver cup and silver spray can as trophies.
Back in L.A., RISK continued to push the boundaries of graffiti, and he and fellow WCA writers embarked on a series of tours: "Bum Rush", an all-out bombing effort in the San Francisco Bay area; "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", a quest on which they hit everything from limos to private planes; and "Hitting Metal", a tour aimed at vehicles, street signs, heavens and any other metal objects they could find.
Meanwhile, RISK had started putting his graffiti on canvases and co-founded Third Rail, a series of gallery shows. Knowing that many of the people at the shows could not afford his canvases, RISK started making T-shirts. RISK turned Third Rail into a successful clothing brand, with RISK winning designer of the year awards and sponsoring celebrities like Kid Rock.
On December 13, 2008, Track 16 gallery in Santa Monica hosted RISK's first solo show Twenty-Six. The title of the show referred to the length of RISK's career and his lifelong dedication to letterforms. "Twenty-Six is a celebration of where I'm at today and where I have come from," RISK explained. "I have been painting for 26 years; there are 26 letters in the alphabet—I could not pick a better way to define myself and my view of graffiti art."http://track16.com/exhibitions/2008-12-13-RISK/pr.php

[[Shoot and protect]]

CATEGORIES: Film production

Shoot and protect is a technique used in video and film production, in which the material is shot in such a way that the areas of interest within a frame lie within a rectangular "protected area" within the frame, with margins at top and bottom and both sides. The action safe and caption safe areas then lie within this protected area. This allows the resulting material to be cropped to any of a wide range of aspect ratios, whether wider or narrower than the shooting format, without losing the most important features of each shot or having to resort to pan and scan or letterboxing. A 14:9 safe area is often chosen as a compromise between 4:3 and 16:9 frame formats.

SHI was founded in 1997 by Florence Reed, who discovered first-hand the consequences of tropical deforestation while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Panamá in the early 1990s. 
Following completion of her Peace Corps service, Reed sought to bring about significant and permanent change throughout Central America. She met with a group of villages in Honduras that desired to implement sustainable techniques. Reed then promoted the project to an interested group of people that included university professors, small business owners, and non-profit executives. In May 1997, this group formed a Board of Directors and Sustainable Harvest International was incorporated as a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization. 
Since its inception, SHI has expanded its reach beyond a single program in Honduras, and now includes programs in Panamá, Belize and Nicaragua. SHI has also established La Fundacion Cosecha Sostenible Honduras (the Sustainable Harvest Honduras Foundation) as an independent affiliate which, following a transition period, has become responsible for its own management and funding. 
A primary objective of SHI is to facilitate implementation of a program that allows poor farmers to take responsibility for reversing environmental degradation and achieving economic viability within their own neighborhoods and countries.

BearManor Media is a book publishing company founded by Ben Ohmart in 2001. Specializing in media-related biographies, BearManor Media is located in Albany, Georgia and Duncan, Oklahoma.
Ohmart developed his back list of almost 600 titles because of his own frustration with the publishing industry: "I started this publishing company in 2001, as a writer. I learned how hard it was to tap into the mainstream market with what is essentially nostalgia fodder. So I published The Great Gildersleeve myself. Then I learned something important. I seemed to enjoy the publishing side more than the writing side, so, when I began to get offers to publish other people's work (Jane Kean was one of the first), I began doing what I love full time." Ohmart, Ben. BearManor Media Since then, the company has grown by leaps and bounds, expanding to include books of scripts, episode guides, film reviews, and celebrity interviews. Well-known authors of BearManor Media autobiographies include actor Charles Napier, voice actress Jean Foray, director James Sheldon, percussionist Emil Richards, dancer Miriam Nelson, child actresses Beverly Washburn and Sybil Jason, musician Al Lerner, and Dale Evans' manager, Dick Baxter.

[[Mary Main]]

CATEGORIES: Developmental psychologists, Attachment theory, University of California, Berkeley faculty, Living people, 1943 births, Scientists from California

Mary Main (born 1943) is a researcher at University of California, Berkeley.
Together with Judith Solomon, Main identified and empiricized a fourth attachment style in children, namely an insecure disorganized attachment classification. In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganised' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganised/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. However, Lyons-Ruth has qualified that '52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior'.[ref]Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Jean-Francois Bureau, M. Ann Easterbrooks, Ingrid Obsuth, Kate Hennighausen & Lauriane Vulliez-Coady (2013) Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity:
distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal, Attachment & Human Development, 15:5-6, 570[/ref]
There is a growing body of research on the links between abnormal parenting, disorganized attachment and risks for later psychopathologies. Abuse is associated with disorganized attachment; yet a parent’s ongoing experience of an anxiety-disorder or multiple forms of social and economic disadvantage  have also been found to predict disorganised attachment in the infant Cyr, C., Euser, E. M., Bakermans-Kranenburg, M. J., & Van IJzendoorn, M. H. (2010). Attachment security and disorganization in maltreating and high-risk families: A series of meta-analyses. Development and Psychopathology, 22, 87-108[ref]Manassis K., Bradley S., Goldberg S., Hood J., Swinson R. (1994) Attachment to mothers with anxiety disorders and their children. Journal of the American Academy of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry 33: 1106–13[/ref] - which is why it is not appropriate to use disorganised attachment as a screening tool for abuse.[ref]Main, M., Hesse, E. & Hesse, S. (2011) Attachment theory and research: Overview with suggested 
applications to child custody. Family Court Review, 49(3): 426–463[/ref] The disorganized style is a risk factor for a range of psychological disorders although it is not in itself considered an attachment disorder under the current classification. For example, longitudinal research by Sroufe, Egeland and Carlson has found that a classification of disorganised/disoriented attachment in infancy has a .36 association with dissociative symptoms in adolescence.Sroufe, A. Egeland, B., Carlson, E. & Collins, W.A. (2005) The Development of the Person, NY: Guilford Press
Mary Main is also co-author of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) which uses questionnaire and interview to assess attachment status of adults.  Developed by Carol George, Nancy Kaplan, and Mary Main in 1984, this is a quasi-clinical semi-structured interview that takes about one hour to administer. It involves about twenty questions and has extensive research validation to support it. The AAI Protocol is available for review.

[[Hochstift]]

CATEGORIES: Holy Roman Empire, History of territories in Germany ruled by an ecclesiastic sovereign

In the Holy Roman Empire the German term Hochstift (plural: Hochstifte or, in some regions, Hochstifter) was often used to denote the territory of secular authority held by bishops ruling a prince-bishopric as their temporalities. The boundaries of secular prince-bishoprics did usually not correspond to that of the spiritual dioceses. Prince-bishoprics were always smaller than the dioceses which included (parts of) neighbouring imperial states such as principalities of secular princes and Free Imperial Cities. Prince-bishoprics could also include areas belonging in ecclesiastical respect to other dioceses.E.g., about 10% of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen was in ecclesiastical respect part of the Diocese of Verden.  
"Das Stift" die Stifte or, in some regions, die Stifter/"het sticht" Dutch (literally, the 'donation'), denotes in its original meaning the donated or else acquired fund of estates whose revenues are taken to maintain a college and the pertaining church (Stiftskirche, i.e. collegiate church) and its collegiate canons (Stiftsherren) or canonesses (Stiftsfrauen).Victor Dollmayr, Friedrich Krüer, Heinrich Meyer and Walter Paetzel, Deutsches Wörterbuch (started by the Brothers Grimm): 33 vols. (1854–1971), vol. 18 'Stehung–Stitzig', Leipzig: Hirzel, 1941, cols. 2870seq., reprint: Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv; No. 5945), 1984. ISBN 3-423-05945-1. If the Stift as a fund served to maintain the specific college of a cathedral (a so-called cathedral chapter) then the Stift was often called "das Domstift" (i.e. cathedral donation fund). 
If the chapter and/or the bishop of a cathedral managed not only to gain the estates and their revenues but also the feudal overlordship to them as a secular ruler with imperial recognition, such estates formed a territorial principality within the Holy Roman Empire with the rank of an imperial state. Each prince-bishop (Fürstbischof) or prince-archbishop (Fürsterzbischof) was thus also called a prince of the church, although the princely rank derived from imperial investiture. 
"Hochstift" is a compound with "hoch" ("high") used for a prince-bishopric, meaning literally a high ecclesiastical donation of estates.Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsches Wörterbuch: 33 vols. (1854–1971), vol. 10 'H–Juzen', Leipzig: Hirzel, 1877, col. 1634, reprint: Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv; No. 5945), 1984. ISBN 3-423-05945-1. Whereas Erzstift, a compound with "Erz…" ("archi…"), was the corresponding expression for a prince-archbishopric.Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsches Wörterbuch: 33 vols. (1854–1971), vol. 3 'E–Forsche', Leipzig: Hirzel, 1862, col. 1099, reprint: Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv; No. 5945), 1984. ISBN 3-423-05945-1. For the three prince-electorates of Cologne (Kurköln), Mainz (Kurmainz) and Trier (Kurtrier), which were simultaneously archbishoprics the corresponding term is Kurerzstift (electorate-archbishopric). The adjective pertaining to Stift as a territory is stiftisch (of, pertaining to a prince-bishopric; prince-episcopal).Victor Dollmayr, Friedrich Krüer, Heinrich Meyer and Walter Paetzel, Deutsches Wörterbuch (started by the Brothers Grimm): 33 vols. (1854–1971), vol. 18 'Stehung–Stitzig', Leipzig: Hirzel, 1941, col. 2896, reprint: Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv; No. 5945), 1984. ISBN 3-423-05945-1. As a component the term Stift today usually takes the copulative "s" when used as a preceding compound,Victor Dollmayr, Friedrich Krüer, Heinrich Meyer and Walter Paetzel, Deutsches Wörterbuch (started by the Brothers Grimm): 33 vols. (1854–1971), vol. 18 'Stehung–Stitzig', Leipzig: Hirzel, 1941, col. 2874, reprint: Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv; No. 5945), 1984. ISBN 3-423-05945-1. such as in Stiftsadel (vassal nobility of a prince-bishopric), Stiftsamtmann (=official of a Stift), Stiftsmann (plural: Stiftsleute; =vassal tenant of an estate of a StiftVictor Dollmayr, Friedrich Krüer, Heinrich Meyer and Walter Paetzel, Deutsches Wörterbuch (started by the Brothers Grimm): 33 vols. (1854–1971), vol. 18 'Stehung–Stitzig', Leipzig: Hirzel, 1941, cols. 2897seq., reprint: Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv; No. 5945), 1984. ISBN 3-423-05945-1.), Stiftssasse (=subject/inhabitant of a prince-bishopric), Stiftsstände (=estates of a prince-bishopric as a realmVictor Dollmayr, Friedrich Krüer, Heinrich Meyer and Walter Paetzel, Deutsches Wörterbuch (started by the Brothers Grimm): 33 vols. (1854–1971), vol. 18 'Stehung–Stitzig', Leipzig: Hirzel, 1941, col. 2900, reprint: Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv; No. 5945), 1984. ISBN 3-423-05945-1.), or Stiftstag (diet of the estates of a prince-bishopric). 
Specific prince-bishoprics were often called "Hochstift/Erzstift X", as in "Hochstift Ermland" or in "Erzstift Bremen", with stiftbremisch meaning of/pertaining to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, as opposed to stadtbremisch (of/pertaining to the city of Bremen). Whereas the spiritual entities, the dioceses, are called in German "Bistum" (diocese) or "Erzbistum" (archdiocese). The difference between a Hochstift/Erzstift and a Bistum/Erzbistum is not always clear to authors so that non-scholarly texts often translate Hochstift or Erzstift incorrectly simply as diocese/bishopric or archdiocese/archbishopric, respectively.

[[Reuptake enhancer]]
CATEGORIES: Drugs by mechanism of action, Psychopharmacology

A reuptake enhancer (RE), also sometimes referred to as a reuptake activator, is a type of drug which enhances the plasmalemmal transporter-mediated reuptake of a neurotransmitter from the synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron, leading to a decrease in the extracellular concentrations of the neurotransmitter and therefore a decrease in neurotransmission.
The antidepressant tianeptine was once claimed to be a (selective) serotonin reuptake enhancer (SRE or SSRE), but the role of serotonin reuptake in its mechanism is doubtful. Tianeptine has no affinity to the serotonin transporter, neither increases nor decreases extracellular levels of serotonin in cortico-limbic structures of conscious rats, and it didn't show any other long-term effect on the serotonin pathway.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/mp.2009.80[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Mountains of France

Mont Gargan is a peak in the Massif central, situated in the western border of the plateau de Millevaches, between Saint-Gilles-les-Forêts and Sussac in Haute-Vienne. Mont Gargan is situated in the parc naturel régional de Millevaches en Limousin. Its occitan name is puèg Gerjant and it is the subject of numerous legends.
Mont Gargan has an altitude of 731 metres; at the summit are the ruins of a chapel built between 1868 and 1871 by Louis Joyeux with the support of the population, and dedicated to Notre-Dame du Bon Secours. The chapel became damaged but was restored in 1992 by the Haute-Vienne general council and by the Friends of Mont Gargan. Since 1986, the chapel has been the property of the Haute-Vienne department. 
The summit was at one time covered with heather and gorse, which have since given way to a prairie. A stele recalls the Second World War battle of Mont Gargan fought between the German army and the maquis resistance fighters led by Georges Guingouin.
Contrary to what is widely stated in books and maps, Mount Gargan is not the highest point in Haute-Vienne; the forest of Crozat and the puy de Lauzat, 25 kilometres to the north-east near Nedde, are higher, at 777 metres above sea level.

He was educated at Eton College, Oxford and the University of Iowa. His first novel The Fourth of June was a best seller and he adapted it for the London stage. It has hust (203) been republished by Valancourt Books. His second novel, You're a Big Boy Now, was made into a 1966 feature film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. He was an assistant to Trevor Nunn at the Royal Shakespeare Company. He has also worked as a commissioning editor for Drama at  Channel 4, and ran the Book at Bedtime series for BBC Radio 4.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.egmont.co.uk/contributor.asp?contid=246|title=David Benedictus author profile|publisher=Egmont Publishing|accessdate=21 October 2009[/tpl]

Although he made some changes in the popular children's series by adding a new figure: Lottie, the Otter. David Benedictus said that he would be on the alert if Disney showed any sign of including an otter in the new Winnie the Pooh films.
Upon the book's publication he admitted to nerves over its reception, saying, "What's the worst thing that can happen, that I'll be torn apart by wild journalists? Happened before and I survived. At worst everyone will hate me and I'll just crawl under a bush and hide – I can live with that. Some people do hate the whole idea of a sequel, but it's not as if I'm doing any damage to the original, that will still be there. My hope is that people will finish reading a cracking story and just want more of them, and that's where I come in." Michael Brown, chairman of the Pooh Properties Trust, said Benedictus had a "wonderful feel" for the world of Pooh.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/books/05pooh.html?hpw |title=The Same Pooh Bear, but an Otter Has Arrived |last=Lee |first=Felicia |date=4 October 2009 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=21 October 2009[/tpl]

He published an autobiography, Dropping Names, in 2005.
He is fond of chess and plays for a South London chess club. He also invented Uncle Ernie's System for finding winners at the races,  and ran it for some 20 years before handing it on.
Benedictus commented on his work in 1985, "Given peace of mind, financial independence, and a modicum of luck, I may produce a novel to be proud of one day."Kirkpatrick, D. L.; Vinson, James. Contemporary Novelists (1986), p. 93./ In March, 2014, he moved to Hove, a resort on the south coast, to be close to his extending family.

In its 12 years of existence, SASVO provided opportunities for over 9,000 students to be responsible and committed citizens. SASVO  promoted values like volunteerism, Self-reliance, Love of Africa, Regional cooperation and unity, Interchange of people of diverse backgrounds, Responsibility towards community, Leadership development, Gender equality, and Physical involvement in development.

The technique relies on the ability of adenine (A) and thymine (T) (complementary basepairs) on different DNA fragments to hybridize and, in the presence of ligase, become ligated together. PCR products are usually amplified using Taq DNA polymerase which preferentially adds an adenine to the 3' end of the product. Such PCR amplified inserts are cloned into linearized vectors that have complementary 3' thymine overhangs.

A Tartan ([tpl]Hebrew name|תַּרְתָּן[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Θαρθαν[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-la|Tharthan[/tpl]), Aramaic: ܬܵܪܬܵܢ Tartan; was the commander-in-chief of the Assyrian army. In the Bible, the Assyrian king sends a Tartan with two other officials to deliver a threatening message to Jerusalem,[tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17|[/tpl] and Sargon II, the king of Assyria, sends a Tartan who takes Ashdod.[tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|20:1|[/tpl]
In Assyria, the Tartan ranked next to the king. The office seems to have been duplicated, and 
there was a tartanu imni or 'tartan of the right', as well as a tartanu shumeli or 'tartan of the left'. In later times the title became territorial; we read of a tartan of 'Kummuh' (Commagene). The title is also applied to the commanders of foreign armies ; thus Sargon speaks of the Tartan Musurai, or 'Egyptian Tartan'. The Tartan of 720 BC was probably called Ashur-iska-danin; in 694 BC, Abdai, and in 686 BC Bel-emurani, held the title. It does not seem to have been in use among the closely related Babylonians.

As noted by one reviewer, "...the blind musician will be remembered best for playing searing guitar on his lap, looking like a pedal steel guitar man gone mad. Songs from the Road...captures Healey's gift for energizing rock and blues tunes with powerful, sometimes blistering guitar work.  It's a talent that occasionally sneaks up on the listener."Dennis Smith, Review of Songs From The Road; Toronto Blues Music Examiner, as reprinted at www.stonyplainrecords.com.

The primary characters of the American television comedy series Parks and Recreation are the employees of the parks department of Pawnee, a fictional Indiana town. The protagonist is Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy parks director as well as serving on city council, and the rest of the ensemble cast consists of her friends and co-workers, including nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), parks director Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), and parks department employees Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir), and Donna Meagle (Retta).
While most of the main cast have been with the series since it debuted in April 2009, actors Rob Lowe and Adam Scott joined the cast late in the second season portraying Chris Traeger and Ben Wyatt, two state auditors who later take jobs in Pawnee. Paul Schneider was a permanent cast member during the first two seasons as city planner Mark Brendanawicz, but he departed at the end of season two. The majority of Parks and Recreation episodes are set in Pawnee, and most of the recurring and supporting characters are friends of the main characters or residents of the town.
Several guest stars have made appearances on the show, including Louis C.K., John Larroquette, Justin Theroux and Parker Posey. Megan Mullally, Offerman's real-life wife, played his character's ex-wife Tammy Swanson, and Poehler's former husband Will Arnett made an appearance as a man on a blind date with Leslie.

Mignon Nevada (14 August 1886 – 25 June 1971) was an English operatic soprano. She was born in Paris, daughter of the American operatic soprano Emma Nevada and her English husband Raymond Palmer. She was named after the title character of the 1866 opera Mignon, written by her godfather, French composer Ambroise Thomas. Her voice was light and agile, and her mother trained her to be a coloratura soprano, although Sir Thomas Beecham thought this was a mistake, that she should have been a mezzo-soprano instead.

[[Phonocardiogram]]
CATEGORIES: Cardiac procedures, Medical tests

A Phonocardiogram or PCG  is a plot of high fidelity recording of the sounds and murmurs made by the heart with the help of the machine called phonocardiograph, or "Recording of the sounds made by the heart during a cardiac cycle." The sounds are thought to result from vibrations created by closure of the heart valves. There are at least two: the first when the atrioventricular valves close at the beginning of systole and the second when the aortic valve and pulmonary valve close at the end of systole. It allows the detection of subaudible sounds and murmurs, and makes a permanent record of these events. In contrast, the ordinary stethoscope cannot detect such sounds or murmurs, and provides no record of their occurrence. The ability to quantitate the sounds made by the heart provides information not readily available from more sophisticated tests, and provides vital information about the effects of certain cardiac drugs upon the heart. It is also an effective method for tracking the progress of the patient's disease.

[[Perseus with the Head of Medusa]]
CATEGORIES: Renaissance sculptures, Sculptures in Italy

Benvenuto Cellini’s 1545 bronze sculpture of Perseus with the head of Medusa on a square base with bronze relief panels is located in the Loggia dei Lanzi of the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, Italy. Also, below the main sculptural event a small relief of the story of Perseus and Andromeda resides, similar to a predella on an altarpiece.Shearman, “Art or Politics,”. The second Florentine duke, Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici, commissioned the work with specific political connections to the other sculptural works in the piazza. When the piece was revealed to the public on 27 April 1554, Michelangelo’s David, Bandinelli’s Hercules and Cacus, and Donatello’s Judith and Holofernes were already erected in the piazza.Shearman, p. 28. 
The subject matter of the work is the mythological story of Perseus beheading Medusa, a hideous woman-faced Gorgon whose hair was turned to snakes and anyone that looked at her was turned to stone.  Perseus stands naked except for a sash and winged sandals, triumphant on top of the body of Medusa with her snakey head in his raised hand. The body of Medusa spews blood from her severed neck. The bronze sculpture and Medusa’s head turns men to stone and is appropriately surrounded by three huge marble statues of men: Hercules, David and later Neptune.Shearman, p. 28. Cellini breathed new life into the piazza visitor through his new use of bronze in Perseus and the head of Medusa and the motifs he used to respond to the previous sculpture in the piazza. 
The sculpture is thought to be the first statue since classical times where the base included figurative sculpture forming an integral part of the work.

Come on Do the Jerk (Tamla 54109) was a 1964 song recorded by R&B group the Miracles on Motown Records' Tamla label subsidiary. A single-only release, it did not appear on any original Miracles studio album, and was the group's last single release of 1964.http://s3.excoboard.com/exco/archive.php?ac=t&forumid=29211&date=07-08-2011&t=718833-5
Co-written by Miracles members Marv Tarplin, Bobby Rogers, Smokey Robinson, and Ron White, "Come On Do The Jerk" charted at #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at # 22 on the Cash Box R&B chart.(Billboard had temporarily suspended its R&B chart at this time). An instructional dance number, this song was one of several songs based on the jerk, a very popular 1960s "dance craze".http://motownjunkies.co.uk/2012/08/03/511/
Described by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson as the intended follow-up song to the group's 1963 million-selling smash "Mickey's Monkey" the previous year, "Come On Do the Jerk" was actually recorded in a similar tempo. As the song begins, longtime Miracles drummer Donald "Spike" Whited and Miracles member, guitarist Marv Tarplin begin the song, while Smokey, as the song's narrator, offers the invitation:
The other Miracles, Ronnie White, Claudette Robinson, Pete Moore, and Bobby Rogers, echo Smokey's lead,  with chants of the song's title, in classic call and response style. 
Then, midway through the song, Smokey's role changes... from narrator to dance instructor, as he instructs the listener on the Jerk's simple dance steps:
The Righteous Brothers, Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield, performed a cover of this song on a 1964 telecast of the ABC TV series, Shindig!.(available on YouTube).[tpl]YouTube|oU6SG5Th6Zo[/tpl][tpl]YouTube|oU6SG5Th6Zo[/tpl]
The Miracles themselves performed Come On Do The Jerk on a telecast of the syndicated Detroit - based teen dance party show Teen Town .[tpl]YouTube|B1RxYKDMIQU[/tpl] The song appears on several Miracles "Greatest Hits" collections, having first appeared on their album, Greatest Hits Vol.2
The song's flip side, "Baby Don't You Go", was also a popular regional hit.[tpl]YouTube|gkwxxfB4l8c[/tpl]

[[Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo]]

CATEGORIES: 2009 television episodes, Time travel television episodes, Phineas and Ferb episodes, Dystopian fiction

"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" is the fourteenth episode of the second season of the animated television series Phineas and Ferb, and the 72nd overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Disney XD in the United States on September 21, 2009. In the episode, Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb travel into the future and have their time machine stolen by their older sister Candace, now an adult, who travels back in time to get her brothers in trouble during one of their outlandish schemes. In doing so, however, she sets off a chain reaction leading to a dystopian future ruled by the evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz.
"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo," written by Scott Peterson and directed by Zac Moncrief, was rated TV-G in the United States. The episode was conceived as a means of expanding the time machine plot that was introduced previously in the episode "It's About Time." Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, co-founders of Phineas and Ferb, centralized plot elements to satire time travel films, such as The Time Machine (1960) and the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990). Multiple scenes in the episode were meant to be rather confusing and difficult to understand in order to interest viewers so they would watch the episode multiple times, trying to learn something new each time.
The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. In its original broadcast, it ranked fourth in the key demographics Boys 6-14, Kids 6-11 and Boys 6-11, totaling 599,000 viewers, an 88 percent increase from that of the previous year's ratings in the timeslot. When it premiered on Disney Channel, it was the thirteenth highest-ranked cable program for the entire week. It guest starred actors Jennifer Stone, Moises Arias, Noah Munck, and Jennifer Grey, along with the band Bowling for Soup, who appeared as themselves playing an extended version of the series' theme song, "Today is Gonna Be a Great Day," which was also included on the official Phineas and Ferb soundtrack which was released on September 22, 2009.

She was the only Coast and Geodetic Survey ship to bear the name and the last sailing vessel owned and operated by the Survey.
Matchless was built at Key West, Florida, in 1859. The Coast and Geodetic Survey acquired her in 1885 and placed her in service that year. She was rebuilt at a cost of $50,000 (USD) in 1895.
On February 28, 1915, officers and crew of Matchless helped put out a fire on Main Street in Edenton, North Carolina.  On September 16, 1917, she helped the steamer White Wings off a shoal. 
While returning from Roanoke Island to Elizabeth City, North Carolina after completion of work in Croatan and Roanoke Sounds the Matchless was caught and held in ice from about December 24, 1917 until January 17, 1918. The ship then engaged in surveys requested by the Navy in the lower Chesapeake Bay, the York River and Mattaponi River during the first half of 1918.[tpl]cite book |title=Annual Report of the Superintendent, United States Coast And Geodetic Survey To The Secretary of Commerce For The Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1918 |last=United States Coast And Geodetic Survey |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1918 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington |isbn= |page= |pages=47–48 |url= |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl]
In her last years Matchless was used "as a house-boat" from which parties surveyed inland waters. She was surveyed and condemned in 1919, retired from Coast and Geodetic Survey service and sold June 28, 1919. The crew from the Matchless transferred to the steamer USC&GS Onward with the task of continuing the surveys in the York River and west shore of Chesapeake Bay.

It includes 8 species that occur primarily in Mexico, but some extend into Central America and one reaches north into the western U.S.A.Stuessy, T. F. 1978. Revision of Lagascea (Compositae, Heliantheae). Fieldiana, Botany 38: 75–133.  One species, L. mollis, has been widely introduced to other localities around the tropics and subtropics.  Lagascea is a member of the same subtribe Helianthinae as the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus, but it looks different because it has heads that are reduced to have 1 (or 2) flowers, and are clustered into compound units that mimic heads and are sometimes called syncephalia.Harris, E. M. 1994. Developmental evidence for the derivation of syncephalia in Lagascea (Heliantheae; Asteraceae). American Journal of Botany 81: 1139–1148.  The relationships of Lagascea are not well established, but the published work from molecular phylogenetic studies places it as the sister genus to Tithonia.Schilling, E. E. and J. L. Panero. 1996. Phylogenetic reticulation in subtribe Helianthinae. American Journal of Botany 83: 939-948.  Two of the species are herbs, distinguished from each other by features of the heads, and the remaining species are shrubs and are distinguished primarily by vegetative features. The genus is named after the Spanish botanist Mariano Lagasca (1776-1839).Genaust, Helmut (1976). Etymologisches Wörterbuch der botanischen Pflanzennamen ISBN 3-7643-0755-2

Lawrencella is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family endemic to Australia. 
The genus comprises two species: Lawrencella davenportii with a distribution in arid regions of Western Australia, The Northern Territory, and South Australia and Lawrencella rosea which is restricted to Southern Western Australia. Wilson, P.G. 1998 “The  Lawrencella complex (Asteraceae: Gnaphalieae: Angianthinae) of Australia” Nuytsia 8:3
Both species are annual herbs growing to approximately 40cm in height. The strap-shaped leaves up to 10cm in length are covered with short hairs.  Flower heads are produce don stalks well above the main leaves, and have yellow centres with pink or occasionally white bracts. Flowering usually occurs in spring or summer in years with good cool season rain. Corrick, M.G., Alexander, B. 2002. “Wildflowers of Southern Western Australia” Five Mile Press, Noble Park.http://asgap.org.au/l-ros.html
Both species have horticultural potential for their colourful flower displays and their drought hardiness. However, difficulties in germination of seed have restricted their widespread cultivation to datehttp://asgap.org.au/l-ros.html http://www.ngia.com.au/files/nurserypapers/NP_1996_06.pdf
The genus Lawrencella is closely related to two other Australian genera, Schoenia and Bellida.

USC&GS ''Taku'' was a United States Coast and Geodetic Survey survey ship in service from 1898 to 1917. She was the only Coast and Geodetic Survey ship to bear the name.
Taku was built by George Kneass at San Francisco, California, at a cost of $11,844.35 (USD) in 1898. The Coast and Geodetic Survey placed her in service that year. She spent her Survey career in the Pacific, primarily in the waters of the Territory of Alaska.
On July 15, 1898 Taku arrived "in disabled condition" at St. Michael, Alaska while the new steamer Yukon was being assembled. Urgent repairs to Taku slightly delayed assembly of Yukon. On July 30 she was seaworthy and Taku sailed at 2 p. m. on August 1, 1898 with a field party first to erect signals and do triangulation on St. Michael and Stuart Islands after which she departed for the mouth of the KwiklokOne of the outlets in the Yukon delta, now spelled Kwikluak (Geographic dictionary of Alaska) for regular survey work.[tpl]cite book |title=Report Of The Superintendent of the Coast And Geodetic Survey Showing The Progress Of Work From July 1, 1898 To June 30, 1899 |last=U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1899 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn= |pages=213, 231 |url= |accessdate=5 March 2012[/tpl]

The American Federation of School Administrators or AFSA represents public school principals, vice principals, administrators, and supervisors in the United States. The trade union belongs to the AFL-CIO as one of the organizations smallest members.
The union was established by the Council of Supervisory Associations, a local union representing principals and other supervisors in the New York City Department of Education.  Rather than becoming a directly affiliated local union, the AFL-CIO chartered the organization as the School Administrators and Supervisors Organizing Committee.
Because the Taft–Hartley Act does not recognize supervisors as union-eligible under federal law, AFSA only negotiates collective bargaining agreements in states where local labor rules permit them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/taft-hartley-signed-60-years-ago/|title=Taft-Hartley Signed 60 Years Ago|last=Gruenberg|first=Mark|date=2007-06-11|publisher=Political Affairs Magazine|accessdate=2012-06-06[/tpl]  In most areas, the organization functions as a professional association rather than a traditional union.  A majority of the union's memership remains in New York City, however.
The organization publishes The AFSA Administrator and presents the Distinguished Leadership Award to highlight member achievements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050503006299/en/AFSA-Announces-Winners-School-Administrator-Leadership-Award|title=AFSA Announces Winners of School Administrator Leadership Award|last=|first=|date=2005-05-03|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=2012-06-06[/tpl]

Amadeus III (c.1300–18 January 1367) was the Count of Geneva from 1320 until his death. He ruled the Genevois, but not the city of Geneva proper, and it was during his time that the term "Genevois" came to be used as it is today. He was the eldest son and successor of William III and Agnes, daughter of Amadeus V of Savoy. He played a major rôle in the politics of the House of Savoy, serving consecutively as regent and president of the council, and also sitting on the feudal tribunal—one of three tribunals of the Audiences générales—of the Duchy of Aosta.

Brian J. Preski is President of Cerberus Government Strategies, LLC and Director of Government Affairs at Patch Management, Inc. Currently, he is not engaged in the practice of law. At Cerberus Government Strategies, LLC, he focuses his practice on assisting public companies, nonprofit organizations and private entities in Pennsylvania with interpreting and complying with various state regulations and expansion of business opportunities.
Prior to joining the firm, Mr. Preski served as Chief of Staff to Pennsylvania House Speaker John M. Perzel. As Chief of Staff to the Speaker and Majority Leader, Mr. Preski was intimately involved in every substantial piece of legislation enacted in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from 1995 through 2006. These enactments resulted in the successful turnaround of the Philadelphia School System, the successful labor agreement of the Pennsylvania Convention Center, the creation of casino gaming within the Commonwealth under the Gaming Control Act, the enactment of medical malpractice reforms, tort reforms, the Electric and Gas Deregulation Acts, revisions to the Commonwealth Tax Code as well as a multitude of other enactments. Moreover, Mr. Preski acted as the caucus' chief staff negotiator for the Commonwealth's $25 billion general fund budget during these years. 
Mr. Preski has a long history of state government service. During his tenure as Chief of Staff to the Speaker, he was also called upon to also act as the Chief Clerk to the House of Representatives. Mr. Preski was asked to accept this dual role, upon the retirement of the prior long-serving Chief Clerk, when he was recognized as the proper person with the requisite management experience, temperament and ability to administer the procedural and administrative operations for the nonpartisan House Core employees. Indeed, the history-making appointment of Mr. Preski to the position occurred when the opposing political leaders could not agree on any other person to fill this role as a search was conducted for a new Chief Clerk. Prior to his time in the Speaker's Office, he served as Chief of Staff to the Office of the Majority Leader and Chief Counsel to the Committee on the Judiciary. During his time on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Preski worked with Governor Thomas Ridge and wrote many of the laws enacted during the extremely successful "1995 Special Session on Crime." This special session of the Commonwealth's General Assembly saw the enactment of 37 new crimes laws within the Commonwealth, including streamlining death penalty appeals, Megan's Law, "Three Strikes and You're Out" sentencing and direct filing of juvenile offenders. 
Mr. Preski began his legal career in Philadelphia, where he served in the District Attorney's Office as an assistant district attorney in multiple administrations. Starting as a new attorney, Mr. Preski was tapped to represent the District Attorney and the citizens of Philadelphia in the federal courts as the City fought a cap on prison crowding. Although at the time assigned to the Civil Litigation Unit, Mr. Preski was also asked to accept the duties of Assistant Chief of the Prison Litigation Unit. As a new attorney, Mr. Preski immediately began his practice in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals representing the District Attorney and the office in civil rights litigation. 
Mr. Preski was requested by Attorney General Michael Fisher to serve upon the Attorney General's Task Force on School Safety; by Pennsylvania Supreme Court Chief Justice Ralph J. Cappy on the Intergovernmental Task Force to Study the District Justice System and by Speaker Perzel to co-chair the Speaker's "Lawyers who Lobby" Task Force.
Mr. Preski is an active member of the Philadelphia business community, having served as chair of the board of directors of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority. During his tenure as Chairman, the Port Authority saw a more than 15 percent increase in cargo flow and he instituted the channel deepening project. 
Mr. Preski also served as vice president of the board of directors of the Delaware River Maritime Enterprise Council; as vice chair of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Criminal Rules Procedural Committee and as a member of the board of directors of Evangelical Services for the Aging/Wesley Enhanced Living. He also currently serves as a member of the board of directors of the Drexel University School of Medicine; the board of directors of Historic Fort Mifflin; the board of directors of Nazareth Hospital/Mercy Health Systems; the board of directors of WYBE; and is Vice-Chairman of the board of directors of the Greater Philadelphia Film Office. 
In recognition of his community activities, Mr. Preski was awarded the 2006 Alumnus of the Year Award by the Widener University School of Law; the 2006 Spirit of Life Award by the City of Hope National Cancer Treatment Center; the 2001 Distinguished Service Award by the Fraternal Order of Police; and the 1997 Distinguished Service Award by the Pennsylvania District Attorney's Association. 
He is a graduate of Widener University School of Law (J.D., 1992) and St. Joseph's University (B.A., 1987).

[[Order of the Black Swan]]

CATEGORIES: Orders, decorations, and medals of Savoy, 1350 establishments

The Order of the Black Swan ([tpl]lang-fr|Companie du Cigne Noir or Compaignie du Cine[/tpl]) was a short-lived chivalric order founded by Amadeus VI of Savoy in 1350. It was defunct by 1364, when Amadeus founded the Order of the Collar in its stead. Along with Amadeus, Amadeus III of Geneva and Galeazzo Visconti were the "great lords" (grans seignours) of the Order. At the time of its founding, the existence of black swans was unknown to Europeans. 
The order was originally composed of fourteen knights. The requirements of membership were the possession of a charger and a palfrey, and the ability to serve at one's own expense for one week whenever required. The Order did collect dues (at least from noblemen, riches hommes) for purposes estreordinaire (extraordinary) according to rank (puissance): eight écus from a knight banneret, four from what they called a chivallier simple, and one from any squire. Annually on Saint Andrew's Day the knights assembled and approved expenditures. In the meantime, the monies were stored in several religious establishments. 
The Order's emblem was a black swan with red beak and feet on a white field, and members (compaignons) were required to display it, usually on their shields. Members swore an oath to defend each other, even against relatives beyond the degree of first cousin, and to submit all disputes between themselves to the judgement of the membership. Any knight who refused to abide by the arbitration of the others was expelled and his former comrades joined in arms against him.

It is endemic to San Clemente Island, one of the Channel Islands of California. It grows along steep, rocky cliffsides and canyons on the island. It is a shrub producing a fleshy, woolly stem usually over a meter in height, often approaching two meters. Leaves occur in tufts at the ends of the stem branches. They are up to 15 centimeters long, oblong in shape, and sometimes very shallowly lobed. They are woolly when new but lose their hairs and become shiny green with age. The inflorescence is a large array of up to 35 flower heads. Each head has a cylindrical base under a centimeter long and contains 9 to 12 light lavender or pinkish flowers. Each flower is a ray floret with an erect tube and a strap-shaped ligule with a toothed tip. The ligule is just under a centimeter long. The fruit is a cylindrical, ribbed achene with a white pappus.
Like many Channel Islands endemics, this plant was reduced to rarity by the presence of feral goats on the islands; the goats have been removed.The Nature Conservancy

The Institute of Transport Management is a non-profit organisation founded in the United Kingdom in 1977 to aid in oversee and reform the standards in the transport industry. It is based in Balsall Heath in the West Midlands.[tpl]cite news |title=International Fuel wins fuel technology award |author= |newspaper=St. Louis Business Journal |publisher=American City Business Journals |date=2007-10-01 |url=http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2007/10/01/daily9.html |accessdate=2009-10-17 [/tpl]
The institute's stated objectives are amongst others:
Its principal activity has been the distribution of awards to companies, nominally those with innovative transport products and services. However, companies are invited to nominate themselves and effectively to pay the institute for "accreditation" or "evaluation". Perhaps as a result, the award categories have varied from year to year and have included Chemical Distribution Company of the Year, OEM-Approved Lubricants of the Year, Fuel Card of the Year, Independent Vehicle Remarketing Company of the Year, and Warehouse Management Solutions Company of the Year.
The organisation's website lists a number of "Accredited Suppliers", many of whom are no longer in existence.

CATEGORIES: Asteraceae genera

Nabalus is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family.  It is now considered the correct name for a group of plants in North America that were formerly considered to be members of Prenanthes, and were included in that genus in the Flora North America treatment.  The common name for the genus is "White Lettuce", and reflects its close relationship to lettuce (Lactuca sativa) but having flowers that are whitish or purplish-white in some species.  Many (perhaps all) of the species are monocarpic perennials, in which an individual plant may live for multiple years in a vegetative condition but then will die after flowering and fruiting.

[[Kandy Lake]]
CATEGORIES: Lakes of Sri Lanka, Kandy, Kingdom of Kandy

Kandy Lake is a lake in the heart of the hill city of Kandy, Sri Lanka, built in 1807 by King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha of Sri Lanka next to the Temple of the Tooth. Over the years, it was reduced in size. It is a protected lake, with fishing banned. There are many legends and folklore regarding the lake. One such is that the small island at its center was used by the king's helm for bathing and was connected to the palace by secret tunnel. 
Kandy Lake, the main body of water in the city of Kandy in central Sri Lanka, is a man-made lake created in 1807 by the last Sinhalese king of Kandy, using forced labor. The king used land which was a paddy field to create the lake. It stands as an indictment[tpl]Says who|date=December 2012[/tpl] of the excesses of the Kandyan monarchy for wasting away national resources to build an ornamental lake at a time when the kingdom was under serious threat. When a hundred of his advisors advised King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe against building the lake, he had them impaled on the reservoir bund of the paddy field which he was converting into the ornamental lake. It was not long before the British captured him, with help from his own noblemen disgruntled by his irrational policies.
Kandy Lake has a perimeter of 2.1 miles and a maximum depth of 60 feet. A decorative wall, called Walakulu wall, runs for 2060 feet along the banks of the Kandy Lake. In the middle of the lake is an island housing the Royal Summer House. Sri Dalada Maligawa, or Temple of the Tooth Relic, is located beside the lake across the road. On the opposite side of the road from the Temple of the Tooth Relic is the Royal Bathhouse, which is used by the king's wives and concubines as a bathhouse. The British added one more story to the structure to house a library.
The Kandy Lake offers a place for a stroll or a jog. The shady path surrounding the lake provides a view of the hills and the town. The lake was created in 1807 by the last Sinhalese King. It is situated by the side of the Temple of the tooth relic. The Malwatte temple, one of the two head temples of the Siyam Nikaya sect of Theravada Buddhism, is also located overlooking the lake. Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, the last king of Kandy, decorated the lake with the "walakulu" (clouds) wall.
The island
One of the prettiest objects of the lake is the island. It is decorated with palm trees and bamboo thickets. King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe built a dam for the purpose of reaching the opposite side of the lake. Then as the dam was not sufficient for him, the King removed the soil from both the palace end and the Malwatte Vihare end, leaving the island behind. At first this island was supposed to be the bathing place of the Queen and the ladies of the court.
The "Walakulu" (clouds) wall
The Walakulu wall was built to increase the beauty of the Kandy Lake. It extends around half of the Lake and has taken one skilled architect to build it. The king who built the Walakulu wall couldn’t finish it because he lost the war and was forced to relinquish the Kandian kingdom. The Walakulu wall still lies unfinished. The triangular shaped holes in the Walakulu wall were used in the past for lighting oil lamps on festival days.
Queen,s bath
The queen’s bath is situated partly in the waters of the Kandy Lake. The wives of Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe used the queen’s bath. The British added another storey which was used as a library.

[[Servius Maluginensis]]

CATEGORIES: Roman patricians, Imperial Roman consuls, 1st-century BC Romans, 1st-century Romans

Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis  was a Roman patrician who flourished in the reigns of the emperors Augustus and Tiberius. He served as consul suffectus in AD 10, alongside Q. Junius Blaesus.  
After a long vacancy (either 87 to 15 BC or 82 to 10 BC) he became flamen dialis under Augustus' direction. According to Tacitus (Annals 3.58, 71), Servius wanted to be governor of Asia in AD 22, but his religious obligations appeared to bar his leaving Rome. The emperor Tiberius finally decided that the flamen dialis must stay in Italy to perform his duties and obliged Servius to forfeit his prospective governorship.  
The exact date when Servius became flamen dialis is disputed. Cassius Dio (54.36) says it was in about 11 BC, and many modern scholars accept this date without question. But Tacitus (Ann. 3.58) indicates that the date was 72 years after the suicide of Cornelius Cinna (87 BC). Some modern translators (including Rex Warner, but not Wood[tpl]Specify|date=September 2011[/tpl]) change Tacitus to match Dio instead of vice-versa, even though Tacitus is the more reliable historian. Gaius Stern asserts that Tacitus is probably correct, meaning that Maluginensis became flamen dialis while Lepidus was pontifex maximus (16/15 BC), so that Lepidus had to supervise Maluginensis' inauguration at Augustus' direction, possibly unwillingly.
Maluginensis died soon after, in AD 23. His son of the same name was selected to take over his priesthood.

Sofia Vembo ([tpl]lang-el|Σοφία Βέμπο[/tpl]; Gallipoli, 10 February 1910 – Athens, 11 March 1978) was a leading Greek singer and actress active from the interwar period to the early postwar years and the 1950s. She became best known for her performance of patriotic songs during the Greco-Italian War, when she was dubbed the "Songstress of Victory".
Her real name was Efi Bembo (Έφη Μπέμπο). She was born in Gallipoli, Eastern Thrace, in 1910, but after the Asia Minor Catastrophe her family moved to Tsaritsani in Greece, where her father became a tobacco worker, and later to Volos.
She began her career in Thessaloniki in the early 1930s. In the winter of 1933, she was hired by the theater operator Fotis Samartzis of the  Kentrikon theater for the revue "Parrot 1933". She then began to record romantic songs for the Columbia company, achieving fame because of her distinctly sonorous contralto voice.
Her reputation however skyrocketed after the Italian attack on Greece on 28 October 1940, when her performance of patriotic and satirical songs became a major inspiration for the fighting soldiers. At the same time, she offered 2,000 gold pounds from her own fortune to the Hellenic Navy. Following the German invasion and occupation of the country in April 1941, she was transported to the Middle East, where she continued to perform for the Greek troops in exile.
After the war, in 1949, she acquired her own theatre, the "Vembo Theatre", in the Metaxourgeio quarter of Athens. In 1957, she married her long-time lover Mimis Traiforos. During the 1960s, she began to perform less and less, before finally retiring in the early 1970s. She died on 11 March 1978.
Because of her role in the war and her efforts during the Axis occupation, she was awarded the rank of Major in the Greek Army.

[[Languages of Madagascar]]
CATEGORIES: Languages of Madagascar

The Malagasy language of Malayo-Polynesian origin, is generally spoken throughout the island. The official languages of Madagascar are Malagasy and French. Madagascar is a Francophone country, and French is spoken among the educated population of this former French colony. 
In the first Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic."Le malgache et le français sont les langues officielles de la République Malgache." Constitution, Titre I, Art. 2; Constitutional Law 14 October 1958.
No official languages were recorded in the Constitution of 1992. Instead, Malagasy was named the national language; however, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, as they were de facto. In April 2000, a citizen brought a legal case on the grounds that the publication of official documents in the French language only was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision Haute Cour Constitutionnelle De Madagascar, Décision n°03-HCC/D2 Du 12 avril 2000 that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.
In the Constitution of 2007, Malagasy remained the national language while official languages were reintroduced: Malagasy, French, and English. The motivation for the inclusion of English was partly to improve relations with the neighboring countries where English is used and to encourage foreign direct investment.Madagascar adopts English as official language, ClickAfrique.com, 10 April 2007. English was removed as an official language from the constitution approved by voters in the November referendum 2010. These results are not recognized by the political opposition or the international community, who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the organization of the election by the High Transitional Authority."crisisgroup">[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/southern-africa/madagascar/166%20Madagascar%20a%20un%20tournant%20critique.ashx |title=Madagascar: La Crise a un Tournant Critique? |accessdate=2010-11-25 |work=International Crisis Group[/tpl][/ref]

This is a list of results of National Football League games played on Turner Network Television (TNT).  From 1990-1997, TNT broadcast NFL games on Sunday nights for the first half of the regular season (or nine games a year).  Meanwhile, ESPN would pick things up for the second half of the season.  TNT also got a couple of Thursday night games to show, which were aired in place of Sunday night games (that would have otherwise conflicted with the World Series; coincidentally, the [tpl]wsy|1991[/tpl], [tpl]wsy|1992[/tpl], [tpl]wsy|1995[/tpl], and [tpl]wsy|1996[/tpl] editions of the World Series featured the Turner-owned Atlanta Braves). Following the 1997 season, ESPN would broadcast Sunday night NFL games for the whole season.  This particular arrangement between ESPN and the National Football League would continue until the end of the 2005 season.  Since that time, NBC (who last broadcast NFL games the same year that TNT last broadcast them, 1997) has been the television home of Sunday night games.  Meanwhile, ESPN has replaced ABC as the broadcaster of Monday night games.
The Phoenix/Arizona Cardinals were the only team to appear on TNT every year of the run, as they had their home opener (and one additional game in 1994) aired on the network each year.

CATEGORIES: Villages in Tirunelveli district

Maruthur is a village in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu in India. It is surrounded by wetlands and the major occupation of the people here is agriculture, The village is surrounded by Paddy fields, In the summer pulses are grown as a relay crop.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]  There are three tanks to irrigate paddy crop. Palayam channel of thamirabharani irrigation system is the feeding channel for these 3 tanks. Thamirabharani river flows on the eastern side of the village.
HISTORY OF MARUTHUR
Thousand years ago once there was a king named Kulasekara Pandian, who ruled a small territory called Manapadai veedu in Tirunelveli. He had two daughters named Maruthavalli and Cholavalli. Uoorkattu mannan, who ruled a place near Kallidaikurchi, wanted to marry both Maruthavalli and Cholavalli. Therefore, he forced Kulasekara to choose either to allow Uoorkattu to marry his daughters or his region would be captured.
On hearing the news, the princess were shocked, but they refused to marry Uoorkattu mannan, citing the age factor. So Uoorkattu mannan planned to kidnap both of the princesses. When the princesses came to know about the plan, they decided to commit suicide by drowning themselves in the river Thamirabharani. By god’s grace, both of the princesses were changed to lemons and they reached the riverbanks of the then so called Maruthur.
It was night and kavirayar, a poet by profession used to meditate on the riverbanks of Maruthur.
He used to take bath on the river before he starts his meditation. On that day when he took bath, 
he took the lemons accidentally; the lemons were changed into Maruthavalli and Cholavalli.Kavirayar was shocked and he inquired the reason why they became lemons. Both the girls narrated the whole story.
Kavirayar was amazed on seeing beautiful girls like Maruthavalli and Cholavalli. He expressed his desire to marry both of them. On hearing the desire of Kavirayar, they were shocked and to escape from him they told him that if Kavirayar would build a dam across the river Thamiraparani before the sunrise then they would marry him.
He readily accepted the condition, and he began to sing a song. The rocks and stones started rolling from the nearby vallanadu mountain and fell into the river and formed a dam. The whole dam was constructed before the sun rise. On seeing the dam, both maruthavalli cholavalli was astonished and to escape from Kavirayar, Both of them fell onto the dead pot and they commit suicide. Uoorkattu mannan –built a temple in the memory of Maruthavalli and Cholavalli in that place where they were dead and he appointed Kavirayar to take care of the temple. 
In the memory of Maruthavalli and since the place consists mainly of Marutham lands, the place came to be known as Maruthur
Adi-Marutheeswar and ''Navaneetha krishnan termples
At  the centre of Maruthur the Adi-Marutheeswar and  Vishalakshi temple was built by Uoorkattu pandian.The temple was renovated in 1969 by P.Chithirai pandian fondly called as Chairman by the people,who was the chairman of Palayamkottai Union at that time. In addition to this the  Navaneetha krishnan temple is also located in the village and is visited frequently by peoples from the nearby areas.  
At present, Maruthur has 4 ponds, [tpl]convert|1007|acre|km2[/tpl] agricultural land. The village library is going to be built shortly from the fund given by MARUTHUR.K.Rama Subramanian who is the panchayat president of Maruthur and also the brother's son of the former Chairman P.Chithirai pandian.

Marc-Louis-Emmanuel Solon (1835 – June 23, 1913), pseudonym Miles,  was a French porcelain artist for Sèvres Pottery who moved to Stoke-on-Trent in 1870 to become a leading artist at Mintons Ltd.  He remained resident in England until his death. His work commanded high prices in the late Victorian period as a leading exponent of the technique of ceramic decoration called pâte-sur-pâte. One of his vases, believed to be his largest, is on display at Osborne House.
Solon was born in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne. Despite some family resistance to his becoming an artist, he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and with Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran.[ref]SOLON, Louis Marc Emmanuel
[/ref] Some of Solon's work came to the attention of the art director of the Sèvres Pottery.  Solon was employed there from 1862-1870 as a ceramic artist and designer, and he learnt and greatly improved the technique of pâte-sur-pâte. His subjects included portraits, female figures, putti, small animals, and birds, in styles derived from Classical Greece, the Renaissance, 17th- and 18th-century paintings, and Victorian postcards. 
Solon moved to England in 1870 at the time of the Franco-Prussian War.  He found employment at Mintons Ltd, and settled at Nº1, The Villas, Stoke-on-Trent.The Villas  Mintons experienced more demand for pâte-sur-pâte ceramics than Solon could meet working on his own, and from the 1870s he trained a number of English apprentices including Frederick Alfred Rhead.

Rhamphogyne is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It belongs to the tribe of typical daisies (Astereae), and therein is placed in the subtribe Lagenophorinae by those that recognize it. This genus resembles plants from the related ragwort tribe (Senecioneae) in some respects.
The type species, Rhamphogyne rhynchocarpa, was thus initially placed in Abrotanella. Presently the genus is monotypic[tpl]Verify source|date=November 2009[/tpl] and restricted[tpl]Verify source|date=November 2009[/tpl] to Rodrigues in the Mascarene Islands.

Dissava was a feudal title associated with high office in the Kandyan and central regions of Sri Lanka. Persons were appointed to the title and office by the King during the Kingdom of Kandy, these appointees headed the administration of a large province of the Kingdom known as a Dissava and was the king's personal representative, tax collector in that area. In modern terms the post was similar to a combination of the post of Chief Minister and Governor of a province of Sri Lanka. There was no time limit for the officer holder as he held the post at the pleasure of the King, which meant throughout his life, if not incurred the displeasure of the King. It was not hereditary, although members of the same family have been appointed.
As king's personal representative in a province they held much power, controlled the civil administration, taxation, judicial, law enforcement and military matters of the province. Many close relatives of the King being commonly appointed. They received a portion of the taxation as pay and also large land grants from the King, some being hereditary. Along with Adigars and a few others high officials of the kingdom they made up the Radala caste, who were referred to as the Chieftains of Kandy by the British. Many were instrumental in the surrender of the Kandyan Kingdom to the British and were signatories to the Kandyan Convention in 1815.
Following the expansion of British rule into the provinces of the former Kandyan Kingdom since 1815, the British retained the office of Dissava appointing Kandyans loyal to the British Crown. Following the Uva Rebellion in 1818 and changers to the administrative divisions of the island with the creation of Districts, British Government Agents took over the duties of the Dissava, with the remaining and newly appointed  Dissavas being mere honorary titles. After Ceylon gained independence in 1947 these appointments were never made.

The postal history of Hungary is strongly linked to the history of Hungary. Mail delivery on a countrywide basis was first organized by the Habsburgs under the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Until 1871, Hungary used the same stamps as other territories of the Empire.
After continued development, the postal systems of Austria and Hungary were formally separated following the Compromise of 1867, with both becoming fully independent after 1908. Both world wars caused heavy damage to the infrastructure. The Hungarian Post was nationalized after 1947. Until 1990, the Post Office controlled not only mail and package delivery, but also the full range of telecommunications, including radio, telephone and television transmissions. When the Post Office was split into separate companies, Magyar Posta JSC was established to handle postal administration.

TOTP@Play is a music television programme, that was broadcast on UKTV-owned digital youth entertainment television channel, Play UK. The programme ran daily on weekday afternoons from October 2000 until 2001.
It was a spin off of the long-running BBC music programme, Top of the Pops, and was one of several Play UK programmes to utilise the TOTP brand. These programmes were able to use the BBC-owned TOTP brand commercially as BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm, held (and still holds) a 50% stake in the UKTV group of channels. BBC Worldwide also publishes the TOTP magazine.

The Hunters ROTC was a Filipino guerrilla unit active during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, and was the main anti-Japanese guerrilla group active in the area near the Philippine capital of Manila.  It was created upon dissolution of the Philippine Military Academy in the beginning days of the war.  Cadet Terry Adivoso, refused to simply go home as cadets were ordered to do, and began recruiting fighters willing to undertake guerrilla action against the Japanese.[tpl]cite episode |title = Philippine Resistance: Refusal to Surrender |episodelink = |series = Asia at War |serieslink = |network= History Channel Asia |airdate= 2009-10-17 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=Terry's Hunters: The True Story of the Hunters ROTC Guerillas| last=Mojica| first=Proculo| year=1960[/tpl]  This force would later be instrumental, providing intelligence to the liberating forces led by General Douglas MacArthur, and took an active role in numerous battles, such as the Raid at Los Baños. When war broke out in the Philippines, some 300 Philippine Military Academy and ROTC cadets, unable to join the USAFFE units because of their youth, banded together in a common desire to contribute to the war effort throughout the Bataan campaign. The "ROTC lads", as they were referred to, did their bit to protect the civilians and to assist the USAFFE forces by way of intelligence and propaganda.
After the surrender of American and Filipino forces on Bataan, and organized resistance ceased, the entire group went up the Antipolo mountains, bringing with them arms secured from civilians and USAFFE stragglers, and began calling themselves the Hunters.
The Hunters originally conducted operations with another guerrilla group called Marking's Guerrillas, with whom they went about liquidating Japanese spies. Led by Miguel Ver, a PMA cadet, the Hunters raided the enemy-occupied Union College in Manila and seized 130 Enfield rifles.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.rememberlosbanos1945.com/|title=Remember Los Banos 1945|accessdate=2009-10-17|publisher=Los Banos Liberation Memorial Scholarship Foundation, Inc.|year=2008[/tpl]
The Hunters was  one of the more effective south Luzon guerrillas, Terry's Hunters were composed primarily of military academy and ROTC cadets.  They were founded in Manila in January 1942 by Miguel Ver of the Philippine Military Academy, and moved to Rizal Province in April where they came under Col. Hugh Straughn's FAIT.  After the Japanese captured Straughn and Ver the executive officer, Eleuterio Adevoso (aka Terry Magtanggol), also a Philippine Military Academy cadet, took over.  They were among the most aggressive guerrillas in the war and made the only guerrilla raid on a Japanese prison, Muntinglupa (New Bilibid), to free their captured members and to obtain arms.  They also participated in the liberation of Los Banos prison camp during liberation.  Captain Bartolomeo Cabangbang, leader of the central Luzon penetration party, said that the Hunters supplied the best intelligence data on Luzon.
During the Liberation of Manila and Southern Luzon in January to August 1945, The local recognized guerrillas of the Hunters ROTC was helping the some of stronghold joint and combined military forces of Filipino soldiers and military officers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary and the American soldiers and military officers of the United States Army in many sending operations in Manila, Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas and Tayabas (now.

He was also called Hybrida (of mixed race) because his mother was SpanishValerius Maximus, 8,6,4.

Quintus Varius Severus Hybrida was from Sucro, Spain (in northern Spain, in the contemporary municipality of Candamo) and was the first senator of the Republic to come from the Spanish province. In 90 BC he was elected to the tribune. He wrote a law, the lex Varia, in order to punish all those who had assisted or advised those who took up arms against the Roman people. Under this law many distinguished senators such as Gaius Aurelius Cotta were sent to exile. In the following year after the application of the law, Varius himself was also convicted by the same law he wrote.

London Counties was a representative cricket side that was formed during the Second World War by Charles Jones.
Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, the government issued an order "closing all places of entertainment and outdoor sports meetings".Hayes & Hill, p.128.  However, this was soon rescinded and there was instead an emphasis placed on "business as usual" through the war.  Sports began to resume once more with a limited schedule.  The County Championship was cancelled, but county sides put out teams to play against each other and against representative sides.  Charles Jones formed London Counties, a side that played their games at Lord's Cricket Ground, and other locations around London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228443.html |title=Obituaries in 1966 |publisher=Wisden |year=1967 |accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl]  London Counties played its first recorded game, a two day match against Northamptonshire XI on 18 May 1940, winning by 128 runs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/136/136337.html |title=Northamptonshire XI v London Counties |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl]  They relied primarily on established southern professionals, and gained a reputation for being a team of "hitters and known fast scorers".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151866.html |title=Notes on the season (1940) |publisher=Wisden |year=1940 |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl]

Sherlock Holmes was Wrong: Re-opening the Case of the "Hound of the Baskervilles" is a 2007 book by French professor of literature, psychoanalyst, and author Pierre Bayard.  
By re-examining the clues, and carefully interpreting them in the context in which Doyle's book was conceived and written, Bayard clears the hound of all wrongdoing and argues that the actual murderer got away with the crime completely unsuspected by Holmes—not to mention by the numerous readers of the story over the past century and even, in a sense, by the author himself.

Abdallah ben Aisha, also Abdellah bin Aicha, was a Moroccan Admiral and ambassador to France and England in the 17th century. Abdallah departed for France on 11 November 1698 in order to negotiate a treaty.In the Land of the Christians by Nabil Matar, p.197 He spoke Spanish and English fluently, but not French. His embassy followed the visit of François Pidou de Saint Olon to Morocco in 1689.
Abdallah met with Louis XIV on 16 February 1699. He was welcomed warmly in Paris and visited many landmarks. He also met with the deposed English king James II, exiled in France at that time, whom he had apparently known in his youth when he had been a Muslim slave in England.
One of Abdallah's main missions had been to obtain an agreement to prevent the capture of Muslims by French ships, and to obtain the return of captured Muslim slaves employed on French galleys. Louis XIV however denied a treaty, and on the contrary boasted about his power to the Moroccan king.
After Abdallah's return to Morocco, numerous letters continued to be exchanged with France, and the Moroccan ruler Mulay Ismail even offered James II military support to reinstal him on the English throne if he wished to convert to Islam, and if not, at least to Protestantism.

Preventive fraction (PF), also called preventable fraction, is a calculation that can be derived from relative risk or odds ratio.
It may be used when an exposure seems to reduce the risk (in opposition to attributable risk percent), and gives the percentage of cases that can be prevented if a population is exposed to an intervention, compared to an unexposed population.
It can be calculated as ( 1 − relative risk ) or as ( 1 − odds ratio ).[tpl]cite book |title=Essentials of epidemiology in public health |series=Epidemiology Series |last=Aschengrau |first=Ann |last2=Seage |first2=George R. |year=2003 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |isbn=978-0-7637-2537-2 |pages=65–66[/tpl]

[[Woodberry Down School]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct schools in Hackney, Educational institutions established in 1955, 1955 establishments in England, Educational institutions disestablished in 1981, 1981 disestablishments in England

Woodberry Down Comprehensive School was located off the Seven Sisters Road in the Manor House area of North London. The now defunct secondary school verges on three boroughs Hackney, Haringey and Islington. The school was opened in 1955, closing in 1981 when it was amalgamated with Clissold School and renamed Stoke Newington School. The new school was founded in 1982 in the building of the former Clissold School. 
A mixed school, the pupils were divided into four houses: Keller (Gold), Curie (Blue), Einstein (Red) and Scott(Green). During the school's first term in 1955 the pupils were tasked to choose the names of the four houses. Many suggestions were put forward by pupils and staff and eventually it was decided to draw up a list of men and women who, by their lives and work, epitomised the school motto, 'Fellowship is Life', and after a campaign, to have an election of four candidates. From 17 international figures Scott of the Antarctic, Albert Einstein, Helen Keller and Marie Curie were selected and gave their names to the four school houses.
The school motto 'Fellowship is Life' was taken from a quote by early Socialist, designer and poet William Morris: "Fellowship is heaven, and lack of fellowship is hell; fellowship is life, and lack of fellowship is death; and the deeds that ye do upon the earth, it is for fellowship's sake that ye do them."
The School badge was specially designed to represent the area the school was located: the Red Griffin was the Stoke Newington Borough Arms, the Green Trees symbolised the Seven Sisters, and the Blue Water symbolised the reservoirs on whose banks the school was built.
In its earliest days it was regarded as a model school and a contemporary newspaper article even advocated that HRH The Princess Anne attend the new comprehensive to see its state of the art teaching at first hand. Dignitaries from around the commonwealth often visited the school to see these latest teaching techniques.
Through most of the 1970s the headmaster of Woodberry Down School was Michael Marland, who was awarded a CBE in 1977 for services to education. He was one of the leading educational pioneers of the second half of the 20th century, making a significant contribution to inner-city education.Michael Marland Obituary - The Independent Marland left the school on its merger to focus on creating a new school, North Westminster Community School.
The school was renowned for sporting achievements, especially rugby, and its alumni have included former professional footballer Marcus Gayle. Many other former pupils have gone on to a diverse range of successful and meaningful careers. Theo Paphitis of television series Dragon's Den also attended, while the '80s band Bad Manners were famously formed at the school in 1976. They commemorated the 1981 closure of the school on the back sleeve of their Gosh It's... Bad Manners album, which reached number 18 in the charts that year. 
The school celebrated a Jubilee Reunion on the 2 September 2006. The school building has now been largely demolished and new flats are to be built on the site.

Hyundai Motor India Limited was formed in 6 May 1996 by the Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea. When Hyundai Motor Company entered the Indian Automobile Market in 1996 the Hyundai brand was almost unknown throughout India. During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, there were only five major automobile manufacturers in India, i.e. Maruti, Hindustan, Premier, Tata and Mahindra. Daewoo had entered the Indian automobile market with Cielo just three years back while Ford, Opel and Honda had entered less than a year back.
For more than a decade till Hyundai arrived, Maruti Suzuki had a near monopoly over the passenger cars segment because TELCO and M&M were solely utility and commercial vehicle manufacturers, while Hindustan and Premier both built outdated and uncompetitive products.

The Kirtlebridge rail crash was a rail crash that took place at Kirtlebridge railway station in Dumfries and Galloway.
On 2 October 1872 the 21:00 night Scotch Express from London Euston, running 1 hour and 50 minutes late left Carlisle at 07:50. It consisted of 18 vehicles pulled by two locomotives.  Just north of Kirtlebridge station the Solway Junction was fully interlocked but the station itself was not, nor was the block system in operation. At 07:55 a goods train arrived at the station and began shunting operations. Crossover points were not controlled by the signalman but by ground levers and were moreover 300 yards from the signalbox. Local rules were that the signals should be kept at danger, but on this occasion they were showing clear. In addition the signalman was not kept informed about the shunting manoeuvres, nor did he receive any advice by telegraph about the progress of the express.  The Kirtlebridge stationmaster momentarily forgot that the late-running express had not yet come through, and diverted waggons onto the downline via the crossover points, as he did so the express appeared, running at 40 mph and collided with the waggons.  The lead locomotive ended up facing the way it had come and its tender ended upright on the platform, the second locomotive stayed on the rails with its tender and three leading coaches piled up against it. Eleven passengers and one engineman were killed. As in many previous accidents 'interlocking and block working' would have prevented the disaster.

Oil City Symphony is a musical with a book by Mike Craver, Mark Hardwick, Debra Monk, and Mary Murfitt and songs by various composers. It is a recreation of a recital by four middle-aged amateur musicians who have reunited in the auditorium of the Ohio high school they attended in the 1960s to pay tribute to music teacher Miss Hazel Reaves, who is retiring. The musical ran for 626 performances off-Broadway.
All four, whose combined talents "represent 127 years of total studying time," aspired to show business careers, but none of them ever left their small hometown. Debbie, the ex-prom queen, plays the drums and percussion; Mark, the minister of music at his church, is a pianist and accordionist; Mary, a rabid fan of women's roller derby remembered for her portrayal of Anita in a local production of West Side Story, plays the violin, saxophone, flute, and slide whistle; and Mike, a former member of an acid rock band, is a master of the synthesizer and vibraslap.

Francesco di Vannuccio (documented 1356–1389; died before 1391) was an Italian painter born in Siena.  A small body of work has been ascribed to this painter, characterized by an attention to and love of pattern and decoration, a tradition dating back in Siena to Simone Martini.  A signed and dated double-sided processional standard of 1380, painted on one side with the Crucifixion and on the other side with a painted glass depiction of the Virgin Enthroned with Saints, in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin (inv. no. 1062B), has been the basis on which a number of other paintings have been attributed.  Most of these are small-scale works, richly finished, which were meant for private devotion, suggesting that Francesco di Vannuccio worked for a discerning and wealthy group of private patrons.

Completed less than two years before his death, it was Homer's last great painting,Cikovsky, 374 and has been the subject of a variety of interpretations regarding its origin, composition and meaning. As with his other late masterworks, it represents a return to the sporting and hunting subjects of Homer's earlier years, and was to be his final engagement with the theme. Its design recalls that of Japanese art, and the composition resembles that of a colored engraving by John James Audubon.

The Dibis (Dibbis) Dam or Dibis Regulator is a gravel-alluvial fill embankment dam located on Lesser Zab River approximately 130 km upstream from its confluence with the Tigris River. The dam is located directly north of the town of Dibis in Kirkuk Governorate, Iraq.  The main-purpose of the Dibis Dam is to divert water from the Lesser Zab River into the Kirkuk Irrigation Project.
The Dibis Dam was constructed between 1960 and 1965 as part of the larger Kirkuk Irrigation Project for the irrigation of 300,000 ha of land. The dam has a capacity of 4,000 cms through the spillway and 278 cms through the head regulator (diversion to the Kirkuk Irrigation Project).
Inflow is from Dokan Dam, approximately 140 km upstream. In 1984 the dam failed due to heavy outflows from the Dokan Dam. The fuse-plug that allows the emergency spillway to work did not erode because heavy sediment had built up behind it. Repairs were carried out by China International Water and Electric Cooperation between October 1985 and March 1987.[tpl]cite web|title=Iraqi Dam Assessments|url=http://www.envirozan.info/EZ_Docs/Dams/D_Iraqi%20Dam%20Assessments.pdf|publisher=United States Army, Corps of Engineers|accessdate=27 February 2012|location=Iraq|date=6 June 2003[/tpl]

Michael Jackson was an American musician and entertainer. He is known to have written, recorded and filmed material that has never been officially released. Many of the pop singer's unreleased songs have been registered—usually by his company Mijac Music—with professional bodies such as the United States Copyright Office, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI), American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency (CMRRA) and EMI Music Publishing.Halstead, p. 1 This list, however, only documents the songs explicitly cited as being unreleased and, therefore, does not contain every unreleased Jackson song registered with such bodies.
Jackson — along with Lionel Richie, Quincy Jones, Rod Temperton and Joseph Jackson — faced a copyright infringement suit in 1993. The lawsuit came after three songwriters alleged that the pop star and his fellow defendants had plagiarized the hits "The Girl Is Mine", "Thriller" and "We Are the World".Campbell, p. 89Grant, p. 168 During a seven-hour deposition, Jackson named numerous unreleased songs that he had written or co-written.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HrsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&dq=%22michael+jackson%22+deposition+mexico&ei=Ac_ZSrKfGpu4yQSf45XKBg#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=Michael Jackson tries to keep career from crumbling as he fights addiction to painkiller drugs and charges of child molestation|last=Collier|first=Aldore|publisher=Jet|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] Following the testimony, a nine-member jury found the defendants not guilty of plagiarism.[tpl]cite book|first=|last=|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1rkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58&dq=jackson+%22the+girl+is+mine%22&lr=&num=100&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES|title=Federal jury rules in favour of Michael Jackson|publisher=Jet|date=January 31, 1994|accessdate=March 10, 2009[/tpl]
Many officially unreleased Jackson songs had been scheduled, at one point, for release on records by the singer, including his six solo studio albums with music label Epic Records: Off the Wall (1979), Thriller (1982), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995) and Invincible (2001). For varying reasons, the tracks were ultimately rejected and, as of 2014, remain unreleased. The pop singer's unreleased material includes songs recorded by Jackson as a solo artist (including covers of songs released by other artists and The Jackson 5 songs) and demo versions, some featuring established artists such as Freddie Mercury and Barry Gibb.
Several of Jackson's songs have been leaked onto the Internet without gaining an official release. One example involved the song "A Place with No Name", a 24-second snippet of which was leaked by website TMZ.com following Jackson's death in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/07/20/america-respond-to-michael-jacksons-a-place-with-no-name/|title=America Respond To Michael Jackson's 'A Place With No Name'|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=July 20, 2009|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] At the time of the leak, it was claimed that there were "hundreds" of unreleased songs by the musician, and that they could be issued for several years to come.

Mark Fosson is a songwriter and guitarist  who grew up in Kentucky, where he began writing songs while he was still in his early teens. In the late '70s he sent some song demos to John Fahey's West Coast-based Takoma Records, and Fahey, impressed with what he heard, offered Fosson a recording deal. Fosson lost no time in relocating to Los Angeles and began recording, but as bad luck would have it, Takoma was in some difficulty, and the label soon folded. Fahey allowed Fosson to retain the master tapes of the sessions, however.[tpl]cite web |first= Zach |last= Baron |title= The Lost Takoma Sessions |url= http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9213-the-lost-takoma-sessions/ |publisher= Pitchfork Media |accessdate=April 4, 2010[/tpl]
Now located on the West Coast, Fosson met fellow songwriter Edward Tree, and the two began working together, forming the Bum Steers, a country-tinged group, in the late '80s, eventually being invited to play the Grand Ol’ Opry at the request of Porter Wagoner. Fosson's material appeared on several soundtracks through the 1990s. 
In 2001 he began collaborating with singer/songwriter Lisa O'Kane, who recorded several of his songs, including the No. 1 European single "Little Black Cloud" and Fosson also began recording a solo project, Jesus on a Greyhound, which was released on New Light Entertainment/Universal. The record drew positive reviews and Fosson was frequently compared to Americana music artists like Ramblin' Jack Elliot, Joe Ely, John Prine and Guy Clark. The Fahey material finally saw the light of day as The Lost Takoma Sessions from Drag City Records in 2006. He most recently has contributed a track to Volume 3 of the highly acclaimed Imaginational Anthem acoustic guitar compilations from Tompkin’s Square Record
On June 26, 2012 Tompkins Square released "Digging In The Dust", a collection of early home recordings which led to Fosson's signing to Takoma Records.

[[Keshi pearls]]

CATEGORIES: Pearls

Keshi pearls are small non-nucleated pearls typically formed as by-products of pearl cultivation. A Japanese word also meaning “poppy” (ケシ, 芥子), it is used in Japanese for all pearls that grew without a nucleus. Originally, keshi pearls referred to those pearls formed when a bead nucleus was rejected. More recently, keshi has been used to refer to second harvest pearls and even to freshwater non-nucleated pearls. However the later usage referring to freshwater pearls is considered erroneous by many leading gem trade associations.http://kojimapearl.com/about-the-pearls/keshi-pearls Because they have no nucleus, keshi pearls are composed entirely of nacre.

Amos Pollard (October 29, 1803–March 6, 1836) was the chief surgeon of the Alamo garrison who died during the battle on March 6, 1836. 
Pollard was born on October 29, 1803 in Ashburnham, Massachusetts to Jonas and Martha (Martin) Pollard. He grew up in Surry, New Hampshire, and in 1825 he graduated from the medical school of the Vermont Academy in Castleton, Vermont. After residing for a period in Greenbush, New York, Pollard then removed to Manhattan where he spent the years 1825 to 1834 practicing medicine at various locations. He married Fanny Parker in 1828, and they had one daughter before his wife's death in 1831. In 1834 Pollard traveled to Texas by way of New Orleans.
He moved to Gonzales, Texas, and on October 2, 1835, he took part in the fight for the "Come and Take It" cannon in Gonzales, which was the opening battle of the Texas Revolution. "Pollard later went to San Antonio de Béxar as a private in Capt. John York's volunteer company. On October 23, 1835, he was appointed surgeon of the regiment by Stephen F. Austin."Bill Groneman, "POLLARD, AMOS," Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpo08), accessed May 28, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.
"After the siege of Bexar Pollard remained in the town as chief surgeon of the Texan garrison, on the staff of Lt. Col. James C. Neill. He cared for the sick and wounded of the garrison and also set up a hospital within the Alamo. On February 23, 1836, Antonio López de Santa Anna's Mexican army besieged the Alamo. Pollard died in the battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836, probably defending the Alamo hospital. A portrait of him was done sometime before he moved to Texas. Besides Travis, Bowie, and Crockett, he is the only Alamo defender of whom a portrait was done from life. A copy of the portrait is on display in the Alamo."

The soil of the island is extremely fertile, and the climate is tropical making excellent conditions for growing tropical fruits and other exotic plants. In the past, agriculture was the primary source of income for the island, though this has changed over recent years as demand for important exports like sugar has declined and damage to crops as a result of hurricanes has increased. At present agriculture accounts for around 6% of Martinique's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) which ranks it far below tourism and other services, the island's primary source of revenue.

[[Mobile Barracks of High Command]]

CATEGORIES: Government of the Republic of China

Mobile Barracks of High Command (Xing Yuan, [tpl]zh|行轅[/tpl]) is a Chinese term primarily referring to a ROC government regional special office opened on behalf of the military supreme commander in a particular region, where there is a high-ranking government or military official as the regional representative of the supreme commander in chief.
This term can trace its beginning back to ancient China.
Generally speaking, a Mobile Barracks of High Command would have the operational authority over the affairs of military, civilians, and Nationalist Party within its area of responsibility, if it is military-related.
For example, Ying-chin Ho (:zh:何應欽), a four-star army general of ROC, was once the director of Mobile Barracks of High Command at Chungking. His official title was, in fact, "Director of Mobile Barracks of the Chairman of the National Government Office at Chungking." Simply put: Ho spoke for the Chairman of the National Government of Republic of China in the great area of Chungking. He was, de facto and de juro, the military governor over several provinces west of Sichuan (included).
Hence, the director of Mobile Barracks of High Command functioned as a provincial governor in the Qing Dynasty. In wartime, due to military considerations, the Director of Mobile Barracks would take over the administrative power of civil affairs and therefore also known as military general governor. Similarly, there were others Mobile Barracks of High Command  at Manchuria, Sifeng (:zh:息烽), Xichang (:zh:西昌), and Canton,  and so on.
Equivalently, another kind of regional special office, "Forward Command Camp of the Chief of the National Military Council" (:zh:行營) would be in charge of the operational planning and command functions in its administrative district.

An acrobatic flip is a sequence of body movements in which a person leaps into the air and then rotates one or more times while airborne. Acrobatic flips are performed in acro dance, free running, gymnastics, cheerleading and various other activities. This is in contrast to freestyle BMX, in which a person revolves in the air about a bicycle.
Acrobatic flips can be started from a stationary, standing position and they are also commonly executed immediately following another rotational move, such as a roundoff or handspring, so as to take advantage of the angular momentum developed in the preceding move. In general, the hands do not touch the floor during execution of a flip and performers typically strive to land on the feet in an upright position.

Osowiec Fortress (Polish Twierdza Osowiec) - Is a 19th-century fortress located in north-eastern Poland, originally built by the Russian Empire.  The Russian name  is Крепость Осовец i.e., Krepost Osovets. In English sources it is variously given as Osowiec,[ref]The eastern front, 1914-1917
 By [[Norman Stone]] [http://books.google.com/books?id=nHUyBriWmjwC&q=osowiec+1915&dq=osowiec+1915]</ref> ''Osovets'', ''Ossovetz'', ''Osovetz'' and  ''Ossovets''.  It saw heavy fighting during [[World War I]] when it was obstinately defended for several months by its Russian garrison against German attacks.
The fortress was built in the years 1882-1892 as one of the defensive works to protect the western borders of Russia against Germany, and continuously modernised afterwards to cope with advances in heavy siege artillery. In 1889-1893, military engineer Nestor Buinitsky took an important part in the creation of the fortress. It was located on the river Biebrza about 50 km from the border with the German province of East Prussia, in the one place where the marshlands of the river could be crossed, hence controlling a vital chokepoint.  The extensive marshlands and bogs that surrounded it made attack difficult. The strategic Białystok - Ełk (Lyck) - Königsberg (Kaliningrad) rail line ran through the fortress and crossed the Biebrza river there. The fortress saw heavy fighting during the beginning of World War I in the eastern front from September 1914 until the Russian Army abandoned it in August 1915.  In the interwar years the fortress was used by the Polish Army.  During the German invasion of Poland in 1939 it was bypassed and did not see much fighting.
Today, some parts of the fortress are accessible to tourists, especially the parts within the boundaries of Biebrza National Park. The visitor information center of the park is located in Osowiec-Twierdza,Lonely Planet guidebook Poland a small settlement located within the boundaries of the fortress. Other parts of the fortress still belong to the Polish Army and access is restricted.

Springer-Verlag: Berlin; Heidelberg, Germany. ISBN 978-3-540-31050-1  Until 2009, it was considered to comprise three species, Platycarpha glomerata, Platycarpha carlinoides, and Platycarpha parvifolia, all from South Africa. David J. Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK. ISBN 978-0-521-82071-4  In that year, the latter two were segregated from Platycarpha to form the genus Platycarphella, leaving Platycarpha with only its type species, Platycarpha glomerata.
The name Platycarpha is derived from two Greek words, platys "broad" and karphos "a chip of straw or wood, a scale, a dry stalk". Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names. volume III, page 2098. CRC Press: Baton Rouge, New York, London, Washington DC. ISBN 978-0-8493-2673-8 (vol. III). (see External links below). The name was first used by Christian Friedrich Lessing in 1831. Christian Friedrich Lessing. 1831. "De Synanthereis. Dissertatis quarta, auctore Chr. Fr. Lessing" Linnaea 6:688. (see External links below). The type species is Platycarpha glomerata.Platycarpha In: Index Nominum Genericorum. In: Regnum Vegetabile (see External links below). This species had been named Cynara glomerata by Carl Peter Thunberg in 1800,  Carl Peter Thunberg. 1800. Prodromus Plantarum Capensium volume 2: 141. (see External links below). and was moved to Platycarpha by A.P. de Candolle in 1836 in Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. Augustin Pyramus de Candolle. 1836. Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis 5:71. (see External links below). 
The systematic position of Platycarpha has long been regarded with uncertainty. Most authors have placed it in the tribe Arctotideae  until molecular phylogenetic studies showed it to be closer to Vernonieae. Vicki A. Funk, Raymund Chan, Stirling C. Keeley. 2004.

It is native to the southwestern United States from California to Texas and it is known as far north as Idaho. Its habitat includes desert and woodlands. This annual herb produces a slender, branching stem reaching a maximum height near 40 centimeters. It has a sparse coating of glandular hairs and contains a milky juice. Most of the leaves are located near the base of the stem. They are widely lance-shaped and sometimes divided into segments. Smaller leaves occur higher on the stem; these may be reduced to scale-like structures, leaving the stem mostly bare. The inflorescence is a wide open panicle of several flower heads. Each small head is cylindrical and narrow, its base wrapped in lance-shaped phyllaries. At the tip of the head bloom 3 or 4 flowers, which are ray florets; there are no disc florets. Each floret has is white to pale pink and has a toothed tip. The fruit is a white achene with a pappus of white bristles.

[[Pipes and Pints]]
CATEGORIES: Czech punk rock groups, Celtic punk groups, Musical groups established in 2006

Pipes and Pints are a Celtic punk band from Prague, Czech Republic, that formed in 2006. Combining Punk rock with Highland bagpipes.http://www.pipesandpints.cz/?s=bio.inchttp://unrepentantrecords.com/pipesandpints.html
Pipes and Pints were formed in 2006 by Vojta Kalina (Highland bagpipes/vocals) with a dream of a band that combines punk rock with dirty folk music such as The Pogues. Soon after, he met Tomas Novotny (guitar/vocals) who shared the same dream, flavored by country and rock and roll. The band released a demo and toured Central Europe (Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, and Slovakia) both as a headlining band and in support of The Porters, Society Parasites, and others throughout 2007 and 2008.  However, the vision of the future for Pipes and Pints was not shared by all of the original members and a line-up change resulted in the addition of Lukas Vincour (drums/vocals), who moved to Prague from Moravia; Syco Mike (lead vocals), who canceled his return from Austria back to native California and moved to Prague with only his dog Tequila; and eventually Ondra Balvin (bass/vocals), a good friend from the streets, squats, and clubs of Prague.
In December 2008, the new Pipes and Pints line-up (without Ondra on bass yet) recorded a 5-track EP which immediately became a promise of better days and the beginning of a new adventure. This EP release was well received and the boys didn't hesitate to hit the road with it.http://www.celtic-rock.de/archives/1643http://www.smalltowncriminals.de/newsfl/content/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5133  It was during that tour Pipes and Pints added new bass player Ondra and proved to everyone they were serious about their music as evidenced by their relentless and voracious touring of European clubs and festivals.  After less than a year the band got a reputation as true believers who give it all they have and you could see them with bands like The Porters, Church of Confidence, Born To Lose, Deadline, Hudson Falcons, Al And The Black Cats and more, or as a headlining band.http://www.unrepentantrecords.com/pipesandpints.html
In November 2009, Pipes and Pints are releasing their debut, full-length album entitled Until We Die with the cooperation of Wolverine Records for Europe and Unrepentant Records for North and South America.  Pipes and Pints are devoting the rest of 2009 and 2010 to what they love the most: live shows. With plans to support the album with as many gigs and tours as possible, Pipes and Pints are looking forward to making music "until they die".

Patrick Gilmore (born June 1, 1976) is a Canadian actor best known for playing the role of Dale Volker in the science fiction series Stargate Universe. He has also been seen in other science fiction shows such as Battlestar Galactica and Eureka, as well as playing Trennan in Riese. He is one of the first actors to appear in all three Stargate TV series, along with Richard Dean Anderson, Amanda Tapping, Michael Shanks, Ona Grauer, David Hewlett, Mike Dopud and Gary Jones. Dale Volker began as a simple side character, but Patrick's excellent portrayal of Volker impressed show-runners and Volker was subsequently given more screen time and more back story.  A similar situation occurred with the character of Dr. Carson Beckett, played by Paul McGillion. Patrick also portrays entrepreneur Tom Drexler in the AMC television series The Killing

[[All That Moody]]

CATEGORIES: 1976 albums, Davey Graham albums

All That Moody is an album by British musician Davey Graham, released in 1976. It was his first album in six years after the release of Godington Boundary and is the first with his name spelled Davey instead of Davy.Allmusic entry for All That Moody Retrieved October 2009. It was released on an imprint called Eron Enterprises, a small label based in Deal, Kent, set up 4 years previously to demonstrate how good South East England's folk music scene was. Graham had known Ron Milner, the label's boss, since Holly Gwinn-Graham had been on the label's first release, Folk In Sandwich (ERON 001).
All That Moody was reissued in 1999 on 10" album and CD by Rollercoaster Records, the CD containing six additional tracks.
In his Allmusic review, critic Brian Downing stated "After a six-year sabbatical in which he taught music, Davey Graham came out of retirement to release this retrospective of sorts, All That Moody, in 1976. This collection did contain both his most well-known songs, as well as a few personal favorites, but in re-recorded form. Unlike in the past, where this approach had led to some artistically bankrupt releases that tricked the public into buying what they thought were originals, this effort is a bit different. Sure it gave the under-appreciated artist some more revenue and added a tidy anthology to a rather skimpy and hard-to-find catalog. But it also allowed Graham to give a decidedly Eastern feel to the majority of the numbers present, whereas this raga-fied approach was merely part of his considerable repertoire in the past. With help from Keshav Sathe and Roger Bunn, Graham effectively and impressively showed why he not only is considered the father of the modern British folk movement, but also a real innovator in bringing world music to a traditionally Western form. And while the remakes don't completely render the originals obsolete, they do give listeners some nice alternative versions. The instrumentals, as usual, work best, as Graham's vocals are not his strongest point. Likewise, the numbers that dabble in blues, jazz, or ragtime, while adding a touch of variety, really don't impress as much as the genre-fusing ones. Rollercoaster Records not only released this lost gem in 1999; they added six additional cuts, making this an item any true folk fan should buy on sight."

She is still the sole owner of the company and its working chairman. The CEO is Ralph Riber.
IES schools are based on the idea of bilingual education, with up to half of the teaching in English, performed by native English speaking teachers recruited from the United Kingdom, USA, Canada, and other English-speaking countries. Other vital elements are “tough love”, creating “a safe, calm environment in which teachers can teach and students learn”; and “high academic expectations”. Restaurant-type school lunches are also part of the concept. IES schools show results on the Swedish national tests which are far above average[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl].

In 1971, he was sentenced to 25 years of jail for a brutal murder (shortened to 15 years in 1979). Surprisingly enough, in 1983 (during the martial law in Poland) he was granted a passport and allowed to leave the country. He returned in 1990 soon earning the nickname "the accountant of the Left" as a former Swiss banker who took care of more than thirty accounts of Polish social democrats. Despite an arrest warrant issued in 1987, Vogel moved freely in Poland and was eventually arrested in 1998 in Switzerland. After Vogel's extradition to Poland, in 1999 Aleksander Kwaśniewski initiated the procedure of granting him amnesty.

The Complete Guitarist is a compilation album by British musician Davey Graham, released in 1978.Allmusic entry for The Complete Guitarist Retrieved October 2009.
In his Allmusic review, critic Alex Henderson stated "To those who are unfamiliar with Davey Graham's work, The Complete Guitarist might seem like a lofty title for this album. But it's a title that the Scottish musician, who has commanded a lot of respect in U.K. folk circles since emerging in the 1960s, lives up to on these unaccompanied acoustic solo-guitar recordings from the late 1970s. Diversity is the rule on this album, and Graham successfully turns his attention to an abundance of traditional Celtic songs (both Scottish and Irish) as well as everything from Johann Sebastian Bach's "Ein Feste Burg" (A Mighty Fortress Is Our God) to blues classics like Big Bill Broonzy's "When I Been Drinking" and Memphis Slim's "How Come You Do Me Like You Do." Whether it's Celtic music, classical, blues, or jazz, Graham has no problem tackling a variety of styles and demonstrating that he really is the complete guitarist. Originally released as a vinyl LP in the late 1970s, The Complete Guitarist was, in 1999, reissued on CD with eight bonus tracks from 1979-1980 added."

Gilchrist's was a Boston department store.  Its flagship store was at the intersection of Washington and Winter Streets, across from both Filene's and Jordan Marsh in Downtown Crossing.  
Gilchrist's was considered one of the big three stores (along with Filene's and Jordan Marsh) that dominated Boston's shopping district for so long.  Gilchrist's opened in 1842, one year after Jordan Marsh in downtown Boston.  Gilchrist's was not considered as high-end as its neighbors, but did just as well.  
In the 1940s Gilchrist's started to branch out into older suburban companies.  By 1964 Gilchrist's had eight locations across the state of Massachusetts: Quincy, Brockton, Framingham, Medford, Waltham, Stoneham, Cambridge, and Dorchester.  The company's store in Cambridge was located in the basement of the Star Market grocery store at the Porter Square shopping center.
The emergence of shopping malls led to the decline of the downtown stores.  Gilchrist's took a back seat to the anchor stores until closing in 1977. Its flagship Downtown Crossing store was replaced with a shopping mall called The Corner in Gilchrist's original building.

Canada Carries On (French: En avant Canada) was a series of short films by the National Film Board of Canada, which ran from 1940 to 1959.  The series was initially created as morale boosting propaganda films during World War II. With the end of the war, the series lost its financial backing from the Wartime Information Board, but continued under as an NFB series of theatrical shorts that included newsreels as well as animated shorts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&csid1=615&navid=66|title=Canada Carries On|last=Morris|first=Peter|work=Canadian Film Encyclopedia|publisher=Film Reference Library|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl]
The series was initially produced by Stuart Legg, who also directed many of the early films in Canada Carries On. The first film in the series was Legg's Atlantic Patrol, released in April 1940, about the Canadian Navy's role in protecting convoys from Halifax to the United Kingdom from U-boat attack.[tpl]cite book|last=Ellis|first=Jack C.|coauthors=Betsy A.

[[Synthetic seismogram]]
CATEGORIES: Seismology

A synthetic seismogram is the result of forward modelling the seismic response of an input earth model, which is defined in terms of 1D, 2D or 3D variations in physical properties. In hydrocarbon exploration this is used to provide a 'tie' between changes in rock properties in a borehole and seismic reflection data at the same location. It can also be used either to test possible interpretation models for 2D and 3D seismic data or to model the response of the predicted geology as an aid to planning a seismic reflection survey. In the processing of wide-angle reflection and refraction (WARR) data, synthetic seismograms are used to further constrain the results of seismic tomography.Makris, J., Egloff, F. & Rihm, R. 1999. WARRP (Wide Aperture Reflection and Refraction Profiling): The principle of successful data acquisition where conventional seismic fails, SEG 1999 Expanded Abstracts In earthquake seismology, synthetic seismograms are used either to match the predicted effects of a particular earthquake source fault model with observed seismometer records or to help constrain the Earth's velocity structure. Synthetic seismograms are generated using specialist geophysical software.

Sofia Johansdotter Gyllenhielm (1556/59 – June 1583) in Reval, Estonia, was a Swedish noble. She was the illegitimate daughter of King John III of Sweden and Karin Hansdotter. 
Sofia spent her childhood with her mother in Finland. She became a lady-in-waiting of her aunt Princess Elizabeth of Sweden in 1576. The same year, she was engaged by her father to her father's favourite, the French immigrant Baron Pontus De la Gardie, as a reward for his service toward her father. Sofia, her sister Lucretia and her brother Julius were ennobled in 1577 and given the name Gyllenhielm. The wedding was held in Vadstena on 14 January 1580. It was a grand ceremony with many guests, and during the ceremony a gallery broke under the weight of the spectators at church, resulting in the death of one person. This was interpreted by present Catholics as a divine verdict of over the heretics. In 1581, she accompanied her spouse to his command in Swedish Estonia. She died in childbirth in Reval in 1583.

These past river conditions created a haven for wildlife, which included vast floodplain forests of giant trees, marshes, and even wet prairies. Today's river is channelized. It is deeper and faster, and controlled by levees, dikes, and other containment structures. These controls make the river more navigable and the surrounding floodplain ideal for agriculture.
The Big Muddy Refuge is allowing the Missouri River to be a river again, to enter its floodplain. This occurs during minor flood events. Management has created side channels, cut down levees, and allowed the floodplain vegetation to return. Currently, in many places the refuge is an impenetrable thicket of young trees and vegetation, but, as the trees grow and the refuge matures, its appearance will change. The process may take decades or even centuries.

Size Five Games (formerly Zombie Cow Studios) is a British independent video game developer founded by Dan Marshall in 2008. Dan Marshall's previous games were retroactively brought under the Zombie Cow banner upon its founding.
Their first new release was a donationware adventure game called Ben There, Dan That!, released in 2008. It was widely praised by the adventure game community and downloaded 50,000 times but brought in only "a couple of hundred quid" due to its donation model.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zombie-cow.com/?page_id=17|title=Ben There, Dan That!|publisher=Zombie Cow Studios|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Marshall self-funded the games development, telling the BBC in 2010 "What I do keeps me fed and warm. I'm not sure I get to lead the most extravagant lifestyle, or how my earnings compare to people working in the mainstream games industry." Marshall later said of the game "I didn’t think people would really pay money for it ... I think that was a bit naive, in retrospect. It’s well worth a couple of quid, and I do regret not charging for it initially. You can always move the price down, you can’t really move it up." A 2011 updated edition of the game, which added a soundtrack and other features, was sold on a "pay what you want" model, with a minimum price.
The sequel, Time Gentlemen, Please!, was released in 2009 to positive reviews. PC Gamer called it "point-and-click adventuring done right for a change."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/timegentlemenplease|title=Time Gentlemen, Please! reviews|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=13 December 2009[/tpl] It holds a Metacritic score of 84%.
In 2010, Zombie Cow Studios released Privates, a sex education game funded by Channel 4 and intended to match the "personal, social, and health education" guidelines of the National Curriculum The Xbox 360 version was cancelled when Microsoft confirmed that the game contravened the Xbox Live guidelines on sexual content of games, but the company released the Microsoft Windows version for free download from Channel 4's website.  The game won a BAFTA award in the "Learning - Secondary" category.
In May 2011 Zombie Cow Studios changed their name to Size Five Games.http://www.sizefivegames.com/2011/05/20/formerly-zombie-cow-studios

[[Sounds of The Four Tops]]
CATEGORIES: Tribute bands

The Sounds of The Four Tops is a Four Tops tribute show created by the American Soul Singer, show producer and actor Freddie Lee Peterkin.  Peterkin is also known under the recording name of 'Freddie Lee' for the critical acclaim of his album Beyond Comprehension.  The Sounds of the Four Tops is a unique Four Tops Tribute as the signature visual production and choreography does not imitate the original artists The Four Tops although the shows pays homage to the original artist's music with vocal presentations of The Four Tops hits.
The choreography in his Four Tops tribute show are completely Peterkin's original dramatic works. His signature visual production consists of original choreographed works created by him between 1991 - 2009. His first known touring production Aces toured Europe in 1991 - 1998. The show Aces was part of the Pete Tobit British theatre show "Reach Out" from 1999-2001. Peterkin retained some of his earlier works in his 2004 Sounds of the Four Tops show.  The Sounds of the Four Tops show has been subject of national newspaper reviews and interviews particularly in the British entertainment publication The Stage newspaper. Peterkin's style of show has since inspired many similar British Four Tops Tribute Shows.
Peterkin's dynamic stage production and dramatic works for Sounds of the Four Tops are inspired by the traditional Black Greek Fraternity "Step Shows" at Freddie Lee Peterkin's Alma Mater, Florida Memorial University which have a significant historic tradition. Peterkin choreographed routines for competition as part of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Delta Psi chapter.
Controversy has been sparked as Freddie Lee Peterkin took action in 2009 against two British national touring theatre shows for misappropriating his original choreographed works. Peterkin is being represented by Leonard Lowy former inhouse solicitor for Island Records at Leonard Lowy & Co Solicitors.  He also discussed the infringement case in a Sky TV interview in June 2009. His tribute production is the only known tribute production to have tributes.  Rather than imitating the routines of the original artists, the two national Motown style theatre shows plagiarized Freddie Lee Peterkin's works without a license agreement or seeking Peterkin's consent. Both shows featured one former member of his Aces show and 3 former employees that has worked for him from 1999-2003. In 2009 Peterkin discovered that the colleague who had stolen from him and the other group members had taken his original stage production and misappropriated the works as his own and contracted Peterkin's original dramatic works to "The Magic of Motown Theatre Show". Three former employees falsely claimed in the Herald newspaper that they had choreographed Peterkin's stage production in "How Sweet It Is" another British theatre show. His former employees were aged between 12-14 years old when Peterkin then aged 23 - 27 years old first created and performed the works to the public between 1989-1994.
Peterkin has since taken legal action against both the show producer of "The Magic of Motown", his former colleague from his group 'Aces' and his former employees in "How Sweet It Is" via Leonard Lowy and Co Solicitors, former in house solicitor for Island Records. Both shows gave notice that they would desist from using Peterkin's works but did not do so until 2010. Peterkin stated in interviews that he intends to still take the matter to the High Court to be acknowledged for his works and to seek compensation for the illegal use of his works.

Swan Lake National Wildlife Refuge is a [tpl]convert|10795|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] National Wildlife Refuge established in 1937 and located in Chariton County, Missouri, [tpl]Convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] south of the town of Sumner. It is located near the confluence of the Grand and Missouri Rivers.
Following the purchase of the land, the Civilian Conservation Corps began work on the refuge creating wetlands, constructing roads and buildings, and initiating the refuge farming program.
The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide nesting, resting, and feeding areas for waterfowl, primarily ducks. Two-hundred and forty-one avian species have been observed residing on or passing through the refuge; another fourteen birds, listed under accidentals on the bird list, have been reported but are not normally expected to be present.  An important secondary purpose was to preserve a remnant flock of prairie chickens. Unfortunately, adequate grassland habitat to maintain a viable population of the birds was not available.
Since establishment of the refuge, the primary emphasis on waterfowl species has been expanded to include the Eastern Prairie Population of Canada geese. Canada geese were first observed using the refuge in the early 1940s, and numbers increased gradually to peak populations over 200,000 birds annually. Although these populations have steadily declined, Swan Lake is still considered a primary wintering area for Canada geese.

The June Gap is important because typically, the number of bees and hence energy requirement in the colony has built up significantly by the time the dearth occurs.
Some plants which can help provide nectar in this gap are Cotoneaster and the closely related Pyracantha.

[[Frank K. Mott]]

CATEGORIES: Mayors of Oakland, California, Oakland City Council members, 1866 births, 1958 deaths

Frank Kanning Mott (January 21, 1866 – 1958) was the 35th mayor of Oakland, California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cshouse.org/Pages/frank_mott.html|title=Frank Mott - The Man Who Built Oakland|publisher=Camron-Stanford House|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl]
Mott was born in San Francisco on January 21, 1866,[tpl]cite news|title=Named President of Oakland's Council; Frank K. Mott Wins the Election|date=April 7, 1896|work=San Francisco Chronicle|pages=10|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] but his family moved to nearby Oakland when he was two years old. His father, who worked for the Central Pacific Railroad (later Southern Pacific Railroad), died when he was 11. To support the family, Mott quit school and worked as a messenger boy for Western Union and then as a telephone operator, the first ever in Oakland, according to his obituary in the Tribune.[tpl]cite news|title=Mayor's nuptials not an Oakland first|date=April 4, 2005|work=Oakland Tribune|page=1|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] He entered the hardware business as a clerk at the age of 16, eventually becoming the sole proprietor of Frank K. Mott Co. He entered politics in 1894 when then-Mayor George Pardee appointed him to the city council to fill H.P. Dalton's vacant seat. He went on to serve two more terms before elected Mayor in 1905.
Mott, known as "The Mayor Who Built Oakland", presided over the greatest disaster relief operation in Oakland when an estimated 150,000 people sought refuge in the city after the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco. He was re-elected in 1907 by a six-to-one margin, defeating Socialist O.H. Phillbrick, 7,317 to 1,226, and re-elected to the third term in 1909, defeating Citizens' Party candidate F.F. Jackson 8,352 to 6,045. Following the adoption of a new city charter establishing a city commission government in 1910, Mott won the 1911 election by defeating Socialist opponent Thomas Booth, 11,722 to 9,837. In a fascinating but little-known chapter of Oakland history, Mott survived the city's first recall election, initiated by the radical Industrial Workers of the World, on August 5, 1912, with 17,139 voting in favor of keeping Mott in office, and 10,846 against.
He achieved, in 1909, final resolution of the waterfront issue which had preoccupied the leaders of Oakland since the city's founding, with a negotiated agreement with Southern Pacific.  The railroad gave up its rights to the waterfront in exchange for a fifty-year franchise on the property it then held. In 1909, Mayor Mott welcomed President William H. Taft to Oakland. The Mayor laid the cornerstone for the present City Hall. The massive harbor improvements which immediately followed were part of an unprecedented era of public works projects, including the dredging of Lake Merritt, the building of the current City Hall and the Civic Auditorium (now known as the Kaiser Convention Center), establishment of the pioneering Oakland Public Museum in the Josiah Stanford (now Camron-Stanford) House, and vast expansion and improvements to sewers, streets, lighting, electricity, fire and police protection. Mayor Mott retired in 1915.
On January 10, 1911, Mott married Mrs. Gertrude Bennett in San Francisco.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j-IDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA399 |page=399 |title=Press Reference Library: Notables of the Southwest |publisher=Los Angeles Times |year=1912[/tpl] His family lived at three different addresses while he was mayor—1066 Jackson (1905–08), 1509 Webster (1909–1911), and 276 Lee Street in Adams Point (1912–1939)—all since demolished. He served as the city's right-of-way agent from 1927 until his death on December 16, 1958, at the age of 92, at the Athens Athletic Club. An Episcopalian, Mott was cremated following his funeral at the Chapel of the Oaks under the auspices of Masonic Lodge 61.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]

In years of high water flows down the Carson River, the refuge is important for migratory shorebirds and waterfowl. However, due to diversions, in most years there is insufficient water flow down the Carson River for the water to enter the refuge.
The refuge is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, but there are no facilities on the refuge. Roads are primitive and passable only during those periods of dry weather.

The stars in this class satisfy conditions which should make them solar analogues, and would be expected to be stable over very long time scales.
It has been suggested that these eruptions may be produced by the interaction of the star's magnetic field with the magnetic field of a putative Jupiter-like planet.

He lived at the Manor House in the centre of Loughborough and died in March 1571 at Stoke Poges. In his will, he mentions his natural son Edward, who was to be given the Manor of Michelcreche, Somerset when he came of age. He gave his manor of Bosworth to his nephew Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon. He does not mention his wife in his will, leading to speculation that they may have been estranged.

[[Helvii]]

CATEGORIES: Tribes of ancient Gaul, Tribes involved in the Gallic Wars

The Helvii (also Elui, ancient Greek Ἑλουοί) were a relatively small Celtic polity west of the Rhône river on the northern border of Gallia Narbonensis. Their territory was roughly equivalent to the Vivarais, in the modern French department Ardèche. Alba Helviorum was their capital, possibly the Alba Augusta mentioned by Ptolemy,Alba was a common town-name in Latin antiquity. and usually identified with modern-day Alba-la-Romaine (earlier Aps). In the 5th century the capital seems to have been moved to Viviers.A.L.F. Rivet, Gallia Narbonensis (London 1988), p. 183.
From the mid-2nd to mid-1st century BC, Helvian territory was on the northern border of the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina (later the Narbonensis). As a border people, the Helvii played a crucial if limited role in the Gallic Wars under the leadership of Gaius Valerius Caburus, who had held Roman citizenship since 83 BC, and his sons Troucillus and Domnotaurus.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 1.19, 1.47, 1.53, 7.8, 7.65. Julius Caesar calls the Helvii a civitas,Bellum Gallicum 7.65.2. a polity with at least small-scale urban centers (oppida),John Koch notes that the Gallo-Brittonic word corresponding to Caesar's usage of civitas is most likely *touta (Old Irish túath): "'tribe' would not be a perfect translation, but is less misleading than 'state,' 'city,' or 'nation'" (Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-Clio, 2000), p. 450 online. John Drinkwater, however, argues in Roman Gaul: The Three Provinces, 58 BC–AD 260 (Cornell University Press, 1983), for "'nation' in the American Indian sense, made up of a number of tribes — Caesar's pagi" (p. 30, note 2; concept of civitas discussed in depth pp. 103–111). See also A.N. Sherwin-White on civitas, populus, municipium and oppidum in The Roman Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 1973) passim; if *touta is correctly translated as "a people," the sense of civitas Helviorum might be analogous to that of the Roman People (populus) as a political entity. In his edition of Tacitus' Germania (Oxford University Press, 1999), J.B. Rives, drawing on Cicero's definition of civitas as "an assembly and gathering of men associated under law" (Republic 6.13), says that it is the usual word for a "community viewed under its political aspect," equivalent to the Greek polis (p. 153). Further discussion by Olivier Büchsenschütz, "The Significance of Major Settlements in European Iron Age Society," in Celtic Chiefdom, Celtic State (Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp. 53–64; consideration of the term "proto-state" by Patrice Brun, "From Chiefdom to State Organization," in Celtic Chiefdom, Celtic State p. 7; see also Greg Woolf, "Urbanizing the Gauls," in Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 106–141. In Gods, Temples, and Ritual Practices: The Transformation of Religious Ideas and Values in Roman Gaul (Amsterdam University Press, 1998), Ton Derks views the civitates of the Augustan era as "city-states": "a civitas was a community, whose constitution was shaped after the Roman example and whose social and political life was centred on a single town" (p. 39 online). and not a pagus ("sub-tribe").

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Lower Saxony, Lakes of Saxony-Anhalt, Dams in Germany, Dams in the Harz, Lists of dams, Saxony-Anhalt-related lists, Lower Saxony-related lists

In the Harz mountains there is a higher than average number of dams with their associated reservoirs. The reason is that the Harz is one of the regions with the heaviest rainfall in Germany and so its water power was utilised very early on. The first dam (on the Upper Harz Ponds) was built in order to drive water-powered pumps and stamp mills used in the mines.
At the present time the Harz reservoirs provide hydro-electricity, drinking water and flood protection, particularly when the snows melt in spring.
The following is a list of dams in the Harz:
In addition, according to the definition of a dam, 30 of the Upper Harz Ponds (Teiche) also count as dams in the Harz. These elements of the Upper Harz Water Regale belong to the oldest working dams in Germany.

[tpl]About|the South Park episode||WTF (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]WTF[/tpl]

"W.T.F." is the 10th episode of the 13th season of the American animated television series South Park, and the 191st overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 21, 2009. In the episode, the South Park boys form their own backyard wrestling league, drawing droves of fans more interested in the acting and scripted dramatic storylines than athletic elements.
"W.T.F." was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode parodied several aspects of professional wrestling, highlighting the sport's emphasis on such theatrical elements as costumes, back stories and scripted storylines. The episode demonstrated how amateur wrestling is often afforded less respect due to pro-wrestling, and presents pro-wrestling fans as stereotypical rednecks who believe the scripted drama is real.
"W.T.F." specifically parodies World Wrestling Entertainment and  its chairman, Vince McMahon. The episode received generally mixed reviews, with several commentators calling professional wrestling too easy a target for South Park satire. According to Nielsen ratings, "W.T.F." was seen by 1.37 million households among viewers aged between 18 and 49.

[[Chiliophyllum]]

CATEGORIES: Asteraceae genera, Astereae, Monotypic plant genera, Endemic flora of Argentina

Chiliophyllum is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae, containing the single species Chiliophyllum densifolium. It is endemic to Argentina, where it is known only from Mendoza Province.Bonifacino, J. M. (2009). Taxonomic revision of the Chiliotrichum Group sensu stricto (Compositae: Astereae). Smithsonian Contributions to Botany 92. pg. 21. Its local common names include romero del piche and romero pichi.
This species is a member of the Chiliotrichum Group in the tribe Astereae of the aster family. This group includes many related "shrubby daisies" native to South America. Chiliophyllum densifolium is the type species of its genus, described from Mendoza Province in 1862. Two more species were added to the genus, but in 2009 C. fuegianum was transferred to Chiliotrichum and C. andinum was moved to a genus of its own, Cabreraea, leaving C. densifolium the sole member of Chiliophyllum.
This plant is a spreading, somewhat rounded shrub growing up to 1.7 meters tall. Its herbage is gland-dotted and sometimes has woolly hairs. The branches are covered densely in leaves; the genus name Chiliophyllum is from the Greek chilios ("thousand") and phyllon ("leaf"), a reference to the abundant leaves, and the species name densifolium also refers to the dense foliage. The leathery, glandular leaf blades are 5 to 6 millimeters long and teardrop-shaped. Flower heads occur singly at the tips of the branches. They are cylindrical with layers of glandular phyllaries that have membranous edges. The heads contain 4 to 8 yellow ray florets tipped with three lobes and up to 12 tubular yellow disc florets tipped with five curled lobes. The fruit is a ribbed achene up to a centimeter long including its pappus of many narrow scales.
This species only occurs in the Andes of central Argentina, where it grows in rocky mountainous habitat at elevations between 2000 and 2600 meters. Associated flora includes Nassauvia axillaris, Berberis buxifolia, and species of Ephedra and Adesmia.
The plant is used medicinally as a diuretic mixed with yerba mate in mate.

These are members of the Chiliotrichum Group in the tribe Astereae of the aster family, a group of related South American "shrubby daisies". Chiliotrichiopsis species are densely branched, rounded shrubs. The branches are ribbed, glandular, and coated in woolly hairs. The alternately arranged leaves are linear to oval in shape with rolled edges and hairy undersides. The flower heads are solitary or occasionally in clusters of 3 or 4. Each head is cylindrical to bell-shaped with layers of wooly-haired, gland-dotted phyllaries. Two species have yellow ray florets with staminodes, and one lacks ray florets. The center of the head is filled with several tubular yellow disc florets. The fruit is a hairy, glandular achene with a pappus of scales.
There are 3 species:
A fourth species, C. mendocina, was transferred to a genus of its own, Haroldia, based on analyses of DNA and morphology.

[[GRSM]]

CATEGORIES: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music

GRSM is an abbreviation for Graduate of the Royal Schools of Music  (London). This professional diploma of graduate status (equivalent to a university first degree) was open to both internal students of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music after joint examination. Candidates followed a three year course including: first and second instrumental or vocal studies, harmony and counterpoint, aural training, history and analysis, conducting, composition and arrangement, and an academic thesis. The former Royal Manchester College of Music, now the Royal Northern College of Music, also awarded the diploma GRSM (Manchester).GRSM (London) Syllabus, 1974 The diploma awarded in London was phased out in the 1990s. When the Royal Academy became a full college of the University of London, the GRSM, along with the non-graduate Performers' Course, was replaced by the award of the BMus (London) for all successful undergraduate students. The Royal College of Music devised its own BMus course which (uniquely among conservetoires) it was entitled by Royal Charter to award. The other mainline British music colleges followed a similar model: Trinity College of Music awarded the GTCL graduate diploma and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama the GGSM diploma. Like the GRSM, they have been replaced.
The LRAM diploma, open to all students of the Royal Academy of Music, in either instrumental teaching or performing was usually taken by examination in the second year of the GRSM course. Similarly the ARCM was a requirement at the College for those taking the GRSM.
Those awarded the Graduate Diploma (by the Royal Academy and Royal College) are entitled to use the post-nominal letters GRSM (London) and to wear the appropriate academic dress: black bachelors' gown with scarlet silk hood of full Cambridge shape, the cowl part-lined 3 inches and bound 1/4 inch with royal blue silk, the neckband fully lined and bound 1/4 inch of royal blue silk.Academical Dress of Music Colleges and Societies of Musicians in the United Kingdom: With Notes on Degrees and Diplomas in Music of Certain Other Institutions by Nicholas Groves and John Kersey.

Chez Raginiak is an award-winning author who escaped communist Poland in 1985 at age 25[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.messengernews.net/page/content.detail/id/520216.html?nav=5010|title=Raginiak tells of his American life|last=Weld|first=Karen|date=17 November 2009|work=The Messenger|accessdate=30 January 2014[/tpl] by securing a temporary exit visa to Italy during the "Polish Pope" travel thaw of the mid 1980s.  He crossed the Alps from Italy to Austria where he spent the next 6 months in Austrian refugee camp before relocating to the United States.  In many ways his experience, once he reached the USA, embodies the near-mythological story of the hardworking individual rewarded by success that draws many to the American shores.
His first book, My Escape To Freedom, was nominated for a Midwest Book Award in 2008.
His second book, Learn English Without Teachers, is being translated to Spanish, Polish, Arabic, Hmong, Somali, and Burmese.
His third book, Tradition! What's your polka? was endorsed by Jack Canfield, author of Chicken Soup for the Soul.

Chimantaea is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae.
This genus of 9 speciesChimantaea. The Plant List. is endemic to the Pantepui,Rull, V. (2004). Biogeography of the 'Lost World': a palaeoecological perspective. Earth-Science Reviews 67(1), 125-37. a biogeographic province on the Guiana Highlands in Venezuela, Guyana, and Brazil.Désamoré, A., et al. (2010). Biogeography of the Lost World (Pantepui region, northeastern South America): insights from bryophytes. Phytotaxa 9, 254-65. The region is characterized by a pattern of about 50 tepuis, isolated tabletop mountains that arise from the sandstone plateau of the highlands. Tepuis are known for their biodiversity, especially their concentrations of endemic species, and most are still pristine, undisturbed ecosystems. The genus is almost entirely restricted to the Chimantá Massif, a complex of several of these tepuis in Bolívar, Venezuela. There several species of the genus are dominant members of the higher-elevation shrublands, which are known as paramoid vegetation because of their similarity to the páramos of the Andes.Rull, V.

[[Binding and loosing]]
CATEGORIES: Judaism terms, Christian terms, Judeo-Christian topics, Sayings of Jesus, Biblical phrases

Binding and loosing is an originally Jewish phrase which appears in the New Testament, as well as in the Targum. In usage to bind and to loose mean simply to forbid by an indisputable authority, and to permit by an indisputable authority.[tpl]EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=BINDING AND LOOSING|section=Beth_Rehob-Box[/tpl] The Targum to a particular Psalm[tpl]bibleverse||Psalms|58:5|[/tpl] (verse 6 in some English versions) implies that these actions were considered to be as effectual as the
spell of an enchanter.
The poseks had, by virtue of their ordination, the power of deciding disputes relating to Jewish law. Hence the difference between the two main schools of thought in early classical Judaism were summed up by the phrase the school of Shammai binds; the school of Hillel looses.
Theoretically, however, the authority of the poseks proceeded from the Sanhedrin, and there is therefore a Talmudic statement that there were three decisions made by the lower house of judgment (the Sanhedrin) to which the upper house of judgment (the heavenly one) gave its supreme sanction.Massoth, 23b The claim that whatsoever disciple binds or looses on earth shall be bound or loosed in heaven, which the Gospel of Matthew attributes to Jesus,[tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|18:18|[/tpl] is probably therefore just an adoption of a phrase popular at the time.
This is probably also the meaning of the phrase when it is applied in the text to Simon Peter in particular[tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|16:19|[/tpl] when Simon is invested with the power to bind and loose by Christ. This serves as the scriptural and traditional foundation for the Catholic Church's conception of papal authority, stemming from such an investiture of St. Peter, since, according to Roman Catholic doctrine, the Popes are the Successors of St. Peter.

New tribes in Asteraceae. Phytologia 91(3), 568-70.Nordenstam, B. and V. A. Funk. Corymbieae. In: Funk, V. A., et al. Systematics, Evolution, and Biogeography of Compositae. Vienna, Austria: International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT). 2009. pp.487-91. The species are all endemic to the Cape Province of South Africa, where they are known commonly as plampers.
These are perennial herbs growing from a thick, hairy rhizome. It is stemless, with the flowers borne on an erect scape. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, sometimes narrowly oval in shape, with pointed tips and veins running the length of the blades. They are hairless to slightly hairy. At the top of the stout scape are panicles or corymbs of flower heads. Each head has a single floret. It is pink, purple, or white and tipped with five lobes. It is enclosed in a pair of narrow green to purplish bracts. The style is divided into two long, hairy branches. The achene is tipped with a pappus of scales or fine bristles.
The plants produce copious nectar which attracts an assemblage of bees, wasps, beetles, and ants, which likely act as pollinators. Plants of the genus appear to be adapted to wildfire-prone habitat, and have been observed flowering most abundantly after fire.
There are 9 species:Corymbium. The Plant List.

John Common is an songwriter, musician and singer based in Denver, Colorado.
Born in Jacksonville, North Carolina, Common spent most of his youth in Pensacola, Florida.  When he was thirteen years old, Common found his older brother's Epiphone acoustic guitar in a closet and began writing songs.  While in Pensacola, Common founded and fronted the psychedelic roots rock band Bunkhouse Jones.  Bunkhouse Jones released two records and toured clubs and small venues in the South.  After finishing school, he traveled around the country to New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Burlington, and other towns writing, busking, playing shows and making lo-fi recordings.  After a stint working on a small family farm in Denmark, Kansas, he made his way to Colorado.

[[Kiamitia County]]
CATEGORIES: Choctaw, Indian Territory, Pre-statehood history of Oklahoma

Kiamitia County, also known as Kiamichi County, was a political subdivision of the Choctaw Nation of Indian Territory.  The county formed part of the nation’s Pushmataha District, or Third District, one of three administrative super-regions.  
The county seat of Kiamitia County was Goodland.  This was the original settlement of Goodland, four miles north of present-day Hugo, Oklahoma.  A United States Post Office operated at Goodland, Indian Territory from August 21, 1871 to February 28, 1902.  The community centered at the county seat no longer exists.  Modern Goodland is located three miles south of Hugo.  A post office calling itself Goodland, Oklahoma, located in Goodland Indian Orphanage, operated there from April 5, 1915 to July 31, 1944.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 90.
The spelling and rendering of the county’s official name appears to have been Kiamitia, reflecting the fact that the name of the Kiamichi River—for which it was named—was not standardized as such until the 20th century.  The Choctaw Nation labeled the county as “Kiamitia” as did Angie Debo, its preeminent historian, who used the term in her epic 1934 work, The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic.  Edwin C. McReynolds, in his landmark 1965 Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, renders the spelling of the county as “Kiamichi”.  
Kiamitia County’s boundaries were, as were all Choctaw counties, designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks.  Much of its northern boundary, south of Antlers, Oklahoma was formed by Dumpling Creek.  Much of its western boundary was Middle Boggy Creek.  Its eastern boundary, in part, was formed by the Kiamichi River and its southern boundary was the Red River.Edwin C. McReynolds, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, plate 38.
As Oklahoma’s statehood approached, its leading citizens, participating in the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state’s counties that Kiamitia County could not exist as an economically viable political subdivision.  By the time of Oklahoma’s statehood in 1907 its county seat existed generally for holding county court, as well as for educational and religious purposes, and not as a population center.  Hugo, by then the area’s largest town, was until statehood cut off from some of its natural economic hinterland, which fell within neighboring Red River County and Towson County of the Choctaw Nation.
This conundrum was also recognized by the framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory.  The county structure proposed by the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention also abolished the Choctaw counties.  Kiamitia County was generally kept as a unit, but was expanded to the east and west and called Hitchcock County.  The proposed county seat for Hitchcock County was Hugo.  
Much of this proposition was borrowed by Oklahoma’s framers, who largely adopted the proposed boundaries for Hitchcock County but called it Choctaw County, Oklahoma, establishing Hugo as its county seat.
Like all Choctaw counties, Kiamitia County served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration.  Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger.  The judge’s duties included oversight of overall county administration.  The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census.  The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.

Retrieved 2009-10-21. or exalted earth,The Egyptian Gods. Retrieved 2008-10-21. as well as referring to the silt of the Nile. As a primeval chthonic deity,Tatenen Retrieved 2009-10-21. Tatenen was identified with creation. He was an androgynous protector of nature from the Memphis area, then known as "Men-nefer".
Tatenen represented the Earth and was born in the moment it rose from the watery chaos, analogous to the primeval mound of the benben and mastaba and the later pyramids. He was seen as the source of "food and viands, divine offers, all good things",C. J. Bleeker. Historia Religionum I: Religions of the Past, p.68 as his realms were the deep regions beneath the earth "from which everything emerges", specifically including plants, vegetables, and minerals.  His father was the creator god Khnum, who made him on his potter's wheel of Nile mud at the moment of creation of Earth.M. Lichtheim: Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol.3, p.113 This fortuity granted him the titles of both "creator and mother who gave birth to all gods" and "father of all the gods".J. H. Breasted: Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Three, § 411 He also personified Egypt (due to his associations with rebirth and the Nile) and was an aspect of the earth-god Geb, as a source of artistic inspiration,J. H. Breasted: Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Two, § 91 as well as assisting the dead in their journey to the afterlife.Carol Andrews: The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, spell 180
He is first attested in the Coffin Texts, where his name appears as Tanenu or Tanuu, 'the inert land', a name which characterizes him as a god of the primeval condition of the earth. Middle Kingdom texts provide the first examples of the form Tatenen.
With a staff Tatenen repelled the evil serpent Apep from the Primeval Mound. He also had a magical mace dedicated to the falcon, venerated as "The Great White of the Earth Creator".Intersexed and Androgynous Deities in Religion or Mythology. Retrieved 2009-10-21. In one interpretation, Tatenen brought the Djed-pillars of stability to the country, although this is more commonly attributed to Ptah.

The Pontifical Mission Societies, known in some countries as Missio, is the name of a group of Catholic missionary societies that are under the canonical jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope). These organizations include the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, the Society of St. Peter the Apostle, the Holy Childhood Association and the Missionary Union of Priests and Religious.
Since 1922, Missio has been the Catholic Church’s official support organisation for overseas mission.
The Pope specifically asks the Pontifical Mission Societies to help bring the messages of Christ to the world, especially in countries where Christianity is new, young or poor.  The societies care for and support the younger churches until they are able to be self-sufficient.
Missio raises awareness and fosters prayer and cooperation in the whole Catholic Church, with 120 offices worldwide, it is the only organisation which supports every one of the 1,069 mission dioceses of the world. Missio exists through the generosity of Catholics and plays a crucial role in combating poverty, disease, injustice and exploitation.[tpl]cn|date=September 2013[/tpl]

[[Hitchcock County, Sequoyah]]

CATEGORIES: Indian Territory

Hitchcock County was a proposed political subdivision created by the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention.  The convention, meeting in Muskogee, Indian Territory in 1905, established the political and administrative layout of a prospective U.S. state it called the State of Sequoyah.  
Sequoyah was an attempt by the Five Civilized Tribes and others in the Indian Territory—who did not wish to be incorporated into an American state—to establish full statehood for the territory.  Although their attempt to achieve statehood was unsuccessful, many of their deliberations in establishing proposed counties proved useful to the framers of Oklahoma, who met just two years later for the purpose of establishing the State of Oklahoma.
The boundaries of modern-day Choctaw, Pushmataha and McCurtain counties in Oklahoma are derived largely from the work of the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention.  Edwin C. McReynolds, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, 1965.
Hitchcock County, with Hugo as its county seat, was proposed, in general, to take the place of Kiamitia County (Kiamichi County), Choctaw Nation, which would be abolished with the advent of Sequoyah statehood.  The county was named in honor of Ethan Allen Hitchcock (1835-1909), the federal Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes, formerly the American minister (ambassador) to the Russian Empire.  
Hitchcock County was created and sized appropriate to the economic heft of Hugo merchants, whose trade territory was to be included, more or less whole, in the new county.  The usefulness of these arrangements did not escape the attention of Oklahoma’s framers, who in 1907 borrowed, largely intact, the concept and proposed boundaries of Hitchcock County for Choctaw County, Oklahoma.
The recorded minutes of the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention’s committee on counties have been lost, so no additional information on the proposed Hitchcock County is available.  Amos Maxwell, The Sequoyah Constitutional Convention, 1953.

CATEGORIES: Spacecraft propulsion

The Nano-particle field extraction thruster or NanoFET is an experimental high-speed spacecraft engine under development by the University of Michigan.Boysen, E. & Muir, N.C. (2011) Nanotechnology For Dummies. 2 Ed., p.172., For Dummies, ISBN 1-118-13686-1. Retrieved July 2011 It provides thrust by emitting charged particles. These particles are cylindrical carbon nanotubes which can either be contained in tanks or manufactured in-flight. By varying the size of these particles, the nanoFET can vary its fuel efficiency (specific impulse), and consequently the amount of thrust output, while maintaining  high power efficiency. This adjustability gives the nanoFET the performance characteristics of all the electric thrusters in one. Like other electric propulsion systems, the nanoFET is not intended for operation inside earth's atmosphere but for operations in orbit and deep space.[tpl]cite journal|last=Drenkow|first=Brittany D.|coauthors=Thomas M.

[[Gerard of Florennes]]
CATEGORIES: 11th-century Roman Catholic bishops, 970s births, 1051 deaths

Gerard of Florennes (ca 975, bishop 1012He was named by the Emperor, 10 February 1012, and consecrated at Reims 27 April (Erik van Mingroot, ed. Les chartes de Gérard Ier, Liébert et Gérard II, évêques de Cambrai 2005, p. 2.) – 14 March 1051Gesta episcoporum Cameracensium, ed. Bethmann in MGH Scriptores VII, 490.), bishop of Cambrai as Gerard I, had formerly been chaplain to Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, and helpful to the latter in his political negotiations with Robert the Pious, King of France. In 1024 Gerard called a synod in Arras to confront a purported heresy fomented by the Gundulfian heretics, who denied the efficacy of the Eucharist.  The records of this synod, the Acta Synodi Atrebatensis,Patrologia Latina 142, cols. 1269–1312. preserve a summary of orthodox Christian doctrine of the early eleventh century, as well contemporary peace-making practices. According to this text's author, the heretics were convinced by Gerard's explanation of orthodoxy, renounced their heresy, and were reconciled with the church.
Gerard was the second son of Arnold, seigneur of Florennes in the county of Namur, the son of Godefroi, count of Hainaut, and thus a member of the high nobility of the Low Countries.[tpl]MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/NAMUR.htm |title-date= |title= (Medieval Lands Project)  Namur 5.C|date=August 2012[/tpl]
He was a student of the great Gerbert of Aurillac, the leading theologian of the tenth century, and a supporter of the monastic reformer Richard of Verdun, abbot of Saint-Vanne.Diane Reilly, Art of Reform in Eleventh-Century Flanders: Gerard of Cambrai, Richard of Saint-Vanne and the Saint-Vaast Bible, Studies in the history of Christian traditions 128 (Leiden) 2006. In 1012, while he was a canon at Reims he founded the Abbey of Saint-Jean at Florennes, with Richard  as its first abbot.  
At Florennes, on 12 September 1015, Godfrey II, Duke of Lower Lorraine, whose appointment Gerard had recommended to the Emperor, defeated both of his rivals, Lambert I, Count of Leuven, brother-in-law of Otto, and Reginar IV, count of Mons killing Lambert and forcing Reginar to make peace. 
In 1015, Gerard transferred the abbey of Florennes to the church of Liège.The abbey church was consecrated in 1026. The early history of the abbey is known via the Miracula S. Gengulfi, written in 1028/1045 by Abbot Gonzo. The abbey was completely destroyed during the French Revolution. (Florennes (Municipality)). drawing together a community of monks from Verdun. Texts from the scriptorium show the innovative separation of words with spaces.Paul Saenger, Space Between Words: the origins of silent reading 2000, p 192, and note 78.
Gerard was one of the theorists who justified the division of European society into the three estates of the realm, observing, as Georges Duby characterised his thought, "that there were distinctions between men, an essential inequality which could be compensated only by charity, mercy and mutual service" within the framework of divinely ordained natural law.Georges Duby, (Arthur Goldhammer, tr.) The Three Orders: Feudal society imagined 1980, quoted in Rodney Bruce Hall, "Moral Authority as a Power Resource" International Organization 51.4 (Autumn 1997:591-622) p. 598. In addition to his role in the Investiture Controversy, Gerard was a voice in the implementation of the Peace and Truce of God movement to limit warfare.David C. Van Meter, "The Peace of Amiens-Corbie and Gerard of Cambrai's oration of the three functional orders: the date, the context, the rhetoric", Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire 74 (1996:633-57), esp. pp 644-57. At Douai in 1024 he introduced the Peace into Flanders at the urging of Count Baldwin IV, he himself apparently having reservations.Geoffrey G. Koziol (1987), "Monks, Feuds, and the Making of Peace in Eleventh-Century Flanders," Historical Reflections, 14(3):531. The traditional date is 1036, but Georges Duby has argued for a re-dating to 1024. 
During his episcopacy, the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Cambrai was reconsecrated on 18 October 1030.
In 1023–25, Gerard was working on his Vita Gaugerici, a life of Gaugericus, one of the early bishops of Cambrai. He made extensive use of the library of Marchiennes, a former nunnery converted into a male monastery in 1024. Its abbot, Leduin, was a close ally of Gerard's in the campaign for monastic reform in the diocese. Leduin possessed a manuscript, used by Gerard, containing Gregory the Great's Regula pastoralis and extracts from Taius of Zaragoza's De malorum concordia, and Bachiarius' De paenitentia.Steven Vanderputten and Diane J. Reilly, "Reconciliation and Record Keeping: Heresy, Secular Dissent and the Exercise of Episcopal Authority in Eleventh-Century Cambrai", Journal of Medieval History 37:4 (2011), 343–57.

[[Cedar County, Choctaw Nation]]
CATEGORIES: Choctaw, Indian Territory, 1908 disestablishments, Pre-statehood history of Oklahoma

Cedar County was a political subdivision of the Choctaw Nation in the Indian Territory.  The county formed part of the nation’s Apukshunnubbee District, or Second District, one of three administrative super-regions.
The word for "Cedar" in the Choctaw language is Chuala.  The county was often referred to as Chuala County.Cyrus Byington, A Dictionary of the Choctaw Language.  Washington:  Smithsonian Institution, 1978.
Cedar County was established by the Choctaw Nation’s Doaksville Constitution of 1860.  It ceased to exist on November 16, 1907, along with the Choctaw Nation and the Indian Territory, upon the advent of Oklahoma’s statehood.  The territory comprising the former county is now included in the Pushmataha County and McCurtain County in Oklahoma.
The county seat of Cedar County was Sulphur Springs, located near present-day Rattan, Oklahoma in Pushmataha County.
Like all Choctaw counties, Cedar County served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration.  Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger.  The judge’s duties included oversight of overall county administration.  The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census.  The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.
Choctaw political subdivisions were drawn according to easily recognizable or popular natural landmarks, such as mountain ranges, rivers or streams.  Cedar County’s boundaries were determined likewise—its western boundary was the Kiamichi River and its eastern boundary was Little River (Red River).  Its northern border ran along the top of the Kiamichi Mountains south of Tuskahoma.Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.
The county took its name from Cedar Creek—today known as Big Cedar Creek—which in turn lent its name to Old Cedar Church, a Choctaw Indian Methodist congregation around which the present-day settlement of Finley, Oklahoma was established.“James Brown Tims”, Indian-Pioneer Papers, Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries.
Cedar County was large, scenic and mountainous.  Due to the rough terrain imposed by the Kiamichi Mountains the county was not home to any towns, only isolated settlements and encampments.  After the Choctaw Nation’s settlement by whites in the 1880s and 1890s the county became known for its hunting and fishing opportunities, and tourists from Paris, Texas and elsewhere took the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway to Antlers, Oklahoma from which they traveled east to Cedar County for hunting and fishing expeditions lasting for several days or more.Many accounts were published by the Antlers Democrat, Antlers News, Antlers News Record, and Antlers American newspapers.

[[Sulphur Springs, Indian Territory]]

CATEGORIES: Indian Territory

Sulphur Springs was a Choctaw Indian community formerly existing in the Choctaw Nation of Indian Territory.  It was located 3/4 mile south-southeast of the highway intersection of OK 3 and OK 93 in present-day Rattan, in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma.    
Prior to establishment of a United States Post Office in 1910 with the name “Rattan”, the area was called Sulphur Springs.  Sulphur Springs was county seat of Cedar County in the Choctaw Nation.  It was established by the Choctaw’s Doaksville Constitution of 1860 and, in the manner of most Choctaw county seats, served a part-time role as legal and political center.  It was never a sizeable settlement and boasted almost no mercantile or retail stores.  “Harrison Frazier”, Indian-Pioneer Papers, Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries; Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, pp. 151-154.
County court met on the first Monday of each month and was called Probate Court, even though it was more similar to modern-day county court proceedings than a modern probate court.  The court met in a large log house, constructed of long, straight logs, serving as both an Indian Methodist church and court house.  
The Cedar County Court House was torn down by white settlers sometime after the dissolution of the Choctaw Nation as a sovereign entity upon Oklahoma’s statehood in 1907.  A tree stump said to be preserved from the tree used as a whipping post—the preferred form of punishment doled out by the Choctaw Nation judicial system—is now held by the Pushmataha County Historical Society in Antlers, Oklahoma.  Ibid., "Harrison Frazier".
Sulphur Springs took its name from several sulphur springs located in the vicinity.  A number of Choctaw families living around the Cedar County Court House used them as well as visitors to county court and meetings of the Methodist congregation.  Ibid., "Harrison Frazier".

[[Languages of the Republic of the Congo]]
CATEGORIES: Languages of the Republic of the Congo

The official language of the Republic of Congo is French. Other languages are mainly Bantu languages, and the two national languages in the country are Kituba and LingalaConstitution de 2002 de la République du Congo (13%), followed by Mboshi, Bateke (17.3%), and more than forty other languages, including Pygmy languages (1.4%), which are not Bantu languages.
French is spoken by 30% of the Congolese population.Délégation générale à la langue française et aux langues de France, référence 2006. According to a study by Omar Massoumou, 88% of those in Brazzaville aged over 15 can write simple phrases in French.Les usages linguistiques à Brazzaville la place du français, Omer Massoumou, Université Marien Ngouabi, Brazzaville.
According to Laval University, because of civil wars that rocked the country, French became a "haven language" for various armed factions. For example, speakers who are incompetent in Kituba (especially those in the south), Kikongo and Lingala (especially those in the north) prefer to speak French for security reasons. For fear of revealing their ethnicity, the Congolese go to French, which helps preserve their anonymity.Le Congo-BRAZZAVILLE(République populaire) (See also: African French)
Kituba (or Munukutuba) is a simplified Kikongo creole, understandable by the users of different dialects of Kikongo. This language is used by 50.35% of the Congolese population who live along the Congo-Océan railway line which connects Brazzaville to Pointe-Noire in the south of the country. 
Lingala, the river language, is the language of President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, and is spoken mainly in the north and east of the country. This is the language which has grown most quickly in the past few years in the Congo.
Batekes form 18% of the population and are mostly found in the Plateaux Department, in the Cuvette-Ouest (where they are known as Mbéti and Tégué), Niari (where they are known as Nzabi), Bouenza and the Pool region.
Lari is a mixture of various idioms of Kongo and Téké, and is the language mostly spoken in the Pool region.
The dominant sign language is ASL from Nigeria, influenced by local gestures and conventions.

[[Hamden, Oklahoma]]
CATEGORIES: Unincorporated communities in Choctaw County, Oklahoma, Unincorporated communities in Oklahoma

Hamden is an unincorporated community in northern Choctaw County, Oklahoma, seven miles southeast of Antlers, Oklahoma.
A United States Post Office was established at Hamden, Indian Territory on March 31, 1894 and operated until May 15, 1924.George B. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 96; Post Office Site Location Reports, Record Group 28, National Archives  Hamden is on the boundary separating Choctaw County and Pushmataha County, and residents of the community live in both.
During the 1880s the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, more popularly known as the “Frisco”, built a line from north to south through the Choctaw Nation of the Indian Territory, connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas with Paris, Texas. Train stations were established every few miles to aid in opening up the land and, more particularly, to serve as the locations of section houses. Supervisors for their respective miles of track lived in the section houses to administer the track and its right-of-way. These stations also served as points at which the trains could draw water.
The site of Hamden was selected because of its proximity to a local creek. Adjacent station stops were established to the north and south.
The sparsely-populated area, at that time known as Kiamitia County (Kiamichi County) of the Choctaw Nation, in the Indian Territory, was home to Choctaw Indians who farmed or subsisted on the land.
Few roads or trails existed.  Transportation was provided by the Frisco Railroad, which offered six trains per day—three in each direction—until it closed to passenger traffic during the late 1950s. It continued freight operations until 1981, when it closed altogether.
Hamden, in its commercial heyday, boasted a cotton gin, store, school and churches, in addition to numerous homes.  Residents continue to live in the area.  The only local landmarks are a community center and the foundations of the old cotton gin, located near the railroad tracks and creek.

Nelson is an unincorporated community in northwestern Choctaw County, Oklahoma, six miles north of Soper, Oklahoma.
Spencer Academy, a Choctaw Nation school, was moved here from Spencerville, Oklahoma.  A United States Post Office was established at Nelson, Indian Territory on March 10, 1881 and operated until November 30, 1954.  Until September 15, 1881 the official name of this post office was Nelsons.  
Nelson is named for Cole E. Nelson, prominent Choctaw Indian and National Attorney of the Choctaw Nation.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 148; Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 127; Post Office Site Location Reports, Record Group 28, National Archives.
Until the advent of Oklahoma's statehood Nelson was located in Kiamitia County (Kiamichi County), Choctaw Nation.
Nelson’s livelihood as a commercial and population center was threatened after the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway built its tracks east of Nelson, passing instead through the communities of Antlers, Hamden, Speer and Hugo.  Although it retained a lively community for decades following the railroad’s construction in the 1880s, the towns along the railroad sapped it of potential commercial success.
Nelson continues to be home to several families, and as such remains the area’s oldest settlement.

King of the Jews is a book by Nick Tosches. On the surface it is a biography of Arnold Rothstein, the man who reputedly fixed the 1919 World Series, inspired the characters of Meyer Wolfsheim in The Great Gatsby and Nathan Detroit in Guys and Dolls, and created the modern system of organized crime.
The book also contains numerous digressions away from its main subject, including: an extended linguistic discussion of transformation of the Hebrews from a polytheistic to monotheistic religion, early 20th-century European Jewish culture, acknowledging the lack of real information on the life of Rothstein, several instances of the author breaking from the various narratives to speak in the first person to the reader, and a repeating motif involving Jesus having sex with a woman.
The book began as an article in Vanity Fair, for which Tosches is a contributing editor.

The Arab street ([tpl]lang-ar|الشارع العربي[/tpl], ash-shāriʿ al-ʿarabī) is an expression referring to the spectrum of public opinion in the Arab world, often as opposed to or contrasted to the opinions of Arab governments.Friedman, Thomas. Under the Arab Street, The New York Times, October 23, 2002. In some contexts it refers more specifically to the lower socioeconomic strata of Arab society.
While it is sometimes assumed, particularly in the United States where it is most widely used, to have been borrowed from Arabic political discourse, its evolution has followed a circular course from Arabic to English and then back. Lebanese newspapers began referring to just "the street" during the 1950s; later in the decade reports in The New York Times used the term in English to explain Gamal Abdel Nasser's broad appeal not just in his native Egypt but across the Arab world. Later commentators added the "Arab" and eventually dropped the scare quotes to create the current usage, which became widespread in American media during the First Palestinian Intifada in 1987.[tpl]cite journal|last=Regier|first=Terry|author2=Khalidi, Muhammad Ali|title=The Arab Street: Tracking a Political Metaphor|journal=The Middle East Journal|date=Winter 2009|volume=63|issue=1|pages=19–23|doi=10.3751/63.1.11|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~regier/papers/arab-street-published.pdf|accessdate=September 3, 2013[/tpl] Arab media began using it themselves a decade later.Regier and Khalidi, 26. However, its usage still differs between the two languages. In the Western English-language media, only Arab popular sentiment is referred to as the "street"; Arabic commentators use the expression in the same sense to refer to not just public opinion in their countries but in the West as well.Regier and Khalidi, 24.
Due to the many negative connotations attached to the use of "street" as a modifier, the use of the term in English has been criticized as fostering stereotypes of a population easily roused to violence and thus unfit for democracy. The use of "Arab street" thus alternately justifies the need for an authoritarian ruler to keep them in check, or constrains the potentially moderate actions of those rulers as a Damoclean sword.[tpl]cite web|last=Malik|first=Hassan|title=The Myth of 'the Arab Street'|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2011/01/31/myth-arab-street|publisher=World Policy Journal|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2013[/tpl] Some have even doubted its existence. Western policymakers have thus either been led to dismiss the Arab street's reported opinions as irrelevant or fear it as unknowable and immeasurable, although this latter view has been challenged.
In the wake of the Arab Spring, the concept of the Arab street has been revisited and challenged. The revolutions that toppled governments in Egypt and Tunisia have, to some, shown how deficient and outdated Western understandings of Arab public opinion, shaped by the "Arab street", had been and have even led to calls for its discontinuation. Others, including some Arabs, saw the uprisings as vindicating the importance of public opinion in their cultures and changing the popular concept of the street within them.[tpl]cite news|last=Shaybeddine|first=Ula|title=The New Meaning of the Arab 'Street'|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/746|newspaper=Al Akhbar|date=September 29, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2013[/tpl]

[[Spencerville, Oklahoma]]

CATEGORIES: Unincorporated communities in Oklahoma, Unincorporated communities in Choctaw County, Oklahoma

Spencerville is an unincorporated community in northern Choctaw County, Oklahoma, 12 miles northeast of Hugo, Oklahoma, adjacent to the Pushmataha County border.
Spencerville, named for U.S. Secretary of War John C. Spencer, was home to Spencer Academy, a Choctaw Nation boarding school for boys.  It was founded in 1844.  It was here that Negro freedman "Uncle" Wallace Willis composed “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”. He was inspired by the Red River which reminded him of the Jordan River and of the Prophet Elijah being taken to heaven by a chariot.
Spencer Academy was operated on behalf of the Choctaw Indians by the Presbyterian Board of Missions.  Prior to Oklahoma's statehood Spencerville was in Towson County, Choctaw Nation—but only barely.  Nearby Frazier Creek formed the boundary separating it from Cedar County to the north.  The Kiamichi River formed the boundary separating it from Kiamitia County (Kiamichi County) to the west.
A United States Post Office operated at Spencerville, Indian Territory from January 22, 1844 to July 22, 1847 and was established again on May 17, 1902.  The community and its post offices took their name from the academy.  The academy later relocated to Nelson, Oklahoma several miles to the west.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 196; Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 60; Post Office Site Location Reports, Record Group 28, National Archives.
Like the community of Hamden—also on the Choctaw and Pushmataha county boundary—and Honobia, on the Pushmataha and Le Flore county border—Spencerville straddles the county line and defies classification as belonging solely to one county or the other.  Residents of both counties traded there, used its postal services, and worshipped there.  The site of old Spencerville is less than 1,000 yards from the Pushmataha County border.

 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]</ref>
In the April 2007 elections the Tai LGA recorded an implausible 99.6% turnout for the Governorship election.[ref]
</ref>
Celestine Omehia of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) was at first declared winner, but his election was later annulled and Rotimi Amaechi, also of the PDP, was declared governor.[ref]
</ref>
In February 2009, the Chairman of Tai Local Government Area was Barry Mpigi.[ref]

There are many oil wells in the LGA, which is laced with pipelines, with most of the oil installations being operated by Shell Nigeria. However, the local community has seen little benefit from oil extraction, and infrastructure is poor.
In the 1990s, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People began a struggle against the degradation of their lands, which at times erupted into violence.[ref]
</ref> 
In June 2001 an oil pipeline that passes through the Baraale community ruptured and spilled crude oil into nearby forests, farmlands and houses. There were delays in repair, and in October 2001 the spilled oil caught fire, causing extensive environmental damage.[ref]
</ref>
The region suffers from violence, kidnapping and arson.[ref]

The Battle of Kolašin ([tpl]lang-sr|Bitka kod Kolašina[/tpl]) took place on July 28, 1858 between the Principality of Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire near Kolašin. The Montenegrin army was composed of 5.000 men from Vasojevići, Morača, Rovci, Drobnjaci, Uskoci and Kuči. The Montenegrin army burnt all of the Turkish katuns on the Sinja(je)vina, and razed the villages of Trebaljevo, Lipovo and Štitarica.[tpl]cite book |last= Rastoder |first= Šerbo |author2=Andrijašević, Živko|author3=Popović, Dragutin|author4=Folić, Zvezdan|author5=Šabotić, Sait|author6=Drobnjak, Slobodan|author7=Selhanović, Jadranka|author8=Drinčić, Željko|author9= Prekić, Adnan |title= Istorijski Leksikon Crne Gore |volume= Volume I: A - Crn |pages= 121–122 |location= Podgorica |publisher= Daily Press - Vijesti |year= 2006 |language= Serbian | isbn= 86-7706-165-7|display-authors= 9 [/tpl]
The attack on Kolašin caused numerous political problems and diplomatic complications, which would later become known as the "Kolašin Affair" (Kolašinska afera). Disagreements were put aside with the engagement of diplomatic representatives of the Great Powers, who showed a great interest in the situation occurring in the Balkans.

Denise Margaret Allen (born 29 March 1953) is a former Australian politician, political strategist, social/political commentator and disability advocate.
Born in Alexandra, Victoria to Jack Donald and Bette Doreen Boote, she attended local public schools before graduating in 1970. Prior to entering politics Denise was a life skills/motivational tutor. She also owned a modelling agency, beauty therapy studio and retail fashion store.[ref]
</ref>
In 2000, she was the Labor Party candidate for the by-election for Benalla in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, which was being vacated by former Deputy Premier and state Nationals leader Pat McNamara.  On paper, Allen faced daunting odds.  Benalla was a staunchly conservative seat in rural northeastern Victoria, and had been in National hands for all but nine years since 1920.  However, she won a surprise victory over new Nationals candidate Bill Sykes, winning by only 237 votes.  She was the first Labor member ever to win it.  A Buddhist, she was the inaugural chairperson of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet. In the 2002 state election, she was defeated by Sykes in a rematch despite Labor being reelected in a massive landslide. She was a People Power candidate for the Victorian Legislative Council in 2006, contesting Northern Victoria Region unsuccessfully.

[[Generic-case complexity]]
CATEGORIES: Computational complexity theory

Generic-case complexity is a subfield of computational complexity theory that studies the complexity of computational problems on "most inputs".
Generic-case complexity is a way of measuring the complexity of a computational problem by neglecting a small set of
unrepresentative inputs and considering worst-case complexity on the rest.
Small is defined in terms of asymptotic density.
The apparent efficacy of generic case complexity is because for a wide variety of concrete computational problems, the most difficult instances seem to be rare. Typical instances are relatively easy.
This approach to complexity originated in combinatorial group theory, which has a computational tradition going back to the beginning of the last century.
The notion of  generic complexity  was introduced in
[ref]I. Kapovich, A. Myasnikov, P. Schupp and V. Shpilrain, Generic case complexity, decision problems in group theory and random walks, J. Algebra, vol 264 (2003), 665–694.
[/ref] where authors showed that for a large class of finitely generated groups the generic time complexity of some classical decision problems from combinatorial group theory, namely the word problem, conjugacy problem and membership problem, are linear.
A detailed introduction of generic case complexity can be found in the surveys

[[Observer (quantum physics)]]
CATEGORIES: Concepts in physics, Quantum mechanics

In quantum mechanics, "observation" is synonymous with quantum measurement and "observer" with a measurement apparatus and observable with what can be measured. Thus the quantum mechanical observer does not
necessarily present or solve any problems over and above the (admittedly difficult) issue of measurement in quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanical observer is also intimately tied to the issue of observer effect.
A number of interpretations of quantum mechanics, notably "consciousness causes collapse",  give the observer a special role, or place
constraints on who or what can be an observer. For instance, Fritjof Capra writes:
  
 "The crucial feature of atomic physics is that the human observer is not
only necessary to observe the properties of an object, but is necessary
even to define these properties. ... This can be illustrated with the
simple case of a subatomic particle. When observing such a particle, one
may choose to measure — among other quantities — the particle's
position and its momentum" Fritjof Capra. The Tao  of Physics, p. 127

However, other authorities downplay any special role of human observers
 
     "Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective 
    features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of 
    registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an 
    apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the "possible" to the "actual," 
    is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory."<ref>[[Werner Heisenberg]], ''Physics and Philosophy'', p. 137</ref>
 
Critics of the special role of the observer also  point out that observers can themselves be observed, leading to paradoxes such as that of Wigner's friend; and that it is not clear how much consciousness is required
("Was the wave function waiting to jump for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer for some highly qualified measurer - with a PhD?"John Stewart Bell, 1981, Quantum Mechanics for Cosmologists. In C.J. Isham, R. Penrose and D.W.

Konnik recently became a part of the art collective, PUSHART and has some of his work on display permanently at ART N SOUL Studios, in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Konnik created the cover art for the horror novel, Splattered Beauty by the author, Brandon Ford (Arctic Wolf Publishing) He also created the cover art for Creeping Shadows, a collection of short stories by Alan Draven, Brandon Ford, and Jessica Lynn Gardner. (Pixie Dust Press) And his last book cover was for The Bitternest Chronicles by Alan Draven. (Pixie Dust Press)
Konnik donated a piece of his work to be auctioned off and the proceeds given to the F*ck Cancer Fund in honor of Lou Genise, a fire performer, poet, and artist.
Konnik died from congestive heart failure due to severe hypothyroidism on March 24, 2011, at the age of 36.

Yongdonggung was a Korean royal residence in Seoul where Crown Prince Sunhoe (Sunhoe Seja) of the Joseon Dynasty once lived. The current address of the place where the residence was located is 73, Suseong-dong neighborhood, Jongno-gu district, Seoul, South Korea. Originally it spanned the neighborhoods of Seosomun-dong and Jeong-dong of Jung-gu district. Yongdonggung was known as "Crown Prince Sunhoe's palace" (Sunhoe Sejagung) because the prince who lived there was also invested with the title of crown prince. However, as the prince died young at the age of 12, his body was buried in the area of Gyeongnueng where the tomb of Deokjong, the father of King Sejo is situated. The ownership of the palace was transferred to the queen and its building was moved to Sujinbang (today's Suseong-dong area). It existed until 1908 when Sookmyung Girls' School was established on the site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?i=270476|title=용동궁 龍洞宮|publisher=Nate / Encyclopedia of Korean Culture|language=Korean|accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl]

[[Jack's Fork County]]

CATEGORIES: Atoka County, Oklahoma, Indian Territory, Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, Pushmataha County, Oklahoma

Jack’s Fork County, also known as Jack Fork County, was a political subdivision of the Choctaw Nation of Indian Territory.  The county formed part of the nation’s Pushmataha District, or Third District, one of three administrative super-regions.
The county seat of Jack's Fork County was Many Springs, the modern community of Daisy, Oklahoma.  The U.S. Government called it Etna, and a post office operated here using that name from 1884-1897.  George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 74.
Jack's Fork County’s boundaries were, as were all Choctaw counties, designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks.  Much of its southern boundary, south of Antlers, Oklahoma was formed by Dumpling Creek.  Much of its western boundary was Middle Boggy Creek.  Its eastern boundary, in part, was formed by the Kiamichi River and its northern boundary was, in part, Brushy Creek.  John W. Morris, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, plates 38 & 56.
As Oklahoma’s statehood approached, its leading citizens, who were gathered for the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state’s counties that Jack's Fork County could not exist as an economically viable political subdivision.  Its county seat existed generally for holding county court, and not as a population center.  Most of its terrain was mountainous and still untamed; and its only sizeable town, Antlers, geographically isolated in Jack Fork County’s extreme southeast corner, would be separated from much of the town’s natural economic hinterland, which, at statehood, fell within neighboring Cedar County and Kiamitia County (Kiamichi County) of the Choctaw Nation.
This conundrum was also recognized by the framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory.  The county structure proposed by the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention also abolished the Choctaw counties.  Jack's Fork County was divided principally into the proposed Bixby and Pushmataha counties, whose county seats would have been Atoka and Antlers, respectively.  Much of this proposition was borrowed by Oklahoma’s framers, who largely adopted the proposed boundaries for Bixby County but called it Atoka County, and also borrowed, with few changes, the boundaries of the proposed Pushmataha County, Sequoyah for its Oklahoma equivalent.
Like all Choctaw counties, Jack’s Fork County served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration.  Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger.  The judge’s duties included oversight of overall county administration.  The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census.  The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.  Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.
The territory formerly comprising Jack's Fork County now falls primarily within Atoka County and Pushmataha County, and to a small degree Pittsburg County, in Oklahoma.  The county’s name, corrupted after statehood to "Jackfork", lives on in the name of Jackfork Creek, a major tributary of the Kiamichi River.

Beat Not the Bones is a 1952 suspense novel (and psychological thriller) by Charlotte Jay (pseudonym of Geraldine Halls) which won the inaugural Edgar award for best novel.http://www.theedgars.com/edgarsDB/index.php
The novel follows the actions of a sheltered young women who arrives in New Guinea from Australia, determined to find out what really happened to her husband, the Chief Anthropologist in the colonial administration. His death has been ascribed to suicide but she has reason to believe it was murder.
The novel was praised for its build up of suspense and for its novel setting.e.g. by Charlotte Armstrong and Dorothy Hughes, quoted in Moss, Peter and Michael J Tolley ‘Afterword’ in ‘’Beat Not the Bones’’ by Charlotte Jay (Wakefield Crime Classics), Wakefield Press, Kent Town, S.A.; 1992.
The novel was reissued in 1992 by Wakefield Press as part of a series reviving Australian crime classics, with an afterword by the editors. They make two further claims for the book. Firstly, it is one of very few historical descriptions of New Guinea, in this case in the immediate post war period. Secondly, they describe it as an ‘’early, a-typical example of an anti-colonial novel’’, and point out its resemblance to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.Moss, Peter and Michael J Tolley ‘Afterword’ in ‘’Beat Not the Bones’’ by Charlotte Jay (Wakefield Crime Classics), Wakefield Press, Kent Town, S.A.; 1992.

[[Equalization payments in Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Canada, Federalism in Canada, Fiscal federalism

In Canada, the federal government makes equalization payments to less wealthy Canadian provinces to equalize the provinces' "fiscal capacity" — their ability to generate tax revenues. A province that does not receive equalization payments is often referred to as a "have province", while one that does is called a "have not province".  In 2013–14, six provinces will receive $16.105 billion in equalization payments from the federal government.
Until the 2009–10 fiscal year, Ontario was the only province to have never received equalization payments; in 2009–10 Ontario received $347 million,[ref]

 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][/ref] while Newfoundland and Labrador, which has received payments since the program's creation, is now a so-called "have" province, and does not receive them.
Canada's territories are not included in the equalization program. The federal government addresses territorial fiscal needs through the Territorial Formula Financing (TFF) program.

CATEGORIES: Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters seasons, 2010 in German motorsport, 2010 in motorsport

The 2010 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season was the eleventh season of Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters since the series' resumption in 2000. The season began on 25 April at the Hockenheimring, and ended on 28 November at the Shanghai Street Circuit, after eleven rounds held in Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy and China. Having finished second in 2008 and third in 2009, HWA Team's Paul di Resta became champion for the first time, having come out on top of a three-way title battle in Shanghai.
Di Resta had trailed teammate Bruno Spengler – a race winner at Lausitz and the Nürburgring – by as many as fifteen points after four races, but by the ninth race, di Resta had taken the championship lead after five top-two finishes including three wins. A poor finish for di Resta at Adria – ninth after being helped into spins by Audi drivers Mike Rockenfeller and Miguel Molina – coupled with Spengler's third place allowed the Canadian driver to take a three-point lead into the final race. Another HWA driver, 2005 season champion Gary Paffett remained in mathematical contention, succeeding in needing a top-two finish at Adria, which left him nine points behind with ten available. Spengler left himself immediately in trouble in Shanghai, crashing during the qualification session which left him 17th on the grid, while di Resta and Paffett lined up on the front row. Spengler could only advance to thirteenth in the race, while his teammates battled for victory. Ultimately, Paffett won the race – ended early due to a collision between Rockenfeller and Susie Stoddart – but di Resta's second place allowed him to take the championship by four points. Paffett's victory also enabled him to overhaul Spengler for second place, by just one point.
Best of the rest went to the defending two-time champion Timo Scheider, who finished as top Audi in fourth place in the championship standings. Scheider, albeit scoring in each of the first five races, struggled for form in the early running, but recovered towards the end of the season and took a single victory during the season, winning at Adria. Mattias Ekström was the only other Audi driver to win a race during the season, winning the series' inaugural race at Valencia but only returned twice to the podium after that; finishing the season in fifth place. Jamie Green was the season's other race-winner, winning for the third season in a row at the Norisring, each of which had been taken in a 2008-specification car. Green finished three points behind Ekström, in sixth place in the points standings.

[[Balinski's theorem]]
CATEGORIES: Polyhedral combinatorics, Graph connectivity, Theorems in discrete geometry, Theorems in graph theory

In polyhedral combinatorics, a branch of mathematics, Balinski's theorem is a statement about the graph-theoretic structure of three-dimensional polyhedra and higher-dimensional polytopes. It states that, if one forms an undirected graph from the vertices and edges of a convex d-dimensional polyhedron or polytope (its skeleton), then the resulting graph is at least d-vertex-connected: the removal of any d − 1 vertices leaves a connected subgraph. For instance, for a three-dimensional polyhedron, even if two of its vertices (together with their incident edges) are removed, for any pair of vertices there will still exist a path of vertices and edges connecting the pair.[tpl]citation|first=Günter M.|last=Ziegler|authorlink=Günter Ziegler|title=Lectures on Polytopes|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1995|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=152|contribution=Section 3.5: Balinski's Theorem: The Graph is d-Connected[/tpl].

Great Bay National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1992 and is located along the eastern shore of New Hampshire's Great Bay in the town of Newington. The area was formerly part of weapons storage area at Pease Air Force Base, which was closed in 1991. 
A variety of rich wildlife habitats from uplands to open waters can be found throughout the refuge. With its open coastal water and abundant prey, the refuge plays a significant role as migration and wintering habitat for the federally protected bald eagle. The bay area also provides prime migration habitat for the peregrine falcon. Many state protected species use the refuge including the common loon, pied-billed grebe, osprey, common tern, northern harrier and upland sandpiper. The bay area also serves as New Hampshire's major wintering area for black ducks. 
Both Great Bay National Wildlife Refuge, and the Karner blue butterfly easement in Concord, New Hampshire, which protects important habitat for this federally endangered species, are managed by the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The refuge has a surface area of [tpl]convert|1116|acre|km2[/tpl].USFWS Lands Report, 30 September 2007

The Delaware Bay and estuary are wetlands of international importance and an international shorebird reserve. The refuge currently owns approximately [tpl]convert|3000|acre|km2[/tpl] within the [tpl]convert|4600|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] approved boundary. The brackish water tidal marshes that make up nearly 80 percent of the refuge provide waterfowl with a feeding and resting area, particularly during the fall and spring migrations. Black ducks, mallards and northern pintails are common winter visitors. Sandpipers and other shorebirds use the refuge marshes as a feeding area during the summer as well as during the spring and fall migrations. 
The rookery at nearby Pea Patch Island hosts over 6,000 pairs of nine species, making it the largest rookery of colonial wading birds on the east coast north of Florida. The refuge marshes provide valuable foraging habitat for these colonial wading birds during the nesting season.
Warblers, sparrows and other migratory birds use the upland areas of the refuge as resting and feeding areas during migration and for nesting during the summer. Thousands of tree swallows forage on the refuge in the late summer. Ospreys, bald eagle, northern harrier, short-eared owl and barn owl nest on the refuge.

In 2007, the bank settled a case with the New York Attorney General who claimed the bank used deceptive practices to market its credit cards. The bank paid $4.5 million as part of the deal.http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-10-19/americas-worst-credit-card-first-premier-banks-dubious-distinction/?cid=hp:beastoriginalsL3
In October 2010, the bank was cited for providing the nation's worst credit cards by the Consumers Union.http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/core_financial_services/016976.html The group reported the bank charged as much as 59% interest on credit cards limited to $300. These cards are marketed under the names Centennial and Aventium as well as First Premier. 
As of December 2010, Premier Bank was reportedly offering a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate and a $300 limit.  This 
was cited by Senator Bernie Sanders as an example of what he called "extortion and loan sharking". [ref]http://www.c-span.org/Watch/Media/2010/12/10/HP/A/41780/Sen+Sanders+Held+a+Tax+Cut+Filibuster.aspx

As of August 2011, Premier Bank is offering a credit card with a 49.9% interest rate and a $300 limit.  Additionally, it requires a security deposit of $95, and a $75 annual fee the first year.  After the first year, the annual fee becomes $45 and a $6.50 monthly servicing fee is added (a total of $125 in fees annually).  Cash advances are charged a minimum fee of $6 and limited to 10% of the total credit limit for at least the first 90 days.  Any credit limit increases are charged a limit increase fee of 25% the amount of the increase, and increases may happen automatically after the first 13 months, though the customer may request the automatic increase be reversed within 30 days and the fee will be refunded.  The contract also allows Premier Bank or any third party it chooses to contact customers via cell phone or text message even if the number was obtained without the consumer's consent via a third party.https://www.applyformypremier.com/CardDetails.aspx?appid=GY1108061548D3W9R retrieved 8-6-2011

The Fort Stanton – Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area is a National Conservation Area in the eastern foothills of the Sierra Blanca, between Capitan and Lincoln in south central New Mexico. Including approximately [tpl]convert|25080|acre|ha[/tpl] and located at an elevation of about [tpl]convert|6300|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level, it was established in 2009 to protect, conserve, and enhance the unique and nationally important historic, cultural, scientific, archaeological, natural, and educational subterranean cave resources of the Fort Stanton - Snowy River cave system.
The National Conservation Area was once known as the Fort Stanton Military Reservation. In 1855, the U.S. Cavalry established Fort Stanton as a cavalry fort. During these tumultuous times, the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th and 25th Infantry Buffalo Soldiers were sent to the New Mexico Territory to protect settlers in the area. The historic fort and its buildings are managed by the New Mexico State Parks Division. The lands surrounding the fort are managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Within the National Conservation Area is Fort Stanton Cave, the third longest cave in New Mexico. This cave was explored by soldiers posted at the fort as evidenced by their inscriptions within the cave. Snowy River Cave is a famous cave passage within Fort Stanton Cave, named for its beautiful stream bed of bright white calcite.

The Amagansett National Wildlife Refuge, in Amagansett, New York, graces the shore of the Atlantic Ocean on Long Island's south fork. Established December 16, 1968, the [tpl]convert|36|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] refuge is of special significance in the protection and management of fragile shore habitat and wildlife. Its unique double dune system embodies marine sand beach, primary dunes, secondary dunes, swales, fens, cranberry bogs, and oak scrub. Many rare plants, including several orchids, occur on the refuge. A major purpose of the refuge is the protection of the secondary dunes, which have become scarce on Long Island due to development.
Long-tailed ducks, white winged scoter, common loon and horned grebe spend winter off the refuge shore, while shorebirds, songbirds and raptors are a treat to visiting wildlife watchers during spring and fall. Merlin, Cooper's hawk, kestrel, sharp-shinned hawk, and peregrine falcon soar over the dunes during migration. Ipswich sparrow, rough-legged hawk, and short eared owl spend winter at the refuge offering birders a cold-weather destination. In late spring and summer the beach hosts piping plover, and common and least terns (protected by the Endangered Species Act) as well as sandpiper and other shorebirds. The Eastern hognose snake, a New York State designated species of special concern, can still be found on the refuge.

The Falcon Takes Over, also known as The Falcon Steps Out, is a 1942 black-and-white mystery film directed by Irving Reis. The film was the third, following The Gay Falcon and A Date with the Falcon (1941), to star George Sanders as the character Gay Lawrence, a gentleman detective known by the sobriquet the Falcon.
Though the film featured the Falcon and other characters created by Michael Arlen, its plot was taken from the Raymond Chandler novel Farewell, My Lovely, with the Falcon substituted for Chandler's archetypal private eye Philip Marlowe and the setting of New York replacing Marlowe's Los Angeles beat. The film was the first adaptation of a Marlowe story – despite Farewell, My Lovely being written after Chandler's The Big Sleep (1939), in which the character was introduced.
Critic Louis Black, in a 1999 article for The Austin Chronicle, wrote that the film "had none of the atmosphere of Chandler's book" and recommended instead the later adaptation, Murder, My Sweet (1944).

The Conscience Point National Wildlife Refuge was established July 20, 1971 as a land gift from Stanley Howard. The [tpl]convert|60|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] refuge is located in the hamlet of North Sea on the north shore of Long Island's south fork. The refuge protects grasslands, oak-beech forest, shrub habitats, kettle holes, freshwater marsh and salt marsh.
The refuge grasslands are a habitat model for maritime grasslands, a disappearing habitat type on Long Island due to development. Maritime grasslands are native grasslands composed of little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), poverty grass (Danthonia spicata), hairgrass (Deschampsia flexuosa), and prickly pear cactus (Opuntia humifusa).
Wildlife on the refuge is as diverse as its habitats. Waterfowl are primarily American Black Ducks and Bufflehead. The grasslands are being managed and enlarged specifically to attract grassland dependent birds such as Grasshopper Sparrow, Eastern Meadowlark, Savannah Sparrow and Bobolink. Due to its coastal location, the refuge is heavily used by migratory songbirds, shorebirds and raptors. The refuge also supports endangered and threatened species.

[[Eptatretus bischoffii]]

CATEGORIES: Fish of Chile, Myxinidae, Animals described in 1880

Eptatretus bischoffii is a common hagfish of the genus Eptatretus. Its maximum length is [tpl]convert|55|cm|in[/tpl]. It lives in a demersal, non-migratory, marine habitat with its depth range between 8–50 m. It can survive in only temperate zones. These organisms are found in the South Pacific, mainly, Chile. It is harmless to humans. 
The mode of reproduction in this kind of organism is external. The copulatory organs are absent. The gonads of hagfishes are situated in the peritoneal cavity. The ovary is found in the anterior portion of the gonad, and the testis is found in the posterior part. The animal becomes female if the cranial part of the gonad develops or male if the caudal part undergoes differentiation. If none develops, then the animal becomes sterile. If both anterior and posterior parts develop, then the animal becomes a functional hermaphrodite. However, hermaphroditism being characterised as functional needs to be validated by more reproduction studies.
The eggs develop in the demersal areas. The shape of the eggs are elongated. The egg contains a single micropylar opening located at the animal pole. It is situated at the bottom of a micropylar cup which lies between the anchor filaments. The single filaments are [tpl]convert|3.2|-|4.9|mm|in[/tpl] long and have an anchor-shaped apical end. The number of filaments varies around 50 but is always smaller on the vegetative end. On both ends of laid eggs, the filaments are enveloped by a gel-like matrix intertwined with large cytoskeletal biopolymers (keratin-like intermediate filaments) of possible holocrine origin.

The Ukanafun area is yet to recover from the shock of the civil war not to talk of ethnic politics that have made one of the great commercial nerve centres of the people of Annang extraction almost completely reduced to the background due to the absence of a good road network that once characterised the area in the time of the colonial masters. Palm produce used to be the major economic activity of the people. Ntak Ibesit now under Oruk Anam LGA used to be the centre of the palm kernel trade at its Ekpene Okpo river port which served as an excellent trade route to Opobo. Today there is no port in Ntak Ibesit.

[[Battle of Krusi]]

The Battle of Krusi ([tpl]lang-sr|Битка на Крусима[/tpl]) took place in 1796 between Old Montenegro and the Pashalik of Scutari  near Krusi. Following his defeat in Martinići (see Battle of Martinići), Mahmut-pasha Bushatli the Albanian Vizier of Shkoder began compiling new plans to attack Montenegro. With his main army in Scutari, Bushatli advanced to Podgorica, in the meantime, near the Montenegrin borders, a rather large number of forces were stationed due to the concentration of attacks towards Montenegro and Brda[tpl]dn|date=April 2014[/tpl]. From Podgorica, the Albanians move onto Lješkopolje because Bushatli's goal was to use the Lješkopolje-Krusi-Carev laz-Rijeka Crnojevića to his advantage to carry out a raid toward Cetinje.
Peter I, Prince-Bishop of Montenegro, was informed of the Albanian plans and had organized defenses beforehand. He then took control of the majority of the his forces and set-up an encampment beneath Mount Sađavce, on the right hand bank of the Matica River. Another, larger, unit, under the command of Jovan Radonjić was beset under Mount Busovnika near the village of Krusi.
The battle occurred on 22 September 1796 when Bushatli ordered his troops to cross the right hand bank of the Sitnica River and attack Montenegrin positions. Krusi was directly in the path of the Turkish army. Intensive fighting would occur when the Albanians met with the Montenegrins. After a whole day of fighting, the Montenegrins were able to defeat the Turks. Bushatli was killed by the Montenegrin army during the battle. Legend has it that it was truly Bogdan Vukov Nikolic from Zalazi* who managed to kill Bushatli. The remains of the broken Turkish army were forced to withdraw to Podgorica.

[[Tulingi]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Germanic peoples, Tribes of ancient Gaul, Tribes involved in the Gallic Wars

The Tulingi were a small tribe closely allied to the Celtic Helvetii in the time of Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul. Their location is unknown; their language and descent are uncertain. From their close cooperation with the Helvetii it can be deduced that they were probably neighbours of the latter. At the Battle of Bibracte in 58 BCE, they were, with the Boii and a few other smaller tribes, allies of the Helvetii against the Roman legions of Caesar.[tpl]cite book |title=Roman Battle Tactics 109BC-AD313 |first=Ross |last=Cowan |first2=Adam |last2=Hook |page=25 |location=Oxford |publisher=Osprey |year=2007[/tpl]
Ancient source material on the Tulingi is scarce. The only reference is Caesar, who relates that with the Helvetii and the others they burned their homes and became part of the column of migrants seeking a new country in southern France.[tpl]harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book I, Section 5[/tpl]. The column was defeated by Julius Caesar in the opening campign of the Gallic Wars, 58 BC. They were then returned to their homes, which they were compelled to rebuild. According to captured records in the Helvetian camp, the number of Tulingi, including fighting men, old men, women and children, had been 36,000, a small fraction of the total of 368,000, of which only 110,000 remained to return home after their surrender.[tpl]harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book I, Section 29[/tpl].
The main possibility as to their identity is that they were Celtic. As the "-ing-" in Tulingi is also a frequently used suffix in forming Germanic tribal names,The name is mentioned critically by Wolfgang Meid as "the earliest but very uncertain" instance of an ethnonymic formation -inga-/-unga- in [tpl]cite book |title=Germanische Sprachwissenschaft vol. 3 - Wortbildungslehre |last=Meid |first=Wolfgang |year=1967 |publisher=de Gruyter & Co |location=Berlin |page=200[/tpl] a second theory, that they were Germanic, developed. This was championed by Rudolf Much and other authors who proposed the now-discredited theory of "Alpine Germanic" tribes in the late Iron Age, to whom the Tulingi were counted.[tpl]cite book |title=Der Mythos von den Alpengermanen |last=Schmeja |first=Hans |year=1968 |location=Vienna[/tpl] So far no Germanic etymology for the name has gained wider acceptance.Stefan Zimmer: http://books.google.ch/books?id=mjnpsC6Lq4QC&lpg=PA313&ots=XKLz2ODMjm&dq=schmeja%20mythos%20alpengermanen&pg=PA313#v=onepage&q=schmeja%20mythos%20alpengermanen&f=false, in: Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, ed. Heinrich Beck. vol 31. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin-New York 2006, p. 325 f. ISBN 978-3-11-018386-3
The ancient Boii had been displaced from the Danube by the Germanics. Those in Gaul were a remnant, as the Tulingi may well have been. If they were, they might logically be found across the Rhine, in Germania.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |editor-first=William |editor-last=Smith |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography |page=1042 |title=Helvetii |volume=Volume I |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=1878[/tpl] Why they did not ally with the Germanics, whom the Celts feared and disliked, remains unexplained. They appear briefly in Orosius' mention of the Helvetian campaign, manifestly based on Caesar. However, Orosius uses Latobrigi instead of Latovici. The "-brigi" would certainly identify a tribe with a Celtic name, and if they were Celtic, perhaps so were the Tulingi.
It is possible that the tribe appears in an independent later source contradicting the Germanic theory. About 360 AD Rufus Festus Avienus in Ora Maritima mentions a number of peoples living on the upper Rhône in Valais. Among them were the Tylangii, who have been tentatively identified as the descendants of Caesar's Tulingi. They were not located across the Rhine, but to the south of Lake Geneva. Moreover, Avienus considers them Ligurians. Some of the other names mentioned are Daliterni, Clahilci, neither of which is noticeably Germanic.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Annales valaisannes |title=Le Valais et le Rhône dans les Lettres anciennes |first=Lucien |last=Lathion |year=1962 |volume= 11 |number=Numbers 2-4 |pages=pages 309–311 |url=http://doc.rero.ch/lm.php?url=1000,43,19,1/I-N177-1962-008.pdf |format=pdf |language=French[/tpl]

The Oriental Basin (Spanish Cuenca Oriental) is an endorheic basin in east-central Mexico. It covers an area of 4,958.60 square kilometers, lying in the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz.
The climate is temperate and subtropical, semi-arid to subhumid, with summer rains. Average annual temperature 12-16°C, and annual total precipitation is 400–800 mm. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests ecoregion covers the mountains surrounding the basin to the west, north, and east."Cuenca Oriental", Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad.

The basin contains a several shallow, mostly alkaline lakes. Two ephemeral playa lakes, Totolcinco (El Carmen or Totolcingo) and Tepeyahualco (El Salado), lie in the lowest part of the basin (2300 meters elevation), and remain dry for most of the year.  The basin includes six maar lakes, locally called axalpazcos, lying in shallow volcanic craters and sustained by underground water. A northern group of lakes – Alchichica, Quechulac, Atexcac, and La Preciosa – lie southeast of Lake Tepeyahualco, and the southern lakes, Aljojuca and San Miguel Tecuitlapa, lie southeast of Lake Totolcinco. The basin also has five dry maars, called xalapazcos.Caballero, Margarita; Gloria Vilcara, Alejandro Rodríguez, Diana Juarez.

Chief towns in the basin include El Carmen Tequexquitla, Tlaxcala, Perote, Veracruz, and Oriental, Puebla.
Groundwater levels in the basin have been dropping in recent years because of over-exploitation for irrigation and destruction of natural recharging areas. In addition, the government is considering pumping freshwater from the Oriental basin to Mexico City to the west and Puebla to the south.Alcocer, Javier (2003).

Ronald Sims (1926–2007) was a distinguished ecclesiastical architect who redesigned many English church interiors.  His style combined modernism with a respect for tradition and particularly the Arts and Crafts movement. He graduated in 1952, when he joined the practice of George Pace, the ecclesiastical architect based in York. In 1975 he inherited the practice after Pace died.
He designed the Chapter House at Southwark Cathedral and the interior of St Mary's in Putney which had been completely gutted by fire. He similarly transformed Heslington Church near York University, although the exposed brieze blocks and concrete lintels are not to everyone's taste.
His work was recognised in 1999 when the Archbishop of Canterbury (then George Carey) awarded him a Lambeth Degree for his contribution to Church building.

CATEGORIES: Languages of Togo

Togo is a multilingual country. According to one count, 39 languages are spoken.Ethnologue, "Languages of Togo" (accessed Oct. 31, 2010) Of these, the official language is French. Two of the most spoken indigenous languages were designated as national languages in 1975: Ewé ([tpl]lang-ee|Èʋegbe[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|Evé[/tpl]) and Kabiyé.
Among the other languages in Togo, Mina (the dialect of Ewé spoken in Lomé) serves as the working language in the south of the country, Mobaa, Tem (also called Kotokoli) and Fula ([tpl]lang-ff|Fulfulde[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|Peul[/tpl]). Most of the indigenous languages of the country can be divided into two groups: the Gur languages in the north, and the Kwa languages in the south.
The two national languages tend to be used regionally: Ewé in the south from Lomé to Blitta, and Kabiyé in the north.
According to the Délégation générale à la langue française et aux langues de France, 30% of the population have a working knowledge of French, 37% according to the French Ministère des affaires étrangères in 2007.
According to Couchoro [tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] "The notable fact is that in the past 15 years, through developmental factors, and particularly to increased education, there has been a vast expansion in the use of French. The consequence has been an appropriation of French like never seen before". (Lafage, 1985, 551).
According to Isabelle Anzorge [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] "This is just an imported language, but it gradually assumes a Togolese identity, freeing itself from all normative constraints, thereby integrating the cultural realities of the country."
The latter noted the existence of a French dialect:Isabelle Anzorge 1988, Le parler français du Togo aujourd’hui, étude lexicale, DEA, Paris III. since the fall of conscription due to economic and political upheaval (the collapse of phosphates, devaluation of the CFA, university strikes following the general strike of 1992, climate of civil war since 1991), French has become a tool or a means of communication of most Togolese, educated or not.

[[Human trafficking in the United States]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking in the United States, Human trafficking by country

Human trafficking is the modern form of slavery, with illegal smuggling and trading of people, for forced labour or sexual exploitation.
Technical Definition: Trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons by means of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, or abuse of power of a position of vulnerability for the purpose of exploitation. Human trafficking is not synonymous with forced migration or smuggling.
In the U.S., human trafficking tends to occur around international travel-hubs with large immigrant populations, notably California and Texas. The U.S. Justice Department estimates that 17,500 people are trafficked into the country every year, but the true figure could be higher, because of the large numbers of undocumented immigrants. Those being trafficked include young children, teenagers, men and women and can be domestic citizens or foreign nationals. According to the Department of State's statistics from 2000, there are approximately 244,000 American children and youth that are at risk for sex trafficking each year.  Of these children and youth, 38,600 were originally runaways.
Under Federal law, it is a crime to make people work by use of force, coercion, or fear.

[[Il ballo delle ingrate]]
CATEGORIES: Compositions by Claudio Monteverdi, Ballets by Claudio Monteverdi, 1608 ballet premieres

Il ballo delle ingrate (The Ballo of the Ungrateful Ladies) is a semi-dramatic ballet (or ballo) by the Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi with words by Ottavio Rinuccini. It was first performed in Mantua on Wednesday 4 June 1608 as part of the wedding celebrations for Francesco Gonzaga (the son of Monteverdri's patron Duke Vincenzo of Mantua) and Margaret of Savoy. Both Vincenzo and Francesco Gonzaga took part in the dancing.Fabbri p.99  Monteverdi also composed the opera L'Arianna (to another libretto by Rinuccini) and the music for the prologue to Guarini's play L'idropica for the occasion. 
Il Ballo delle ingrate was published as part of Monteverdi's Eighth Book of Madrigals (Madrigali guerrieri, et amorosi) in 1638. This printed version probably contains revisions Monteverdi made for a revival in Vienna. The virtuosic bass writing for Plutone is closer in style to Monteverdi's late operas than to that of his L'Orfeo (1607).Holman p.2 The musicologist Paolo Fabbri believes that the revisions were made for a performance to celebrate the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III in 1636. The sudden death of the previous emperor meant Monteverdi had to produce music at short notice, so he reworked the Ballo delle ingrate, removing the references to the Mantuan wedding.Fabbri p.234

CATEGORIES: Church of England churches in West Sussex, Grade I listed churches in West Sussex, Arun

St Mary's Church is an Anglican church in the village of Walberton in the district of Arun, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex.  Its 11th-century origins are now mostly hidden behind the results of extensive restoration work undertaken since the 18th century; but some Saxon-era fragments remain, and reused Roman building materials can still be seen in the walls.  The extensive collection of 18th-century gravestones in the churchyard includes some especially macabre examples. The church is protected as a Grade I Listed building.

[[Slavery in Canada (New France)]]
CATEGORIES: Slavery in Canada, New France

Slavery in Canada, New France was first recorded in 1628, when the first slave in New France was brought by a British Convoy to New France. Olivier le Jeune was the name given to the boy originally from Madagascar. His given name resonates somewhat with the Code Noir, although the Code was not established until 1685. The Code Noir forced baptisms and decreed the conversion of all slaves to Catholicism.Afua Cooper,The Untold Story of Canadian Slavery and the burning of Old Montreal (Toronto:HarperPerennial,2006), 74-76. 
His name is reflective of a tradition in New France that would give slaves a name from prominent Catholic figures. By 1688 the favourability of domestic servitude and its integral part of New France society  was evidenced by a group of French aristocrats who petitioned King Louis XIV to import more slaves from West Africa.Tom Derrek,"In Bondage," The Beaver 83.1 (February–March 2003) 
By the early 18th century, Africans began arriving in greater numbers in New France, mainly as slaves of French aristocracy. Slavery was further fortified by the Raudot Bill of 1709. The bill was an ordinance that recognized slavery in New France in law,"Panis and Negroes who have been purchased and who will be purchased, shall be property of those who have purchased them and will be their slaves."Robin Winks,Blacks in Canada(Montreal:McGill-Queens Press, 1966),6. 
Although slavery continued after the British conquest, the slave trade was not formally established as there was no need for a large labour force given the localized (fur and fisheries based) economies of the northern colonies. Despite the seemingly less physical work (as compared to slave labour on plantations) and as a result of their position within the domestic realms of their slave owners, Canadian slaves were always under the watchful gaze of their owners. By the time of the Conquest there were approximately 3,604 slaves in New France. 
Most of these (52.3%) were located around Montreal where the economy was most dependent on labour. Historian Marcel Trudel recorded approximately 4000 slaves by the end of New France in 1759, of which 2,472 were aboriginal people, and 1,132 blacks. After the Conquest of New France by the British, slave ownership remained dominated by the French. Marcel Trudel identified 1509 slave owners, which only 181 were English.Robin W. Winks.  The Blacks in Canada. A History.  McGill-Queens University Press, 1997. p.9. 
The citizens of New France received slaves as gifts from their allies among native peoples. Many of these slaves were prisoners taken in raids against the villages of the Fox nation, a tribe that was an ancient rival of the Miami people and their Algonquian allies.[ref]Brett Rushforth, "Slavery, the Fox Wars, and the Limits of Alliance," William and Mary Quarterly 63 (January 2005), No.1, para. 32. Rushforth confuses the two Vincennes explorers. 
François-Marie was 12 years old during the First Fox War.[/ref] Native ("pani") slaves were easier to obtain and thus more numerous than African slaves in New France, but were less valued. The average native slave died at 18, and the average African slave died at 25.[tpl]cite book |last=Cooper |first=Afua |title=The Hanging of Angélique |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2006 |isbn=0-00-200553-0[/tpl]

Unlike the similarly named but unrelated Tai Po Lookout which is now a private residential place, Tai Po Lookout Tower, by years, has become a famous tourist spot in the New Territories. The building is 32.4 meters high. Visitors can reach the top to take a bird's eye view upon Tolo Harbour, the entire Tai Po Waterfront Park and the neighboring Tai Po Industrial Estate.
At the lower part of the tower there is an inscriptional record to mark down the meaning of its establishment: The inhabitants of the New Territories defended and sacrificed themselves for their own home in the early period when Hong Kong was ceded to Great Britain in 1898. They devoted to the development of the territory and significantly made a great contribution into society after the war time of Hong Kong falling into Japan's hands during the period of time from December 1941 to August 1945. The inscription also points out that the location of the tower is exactly where the English government made a landing when taking over the New Territories, the tower, therefore, was built at the same place for the commemoration of the sovereignty handover.

A boilery is a place of boiling, much as a bakery is a place of baking.  Boilery can also mean the process and equipment for boiling.  They were also known as boiling houses.  Although they are now generally confined to factories, and usually boil industrial products rather than food, historically they were more common in daily life. Boileries are typically for boiling large quantities of fluid.http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-boilery.htm

CATEGORIES: 1925 births, 2003 deaths, Diamond dealers, People from Brooklyn

William Goldberg (March 19, 1925 – October 20, 2003) was an American diamond dealer and the founder of the William Goldberg Diamond Corporation.
Goldberg was born in Brooklyn, New York City. He started cutting diamonds in 1948, but found that his aptitude lay with buying and selling diamonds rather than cutting them. In 1952 he founded Goldberg & Weiss with diamond cutter Irving Weiss. In 1973 he formed the William Goldberg Diamond Corporation, located on 48th Street in New York City's Diamond District. In 1978 he became president of the New York Diamond Dealers Club and served three terms. He traded well known diamonds including the Queen of Holland diamond, the Premier Rose diamond, the Red Shield diamond and the Pumpkin diamond.
He died of pancreatic cancer, aged 77. Following his death, members of Goldberg's family created the William Goldberg Endowed Scholarship Fund at the Gemological Institute of America.

He worked at Instituto Superior Técnico  in Lisbon, Portugal from 1991 to 2010. He is currently professor at Departamento de Física e Astronomia of the Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto. 
He is the author of a book to raise the awareness of the public on science about the history of ideas in astronomy, cosmology and theories of gravity (in Portuguese) and of a technical text on the aspects of gravity and propulsion in space published by the European Space Agency: 
In particular, Bertolami studied the cosmological constant problem and its connection with the equivalence principle, the generalized Chaplygin gas model of unification of  Dark Energy (to explain the cosmic acceleration) and Dark Matter (to explain the flattening of the rotation curves of galaxies) and some Modified models of gravity with non-minimal coupling between curvature and matter. He has also worked on the Pioneer Anomaly, which was shown to be most likely due to 
on-board thermal effects and reflection of the generated radiation.

William Herbert, 6th Earl of Pembroke, 3rd Earl of Montgomery (c. 1641 – 8 July 1674) was an English nobleman and politician who succeeded to the titles on 11 December 1669 on the death of his father.
Brought up in Wiltshire at Wilton House, he was the son of Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke, by his marriage to Penelope Naunton, the daughter of Sir Robert Naunton, Secretary of State to King James I and of Penelope Perrot, a daughter of Sir Thomas Perrot and of Lady Dorothy Devereux (later Countess of Northumberland), whose parents were the famous Earl of Essex and Lettice Knollys.William Herbert, 6th Earl of Pembroke at thepeerage.com
His mother died before 1647, when he was a small child.G. E. Cokayne et al, ed., The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant (2000 edition), volume II, page 37
In September 1658, he was granted a pass to travel overseas. He was member of parliament for Glamorgan between 1661 and his elevation to the House of Lords in 1669.David L. Smith, 'Herbert, Philip, first earl of Montgomery and fourth earl of Pembroke (1584–1650)' in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (OUP, 2004) After he came into his father's great estates, especially in Wiltshire and in Wales, Pembroke was known to exercise a decisive electoral influence in many places. However, with the Cavalier Parliament enduring from 1661 until 1679, he had few opportunities to wield this influence directly in elections to the House of Commons. From 1665 to 1674, he was Custos Rotulorum of Wiltshire.  
Pembroke died unmarried on 8 July 1674 and was succeeded by his brother, another Philip Herbert.

It is a sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor, based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor II(EBR-II) design, scaled up by a factor of ten.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/energy-and-environment/in-depth/prism-project-a-proposal-for-the-uks-problem-plutonium/1016276.article |title=Prism project: A proposal for the UK's problem plutonium |author=Stuart Nathan |date=13 May 2013 |website=The Engineer |accessdate=29 November 2013[/tpl]
The design utilizes reactor modules, each having a power output of 311 MWe, to enable factory fabrication at low cost.
In an identical fashion to the EBR-II that it is based on, the reactor would transition to a much lower power level whenever temperatures rise significantly, moreover the reactor vessel modules are pool type, as opposed to loop type, with the pool conferring substantial thermal inertia and the final key safety feature includes a "RVACS", which is a passive reactor vessel air cooling system to remove decay heat. These safety systems are passive and therefore always operate and are to prevent core damage in a Loss of coolant accident were no other means of heat removal are available.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/5491968 |title=Technical Report: Summary of advanced LMR (Liquid Metal Reactor) evaluations: PRISM (Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module) and SAFR (Sodium Advanced Fast Reactor).

[[Wilhelminism]]
CATEGORIES: German Empire, Wilhelm II, German Emperor

The Wilhelmine Period comprises the period between 1890 and 1918, embracing the reign of Wilhelm II and the First World War. By Wilhelminism is not meant a conception of society associated with the name Wilhelm, and traceable to an intellectual initiative of the German Emperor. Rather, it relates to the image presented by Wilhelm II, and his demeanour, manifested by the public presentation of grandiose military parades, and self-aggrandisement on his part, this latter tendency having not been unknown to his grandfather Wilhelm I and Bismarck during the period that Wilhelm’s father was Crown Prince. He continued to implement measures against Socialist ideas. His policies, founded on his imperial ambitions, and directed towards the establishment of Germany as a world power, achieved a short-lived high point at the beginning of the First World War, following the acquisition of some colonial possessions in the South Seas and on the African continent.
The distinctive spiked helmet, the so-called Pickelhaube, although it had existed previously, and not only in the German Empire, was symbolic for this period, and for the imperial army and German military (in various sign languages, the extended forefinger placed in front of the forehead, indicating the spiked helmet, is still the sign for “German”).
Wilhelm’s fascination for the German Navy, and his ambition to see it established as an instrument for the projection of world power, were reflected in everyday German life. Until the middle of the twentieth century, boys were dressed in sailor suits, and in this way were impressed at an early age with the Navy’s aura and prestige.
In principle, the dismissal of Otto von Bismarck as Chancellor of Germany in 1890 marks the beginning of the period. The end of Wilhelminism is associated with the end of the First World War in 1918, and the Emperor’s abdication.
The term Wilhelminism also characterizes the social and cultural climate of the reign of Wilhelm II, which found expression in rigidly conservative attitudes. At the same time, the period was distinguished by an extraordinary belief in progress, which, while contributing to the enormous prosperity of the German Empire, was at odds with its social conservatism.
The term is equally applied to styles prevailing in the visual arts and architecture of the period. It is used to describe, among other things, an essentially neo-Baroque, extraordinarily prestige-oriented style calculated to give expression to the German state’s claim to imperial power. This style was particularly exemplified by the grandiose Siegesallee, lampooned by Berliners as the Puppenallee (“street of the dolls”), and was given official status by Wilhelm’s so-called “Rinnsteinrede“ (“gutter speech”) on what he considered modernist degenerate art at the inauguration of the extravagant boulevard on December 18, 1901.

[[Postmodern vertigo]]
CATEGORIES: Postmodernism

Postmodern Vertigo is  a description of a panic that occurs when somebody considers the reality of their own existence but no longer accepts truth or structure in their thought.  Suddenly the thinker no longer believes in anything, everything seeming like a fabrication. Thought become meaningless and a feeling akin to vertigo is experienced.  Many writers have described this feeling as "the void" or as a "crisis of postmodernism".  Another term which has a similar meaning is anomie.  Whereas a crisis of postmodernism describes the thought or meaning of viewing existence as a false construct and the void creates a metaphoric representation and Anomie refers to the philosophical dead end, Post-modern vertigo more specifically has been used to refer to this feeling when it takes on a physiological manifestation, causing an increase in heart rate and sweating.
Postmodern vertigo might be a form of existential crisis.

Alternative Press reviewer Evan Lucy rated the album 3/5, saying that "Fans of We the Kings' debut will undoubtedly find something to hold onto with Smile Kid, but for those who were less than enamored with the band's pop-punk blend will likely stay that way." He said although the band "have expanded their previously narrow sound", he was still dissuaded by the band's failure to branch out musically; "Until the band are willing to step outside further outside the musical box and Clark is willing to belt it out, We the Kings will remain good, not great--and still on the verge of pop-punk royalty."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/reviews/smilekid.htm|title=File Under: Pop-punk - We The Kings - Smile Kid|work=Alternative Press|last=Lucy|first=Evan|accessdate=2009-12-09[/tpl]

[[Öræfasveit]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of Iceland

Öræfasveit or Öræfi (previously called Litlahérað) is a western region in Austur-Skaftafellssýsla, between Breiðamerkursandur and the river Skeiðará, east of the village Kirkjubæjarklaustur and South, West and East of the volcano Öræfajökull. It has been a part of the municipality of Hornafjörður since 1998. In the Middle Ages, this region was called Hérað or Litlahérað, but was deserted in the wake of the 1362 eruption of Öræfajökull and the subsequent flooding of the region. After these events the region was simply called Öræfi ("wilderness").
For a long time, the region was very isolated since two large rivers hindered the pathway from both from the east and west. This isolation continued until Jökulsá á Breiðamerkursandi bridged the gap in 1967 and the Skeiðará bridge was opened in 1974 with the Ring Road.
Skaftafell National Park was established in Öræfasveit in 1967 and merged into the much larger Vatnajökull National Park in 2008.

[[IBM Master Inventor]]
CATEGORIES: IBM employees

An IBM Master Inventor is an individual selected by IBM. The qualification and appointment to Master Inventor is governed by the value to IBM of an inventor's contribution to the patent portfolio, and through defensive publication (published in www.ip.com). IBM weighs many aspects of an inventor's contributions, including but not limited to impact of invention through licensing, inclusion in product, and percentage of patents with a measurable impact. IBM also considers an individual's contribution to the inventing community inside IBM, whether by acting as a patent reviewer, or providing feedback and guidance to new inventors.
IBM Master Inventors are appointed to two to three year terms, which are sometimes renewed. They are expected to identify new inventions, mentor other employees through the patent process, foster innovative thinking, and help evaluate ideas for patenting.  Becoming a Master Inventor is the result of a cumulative contribution to the IBM patent portfolio. According to one Master Inventor Dharmendra S Modha's Cognitive Computing Blog http://p9.hostingprod.com/@modha.org/blog/2007/11/ibm_master_inventor.html. the citation reads: [tpl]cquote|Each year, IBM asks a small group of employees to join the ranks of Master Inventor. This group of people is asked to assist in the identification of new inventions and mentor others in the use of the patent process, among other things. The invitation to become a Master Inventor is based on the value to IBM of an inventors' United States patents during the three prior calendar years. This achievement is significant because it is the result of a cumulative contribution to the IBM patent portfolio, including Corporate Patent Portfolio Awards, Division Patent Portfolio Awards, and Division Supplemental Patent Issuance Awards.[/tpl] Stories about a few master inventors appear in IBM web pages and external media.A Master Inventor at work http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/podcasts/blog_videocast_b.shtml.

[[Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund]]
CATEGORIES: Sports governing bodies in Germany, Sports clubs banned by the Nazis

The Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund (ATSB or Workers' Gymnastics and Sports Federation) was a national German sports organization active between 1893-1933. The organization actively promoted leftist political views built around class struggle and nationalism.
Sport in late 19th century Germany was centered on the development of gymnastics and was highly politicized with strong nationalist overtones. A clear class divide developed and often workers were not accepted within the ranks of established sports clubs. In response, separate worker's clubs emerged and in 1893 the Workers' Gymnastics Federation (ATB or Arbeiter Turnerbund) was formed in Gera. In June 1919, following World War I, the federation was renamed Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund to reflect the rise of sports other than gymnastics including athletics, handball, and especially football.
In the late 1920s the federation had a membership of 770,000 and fielded over 8,000 football teams throughout Germany. Between 1920-32, the ATSB staged its own national football championship separate from that of the DFB (Deutscher Fußball Bund, en:German Football Association). It also held German Workers' Gymnastics and Sports Festival and hosted or took part in international events including the Workers' Olympiad.
By 1930, the federation had a membership of 1.2 million, however, it splintered when the communist-oriented Kampfgemeinschaft für Rote Sporteinheit (KG, en:Fighting Community for Red Sport, commonly Rotsport) was formed. Despite its popularity, the ATSB never managed to break the dominance of bourgeois clubs within the working class.
After the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, all sports associations with left-leaning or faith-based affiliations were disbanded. The memberships of these clubs were dispersed or forced into mergers with sides more ideologically palatable to the regime and the clubs' assets were expropriated. The KG was broken up in February 1933, followed by the ATSB in May.

CATEGORIES: Agriculture in Montserrat

Agriculture in Montserrat, a British Overseas Territory, is a small industry that is heavily influenced by the volcanic activity of the Soufrière Hills. Historically a major producer of sugar and tobacco, the eruptions of the Soufrière Hills between 1995 and 1997 severely damaged infrastructure across a large part of the island. Much of the arable land was destroyed during eruptions or now falls within an "exclusion zone", leaving only limited sections on the northern region of the island usable for cultivation.
Agriculture plays little role in the island's economy, as most of the economic activity since the eruptions is generated by service jobs (tourism, government) and construction. Regardless, the government of Montserrat has committed to investing in new technology to revive the agricultural industry of the island; so that it is more self-sustainable and less reliant on food imports.

Ben Leslie is an American auto mechanic. He currently serves as the crew chief of the #6 Ford Fusion fielded by Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. He is the younger brother of former Auto Racing Club of America champion and NASCAR driver Tracy Leslie.
Leslie joined NASCAR in 1994 as a mechanic and tire changer on Ted Musgrave's car owned by Roush Racing. Later he would go on to hold the same position on Mark Martin's car. In 1998, he moved to Roush's new team, the #26 Cheerios Ford driven by Johnny Benson. Originally serving as the team's car chief, he was promoted to interim crew chief midway through the season and had a pair of ninth-place finishes with Benson. After spending the first part of the 1999 season with Benson, he became the car chief of Matt Kenseth's car, and the team won Rookie of the Year honors in 2000.
After several races in 2001, Leslie was moved to the crew chief position of the #97 team driven by rookie Kurt Busch. Leslie and Busch won the pole at the Mountain Dew Southern 500 and had five top-ten finishes. At the end of the season, he was moved again to Mark Martin's team. They won the Coca-Cola 600 but lost the championship by 38 points. He was moved again at the end of the season to the #21 Motorcraft/Wood Brothers Racing Ford driven by Ricky Rudd, but the team struggled with only five top-tens and dropped to twenty-third in points.http://www.nascar.com/drivers/ccps/bleslie00/index.html After winning one pole and garnering two top-ten finishes with Rudd in 2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series, Leslie left the Wood Brothers to take a position as field director for Ford Racing.
Leslie stayed with Ford for several years before returning to pit road as crew chief of the #28 Yates Racing Ford driven by Travis Kvapil. They had two top-twenty finishes but the team was shut down after five races due to a lack of sponsorship. Afterwards, he joined Yates' affiliate team, Hall of Fame Racing as crew chief for Bobby Labonte and eventually Erik Darnell for the rest of the season.http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/sprintcupseries/Ben_Leslie_replaces_Todd_Parrott_as_Bobby_Labontes_crew_chief.html In 2010 he moved to Roush Fenway's #6 team to be crew chief for rookie Ricky Stenhouse, Jr..

[[Local Health Board]]

CATEGORIES: NHS Wales, 2003 establishments in Wales, Government agencies established in 2003

A Local Health Board (LHB) is an administrative unit within the National Health Service in Wales.
LHBs were first established in Wales in 2003.  They were 22 in number, being coterminous with the 22 Welsh local authorities.  The LHBs were subsidiary to a system of NHS Trusts.  This was found to be an unnecessarily complex structure.  Simplification began by the merging of the Trusts, eventually reducing the number to 7 by October 2009, at which time a major reorganisation was implemented.
In essence the LHBs were abolished, their functions being subsumed by the 7 NHS Trusts.  Confusingly the Trusts were described in law as 'Local Health Boards' despite the fact that in general they were now to be more regional than local in nature.  This confusion has been exacerbated by the fact that all 7 LHBs have chosen operational names (i.e. the names by which they are known to the public) which specifically omit the word 'local'.  The term 'Local Health Board' is thus no more than a legislative description.
Note that the name 'Trust' has been adopted/retained by three 'all-Wales' units within NHS Wales.

Longnü ([tpl]zh|first=t|t=龍女|s=龙女|p=Lóngnǚ[/tpl]; Sanskrit: nāgakanya; Vietnamese: Long nữ), translated as Dragon Daughter, along with Sudhana are considered acolytes of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara in Chinese Buddhism. However, there are no scriptural sources connecting both Sudhana and Longnü to Avalokiteśvara at the same time. However, it is suggested that the acolytes are representations of the two major Mahāyāna texts, the Lotus Sūtra and the Avataṃsaka Sūtra, in which Longnü and Sudhana appear, respectively.
The depiction of Longnü and Sudhana with Avalokiteśvara may have been influenced by the Jade Maiden ([tpl]zh|c=玉女|p=Yùnǚ[/tpl]) and Golden Youth ([tpl]zh|first=t|t=金僮|s=金童|p=Jīntóng[/tpl]) who both appear in the iconography of the Jade Emperor.

He introduced Mir Dariya Khan Khoso into politics; by defeating the political giant Mir Jafar Khan Jamali he proved his coin there.
Mir Sikandar Khan published his first book of Sufi lyrics under the name Subh Mein Punhoon Paan in 1973. The following lyrics were adapted into a kafi by the late musician Ustad Muhammad Juman in 1974 on Radio Pakistan in Hyderabad:

Zahara de la Sierra is municipality in the province of Cádiz in the hills of Andalusia, southern Spain. It is perched on a mountain, overlooking a valley and a man-made lake formed by the dam that must be driven over to access the town. It is considered to be one of the "pueblos blancos" or "white towns" because the overwhelming majority of the buildings are white.
The town was originally a Moorish outpost, overlooking the valley. Due to its position between Ronda and Seville, it was a perfect site for a castle to be built to serve as a fortress in case of attack. The remains of the Moorish castle are still existing. It was ruled by Arabs till 1407. It was recaptured by Emirate of Granada in 1481. This capture gives pretext to Castile war against Gırnata. It was finally captured by Castillean troops under command of Rodrigo Ponce de León, Duke of Cadiz in 1483.

"I've Been Loving You" is the 1968 debut single by Elton John with lyrics credited to Bernie Taupin (although John later admitted that he wrote the song by himself, giving Taupin credit as an effort to earn Taupin his first publishing royalties). The B-side is "Here's to the Next Time", an Elton John composition. "I've Been Loving You" was not originally included on any album and the single was withdrawn shortly after its release.  Neither side appeared on any official album release until the 1992 "Rare Masters" box set (which featured previously unreleased stereo mixes of both).
The single is extremely rare.Joynson, Vernon (1995). The Tapestry of Delights. London: Borderline Books.  An even rarer 4-song EP, released only in Portugal, contained two additional songs: "Thank You For All Of Your Loving" (written by John and then bandmate Caleb Quaye) and "The Angel Tree" (the first true release of a John/Taupin composition).
In 1976, the Canadian band Wednesday covered the song under the title ""Loving You Baby"".  It was a substantial hit in their native country, peaking at #6 on the Canadian singles charts.

The 2009-10 Major Indoor Soccer League is the sophomore season for the league, and first under the old MISL banner. 31 season of professional Division 1 indoor soccer. The members of the MISL's second season teams are the Baltimore Blast, the Milwaukee Wave, the Monterrey La Raza, the Philadelphia KiXX, and the Rockford Rampage.
The season kicked off on November 13, 2009 with the NISL Champion, Baltimore Blast, welcoming the Rockford Rampage. The regular season will conclude on March 21, 2010, with the Rockford Rampage hosting Monterrey La Raza.
This year also marks the first season since the KiXX founding that they will play at a new arena, the Liacouras Center, on the campus of Temple University.http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2009/10/12/daily36.html
Shortly before the season began, the league was re-branded as the Major Indoor Soccer League.
The season for each team has expanded to twenty games, so each team this year will play ten home and ten away games. However, due to arena conflicts with Temple University, the Kixx will play eight home games and twelve road games.
On March 9, 2010 with a 11-6 win over the Rockford Rampage, the Milwaukee Wave clinched the first playoff spot. This continues the Wave's tradition of making the playoffs every season in a league named MISL. This also marks the fifteenth season since the 1993-1994 NPSL for the Wave to qualify for the playoffs.

[[NHydrate]]

CATEGORIES: Microsoft software

nHydrate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) solution for the Microsoft .NET platform providing a framework for a relational database to be mapped to .NET objects. It is designed to alleviate the drudgery software developers experience writing persistence domains.
nHydrate is free as an open source project on Codeplex.com under the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL).
nHydrate was originally created in 2003 as a private project to solve the issues with the .NET Framework 1.1. Using ADO.Net Datasets is cumbersome and error prone, so a small generated framework was created to relieve developers of the CRUD work. As a private project it was later inspired by the work of the NHibernate group.
nHydrate was a private project from 2003 until 2009. It was used at various companies in the Atlanta, Georgia, area but never widely released. It was publicly released on September 10, 2009.
nHydrate is built on the .NET Framework 4.0.
From version 5.0 and above, the entire framework has been reworked to use only Entity Framework as it internal data access layer. The modeler is now visual with a main diagram like other modeling products. All code interactions are simply Entity Framework now so there is no learning curve for developers when using the generated output.

[[Organic milk]]

CATEGORIES: Milk, Organic food

Organic milk  refers to a number of milk products from livestock raised according to organic farming methods. In most jurisdictions, use of the term "organic" or equivalents like  "bio" or "eco", on any product is regulated by food authorities.  In general these regulations stipulate that livestock must be:  allowed to graze, be fed an organically certified fodder or compound feed, not be treated with most drugs (including growth hormone), and in general must be treated humanely.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/ofp/ofp.shtml |title=Organic Production and Organic Food: Information Access Tools |author=Mary Gold |date=June 2007 |work=USDA |publisher= |accessdate=18 December 2012[/tpl]Organic Dairy Industry in Canada, Agriculture Agri-Food Canada http://www.dairyinfo.gc.ca/pdf/organic_profile_eng.pdf
There are multiple obstacles to forming firm conclusions regarding possible safety or health benefits from consuming organic milk or conventional milk, including the lack of long term clinical studies. The studies that are available have come to conflicting conclusions with regards to absolute differences in nutrient content between organic and conventionally produced milk, such as protein or fatty acid content. The weight of available evidence does not support the position that there are any clinically relevant differences between organic and conventionally produced milk, in terms of nutrition or safety.

Tilo Gutzeit (born 12 January 1938) is a German figure skater who represented West Germany in competition. He is the 1955 German national champion. He represented the Unified Team of Germany at the 1956 Winter Olympics, where he placed 10th, and at the 1960 Winter Olympics, where he placed 9th. He represented the club  Düsseldorfer EG in national level competition.
Originally the results of the 1955 German Championships were misscalculated. Due to this Tilo Gutzeit received only the silver medal there and 12 year old Manfred Schnelldorfer was announced as German Champion. Several months after these championships, Werner Rittberger, who was a judge at these championships, recalculated the results. The results were corrected and the medals were physically exchanged. 
Tilo Gutzeit was also a potential skating partner for pair skater Marika Kilius. She had to split from Franz Ningel due to her height. However, Marika Kilius decided for Hans-Jürgen Bäumler.

By 1892 he had also designed the masthead of Cassell's Saturday Journal.http://capitadiscovery.co.uk/gsa/items/221139 On 21 May 1892 he married his second cousin Alice Marsh (1861-1955), who went on to enjoy her own highly successful career as an illustrator of children's books under the name Alice Talwin Morris. His occupation on the marriage certificate is listed as 'clerk'.Cinamon, G. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition. London: William Morris Gallery, p.11 They lived at 1 Field Court, Gray's Inn, London, a short walk from the offices of Black and White on Bouverie Street.Cinamon, G. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition. London: William Morris Gallery, p.1
Responding to an advertisementThe Times, 21 February 1893 for an Art Director for publishers Blackie and Son, he moved to Glasgow in May 1893 where he soon made the acquaintance of the artists and designers associated with the Glasgow School of Art. Although he never attended the School, Morris soon became friends with Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his contemporaries, and his own work quickly began to incorporate Glasgow Style motifs.
In July 1893 he and Alice purchased Dunglass Castle and began to design its interiors.Gleeson White. J. W. (1897) 'Some Glasgow designers and their work: part II', The Studio, XI(54), September, pp.227-236 They also bought and commissioned pieces from Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh and Frances Macdonald McNair for the house.Buchanan, W. (2004) 'Talwin Morris, Blackie and the Glasgow Style', Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society Journal, 87, Autumn, p.10 Bookplates designed by Talwin and Alice at that time are generally thought to reflect the circumstances of their new home and life together.Cinamon, G. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition. London: William Morris Gallery, p.11 The house was sold in July 1899 to the parents of his friends Margaret and Frances Macdonald, and the Morrisses moved to Torwood in Bowling.Cinamon, G. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition. London: William Morris Gallery, p.1
From 5 October-5 December 1896 he exhibited three book cover designs at the fifth exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society at the New Gallery, London. He also produced metalwork, jewelleryExamples are held in the Victoria and Albert Museum. See http://collections.vam.ac.uk/ and furniture, which he exhibited at the 1902 Exhibition of Modern British Furniture at the National Museum of Industrial Art in Budapest. Also in 1902, his work was selected for exhibition alongside those of his contemporaries at the influential Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna held in Turin, at which he sold several pieces.Buchanan, W. (2004) 'Talwin Morris, Blackie and the Glasgow Style', Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society Journal, 87, Autumn, p.10
In 1902 also he introduced Mackintosh to his employer Walter Blackie, which led to Mackintosh receiving the commission to design Blackie's home, Hill House, Helensburgh.Glasgow: City of Sculpture: http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=morris_t# In 1910 he designed the memorial of his employers the Blackie Family in Glasgow Necropolis.
Morris himself became hugely influential in Victorian book design by moving away from the popular narrative bindings of the time to a more modern Art Nouveau approach where line, curve and decoration are used to entice the reader.Ford, L. (2004) 'The Art Nouveau book designs of Talwin Morris', Amphora, 135, June, pp.4-8. Available: http://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/jspui/handle/1993/4449 At Blackie and Son his output was prolific, producing many designs that could be printed in different colourways across series such as the Red Letter Library and Library of Famous Books. He also designed books for Morison Brothers of Glasgow, Cassell, J. G. Cotta of Stuttgart, Mudie's Select Library, and from 1898 the Blackie subsidiary Gresham.Cinamon, G. (1981) 'Talwin Morris and the Glasgow Style: Part II', Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society Newsletter, 29, Spring/Summer, pp.8-10 In 1906 he also supplied the cover design of the influential German magazine Dekorative Kunst.Dekorative Kunst, Band IX Nos. 5-8, February–March 1906 Though many of his book designs are unsigned, some feature his 'signature' of a single dash followed by a further two dashes (his reversed initials MT in morse code). During his tenure, Morris also commissioned book designs by designers such as Ethel Larcombe and Silver Studio.
Morris retired through ill-health in 1909 and died from a cardiac embolism on 29 March 1911 at just 45 years old. His one piece of formal writing, the 9th special supplement of the Press Art School titled 'The Illustration of Children's Books', was published posthumously in 1912.A copy is held in the British Library. His body lies in Dumbarton Cemetery, marked by a gravestone designed by his friend Charles Rennie Mackintosh at the behest of his widow Alice. The inscription reads "Love is more great than we conceive / and death is the keeper of unknown redemptions".Mackintosh's pencil and wash design for the gravestone is held in the Hunterian Art Gallery collection, Glasgow. See http://www.huntsearch.gla.ac.uk/
From 21–22 July 1924 books in the possession of his widow Alice were auctioned at Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge.The sales catalogue is held at University of Manchester Library In 1946 his widow Alice presented examples of his architectural drawings, interior designs and sketchbooks of Blackie motifs to Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Much of his design work for Blackie was sold at Sotheby's, London 1–2 June 1989 in the sale of the Blackie archives. A grille and stained-glass window for the Blackie headquarters in Stanhope Street, Glasgow (demolished in the 1960s) was sold the following month at Christie's, Glasgow.Cinamon, G. (1990) 'Talwin Morris (1865-1911): a checklist of works related to publishing', Private Library, 3(1) Spring, p.41 Posthumous exhibitions of his work were held at the William Morris Gallery from 23 August-2 October 1983, National Art Library from June–July 1990, and at Blackwell from 26 April-11 July 2005. His work can be seen in many library and museum collections, both in the United Kingdom and internationally.

[[Aliquandostipitaceae]]
CATEGORIES: Dothideomycetes, Fungi families

The Aliquandostipitaceae are a family of fungi in the Ascomycota, class Dothideomycetes. The family was described by Patrik Inderbitzin in 2001, and the order Jahnulales was created in 2002 to accommodate the family. The distinguishing characteristic for members of the family are the unusually wide hyphae ("widest hyphae reported in the ascomycetes") that support the spore-bearing structures, and the presence of ascomata both with and without stalks. The genus Aliquandostipe has a pantropical distribution, having been found in Central America and southeast Asia; Jahnula has a wider distribution. Species in the family are saprobic, and are typically found growing on rotting wood.

The CCAC was established in 1968 by the National Research Council at the request of the Medical Research Council. Its initial goal was to "investigate the care and use of experimental animals in Canada", with a mandate to "to work for the improvement of animal care and use on a Canada-wide basis". The organization is a non-legislated, participatory, peer review system—all experimental care and use of animals in Canada is subject to its rules and regulations.[tpl]cite book |title=Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals |volume=1 |edition=2nd |author=Ernest D. Olfert, DVM, Brenda M. Cross, DVM and A. Ann McWilliam |date=1993 |publisher=Canadian Council on Animal Care [/tpl]
The organization explains its position on the use of animals in research:
The CCAC uses assessment panels, which meet with personnel from research institutions such as colleges and universities, to evaluate animal care and use within the facilities. While there, the panels interview individual investigators and observe specific techniques. If an institution does not meet the standards set by the CCAC, then the CCAC issues recommendations to the offending institution, typically for housekeeping or facility maintenance concerns.
Research in which vertebrates or cephalopods are used in Canada are subject to the requirements of the CCAC; however, research can be exempt if shown to be necessary. The CCAC was funded entirely by annual grants from the Medical Research Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, two of Canada's largest granting agencies, from the organization's inception in 1968 to 1994.[tpl]cite web |accessdate=2009-10-18 |url=http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/37_2/37_2Canada.shtml |title=Laboratory Animal Care Policies and Regulations |publisher=Ilar Journal |date=1997 |author=Wong, James [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

The 2010 Michigan State Spartans football team competed on behalf of Michigan State University in the Big Ten Conference during the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season. Head coach Mark Dantonio was in his fourth season with the Spartans. Michigan State played their home games in Spartan Stadium in East Lansing, Michigan, U.S.
In the hours following the Spartans' September 18, 2010 victory over Notre Dame, Coach Dantonio suffered a heart attack for which he was hospitalized, and received a coronary stent.  His recovery was complicated by the subsequent development of a blood clot in his leg.  While he recovered, offensive coordinator Don Treadwell stepped in as acting head coach, leading the Spartans against Northern Colorado and Wisconsin.  Dantonio resumed his head coaching duties for the sixth game of the season against Michigan, although he coached that game and the next week's game against Illinois from the press box instead of the head coach's traditional place on the sidelines.  He returned to the sidelines for MSU's road win against Northwestern.
The Spartans finished the regular season with eleven wins (the most in school history), one loss, and secured their first share of the Big Ten Championship in twenty years.

[[QuRiNet]]

CATEGORIES: Computer networking

The Quail Ridge Wireless Mesh Network project is an effort to provide a wireless communications infrastructure to the wildlife reserve. The network will benefit on-site ecological research and provide a wireless mesh network testbed for development and analysis.
This is a joint project with the University of California Natural Reserve System and the Networks Lab at the Department of Computer Science, UC Davis.
The goal is to create a large scale wireless mesh network backbone deployed within the reserve. Various sensor networks would gather temperature, visual, and acoustic data at certain locations. This information would then be passed back to the field station for storage or for further relay over Ethernet. The backbone nodes will also serve as access points enabling wireless access at their locations.
The Quail Ridge Reserve will also act as a test bed for research in wireless mesh networks. Some of our research goals include:
    * Layer 2 Routing: We would like to forward traffic at the MAC layer in order to avoid excess
      processing time and addressing required by current routing protocols. We are interested in finding
      ways to intelligently select paths for packets at the MAC layer.
    * Monitoring and Maintenance Tools: With access to the Quail Ridge Test Bed, we would like to
      design and develop wireless mesh network monitoring and maintenance tools that would be useful to
      future mesh network administrators and researchers.
    * Time Based Access Mechanisms [[Time division multiple access]]: Current 802.11 mesh networks must utilize CSMA/CA in order to
      access the channel. With a large number of users, it may be more efficient to organize access based
      on time. We are interested in applying TDMA schemes over 802.11 in order to boost performance.
    * Exploiting the Multiple Channel Advantage: The access points we have chosen for Quail Ridge
      are equipped with two radios. This will allow us to intelligently and dynamically select channels
      in order to avoid interference on high-traffic links.

[[Compassionate love]]

CATEGORIES: Love

Compassionate love, sometimes also called altruistic love, has been a topic of scientific interest and research since the 1990s. It is also closely related to the construct of unlimited love that has been expounded by Stephen G. Post. Compassionate love refers to love that "centers on the good of the other" (p. 3, Underwood, 2008Lynn G. Underwood (2008). Compassionate love: A framework for research. In Beverley Fehr, Susan Sprecher, & Lynn G. Underwood (Eds.), The Science of Compassionate Love: Theory, Research, and Applications (pp. 3-25) (table of contents), Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. ISBN 978-1-4051-5394-2). It is distinct from altruism, compassion, and romantic love. Since 2001, the scientific study of compassionate love has received several million dollars in research support from the Fetzer Institute and the Institute for Research on Unlimited Love (IRUL).
The emergence of the term compassionate love has been described by Lynn G. Underwood in a chapter in the first edited book on compassionate love research, The Science of Compassionate Love.Beverley Fehr, Susan Sprecher, & Lynn G. Underwood (Eds.), The Science of Compassionate Love: Theory, Research, and Applications (2008). (table of contents), Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. ISBN 978-1-4051-5394-2 The term first emerged in the context of a research meeting at the World Health Organization (WHO) for developing tools to assess quality of life to be used in diverse cultures. The group included researchers from all over the world, from both religious and nonreligious backgrounds. One of the facets of interest was loving kindness, or love for others. Underwood writes that "There was considerable discussion of the appropriate wording for this aspect. The Buddhists were not happy with the word 'love' but wanted 'compassion' to be used, which for them fit the concept. The Muslims in the group (from Indonesia, India, and Turkey) were adamant that compassion was too 'cold' and that 'love' needed to be there as it brought in the feeling of love.... 'compassionate love' was the compromise phrase" (pp. 8-9, Underwood, 2008Underwood (2008). (see earlier reference for full citation)).
Scientific research on compassionate love began to emerge after a 1999 conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that brought together several key theorists and researchers, and produced an edited book reflecting major ideas.Stephen G. Post, Lynn G. Underwood, Jeffrey P. Schloss, William B. Hurlbut (Eds.), Altruism and Altruistic Love: Science, Philosophy, and Religion in Dialogue (2002).(table of contents), New York: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-514358-2, ISBN 978-1-4051-5394-2

Shawqi Aboud (in Arabic شوقي عبود) (Adhammiya, Iraq 1927 - d. Baghda 2008) was an Iraqi coach that managed the Iraqi national team on three different occasions.
He was born in Adhammiya where his father worked for the Capital Municipality, it was there he first got the taste of sports growing up in Baghdad and playing at the local sports grounds of the area. He studied sports at primary and secondary school before enrolling at the Military College (Kuliya Al-Askariya) in 1948 and later became a champion sprinter at the College.
While at the Military College in Baghdad he also studied the game of football playing in the Iraq League before being transferred to the city of Basra, however as he was an officer in the Iraqi army, he was unable to register with any sports club in the city.
In 1954, Shawqi traveled to England to take part in a training course along with Adil Basher. He spent a month in England where he got to know Irish coach William Cook, formerly a professional with Everton and Celtic who joined the Iraq delegation on their return to Baghdad to manage the Iraq army team. Cook spent six months training the Iraq army team at the Sarsink Camp on a wage of only a few Iraqi dinars, where they played a number of friendly games, with Shawqi playing a few matches for Iraq in the outside right position, as well as working as one of Cook’s coaching assistants.
Shawqi went onto coach army teams Al-Farqa Al-Awola (First Division), Al-Farqa Al-Thalatha (Third Division), Al-Farqa Al-Rabaa (Fourth Division) before he took over Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya (Air Force) in 1963 which was to be his last coaching job.

The song has never been included on a Shirley Bassey album or compilation. The 7" single release features. on the b-side, the original Shirley Bassey recording of "Memory", 'from the musical Cats recorded in 1984.

Thomas Griffin and Meeks Griffin were brothers and prominent black farmers who lived in Chester County, South Carolina. They were executed via the electric chair in 1915 for the murder in 1913 of 75-year-old John Q. Lewis, a Confederate veteran of Blackstock.
The Griffin brothers were convicted based on the accusations of another black man, John "Monk" Stevenson, who was known to be a small-time thief. Stevenson who was found in possession of the victim's pistol, was sentenced to life in prison in exchange for testifying against the brothers.
Two other African Americans, Nelson Brice and John Crosby, were executed with the brothers for the same crime.
However, some in the community believed that the murder might have been the result of Lewis's suspected sexual relationship with 22-year-old Anna Davis. Davis and her husband were never tried, possibly for fear of a miscegenation scandal.
The Griffin brothers, who were believed to be the wealthiest blacks in the area, sold their [tpl]convert|138|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] farm to pay for their defense against the accusations.
Over 100 people petitioned Gov. Richard Manning to commute the brothers' sentence. The signatories included prominent people including Blackstock's mayor, a sheriff, two trial jurors and the grand jury foreman. Nevertheless, they were sent to the electric chair.[tpl]cite news | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010066394_pardon15.html?syndication=rss | title=Radio host Tom Joyner clears his family's name | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=2009-10-15 | accessdate=2009-10-18 | first=Seanna | last=Adcox[/tpl]

[[Oxytalan]]
CATEGORIES: Teeth

In the cellular anatomy of teeth, oxytalan fibres are a component of the extracellular matrix. They were first described by Fullmer & Lillie (1958) in periodontal membranes.  On light microscope examination, these fibres may be distinguished from mature elastic fibers by their failure to stain with aldehyde fuchsin solutions, unless they have been oxidized by potassium permanganate, performic acid or peracetic acid. 
Under electron microscopy they appear to be composed of microfibrillar units, 7–20 nm in diameter with a periodicity of 12–17 nm. 
From their morphology, localization and staining properties it seems likely that these fibers are an immature form of elastic tissue.
Oxytalan fibers are elastic-like fibers that run parallel to the tooth surface and bend to attach to cementum. Fibrillin builds the oxytalan fibers, which causes the elastic behavior.WELSCH – Lehrbuch der Histologie, Elsevier München 2010   
They can be found on the surface of smooth muscles. They are largely associated with blood vessels.

Nathan A. Scott, Jr. (24 April 1925 – December 2006) was an American scholar who helped establish the modern field of theology and literature and who helped found the well-known Ph.D. program in that field at the University of Chicago.Wright, Terry. "Religion and Literature from the Modern to the Postmodern: Scott, Steiner and Detweiler". Literature and Theology 19.1 (2005) 3-21. Scott also published seventeen books, in addition to publishing articles and reviews and editing editions."Remembering Nathan Scott" by Henry L. Carrigan, Jr. He has likewise been the subject of numerous articles and books.
Scott's innovation in literary criticism was to reject the New Critics' idea that poems should be studied as autonomous objects and to remind scholars that authors' personal beliefs are crucial for understanding their texts; in this way, he also returned criticism to a study of the way literature represents the outside world.Hesla, David H.

Scott earned his B.A. at the University of Michigan in 1944, his B.D. at Union Theological Seminary in 1946, and his Ph.D at Columbia University in 1949, having studied under Lionel Trilling, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Jacques Barzun. He served as dean of the chapel at Virginia Union University and was an ordained priest in the Episcopal Church. He taught at Howard University in Washington, D.C.Fikes, Robert. Nathan A.

Hobo is a sans serif typeface.  It is unique in having virtually no straight lines and no descenders. It was created by Morris Fuller Benton and issued by American Type Founders in 1910.  A light version, Light Hobo, was released in 1915.  Matrices were offered for mechanical composition by Intertype.  Hobo possesses uniquely organic and art nouveau-style features.
Its name came from a story stating that it was sketched in the early 1900s, sent to the foundry nameless, and progressed so little for so long, that it was called "that old hobo".  Hobo, originally called Adface, was finally patented in 1915 along with Light Hobo.[tpl]cite book|last=McGrew|first=Mac|title=American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century|year=1993|publisher=Oak Knoll Books|isbn=0-938768-39-5|pages=181[/tpl]

Established December 27, 1954, through a donation by the Morton family, the [tpl]convert|187|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] Elizabeth A. Morton National Wildlife Refuge boasts exceptionally diverse habitats including bay beach, a brackish pond, a freshwater pond, kettle holes, tidal flats, salt marsh, freshwater marsh, shrub, grasslands, maritime oak forest, and red cedar. The refuge's diversity is critical to Long Island wildlife.
Habitats along the beach attract many species including nesting piping plovers, roseate terns, least terns, common terns, and shorebirds. The waters surrounding the refuge are considered critical habitat for juvenile Kemp's Ridley sea turtles and are occasionally used by loggerhead sea turtles. Waterfowl use of the refuge peaks during the colder months. Long-tailed ducks, white-winged scoter, goldeneye and black ducks will most likely be spotted during winter.
The refuge is located in the hamlet of Noyack, New York. Much of the refuge is situated on a peninsula surrounded by Noyack and Little Peconic Bays. The north/south orientation of the peninsula makes the refuge important habitat for shorebirds, raptors and songbirds as they navigate the coastline during migration.

The Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge on the north shore of Long Island consists of high quality marine habitats that support a variety of aquatic-dependent wildlife. The refuge's waters and marshes surround Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, home of Theodore Roosevelt - father of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Subtidal (underwater up to mean high tide line) habitats are abundant with marine invertebrates, shellfish and fish.
Marine invertebrate and fish communities support a complex food web from waterfowl to fish-eating birds, to marine mammals. Waterfowl use of the Refuge peaks from October through April. Over 20,000 ducks have been documented on the refuge during one survey. Over 25 species of waterfowl, along with numerous other waterbirds, depend on Oyster Bay for survival. The most common marine mammals at the refuge are harbor seals - which have become more noticeable during recent years. Sea turtles and diamondback terrapins can also be sighted at the Refuge.
New York State's only remaining commercial oyster farm operates on the refuge, producing 90% of the State's oyster harvest.

The Codex Salmanticensis (Brussels, Royal Library 7672–4) is a medieval Irish manuscript containing an extensive collection of Irish saints' Lives, now in the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels. It was culled by the compilers from various sources, some of which can be identified as distinct, regionally focused groups in the text. 
One such group is that of the O'Donohue Lives, so called after one of the manuscript's contributors, Diarmaid Ó Dúnchadha. These works are mostly eighth- and ninth-century Lives of saints whose monasteries lay in central Ireland (around Slieve Bloom), in parts of Munster, Mide and Leinster. They include saints like Ailbe of Emly, Ruadán of Lorrha and Cainnech of Aghaboe.Charles-Edwards, "The Northern Lectionary", p. 148-50.
The collection also includes five short Lives of saints associated with northern churches (in Ulster or the Airgíalla): Mo Lua[tpl]dn|date=December 2012[/tpl] of Drumsnat, Daig of Inniskeen, Mochta of Louth, Éogan of Ardstraw and Mac Nisse of Connor. Their feast-days are given in August or the beginning of September. These texts are relatively late, but Charles-Edwards has suggested that they ultimately derive from an earlier, northern Irish work used for reading on the festivals, which he calls the Northern Lectionary.Charles-Edwards, "The Northern Lectionary," pp. 151-3.

"A Rugrats Passover" is the 26th and the final episode of the third season of the American animated television series Rugrats, and its 65th episode overall. It was broadcast originally on April 13, 1995, on the cable network Nickelodeon. The plot follows series regulars Grandpa Boris and the babies as they become trapped in the attic on Passover; to pass the time, Boris tells the Jewish story of the Exodus. During the episode the babies themselves reenact the story, with young Tommy portraying Moses, while his cousin Angelica represents the Pharaoh of Egypt.
"A Rugrats Passover" was directed by Jim Duffy, Steve Socki, and Jeff McGrath from the script by Peter Gaffney, Paul Germain, Rachel Lipman, and Jonathon Greenberg. The episode was conceived in 1992 when Germain responded to a Nickelodeon request for a Rugrats Hannukah special by creating a Passover episode instead. The episode scored a 3.1 Nielsen Rating, making it "the highest-rated show in Nickelodeon's history",[tpl]cite journal|title=Nickelodeon on a roll; Learning Station's bright idea|date=1995-10-14|work=Billboard|page=66[/tpl] and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, including from Jewish community publications. It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, an Annie Award, and a CableACE Award. The episode also, however, attracted controversy, when the Anti-Defamation League compared the artistic design of the older characters to anti-Semitic drawings from a 1930s Nazi newspaper.
The episode made Rugrats one of the first animated series to focus on a Jewish holiday; its success precipitated the creation of another special, "A Rugrats Chanukah", which also attracted critical acclaim. A novelization of the episode was in 2007 exhibited at the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The Target Rock National Wildlife Refuge is located just east of the village of Lloyd Harbor, New York, on the north shore of Long Island, [tpl]convert|25|mi|km[/tpl] east of New York City.
This [tpl]convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] refuge is composed of mature oak-hickory forest, a half-mile rocky beach, a brackish pond, and several vernal ponds. The land and waters support a variety of songbirds (particularly warblers during spring migration), mammals, shorebirds, fish, reptiles and amphibians. During the colder months, diving ducks are common offshore, while harbor seals occasionally use the beach and nearby rocks as resting sites. New York State and federally protected piping plover, least tern, and common tern depend on the Refuge's rocky shore for foraging and rearing young.
The spring bloom at Target Rock is a reminder of its days as a garden estate, with flowering rhododendrons and mountain laurel.

[[De Bruijn's theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Theorems in discrete geometry

In a 1969 paper, Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn proved several results about packing congruent rectangular bricks (of any dimension) into larger rectangular boxes, in such a way that no space is left over. One of these results is now known as de Bruijn's theorem. According to this theorem, a "harmonic brick" (one in which each side length is a multiple of the next smaller side length) can only be packed into a box whose dimensions are multiples of the brick's dimensions.[ref]

Teisutis 'Joe' Zikaras (often spelled "Tesutis") (5 July 1922 – 10 May 1991) was an Australian sculptor born in Panevėžys, Lithuania. He earned a diploma at the School of Fine Arts, Kaunas, Lithuania, where his father Juozas, creator of Lithuania's famous Liberty statue, was Head. He left Lithuania after its takeover by Russia and spent spent two years 1946–48 teaching drawing and sculpture at a campus of the École des Arts et Métiers in Freiburg, Germany,http://test.svs.lt/?Daile;Article(3569);print an art school for Lithuanian refugees where Aleksandras Marčiulionis was a principal.http://www.lituanus.org/1999/99_4_05.htm
He was one of the artists who contributed to the 1949 Lithuanian Art Exhibition held in Freiburg with Paulius Augius, Juozas Bakis, Alfonsas Dargis, Povilas Kaufmanas, Viktoras Petravicius, Vaclovas Ratas, Adolfas Vaicaitis, Adolfas Valeska, Telesforas Valius, Liudas Vilimas and Viktoras Vizgirda.http://www.virtualmuseum.us/lith/augius/pro.html
He was accepted by Australia as a 'DP' (displaced person), arriving in Melbourne in 1949.http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/catalogues/artist/14136/teisutis-zikaras.aspx From 1952 to 1956, he was employed as a sculptor on the Melbourne War Memorial. He proceeded to become Lecturer in Sculpture at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. His surviving commissioned work includes the sculpture for the courtyard of the ETA Foods Factory in Braybrook, Victoria.
He was a member of the Victorian Sculptors' Society. Around 1960, he joined with Clifford Last, Inge King, Vincas Jomantas and Lenton Parr to form a splinter group which exhibited together as the 'Centre Five'. In 1967 they split from the Society, which never recovered from the departure of so many of its prominent members.http://www.sculptorsvictoria.asn.au/association_history.php
According to Australian art critic Alan McCulloch "He was raised in the tradition of peasant wood-carvings, many of which were hung on trees. This influence accounts for the flatness, the two-dimensional quality in the work not only of Zikaras but also in that of many other Lithuanian sculptors."Encyclopedia of Australian Art Alan McCulloch, Hutchinson of London 1968

It is the seat of a municipality with an area of [tpl]convert|241.05|km²|2|abbr=out[/tpl] and 162 636 inhabitants (2008), divided in 69 parishes. The municipality is bordered to the north by the municipality of Póvoa de Lanhoso, to the east by Fafe, to the south by Felgueiras, Vizela and Santo Tirso, to the west by Vila Nova de Famalicão and the northwest by Braga.
It is an historical city that had an important role in the formation of Portugal and it was settled in the 9th century, at which time it was called Vimaranes. This denomination might have had its origin in the warrior Vímara Peres, when he chose this area as the main government seat for the County of Portugal which he conquered for the Kingdom of Galicia.
Guimarães is one of the country's most important historical cities. Its historical center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, making it one of the largest tourist centers in the region.
The city is often referred to as the "birthplace of the Portuguese nationality" or "the cradle city" (Cidade Berço in Portuguese). This might be because the administrative seat of the County of Portugal was established there by Henry of Burgundy, or that it might also been the birthplace of Afonso I of Portugal, the first Portuguese king or because of the historical role of the city in the Battle of São Mamede (June 24, 1128), which had a tremendous importance in the formation of Portugal and was fought in the vicinity of the city, However, due to the needs of the Reconquista, the governative center was changed to Coimbra in 1129. The "Vimaranenses" are also called "Conquistadores" (the Conquerors) in relation with the historical heritage of the conquest initiated in Guimarães.
Guimarães, jointly with Maribor, Slovenia, was the European Capital of Culture in 2012.

Pine Creek WMA consists of [tpl]convert|10280|acre|km2[/tpl].  It is adjacent to Little River and its impoundment, Pine Creek Lake, which offers additional and coextensive protected areas for wildlife.
Intensive management practices maintain old farm field habitat, as well as a variety of natural landscapes.  Approximately [tpl]convert|250|acre|km2[/tpl] of food plots are planted yearly.  Management practices include burning, plowing, and brush hogging provide native plant food resources and maintain habitat diversity.
Trees include six species of oak as well as ash, hickory, pine, river birch, and willow.  Sand plum, holly, sumac, and a great variety of grasses and legumes are also present.
Soil types range from deep sand to rocky.
The area receives approximately [tpl]convert|53|in|mm[/tpl] of rain per year, and is well-watered.
Game species are abundant:  bobwhite quail, whitetail deer, Eastern Wild Turkeys, cottontail rabbits and swamp rabbits, coyote, bobcats, beavers, mink, raccoons, doves, and geese may all be found in varying numbers.
Nongame species are also in evidence:  black bear, river otters, and bald eagles are also part of the WMA's ecosystem.  None of these nongame species may be hunted.  Eagles winter at Pine Creek Lake and travel the Little River watershed.All information courtesy general profile description by Richard Beagles, biologist, Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, available via http://www.wildlifedepartment.com/pinecreek.htm.

Sir John Barnard (c. 1685 – 28 August 1764)Edward J. Davies, “The Ancestry of Lord Palmerston”, The Genealogist, 22(2008):62-77. was a British Whig politician and Lord Mayor of London.D. W. Hayton, ‘Barnard, Sir  John  (c.1685–1764)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 Oct 2009.
He was a son of John Barnard of London, a Quaker merchant, and his wife Sarah, daughter of Robert Payne of Play Hatch in Sonning on the border of Berkshire and Oxfordshire.Davies.
He was a Sheriff of London in 1736 and elected Lord Mayor of London for 1737.
He was elected at the 1722 general election as one of the four Members of Parliament (MPs) for the City of London. He held the seat for nearly 40 years, until the 1761 general election.
Barnard was an opposition Whig, opposed to the administration of Sir Robert Walpole. In a speech in March 1738 Barnard said:
 A dishonourable peace is worse than a destructive war...All nations are apt to play the bully with respect to one another; and if the government or administration of a nation has taken but one insult tamely, their neighbours will from thence judge of the character of that nation...and will accordingly treat them as bullies do noted poltroons; they will kick and cuff them upon every occasion.Brendan Simms, Three Victories and a Defeat. The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire, 1714–1783 (Allen Lane, 2007), p. 252. 
Barnard gained a positive reputation as a "hammer of the Spaniards" and at Lord Cobham's country house at Stowe, who predeceased Barnard, an ornate bust commissioned of Barnard was included in its Temple of British Worthies, along with Elizabeth I and Sir Francis Drake.Simms, p. 259.

His works had been shown in various solo shows and mix shows in different galleries. His Paintings have been on collections in different places of the world. He graduated at the University of Santo Tomas, College of Fine Arts in the Philippines. He was a consistent winner in almost all competitions he entered that made him win an award as the Most Outstanding Atelier student in painting (ref. The Varsitarian, "The Thomasian as a Surealist" by Oscar T. Valeriano)
His first one-man show was at the Hidaldo Gallery in Makati Commercial Center, Philippines - January 2, 1974.  (ref. Manila Bulletin, Jan 1, 1974 issue, Home & Culture by Carmen Perez section).
His painted Pumpkin won best entry at the 1998 Annual Pumpkin Contest at the Westin Hotel & Resorts in San Francisco, California.  While some of his works were featured at the San Francisco State University's Literary Magazine, "From the Heart" or "Del Corazon".  He was a runner up at the Burlingame Art Society competition in 2002.  One of his old work was featured in the Encyclopedia of Philippine Art (ref. Encyclopedia of Philippine Art, Volume 1, pg 179).
The Florida Medical Journal has one of his composition on its cover in 1990 (ref. The Journal of Florida Medical, September 1990, Vol 77, No.9).  An abstract watercolor, metaphorically symbolizing the role of physicians in treating the sick.  According to artist Ricardo G. Lacsamana, the outstretched hands symbolize the healing power of physicians, manifest as a healthy tree providing protection and comfort to the sick and infirm who are aided by philanthropic groups, as symbolized by the crutch.  The dove and fish indicate that physicians do not escape criticism, while the central "internal" figures may connote the medical profession as a whole.  He created a painting entitled "Transition" in commemoration of the Peace and Freedom and People Power Revolution (also known as the EDSA Revolution and the Philippine Revolution of 1986), which at that time was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, Philippines.  The painting was featured in "The Manila Times" in August 1986 (ref. The Manila Times, August 1986 issue).
Lacsamana painted dreams draw admiration to art lovers.  His symbols and very fertile imagination produce fantastic images... that takes you in a horizon where you experience dreaming differently, you never thought you could.  He copes with contemporary problems such as flood, population explosion, Fil-American relations, women's liberation, poverty, the respective roles of the young and old in society, and with modern interpretations of the Bible.

[[Good, Bad but Beautiful]]

Good, Bad but Beautiful is a 1975 album by Shirley Bassey. In the first half of the decade, Bassey recorded nine albums, with three making the top ten. In March 1975, Bassey released a compilation that became her highest-charting album to date, The Shirley Bassey Singles Album (#2), and reflects the momentum Bassey had maintained since her 1970 "comeback". Good, Bad but Beautiful, released in the autumn of 1975, spent seven weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at #13.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/albuminfo.php?id=3700 |title=Shirley Bassey - Good Bad But Beautiful |publisher=Chart Stats |date=1975-12-13 |accessdate=2012-02-19|archiveurl=http://archive.is/Xu5J|archivedate=2012-07-29[/tpl] The album reflects the formula that brought Bassey back to the charts: a combination of contemporary songs combined with her forte of standards, show tunes, and torch songs, featuring  arrangements aimed squarely at the adult contemporary, or middle-of-the-road, audience. This was also achieved by modifying her backup orchestra to include electric guitars, a string and brass section with a more contemporary sound, and drumming that is more soft rock-oriented than jazz-oriented, while side two's opener, "Feel Like Makin' Love" displays a smooth jazz style.
This was Bassey's seventh album of the 1970s to make the Billboard 200, peaking at #186. It also reached #54 on the US R&B chart. In the UK the album was awarded a silver disc six weeks after it was released.          
The original release was in stereo on vinyl and cassette. In 2005, BGO Records issued a remastered Good, Bad but Beautiful, together with the 1973 album Never Never Never, on a 2 CD set.

[[Original Prague Syncopated Orchestra]]
CATEGORIES: Czech jazz ensembles

The Original Prague Syncopated Orchestra (Czech: Originální Pražský Synkopický Orchestr or OPSO) is a Czech jazz band first formed in Prague, in what was then Czechoslovakia, in 1974. It is best known for painstaking reconstructions of performances of music of the 1920s, using authentic instruments, and improvisation in the style of the time.
The initial line-up in 1974 was a five-man band (three wind instruments, piano and banjo) under the artistic direction of musicologist Pavel Klikar.Prague Post, May 17, 2000 Three more members joined in 1976: a second saxophone, a violin, and vocalist Ondřej Havelka. In May 1978 the band came to European prominence playing at the Festival of Old Jazz in Breda, the Netherlands. That autumn the band expanded to twelve members.
During the 1980s, the ensemble's live concerts regularly featured lyrics in English, but broadcast performances did not.Eastern Europe: an Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture, ed. Richard C. Frucht, vol. 1, p. 263.
In 1995 the band split, with Havelka founding a rival group that eventually adopted the name Ondřej Havelka and his Melody Makers.
The Original Prague Syncopated Orchestra continues to perform, and is well known for open-air performances on the Charles Bridge in Prague.

[[Antigua Escuela de Jurisprudencia, Mexico City]]
CATEGORIES: Landmarks in Mexico City, Buildings and structures in Mexico City

The Antigua Escuela de Jurisprudencia (Old School of Jurisprudence) building is located on the corner of Republica de Argentina and San Ildefonso Streets in the historic center of Mexico City. The building originally was convent for Dominican nuns called Santa Catalina de Siena.After the Reform Laws the government took possession of the building and worked to turn it into a military barracks, transforming and partially demolishing it.[tpl]cite book |title= Guia Oficial Centro de la Ciudad d Mexico  |last=Horz de Via (ed)  |first=Elena  |year=1991  |publisher= INAH-SALVAT |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-32-0540-2  |pages=50–51 [/tpl] In the meantime, the National University of Mexico, the forerunner of UNAM, had been closed in 1833, and the Jurisprudence School was recreated at the College of San Ildefonso. In 1868, the National Preparatory High School was founded in the same building so the Jurisprudence School moved to the ex Convent of La Encarnación,(now SEP) and finally to the ex Convent of Santa Catalina de Siena.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.100.unam.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=371&Itemid=77  |title= Antigua Escuela de Jurisprudencia |publisher= UNAM |location=Mexico City [/tpl] In 1908, Diaz inaugurated this building as the Escuela Nacional de Jurispudencia (National School of Jurisprudence) .
Two years later, Justo Sierra founded the Universidad Nacional de Mexico, who was a graduate of the Jurisprudence School.  This school was integrated into the new university along with a number of other professional schools. In 1929, a student movement, of which the Jurisprudence School played a decisive role, succeeded in making the University autonomous, meaning the government would not directly dictate the school’s curriculum.
In 1948, the Jurisprudence building became sole property of the university. In 1954, with the building of new facilities at the Ciudad Universitaria, the School moved south. The building now houses the continuing education and alumni services of the School of Law.
The facade of the building is of two levels. The lower level is mostly devoid of any ornamentation but the upper level is based on Palladian architecture, especially in its use of columns with pediments. However, most of the building, inside and out shows an eclectic mixture of architectural styles, because it had been remodeled a number of times during different architectural periods. The interior contains what remains of the old convent’s patios although they have been greatly altered. The third floor was added at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Azerbaijani system is a more complicated than many other national league systems, consisting of two completely separate systems of leagues and clubs, senior football and junior football. The two systems have nothing to do with the ages of the players involved.
In senior football in Azerbaijan there are two national leagues, the Azerbaijan Premier League and the Azerbaijan First Division. There are also several leagues (most notably the Azerbaijani Regional League), but there is no regular promotion or relegation between the regional leagues and the national league.
PFC Neftchi Baku are the current record holders with 5 titles.

[tpl]nihongo|Lazy|レイジー|Reijī|stylized as LAZY[/tpl] is a Japanese rock band originally founded in 1977 by young classmates Hironobu Kageyama, Hiroyuki Tanaka and Akira Takasaki. The three founders soon recruited, from their own school, drummer Munetaka Higuchi and keyboard player Shunji Inoue to complete the line-up. The name Lazy was taken from Deep Purple's song of the same name and the music the new band wanted to play was orientated towards hard rock. Managers and producers instead envisioned the young musicians as ideal prototypes for pop icons and created, through the use of monikers, costumes and well-balanced singles, a successful "boy band" for the Japanese teenage market. In contrast with these decisions, the band members started writing and recording their own music, slowly changing the sound of the band from easy-listening pop rock to hard rock. A growing dissatisfaction for the direction the band had taken, and the need to express their musical ability, caused Lazy to split-up in 1981.
Each member became known on their own, mainly in the soundtrack recording business, or formed other bands like Loudness. Lazy reformed in 1997 for a new album and a tour, and intermittently in the following years to do several projects together. In September 2006, bassist Tanaka died of heart failure. On November 30, 2008, drummer Higuchi died at the age of 49.[tpl]citation|title= Blabbermouth.net |year=2008 |publisher= Roadrunner Records |location= Los Angeles| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=109888 | accessdate = 2008-10-30[/tpl] In 2009 they recorded a new single version of [tpl]nihongo|"Kanjite Knight"|感じてKnight[/tpl], together with Kageyama's JAM Project, for the 2009 anime Shin Mazinger Shogeki!

Retrieved 2013-02-05. National Wildlife Refuge, located on the northern end of North Carolina's Outer Banks, was established in 1984 to preserve and protect the coastal barrier island ecosystem. Refuge lands are managed to provide wintering habitat for waterfowl and to protect endangered species such as piping plover, sea turtles, and seabeach amaranth.
Habitat types common to most barrier islands are found on the refuge. Moving westward from the Atlantic Ocean to Currituck Sound, these habitats include sandy beaches, grassy dunes, interdunal wetlands (flats), maritime forests and shrub thickets. Currituck Sound's shoreline is made up of brackish water marshes and occasionally, mud flats that have been exposed by wind tides. A few forested islands also exist on the refuge. Monkey Island, a noted bird rookery, provides nesting habitat to several species of wading birds. It is also currently the most northerly known native habitat of the Sabal minor palm.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ww2.odu.edu/~lmusselm/plant/index.php?todo=details&id=8388|title=Monkey Island Sabal Minor|publisher=Old Dominion University|accessdate=1 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.garysnursery.com/TheSabalMinor.html|title=Gary's Nursery|publisher=Gary Hollar|accessdate=1 November 2013[/tpl]  In addition to Sabal Palms, vegetation within these diverse habitat types include several varieties of beach grasses, live oak, loblolly pine, wax myrtle, cattails, sedges and rushes, black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) and giant cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides).
Various types of wading birds, shorebirds, waterfowl, raptors, mammals (including feral horses), reptiles, and amphibians common to the eastern United States, are found on the refuge. The endangered Piping Plover and loggerhead sea turtle sometimes nest on refuge beaches and dunes. 
The refuge has a surface area of [tpl]convert|8316|acre|km2[/tpl].USFWS Lands Report, 30 September 2010

Mackay Island National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1960 to provide habitat for migratory waterfowl, primarily the greater snow goose. It is located almost entirely on Knotts Island in the Currituck Sound between Back Bay in Virginia and the open sound in North Carolina.  The refuge is primarily made up of marsh habitat. This area has long been recognized for supporting significant migratory waterfowl populations and sport fishery resources, and is part of the Charles Kuralt Trail.
The refuge is strategically located along the Atlantic Flyway, making it an important wintering area for ducks, geese, and tundra swans. At times, flocks of over 12,000 snow geese may be observed on the refuge after their arrival in November. Many other wildlife species such as wading birds, shorebirds, raptors, neotropical migrants, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians use refuge habitats for food, cover, and nesting. A pair of bald eagles also nest on the refuge.
About 74 percent of the refuge is slightly brackish marsh habitat, dominated by cattails, black needlerush, and giant cordgrass. The remaining habitat includes farmland, marsh impoundments, brush and typical upland and lowland Eastern pine-hardwood forest. Vegetation in these areas includes loblolly pine, sweet gum, black gum, cypress, red maple, hickory, and oak.
The refuge has a surface area of [tpl]convert|8231|acre|km2[/tpl]. Of this, [tpl]convert|7357|acre|km2[/tpl] is in North Carolina and [tpl]convert|874|acre|km2[/tpl] is in Virginia.USFWS Lands Report, 30 September 2007

Situated along the Pee Dee River, Pee Dee National Wildlife Refuge contains [tpl]convert|8443|acre|km2[/tpl] in Anson and Richmond Counties, North Carolina. The refuge was established to provide wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl.
Cooperative farming in field impoundments, water level management, and the bottomland hardwood forest along Brown Creek provide excellent habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife. Wintering waterfowl numbers fluctuate greatly, but can exceed 10,000 birds yearly. The refuge also supports a small population of wintering Southern James Bay Canada geese. Pee Dee Refuge is located a few hundred yards from the once famous "Lockhart Gaddy Wild Goose Refuge". In the 1950s, Gaddy's pond wintered more than 10,000 Canada geese a year. Pee Dee National Wildlife Refuge was established in October 1963 to provide additional habitat for these geese and other waterfowl. Local numbers of wintering migratory geese have dwindled in recent years, but the refuge remains an important wintering area for the remaining geese and thousands of ducks.
The refuge also supports an abundance of nesting neotropical migratory birds, bobwhite quail, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. The diversity of habitat and management provides for more than 168 bird species, 49 reptiles and amphibians, 28 mammals, and 20 fish species. Refuge lands include the following habitat types: bottomland hardwood forest ([tpl]Convert|3000|acre|km2[/tpl]), upland pine forest ([tpl]Convert|1500|acre|km2[/tpl]), mixed pine/hardwood forest ([tpl]Convert|2000|acre|km2[/tpl]), crop lands ([tpl]Convert|1000|acre|km2[/tpl]), old fields, native warm season grass fields, and openings ([tpl]Convert|1000|acre|km2[/tpl]).

Roanoke River National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1989 to protect and enhance wooded wetlands consisting of bottomland hardwoods and swamps with high waterfowl value along the Roanoke River. The extensive bottomland hardwood habitat of the Roanoke River National Wildlife Refuge is part of what the Nature Conservancy calls "one of the last great places."
Refuge lands consist of bottomland hardwood forest interspersed with cypress-tupelo sloughs that includes forested wetlands in the lower 130 miles of the Roanoke River from the fall line at Weldon, North Carolina downstream to the Albemarle Sound near Plymouth, North Carolina. The refuge includes part of an extensive wetland ecosystem that contains excellent examples of several southeastern plant communities and habitat types. These include levee forest, cypress-gum swamp, bottomland hardwoods, oxbows, beaver ponds and blackwater streams. These communities add to the rich mosaic of habitat types in the river's floodplain.
The refuge includes valuable wetlands for fish and wildlife; especially waterfowl, neotropical migrants, and anadromous fish. The refuge hosts 214 species of birds, including 88 breeding resident species and the largest inland heron rookery in the state; white-tailed deer; one of the largest natural wild turkey populations in North Carolina; and a remnant population of black bear along with numerous small game and a diversity of fish species including the endangered shortnose sturgeon.

[[Bobby Sullivan]]

CATEGORIES: Living people, American punk rock musicians

Bobby Sullivan is a musician and activist.
He grew up in the Washington, DC punk scene. Forming Soulside in 1983, their first release under the name Lunch Meat was a split 7” with Dave Grohl’s first band, Mission Impossible. After the first 7”, all their work (three albums and another 7”) was produced by Ian MacKaye and released on Dischord Records. Soulside toured extensively in the US, Canada, and Mexico, and toured Europe in 1989, including Eastern Europe.
After Soulside’s split, Sullivan formed 7 League Boots in Boston, a band which blended  reggae and rock. After releasing two 7”s and one album on Constant Change/Cargo Records, they broke up and Sullivan joined Rain Like The Sound Of Trains in DC, before forming Sevens with his brother Mark Sullivan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/cracked/reviews/TR%20Soulside.htm |title=Review of Hot Bodi Gram |publisher=Monochrom.at |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26[/tpl] Both bands released albums produced by Tim Kerr.
In his later years, Sullivan became an activist. Mentored by Eric Weinberger, a civil rights activist who had been on the Freedom Rides, he worked with Food Not Bombs (soup kitchens for the homeless) for five years in DC and Boston.  He also helped form the DC chapter of the Anarchist Black Cross, a political prisoner support network, giving him close relationships with Ramona Africa from the MOVE Organization and various former Black Panthers and Weather Underground members. Today Bobby still makes music as B.Subtle with Moving Temple and Spontaneous Earth, an “acoustic roots” band in Asheville, North Carolina.  He also visits prisons and corresponds regularly with hundreds of inmates as Minister of Education for the Rastafarian UniverSoul Order, a prison ministry.

[[Lake Cities (train)]]

CATEGORIES: Passenger trains of the Erie Lackawanna Railway, Passenger trains of the Erie Railroad, Night trains of the United States, Named passenger trains of the United States, Railway services introduced in 1939

The Lake Cities was a passenger train operated by the Erie Railroad and its successor the Erie Lackawanna Railway between Chicago, and New York City.
The Lake Cities began in 1939 as the Midlander, a Jersey City-Chicago service with sections to Cleveland, Ohio, and Buffalo, New York. Unlike other New York-Chicago runs, it bypassed Buffalo to the south and ran through the Southern Tier of New York State.Streamliner Schedules, The Lake Cities http://www.streamlinerschedules.com/concourse/track3/lakecities195607.html 
A few years before the Erie's 1960 merger with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, the Lake Cities began running into the Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, rather than the Erie's Pavonia Terminal, in Jersey City.  Between 1961 and 1962, the train was known as the "Chicago Lake Cities/Buffalo Lake Cities", but reverted to Lake Cities again. Sleeper service ended on October 28, 1962. In connection with the 1964 World's Fair in New York, the Lake Cities was renamed The World's Fair from April 26 until October 25, 1964. Originally routed via Port Jervis en route to Bingamton over the traditional Erie lines, by the latter part of the 1960s it was routed over the Lackwanna's Poconos line after the elimination of the Phoebe Snow line in 1966. On November 28, 1966, the Lake Cities regained diner and sleeper service to compensate for the withdrawal of the Phoebe Snow (which had its final run the previous day), but by 1967 the sleeping service went no further west than Marion, Ohio, while the dining car stopped at Huntington, Indiana. 
The Erie Lackawanna withdrew the train on January 6, 1970.[tpl]rp|145–149[/tpl]

Quitchupah (or Quitchumpah) Creek is a stream draining portions of Emery and Sevier Counties in central Utah, in the western United States.   Quitchupah Creek is significant for its rock art remains of the Fremont culture that line its banks.  Quitchupah is Ute for "animals fare poorly." The drainage area is located within the Colorado River Basin near the south end of the Wasatch Plateau. All drainage from the area flows to Quitchupah Creek or its tributaries, including East Spring Canyon, Water Hollow, and North Fork and flows through Convulsion Canyon.United States Forest Service,   Quitchupah Creek Road Project Final Environmental Impact Statement, June 2001

Gesshū Sōko (1618–1696) was a Japanese Zen Buddhist teacher and a member of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan. He studied under teachers of the lesser known, and more strictly monastic, Obaku School of Zen and contributed to a reformation of Sōtō monastic codes. As a result, he is sometimes given the title "The Revitalizer".
He is known for his calligraphy[tpl]cite book |title=Sacred Calligraphy of the East, third edition |first=John |last=Stevens[/tpl] as well as his poetry, including his death poem: 
 
 Inhale, exhale 
Forward, back 
Living, dying: 
Arrows, let flown each to each 
Meet midway and slice 
The void in aimless flight -- 
Thus I return to the source.[tpl]cite book |last=Hoffmann |first=Yoel |title=Japanese Death Poems: Written by Zen Monks and Haiku Poets on the Verge of Death |year=1986 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing[/tpl]

Gesshū Sōko passed Dharma transmission to Zen Master Manzan Dohaku who went on to restore the strong master-disciple bond in Sōtō Zen.

The series was inspired by the success of the NFB's Canada Carries On series.

[[Do prostego człowieka]]
CATEGORIES: 1929 poems, Polish poems

Do prostego człowieka ([tpl]lang-en|To the Simple Man[/tpl]) is a poem by Julian Tuwim. Published for the first time in the November 7, 1929 edition of Robotnik daily, it immediately became popular due to its strong pacifist and anti-war message. The poem mocks militarism, jingoistic fervour and hysteria, and suggests that it is the powerful that reap the profits of wars waged by common people.
The poem was commonly read as expressing poet's disillusionment with Józef Pilsudski's regime and increasingly militant rhetoric.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | author =Marci Shore | coauthors = | title =Caviar and ashes: a Warsaw generation's life and death in Marxism, 1918-1968 | year =2006 | editor = | pages =74–75 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Yale University Press | location =New Haven, Conn. | isbn=978-0-300-11092-0 | url =http://books.google.pl/books?id=0nyESYH8ZnEC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=%22simple+man%22+Tuwim&source=bl&ots=rkOibsUkbz&sig=ocCaO36NA6T3dEGzm1VpNfq2DJg&hl=pl&ei=2bbbSojUFYLWmQOY1qzoDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CA4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22simple%20man%22%20Tuwim&f=false | format = | accessdate =2009-10-19 [/tpl]
At the same time it was openly criticised by both left and right-wing journalists. The rightists went as far as to suggest Tuwim be hanged for allegedly promoting desertion among Polish soldiers.
Despite criticism, the poem became immediately popular in Poland. One of the final lines of the poem (The oil is theirs, the blood is yours) became particularly famous and entered the Polish language as a popular expression in the form of "not my oil", meaning "it's none of my business".
In recent years the poem was translated to English by Marcel Weyland.[tpl]en icon[/tpl][tpl]pl icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author = | year = | month = | title = To the simple man | journal =Seria poetycka; Polish poetry | volume =VIII | issue =1836 | pages = | id = | url =http://www.antoranz.net/CURIOSA/ZBIOR7/C0710/20071014-QZM02062_Tuwim.HTM | issn=1176-7545 | accessdate = [/tpl] Weyland's translation contains one distorted passage as it is based on a faulty version of the text in common circulation in which a typo led to the substitution of the "lords" ("panami", instrumental grammatical case) by "maidens" ("pannami"), the result being rather ludicrous and far from intended by the poem's author. It also gained new popularity due to numerous rock bands performing it on their concerts. One of the best-known such interpretations is by a Polish rock group Akurat.

[[Postpositivism (international relations)]]
CATEGORIES: International relations theory, Positivism

In international relations theory, postpositivism refers to theories of international relations which epistemologically reject positivism, the idea that the empiricist observation of the natural sciences can be applied to the social sciences.
Postpositivist (or reflectivist) theories of IR attempt to integrate a larger variety of security concerns.  Supporters argue that if IR is the study of foreign affairs and relations, it ought to include non-state actors as well as the state.  Instead of studying solely high politics of the state, IR ought to study world politics of the everyday world—which involves BOTH high and low politics.  Thus, issues such as gender (often in terms of feminism which generally holds salient the subordination of women to men—though newer feminisms allow for the reverse too) and ethnicity (such as stateless actors like the Kashmiris or Palestinians) can be problematized and made into an international security issue—supplanting (not replacing) the traditional IR concerns of diplomacy and outright war.
The postpositivist approach can be described as incredulity towards metanarratives—in IR, this would involve rejecting all-encompassing stories that claim to explain the international system.  It argues that neither realism nor liberalism could be the full story. A postpositivist approach to IR does not claim to provide universal answers but seeks to ask questions instead.  A key difference is that while positivist theories such as realism and liberalism highlight how power is exercised, postpositivist theories focus on how power is experienced resulting in a focus on both different subject matters and agents.
Often, postpositivist theories explicitly promote a normative approach to IR, by considering ethics.  This is something which has often been ignored under traditional IR as positivist theories make a distinction between positive facts and normative judgements—whereas postpostivists argue that discourse is constitutive of reality; in other words, that it is impossible to be truly independent and factual as power-free knowledge cannot exist. (#)
Postpositivist theories do not attempt to be scientific or a social science.  Instead, they attempt in-depth analysis of cases in order to "understand" international political phenomena by asking relevant questions to determine in what ways the status-quo promote certain power relations.

[[Rita Lobato]]

CATEGORIES: 1866 births, 1954 deaths

Rita Lobato Velho Lopes (Rio Grande June 7, 1866 — Rio Pardo January 6, 1954) was the first woman to practice medicine in Brazil. She received her degree in 1887 from a school in Bahia. Her initial enrollment caused debate, with some people arguing that women had brains too small to understand medicine or that a female doctor would never find a husband, although others were in favor of her entrance and the Echo das Damas saw her as an example for Brazilian girls. She did, in fact, marry and practised medicine for several years.June Edith Hahner, Emancipating the Female Sex: The Struggle for Women's Rights in Brazil, 1850-1940, Duke University Press, 1990, pg 62-63.

[[The Cuman Tsaritsa of Bulgaria]]

CATEGORIES: 13th-century Bulgarian people

The name of the Cuman noblewoman who subsequently married two Tsars Emperors of Bulgaria, Kaloyan of Bulgaria and Boril of Bulgaria, is unknown. There are only two sources mentioning her, both foreign. The Byzantine historian George Akropolites claimed that after the death of Kaloyan, his sister's son Boril 'married his Scythian aunt'.Greek sources of Bulgarian History, Vol. VII, Page 156, Sofia, From this evidence, it is not sure whether the Tsaritsa was really a Cuman, or she belonged to another tribe that could be described as Scythian. As Veselin Ignatov Ignatov, V., 100 Myths in Bulgarian History, Vol. I, Page 200-201, Sofia (Игнатов, В. 100 мита в българската история, том І, стр. 200-201, София) points out, given the strong relations between the Asen dynasty and the Cumans, her Cuman lineage is the most probable possibility, but not the only one.
The second source mentioning the Tsaritsa was made by Canon Alberih about 1241. He repeated a story that he had heard from a Flemish priest who claimed to have visited the Bulgarian capital of Tarnovo. The priest claimed that the Tsaritsa fell in love with the captive Latin Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople and while her husband was away, she sent the Emperor a love letter, promising that she would help him escape if he took her with him and crown her his Empress. When Baldwin rejected her, she complained to Kaloyan, claiming that the captive Emperor had tried to convince her to help him run away, proposing to wed and crown her. Kaloyan believed her and one night, while drunk, had Baldwin killed in his presence.Latin Sources of Bulgarian History, Vol. IV, Page 182, Sofia, Most historians distrust this source, since the reasons for Baldwin's death are well known and verified by Byzantine and Latin sources: he was killed along with other captives, both Byzantine and Latin, because Kaloyan was angered by the Byzantines breaking their contract with him and joining the Crusaders. Another reason for the historians' distrust of the story is the time of its arising: almost forty years after the events took place, and it was spread in France, not Bulgaria. As Ignatov points out, Alberih himself started the story by elaborating that he did not deliver confirmed data, so it might be just a rumour without any proof and still more, backed up by no logic, since the Bulgarian Tsaritsa wore the crown of a prospering state, she was wife to the victor over Byzantines, Latins, Serbians, and Hungarians, while Baldwin I was defeated, imprisoned, humiliated. She had nothing to gain by sharing his crown - she had her own, and right then, it was worth far more than his.Ignatov, V., 100 Myths in Bulgarian History, Vol. I, Page 200-201, Sofia (Игнатов, В. 100 мита в българската история, том І, стр. 203-204, София)
The birth year of the Tsaritsa and the name that she was given at birth are not known, but it seems likely that with a view to her marriage to Kaloyan, she converted to Christianity and adopted the name Anna.Duichev, I., Bulgarian Middle Ages, Page 319, Sofia (Дуйчев, И. Българското Средновековие, стр. 319, София) After Kaloyan's death in 1207, she married his nephew and successor Boril of Bulgaria and that fact, combined with the probable Cuman idenitity of Kaloyan's supposed murderer, Manastur, encouraged many historians, especially those from the end of 19th and the first half of 20th century, to believe that together with Boril, she was part of a conspiracy that took her husband's life.Zlatarsky, V. History of the Bulgarian State through the Middle Ages, Page 260-261, Sofia (Златарски, В. История на българската държава през средните векове, стр. 260-261, София) During the last few decades, the idea of the Empress' part in the conspiracy has been accepted with distrust by many historians. Despite the differences in their beliefs about the reasons for Kaloyan's death - a conspiracy of Byzantines and Latins, death by natural reasons - Ivan Duichev, Ivan Bogilov, Genoveva Tzancova-Petkova, and Veselin Ignatov all support the idea that Boril's marriage with the Dowager Tsaritsa was only a way to legalize his coming to the throne. Whatever the truth, to this day there is no evidence connecting the Tsaritsa with Kaloyan's death. 
Like her wedding to Kaloyan, the date of her wedding to Boril is unknown. His ascension to the throne was supported by her compatriots, the Cumans, but a few years later there was a great Cuman riot against him. There is no concrete evidence in the sources, but it is likely that Boril repudiated the Tsaritsa and sent her to monastery where she became a nun and assumed the name Anisia.Pavlov, P. About the role of the Cumans in Bulgarian military history (1186-1241): in Military-Historical Symposium, 1990, №6, page 14-23 Sofia (Павлов, П. За ролята на куманите в българската военна история (1186-1241): във Военноисторически сборник, 1990, №6, стр. 14-23, София) Boril then married a niece of the Latin Еmperor Henry of Flanders. Nothing is known about the Tsaritsa's later life.
The historians have controversial minds about whether she had children by any or both her marriages. Zlatarsky supports the idea that the princess whom Boril gave to the Latin Emperor Henry in marriage was the Tsaritsa's daughter by Kaloyan, and Ignatov believes that she gave a son to Kaloyan. Other historians give her a second daughter, this time by Boril, but nothing is verified for certain this far.
The Cuman Tsaritsa of Bulgaria is widely portrayed in historical novels, always in negative light. One of the most beloved writers of historical fiction, through her novel The Wonder Worker of Thessalonica Fani Popova-Mutafova shaped the minds of her readers that the Tsaritsa was a beautiful, lustful and horrible woman who was passionately in love with Baldwin and rejected by him, led Kaloyan to have him killed. Then, she fell in love for Boril and together they planned and carried out Kaloyan's murder by the hand of Manastur and got married only 40 days after the Tsar's funeral. The author gives her character the Cuman name Tzelguba and because of the popularity of her books, there are many people who truly believe that it is the Tsaritsa's real name. 
In the opera Tsar Kaloyan by Pancho Vladigerov, she is given the Christian name Maria.

[[464 BC Sparta earthquake]]

CATEGORIES: Earthquakes in Greece, 5th-century BC earthquakes, Sparta, Classical Greece

The Sparta earthquake of 464 BC destroyed much of Sparta, a city-state of ancient Greece. Historical sources suggest that the death toll may have been as high as 20,000, although modern scholars suggest that this figure is likely an exaggeration. The earthquake sparked a revolt of the helots, the slave class of Spartan society. Events surrounding this revolt led to an increase in tension between Sparta and their rival Athens and the cancellation of a treaty between them. After the troops of a relief expedition dispatched by conservative Athenians were sent back with cold thanks, Athenian democracy itself fell into the hands of reformers and moved toward a more populist and anti-Spartan policy. Therefore this earthquake is cited by historical sources as one of the key events that led up to the First Peloponnesian War.

Unfortunately, the sound quality of this disc varies (sometimes within a single track) more than it should for a recording of this vintage, and the disc's 35-minute length is another annoyance. But the weight of great performances by Adderley, Silver and the infallible Clarke/Chambers axis, combined with the disc's attractive price, make it a solid value. Highly recommended".Anderson, R.

Bethune's Gully is notable geological feature of northern Dunedin, in the South Island of New Zealand. It is located close to the suburb of Normanby towards the northern end of North East Valley. It preserves a number of acres of very old-growth forest and a large stand of exotic Douglas fir, and is an ecosystem directly below the cloud forest on the upper slopes of Mount Cargill. The gully was formed by the upper reaches of Lindsay Creek, a tributary of the Water of Leith which flows along North East Valley.
The gully is surrounded by a [tpl]convert|86|ha|acre|adj=on[/tpl] reserve and recreational area at the start of walking and trail-biking tracks which lead up the slopes of Mount Cargill, [tpl]convert|2.5|km|mi[/tpl] to the north. The most notable of these is a 2-hour round trip walk which leads to the Cargill's summit, a rise of [tpl]convert|580|m|ft[/tpl], which was opened in 1981.Hamel, A. (2007) Dunedin tracks and trails. Dunedin: Silver Peaks Press. ISBN 978-0-473-13772-4. pp 5.14-15
In 1996 Bethune's Gully was the venue for the New Zealand national mountain-biking championships. Biking tracks were extended after the championships and were opened to the public in 2003. Nearby Forrester Park, on Norwood Street, is home to the city's main BMX circuit.
The reserve was named for David Bethune, who took over the property in 1878, setting up a sawmill and brick kiln. The property fell into disuse after it was sold by Bethune, only to be redeveloped by J. B. Thompson immediately after World War I and leased to the Dunedin City Council. It became city property after Thompson's death in 1955.Herd, J. and Griffiths, G.J. (1980) Discovering Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe. ISBN 0-86868-030-3. p. 31
The Gully is reached by Cluny Street, a short paved road off Normanby's Norwood Street, beyond which Norwood Street passes through a narrow cutting before emerging in open countryside.

Operation Whirlwind ([tpl]lang-hr|Operacija Vihor[/tpl])[tpl]harvnb|CIA|2002|p=225[/tpl] was a failed Croatian Army  (HV) offensive in the Banovina region of Croatia, fought from 11–13 December 1991, during the early stages of the Croatian War of Independence. The offensive employed a single infantry brigade as the main attacking force, supported by a bridging unit and a handful of tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Although the offensive met hardly any resistance in its initial stage, achieving tactical surprise, the operation was poorly planned, supported and executed as a result of limited training and combat experience. The offensive established a short-lived bridgehead, evacuated in panic two days after the operation commenced, under tank and mortar fire from the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) deployed north of Glina.
The operation was criticised for its poor planning and execution, insufficient preparation, reconnaissance and training, and inappropriate command and control methods applied by the Sisak Operational Group in charge of the offensive. It also lacked clear objectives. Afterwards, Croatian military authorities investigated the offensive, but found that there was very little written documentation, including written unit-level orders, pertaining to the operation. That led Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo to conclude that the offensive was not formally authorised. The formal investigation did not specifically charge anyone with the failures, simply specifying the problems observed instead.

[[Condor of Bermuda]]

Condor of Bermuda was a maxi yacht campaigning under the leadership and funding of London based international businessman Bob Bell. Originally called Condor but renamed Heath's Condor for the 1977-78 Whitbread Round the World Race (see Volvo Ocean Race) after Bell's association with Heath's Insurance Co (London). There is no link with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath of Morning Cloud yachting fame. Condor was then later renamed Condor of Bermuda, as government policy in the UK during the 1970s effectively exiled the financing of such a campaign by making the funding and domiciling of such an endeavour from the home countries a practical impossibility.
Condor of Bermuda is a polished mahogany race boat; and is often confused with its successor, Condor (sometimes referred to as Condor II (shown in top photo at right), which was of Kevlar and composite construction, and slightly larger, due to IOR rule changes. The two boats were colloquially known as The Grand Piano and Plastic Condor  or the Brown Bus  by those who had sailed on both.

A bamboo bicycle is a bicycle with a frame made out of bamboo.  Custom built and manufactured bamboo bikes have become something of a trend, with producers in the United States, Asia and Africa.Smooth rides for Bangkok's first bamboo bike owner, CNNGo, Greg Jorgensen, 2 September 2010  
Some of the main features of bamboo designs are vibration damping,[tpl]cite web | title = Calfee Design: Bamboo bike | url = http://www.calfeedesign.com/bamboo.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100521074250/http://www.calfeedesign.com/bamboo.htm| archivedate= 21 May 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] crash tolerance, and the natural look of the bike. Vibration damping is one of the most desirable features of such bikes. A bamboo bicycle can offer a very smooth and comfortable ride.  As a consequence, bamboo has been made into road bicycles, mountain bikes, and racing bicycles.
Bamboo is also considered by some to be a more eco-friendly material than other more conventional frame materials.[tpl] cite web | author = Jen Lukenbill | title = Bamboo bikes | publisher = AboutMyPlanet | url = http://www.aboutmyplanet.com/environment/bamboo-bikes | accessdate = 2010-05-16 [/tpl]

Thomas Grenville (4 April 1719 – 3 May 1747[tpl]Ref_label|A|a|none[/tpl]) was an officer of the Royal Navy and Member of Parliament for Bridport. He saw service during the War of the Austrian Succession.
Born into a politically well-connected family, Thomas Grenville rose quickly through the naval ranks to his first commands during the War of the Austrian Succession. A fortunate encounter while in his first command brought him a valuable prize, while political influence ensured he received prime postings. He was to have gone on an independent cruise early in 1747, but the requirements of the service meant that he was instead attached to the fleet in the Atlantic under George Anson. Anson came across a French fleet under the Marquis de la Jonquière, off Cape Finisterre and attacked them in the Battle of Cape Finisterre. He won a decisive victory, but Grenville was among the casualties, having been wounded in the leg, and subsequently dying of his injuries after a few hours. His body was returned to England for burial, and a memorial was raised to his memory by his relative, at Stowe House.

CATEGORIES: 19th-century British painters, 20th-century British painters, Art copyists, 1852 births, 1929 deaths, Patrons of art

Christiana Jane Herringham  (Lady Herringham) (1852–1929) was a British artist, copyist, and art patron. She is noted for her part in establishing the National Art Collections Fund in 1903 to help preserve Britain's artistic heritage.
She was the daughter of Thomas Wilde Powell, a wealthy patron of the Arts and Crafts Movement. In 1880 she married the physician Wilmot Herringham, (later Sir Wilmot Herringham) with whom she had two sons. She was committed to women's suffrage from 1889 onwards.
A talented artist and copyist of Old Masters, she dedicated herself to the revival of tempera painting, translating Cennino Cennini's 15th century treatise Il libro dell' arte o trattato della pittura in 1899 and founding the Society of Painters in Tempera in 1901.
She provided the money that launched the National Art Collections Fund in 1903 and served as the only woman on the NACF's first executive committee. She later  assisted  in founding the India Society, which encouraged respect and appreciation for Indian artistic traditions.
As part of her work for the India Society, she travelled to India in 1906 and 1911 and made copies 
of  the Buddhist cave paintings at Ajanta near Hyderbad, which were deteriorating badly. Among the visitors who observed her work was William Rothenstein. An exhibition of the copies opened at the Crystal Palace in London in June 1911. Herringham, however, had begun to suffer from delusions of pursuit and persecution and was admitted to an asylum. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.
Her biographer Mary Lago suggests Christiana Herringham may have been the inspiration for Mrs Moore in E.M. Forster's novel A Passage to India.

]]
The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra (MSSO) was founded in 1943 by  the Kremlin and is one of the five oldest concert orchestras in Russia.
Lev Steinberg the Peoples Artist of USSR and conductor of the Bolshoi Theatre, became the MSSO first Chief Conductor, a post he held until his death in 1945. He was succeeded by a series of distinguished Soviet musical giants that has included Nikolai Anosov (1945 – 1950) and Leo Ginzburg(1950 – 1954), Mikhail Terian (1954 – 1960) and Veronica Dudarova (1960 – 1989). Owing to the collaboration with such figures the orchestra became one of most prominent national symphonic ensembles, but in the first place it was known by the performances of Russian and Soviet classical music, involving many premieres of Nikolai Myaskovsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Reinhold Gliere.  
The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra becomes renowned around the globe under the leadership of  Pavel Kogan. In 1989 Maestro was engaged as Music Director and Chief Conductor and immediately enriched the orchestra repertoire by the works of European and American musical literature. 
A landmark of the MSSO has been to present the grandiose monographic cycles of complete symphonic works of the greatest composers: Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, R. Strauss, Mendelssohn, Mahler, Bruckner, Sibelius, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Glazunov, Rachmaninov, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Scriabin, Berlioz, Debussy, and Ravel. The orchestra wide-ranging programs balance great orchestral, operatic, and choral classics with equally significant music of the 21st century, lots of many forgotten and neglected pieces.
It plays some 100 concerts annually. Along with the series in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory and in Tchaikovsky Concert Hall, the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra performs in the Great Hall of the Saint-Petersburg D.D. Shostakovich Philharmonic Society and at the stages of the other Russian cities, as well as on tours abroad. The MSSO constantly appears in 59 countries, holding the major musical centers of the world, such as USA, Great Britain, Japan, Spain, Austria, Italy, Germany, France, South Korea, Australia, China and Switzerland.
The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra also has a long and distinguished recording history with DVD and CD studio and live recordings, TV and radio broadcast. In 1990 the “Pioneer” made a live recording of Tchaikovsky’ piano and violin concertos, performed by the MSSO and Maestro Kogan (soloists – Aleksey Sultanov, Maxim Vengerov). In the beginning of 90th the Russian television released the documentary “Travels with the orchestra” about the MSSO and Pavel Kogan tour in Europe and Saint-Petersburg. Widely known and enjoy wide popularity the Rachmaninov cycle, released by “Alto” – the MSSO and P. Kogan interpretations of the composer’s all symphonies and “Symphonic Dances” has led the lists of all present versions.
Also the MSSO takes a legitimate pride in its cooperation with eminent conductors and soloists especially with Evgeny Svetlanov, Kirill Kondrashin, Aleksandr Orlov, Natan Rahlin, Samuil Samosud, Valery Gergiev, David Oistrakh, Emil Gilels, Leonid Kogan, Vladimir Sofronitsky, Sergei Lemeshev, Ivan Kozlovsky, Svyatoslav Knushevitskyi, Sviatoslav Richter, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniil Shafran and Angela Georgiu.

The Oppidum d’Altimurium, also known as the Oppidum Murviel-les-Montpellier, is an ancient hill-town (or oppidum) near the village of Murviel-lès-Montpellier, France, located between Montpellier and Béziers.
The site, which overlooks the Montpellier garrigue at 190m altitude and covers about 20 hectares, is one of the largest hill forts in the region, on par with those of Ensérune or Ambrussum.Oppidum d’Altimurium, decouverte34.com
It was founded in the 2nd century BC, and was protected by a 1st-century BC wall almost 2 km long. The city was divided into two zones: the upper town atop the hill and the lower town on the slopes, down almost to the present town of Murviel-les-Montpellier. 
The Roman monumental area, located between the upper town and lower town of the oppidum, contains a square 75m long, rooms built against the hill, 2 large porches arranged on each side of the square, and a large building of the Corinthian order which was probably a temple. 
Much of the site is now protected and is open to the public as a major historical site in the Montpellier region.  In 2009, excavations were still in progress.  An archaeological museum with some artifacts from the site is located in Murviel-les-Montpellier.

Before the war Wiatr studied Law and Economics at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, where he became active in youth organizations associated with the Ludowcy (agrarian) movement. Between 1937 and 1939 he was the chief of the SL in Nowy Sącz. He helped to organize a farmer's strike in the Beskidy region, for which he was arrested and imprisoned at Bereza Kartuska for six weeks, along with other political activists.
He was one of the commanders of the organization "Chłostra" (an acronym of Chłopska Straż - Peasants' Guard). 
From 1941 until 1945 he was the commander of the VI Region of the BCh in Małopolska and Silesia, and was active in the organization SL-Roch (the wartime successor of People's Party). After the merger between BCh and the Polish Home Army (AK) (within which, BCh retained its own officers and command structure) he was the second in command of the Kraków Region of the AK.
After the formation of the communist Polish Committee of National Liberation "Lublin Committee" and the subsequent political takeover of Poland by the communists, Wiatr issued an order to members of his organization (order No. 186) in which he recommended against SL and BCh members joining the structures of the new communist authorities. Because of the persecution directed at the former members of the anti-Nazi underground by the communist authorities, Narcyz decided to stay partially underground and did not "reveal" himself to the local secret police office.
Narcyz Wiatr was murdered in Planty Park, in Kraków by members of the Myślenice communist secret police (UB), most likely on the orders of UB chief Stanisław Radkiewicz.Ryszard Terlecki, "Miecz i Tarcza Komunizmu. Historia aparatu bezpieczenstwa w Polse, 1944-1990" (Sword and Shield of Communism. A history of the Polish security services, 1944-1990), Wydawnictwo Literackie, Krakow, 2007, pg. 62 At the time it was claimed that Wiatr had been killed by "unknown perpetrators". and no investigation into his murder was conducted.
In 1990 the Krakow office of the Institute of National Remembrance, charged with investigating historical crimes by Nazis and communists in Poland, began an official investigation into his death. In 1996, Stanisław Paryła, who had been an agent of the Krakow communist secret police in 1945 and participated in the shooting during which Wiatr was killed, was charged with murder. Because of the ill health of the accused, the trial was postponed.

Fort Platte was a stronghold and trading post established by Lancaster Lupton that was active between 1840 and 1846."The Five Forts – Fort Lupton, Fort Jackson, Fort St.Vrain, Fort Vasquez and Fort Platte". The fort competed with Fort Laramie which was only one mile away and quickly surpassed it due to a superior supply system. In 1842, due to economic losses, Lupton had to sell the fort and it was bought by the successful fur trading firm Pratte and Cabanné who managed it from 1843 to 1845. In 1845, Pratte and  Cabanné moved operations to Fort Bernard to try to capture traffic traveling west on the Oregon Trail before it reached Fort Laramie.[tpl]cite book|title=The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840-60|last=Unruh|first=John|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-252-06360-2|pages=250[/tpl] 
The fort was described by Rufus B. Sage in his 1846 book Rocky Mountain Life:"Fort Laramie Photos".
 
 Fort Platte, being next to Fort Hall, the most important point on the route to Oregon, calls for a brief description. This post occupies the left bank of the North Fork of Platte river, three-fourths of a mile above the mouth of Laramie, in lat. 42o 20' 13" west from Greenwich and stands upon the direct waggon road to Oregon via South Pass. 
 It is situated in the immediate vicinity of the Oglallia and Brule divisions of the Sioux nation, and but little remote from the Cheyennes and Arapaho tribes. Its structure is a fair specimen of most of the establishments employed in the Indian trade.  Its walls are "adobies," (sun-baked brick,) four feet thick, by twenty high -- enclosing an area of two hundred and fifty feet in length, by two hundred broad. At the northwest and southwest corners are bastions which command its approaches in all directions.  
  Within the walls are some twelve buildings in all, consisting as follows: Office, store, warehouse, meat-house, smith's shop, carpenter's shop, kitchen, and five dwellings, -- so arranged as to form a yard and corel, sufficiently large for the accommodation and security of more than two hundred head of animals. the number of men usually employed about the establishment is some thirty, whose chief duty it is to promote the interests of the trade, and otherwise act as circumstances require.  
 The Fort is located in a level plain, fertile and interesting, bounded upon all sides by hills, many of which present to view the nodding forms of pines and cedars, that bescatter their surface, -- while the river bottoms, at various points, are thickly studded with proud growths of cottonwood, ash, willow, and box-elder, thus affordings its needful supplies of timber and fuel.
 
In 1946, an account stated that the fort was "deserted and ruinous".Phillips, Paul. The Fur Trade, vol. II. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1961. pg. 543

==Biography and career==
End of paragraph.[]

[[Catholic Church and women]]

CATEGORIES: Christianity and women

In the history of the Catholic Church, laywomen and women in religious institutes have played a variety of roles and the church has affected societal attitudes to women throughout the world in significant ways. Women constitute the majority of members of the consecrated life within the Catholic Church: in 2010, there were around 721,935 professed religious women.
Prominent women in the life of the church have included everything from Old Testament figures, to the Virgin Mary and female disciples of Jesus, to theologians, abbesses, monarchs, missionaries, mystics, martyrs, scientists, nurses, hospital administrators, educationalists and religious sisters. Motherhood is given an exalted status within the Catholic faith, with Mary the Mother of Jesus officially known as Queen of Heaven. The special role and devotion accorded to Mary and Marian devotion has been a central theme of Catholic art. Conversely, the role of Eve in the Garden of Eden and other biblical stories affected the development of a Western notion of woman as "temptress".
The Gospels suggest Jesus himself broke with convention to provide religious instruction directly to women. While the Twelve Apostles were all male, and there is much debate about the beliefs of early church leaders like St Paul, women were very active in the early spread of Christianity.  There have been many female saints and many devotions started by women. Medieval abbesses enjoyed considerable power and influence and women have played an important role in Catholicism through convents and abbeys, particularly in the establishment of schools, hospitals, nursing homes and monastic settlements, through religious institutes of nuns or sisters like the Benedictines, Dominicans, Sisters of Saint Francis, Loreto Sisters, Sisters of Mercy, Little Sisters of the Poor, Josephites, and Missionaries of Charity. In the early 21st century, the largest of all religious institutes for women was the Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco with around 14,000 members. Religious vocations for women have been declining in Europe, Oceania and America. They have increased in Asia and Africa.
Through its support for institutionalised learning, the Catholic church produced many of the world's first great women scientists and scholars - including the physicians Trotula of Salerno (11th century) and  Dorotea Bucca (d 1436), the philosopher Elena Piscopia (d 1684) and the mathematician Maria Agnesi (d 1799). Four women are honoured as Doctors of the Church: German mystic Hildegard of Bingen, Spanish mystic, Teresa of Ávila; Italian mystic Catherine of Siena and the French nun Thérèse de Lisieux. Other Catholic women have risen to international prominence through charitable mission works and social justice campaigns—as with hospitals pioneer St Marianne Cope, Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa, or anti-death penalty campaigner Sister Helen Prejean.
The Church has influenced the status of women in various ways: condemning infanticide, divorce, incest, polygamy and counting the marital infidelity of men as equally sinful to that of women.[tpl]cite book |last=Bokenkotter |first= Thomas |year=2004 |title=A Concise History of the Catholic Church |publisher=Doubleday |ISBN=0-385-50584-1 |page=56[/tpl]Noble, p. 230.Stark, p. 104. The Church holds abortion and contraception to be sinful, thus affecting the reproductive practices of women. The role of women in the Church has become a controversial topic in Catholic social thought.[tpl]cite book |title=The Catholic imagination in American literature |first=Ross |last= Labrie |publisher=University of Missouri Press |year=1997 |page=12 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ao93kXVL1IIC&dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+%22role+of+women%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] Christianity's overall effect on women is a matter of historical debate—it rose out of patriarchal societies but offered a lessening of the gulf between men and women. The institution of the convent has offered a space for female self-government, power and influence through many centuries. Nevertheless, according to some modern critiques, the Church's largely male hierarchy and refusal to ordain women implies "inferiority" of women. New feminism and Feminist theology deal extensively with Catholic attitudes to women.

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Padua, Synagogues in Italy, 16th-century synagogues, Baroque synagogues

The Italian Synagogue of Padua is the only synagogue still in use of the several that flourished in the university town of Padua from the Renaissance through World War II.
The Italian Synagogue was built in 1584.Sacerdoti, Annie, Guide to Jewish Italy, Rizzoli, New York, 2003, 2004 English edition, pp. 74-7Brandes, Francesca, Venice and Environs, Jewish Places, history and art, 1997, Marsilio, New York, Jewish Padua, pp. 56-75
The synagogue underwent renovation and/or restoration in 1581, 1631, 1830, and 1865.  It was closed in 1892 when the community built a modern synagogue, but reopened after the war because in 1943 fascists burned the modern synagogue.
The synagogue is located at 9 Via San Martino and Solferino in the historic ghetto.  It is in the same building as the offices of the Jewish community of Padua.  Students visiting the university are welcome to pray with the congregation.  Visitors can see the synagogue by contacting the Jewish community.
The baroque synagogue measures 18 by 7 meters.  As is usual in Italian synagogues, the Bimah and Torah Ark are located at opposite sides of the room, with the space in between left vacant to accommodate the processional.  What is unusual about the synagogue at Padua is that the Ark and Bimah are placed on the synagogues's long walls.  
The baroque, sixteenth century Torah Ark is made from the wood of a plane tree that was struck down by lightning in the University's famous botanical garden.  It features gilded doors, four Corinthian columns made of black marble with white veining, and carved foliage.  The balduchin is in the form of a broken pediment.
The "majestic" Bimah is reached by a curved flight of eight steps  on each side.  It features an octagonal  balduchin supported by four columns and four pilasters (two projecting form the wall.)  The Corinthian capitals of the pillars and pilasters are gilded.  Elaborate baroque carvings surmount the balduchin.
The ceiling is coffered and painted. The area between the Torah Ark and Bimah is a coffered barrel vault, with large, heavily-carved baroque rosettes in each recess.
The historic women's gallery is upstairs. Today, the synagogue has a women's section on the main floor.

[[Authorship of the Petrine epistles]]
CATEGORIES: Biblical authorship debates, Peter the Apostle, Canonical epistles, Petrine-related books

The authorship of the Petrine epistles (First and Second Peter) is an important question in biblical criticism, parallel to that of the authorship of the Pauline epistles, since scholars have long sought to determine who were the exact authors of the New Testament letters. Most scholars today conclude that Peter was not the author of the two epistles that are attributed to him and that they were written by two different authors.Old Testament in the New, Steven Moyise, p. 116'Most scholars believe that 1 Peter is pseudonymous (written anonymously in the name of a well-known figure) and was produced during postapostolic times.' Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 352'Virtually no authorities defend the Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, which is believed to have been written by an anonymous churchman in Rome about 150 C.E.'

CATEGORIES: Army divisions of the Soviet Union, Military units and formations established in 1990, Military units and formations disestablished in 2009

The 127th Order of Kutuzov Second Degree Machine-Gun Artillery Division (127 пулемётно-артиллерийская дивизия) was a division of the Russian Ground Forces, which traced its history to the 66th Rifle Division of World War II.
The division was originally formed on 14 May 1932 in village Lutkovka-medical in the Veditsky Shmakovsky raion of the Ussuriisk Oblast, Far Eastern Military District, as the 1st or 2nd (sources differ) Collective Farm Division. It was renamed the 66th Rifle Division on 21 May 1936.
The division formed part of the 35th Army of the Independent Coastal Group in the Far East in May 1945. In August 1945 the division, as a part of 1st Far East Front, participated in the Soviet operation against Japan. On 9 August 1945 the division began operations as part of 35th Army,http://niehorster.orbat.com/012_ussr/45-08-08/army_35.html advancing 12 kilometers, having forced the river Sungach in northern Manchuria. The division fought on the Ussuri River at Hotunsky (Хотунского), Mishansky (Мишаньского), Boundary (Пограничного), and Duninsky Ur (Дунинского УР) translation error for Duninsky Fortified Region, capturing the cities of Mishan, Girin, Jantszy, and Harbin. For its valour in combat and courage on 19 September 1945 the 66th Rifle Division was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, Second Degree. Three Hero of the Soviet Union medals, 1266 awards, and 2838 medals were given to the division's personnel.
A year after the war it was reorganised as the 2nd Tank Division, but was renamed again in 1957 as the 32nd Tank Division and in 1965 as the 66th Tank Division.[tpl]cite book |title=The Soviet Army in the Years of the 'Cold War' (1945-1991) |last=Feskov|first=V.I. |author2=K.A.

In May 1981 the division headquarters was relocated to Sergeevka (Сергеевка). Since 1 July 1990 the 277th Motor Rifle Division was reorganised as the 127th Machine Gun Artillery Division. It incorporated the 114th and 130th Machine Gun Artillery Regiments, the 314 мсп, 218th Tank Regiment, 872nd Artillery Regiment, and 1172nd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment.
In mid-2008 the division, under a new commander, Sergey Ryzhkov, replaced some of its former cadre units with higher-readiness units.http://www.soldat.ru/forum/?gb=3&id=61960, 7 April 2008 A regiment arrived from Sergeevka and two regiments of constant readiness from Kamen-Rybolov (438th Motor Rifle Regiment?) on the western shore of Khanka Lake, and Ussuriysk (the 231st Motor Rifle Regiment). These changes effectively made the division a motor rifle formation though its designation was still that of a static defence formation.
In 2009, as part of the Russian Ground Forces' transition to brigades, the division appears to have been reorganised as the 59th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade (с. Сергеевка, Primorsky Krai), from the main body of the division, equipped with BMPs, and the 60th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade (п. Lipovtsy, Primorsky Krai), from the 218th Tank Regiment of the division, also equipped with BMPs.specnaz.pbworks.com, accessed October 2009

It focuses on the environment, especially in China, although it has an interest in environment and sustainability issues around the world.
It features articles by Chinese and non-Chinese authors from a variety of perspectives. These include an interview with former US vice-president Al Gorehttp://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/413--A-challenge-to-our-moral-imagination- and Chinese economist Hu Angang. Other contributors include Pan Yue who was named New Statesman Person of the Year 2007 and a rising figure in Chinese government circles who is championing a green China, and Ma Jun a leading Chinese environmentalist named by Time magazine as one of its 100 most important people in 2006.
It has adopted a web 2.0 approach, which gives user-generated comment a key place in the site, and sees the use of RSS feeds, Creative Commons material, and news briefs and links collected from varied sources across the net.
Its tagline is "China and the world discuss the environment".
BBC Radio 4's Sheena McDonald said on the Talking Politics programme on December 23, 2006, that the site was the only fully bilingual website in English and Chinese focusing on the environment in the world. She interviewed editor Isabel Hilton, who at the time was also editor of openDemocracy, who said that the aim of the site was to foster a dialogue which might otherwise be defeated by language barriers. 
It shares a similarity in construction and ethos with China Digital Times, which is run by the China Internet Project at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley.

Abraham ('Appie') Bueno de Mesquita (Amsterdam, July 23, 1918 — Lelystad, August 19, 2005), commonly known under his stage name Bueno de Mesquita was a Dutch comedian, actor and stage artist, well known for his ability to make funny faces.
His comical talents literally saved his life. In World War II, the (Sephardi) Jewish Bueno de Mesquita was imprisoned in the Dossin Barracks in Mechelen, Belgium, and was scheduled to be deported to Auschwitz. However, the camp commander was looking for musicians. His ability to even play a one string cello combined with his mimical talents saved him.
Bueno de Mesquita was one of the first television artists, as early as 1952, Bueno de Mesquita appeared on television as a comedian. In the 1960s, he made many shows with Rita Corita, both on television, and in theaters. In 1968, he started working with Rudi Carrell on German television, which he continued doing for 13 seasons. Since his name was hard to pronounce for many Germans, in Germany, he was known as the small one, with the moustache. He has stated that his success in making Germans laugh sometimes felt as a small revenge.
Beside working with Rita Corita and Rudi Carrell, he also worked a lot with the Mounties, both on television and the theaters.
Bueno de Mesquita has written an autobiography, Cello met één snaar (Cello with one string).
Bueno de Mesquita died in the night from August 18 to August 19, 2005, in his hometown Lelystad, aged 87, after a long battle with lung cancer and brain tumor.

[[The Literature of Australian Birds]]
CATEGORIES: 1954 books, Published bibliographies, Ornithological literature, Books about Australian natural history, Books about Australian history

The Literature of Australian Birds is a book published in 1954 by Paterson Brokensha in Perth, Western Australia.  Its full title is The Literature of Australian Birds: A History and a Bibliography of Australian Ornithology.  It was authored by Hubert Massey Whittell.  It is in large octavo format (252 x 184 mm) and contains some 900 pages, two separately paginated parts bound in one volume in brown buckram.  It contains a coloured frontispiece (Plate 1) of a drawing of the Superb Lyrebird by Lieutenant-General Thomas Davies from 1799, with another 31 black-and-white plates bound between Parts 1 and 2.
Part 1, titled “A History of Australian Ornithology 1618 to 1850”, is 116 pages in length.  It covers the period from the exploratory Dutch voyages of the early 17th century to the voyages of HMS Fly and HMS Rattlesnake during 1842-1850.  Much the larger part of the book, however, lies in the 788 pages of Part 2, titled “A Bibliography of Australian Ornithology 1618 to 1950, with Biographies of Authors, Collectors and Others”, where Whittell has attempted to be exhaustively comprehensive in compiling mentions of Australian birds, not only from the scientific literature but also from newspapers, magazines and other published sources, and including potted biographies of their authors.  The two parts of the book are dedicated separately, Part 1: "To D.L.S. in Appreciation of our long Association in Australian Ornithology", and Part 2: "In Memoriam. GREGORY MACALISTER MATHEWS C.B.E.. A Pioneer Bibliographer of the Literature of Australian Birds. OBIT 1947."Whittell (1954).
A facsimile edition was published by Oak Knoll Press in 1993 (ISBN 1888262680).  In 1995 the Bird Observers Club of Australia (BOCA) published BOCA Report Number 6 – “Whittell (1618-1950) Supplemented. Additions and Emendations to H.M. Whittell’s The Literature of Australian Birds”, compiled by Tess Kloot.  In the preface to this latter work Kloot comments, with regard to Whittell:
 ”In his monumental work, The Literature of Australian Birds, (Paterson Brokensha Pty Ltd, 1954), the late Major H. M. Whittell paid tribute to those who went before him : In 1925 Gregory M. Mathews issued, as a supplement to his Birds of Australia, a bibliography of books and articles studied in the preparation of his work, plus brief biographical notes on the authors; and in 1935 Anthony Musgrave published his Bibliography of Australian Entomology 1775-1930. In turn, I can do no better than pay tribute to Major Whittell. With his book constantly before me as I worked, I never ceased to wonder at his exhaustive research and meticulous attention to detail. It is indeed a remarkable achievement. I offer this modest contribution (and later, A Bio-bibliography of Australian Ornithology: 1951-1975) in the hope that others who come after me will build upon my work.”Kloot (1995).

Colm O'Neill (born 1964 in Midleton, County Cork) is a former Irish sportsperson. He played Gaelic football and hurling with his local club Midleton and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county football team from 1984 until 1991.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/Cork/Profile.aspx|title=Cork Hurling Profile|publisher=www.hoganstand.com|date=|accessdate=2009-03-25[/tpl]
He won an All-Ireland Minor Football Championship medal in 1981 scoring three goals in Cork's victory over a spirited Derry side which had a lot of players who would claim senior medals in 1993.
O'Neill won two All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship medals in 1984 and 1985. He was at corner forward in the rebels unsuccessful All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final against Meath in 1987 and came on as a substitute the following year (1988) against the same opposition when again the rebel county fell to  Meath by a single point. In 1989 he was part of the team that won the All Ireland beating Mayo in the final.
1990 was by far O'Neill's best year, though the year ended on a low note when he was sent off by referee Paddy Russell for striking Meath's full back Mick Lyons in the All Ireland final. This denied O'Neill a certain All Star and a Player of the Year nomination.
In 1991 O'Neill retired after a shock defeat to Kerry in the Munster Senior Football Championship semi-final.
He currently is living in the United States as a very successful publican.

(1973), p. 237. but was increasingly distressed by the personal rivalries among the individual members, which constantly undermined the academy's dedication to collective research.

CATEGORIES: Subdivisions of Albania, Historical regions in Albania

Bajraku (plural Bajrakut) was a military unit and later an administrative land division created in some provinces of historical Albania which also included what is today Kosovo. It was a patriarchal organization, similar to a commune or small district today.
The Bajrakut of Oštrozub was one of the largest of Kosovo and Albania. It is believed that it formed as an administrative unit in the mountainous area of Lapušnica which was not controlled directly by the Ottoman government due to its location so was given privileges. The  Bajrakut of Oštrozub is believed to have been formed sometime in the mid-17th century based on Oštrozub which today is a village in the municipality of Mališevo.
The Bajrakut of Oštrozub also was popularly known as Bajrakut Kapakli in reference to the warfare conducted by fighters in the region against the Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish war.
The Bajrakut of Oštrozub included about 43 villages in southern and central Lapušnica and southern Drenica and these are:

CATEGORIES: 1963 births, Living people, American male film actors

Chris Pedersen (born 1963) has been a punk guitarist, actor and NASCAR racer.
Pedersen was born in San Francisco and grew up in Southern California.  In 1981 he briefly played guitar for the punk rock band SIN 34.http://www.wegotpowerfilms.com/archives/TheSin34Story.htm
Pedersen was never formally trained as an actor.  He was approached by director Penelope Spheeris at a park in Burbank where the band T.S.O.L. was playing. According to Pedersen, who was unemployed at the time, "I was thinking 'yeah, right' and didn't pay any attention to her until she said it paid $100 a day, which at the time was a lot of money. So I showed up for the audition on time and tried really hard not to screw it up. That was the start of my acting career."  He played a punk rocker in Suburbia, and also appeared in Platoon, Night of the Comet and Point Break among others. 
He began to distance himself from the film industry in the early 1990s, focusing instead on cars and technology. He had a brief racing history competing in weekly NASCAR events at Saugus speedway 1992–1995 and Irwindale Speedway in 2000.  He founded and led a self-funded DARPA Grand Challenge team, the "AI Motorvators", whose V8-powered "IT Came From The Garage" finished in the semi-finals in 2004 and 2005; they were featured in an episode of the Discovery Channel show Monster Garage.

CATEGORIES: 311 deaths, Anatolian Roman Catholic saints, Saints from Anatolia, 4th-century Christian martyrs, 4th-century Romans, 4th-century Christian female saints, Year of birth unknown

Saint Dorothy (Dorothea, Dora; [tpl]lang-it|Santa Dorotea[/tpl], [tpl]lang-es|Santa Dorotea[/tpl]; died ca. 311) is a 4th-century virgin martyr who was executed at Caesarea Mazaca. Evidence for her actual historical existence or acta is very sparse. She is called a martyr of the Diocletianic Persecution, although her death occurred after the resignation of Diocletian himself.  She should not be confused with another 4th-century saint, Dorothea of Alexandria.
She and Theophilus are mentioned in the Roman Martyrology as martyrs of Caesarea in Cappadocia, with a feast day on 6 February.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ISBN 88-209-7210-7) She is thus officially recognized as a saint, but because there is scarcely any non-legendary knowledge about her, she is no longer (since 1969) included in the General Roman Calendar.

[[Address constant]]

CATEGORIES: Data types, Primitive types, IBM software, Assembly languages

In IBM System/360 through present day z/Architecture, an address constant or "adcon" is an assembly language data type which contains the address of a location in computer memory. An address constant can be one, two, three or four bytes long, although an adcon of less than four bytes is conventionally used to hold expression for a small integer such as a length, a relative address, or an index value, and does not represent an address at all. Address constants are defined using an assembler language "DC" statement.
Other computer systems have similar facilities, although different names may be used.

[[PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament]]
CATEGORIES: PGA Tour

The PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament, also known as Qualifying School or Q-School, was an annual tournament which was historically the main method by which golfers earned PGA Tour playing privileges, commonly known as a Tour card. Beginning in 2013, Q-School will only grant privileges on the Web.com Tour, the PGA Tour's official developmental circuit. The first tournament was played in 1965.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/2009/qschool/12/07/past.winners/index.html |title=Past champions: PGA Tour National Qualifying Tournament |publisher=PGA Tour |date=December 7, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121026131549/http://www.pgatour.com/2009/qschool/12/07/past.winners/index.html |archivedate=October 26, 2012[/tpl] In several early years, two separate tournaments were played, one in the spring and one in the fall (autumn) (1968–69, 1975–81). The format of the tournament has changed several times, ranging from a 72-hole tournament to a 144-hole tournament. The current format (in place since 1982) is 108 holes over six days in late November/early December. Before 2013, the top 25 players and ties earned their tour cards. The next set of fifty finishers earned full Web.com Tour cards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pgatq.bluegolf.com/bluegolf/pgatq11/event/pgatq1129/agenda.htm?agenda=c08dc961-5bee-4f3c-a192-017f1c1c645c |title=Q-School Finals - Tournament Information |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=September 5, 2013[/tpl] The remaining participants received conditional Web.com Tour status.
The 2012 Qualifying Tournament was the last to grant playing privileges for the PGA Tour. On March 20, 2012, the tour announced radical changes to its season structure and qualifying process,[tpl]cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7714944/pga-tour-changes-schedule-qualifying-process |title=PGA Tour announces changes |work=ESPN.com |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012[/tpl] and announced further details on July 10 of that year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/webcom/news/2012/07/10/tourqualifying.html |title=Web.com impact expanded with qualifying changes |first=John |last=Dell |publisher=PGA Tour |date=July 10, 2012 |accessdate=September 5, 2013[/tpl]
The 2013 season will end with The Tour Championship in September, and the 2014 season will begin the following month. As a result, the Qualifying Tournament will only grant playing privileges on the Web.com Tour (known as the Nationwide Tour at the time of the March 2012 announcement). A new series of four tournaments known as the Web.com Tour Finals, to be held in September, will grant 50 PGA Tour cards to a field consisting of the top 75 on the Web.com Tour money list and the golfers placed 126 to 200 on the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup points list. The top 25 on the Web.com Tour money list before the Finals will receive PGA Tour cards, with total money earned in the Finals determining the remaining 25 card earners.

[[Reverse ferret]]

CATEGORIES: Ferrets, Journalism terminology, Metaphors referring to animals, Metaphors referring to sport

Reverse ferret is a phrase used predominantly within the British media to describe a sudden reversal in an organisation's editorial line on a certain issue. Generally, this will involve no acknowledgement of the previous position.[tpl]Cite news|format=subscription|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4275198.ece|title=Tabloid week: the reverse ferret|last=White|first=Roland|work=The Sunday Times|date=6 July 2008[/tpl]
The term originates from Kelvin MacKenzie's time at The Sun. His preferred description of the role of journalists when it came to public figures was to "stick a ferret up their trousers". This meant making their lives uncomfortable, and was based on the supposed northern stunt of ferret legging (where contestants compete to show who can endure a live ferret within their sealed trousers the longest). However, when it became clear that the tide of public opinion had turned against the paper's line, MacKenzie would burst from his office shouting "Reverse Ferret!"

[[Dynamic Business Modeling]]
CATEGORIES: Information systems, Business software

Dynamic Business Modeling ("DBM") describes the ability to automate business models within an open framework. The independent analyst firm Gartner has recently called Dynamic Business Modeling "critical for BSS solutions to succeed".
Dynamic Business Modeling is based on principles wherein the business logic of an application is managed independently from the application servers that automate the services and processes defined in the business logic. Business modeling and integration (which itself is defined as part of the business model) are defined in a business logic layer, allowing underlying application servers to be business logic agnostic and therefore need no business driven customization. DBM applied correctly should reduce both the cost and risk in the initial implementation and its future evolution of systems.
Previous generations of IT systems (from 1990 to approximately 2001) were designed to address specific business models and regulatory practices and no value was given to logic–infrastructure segregation.  These systems provided value by automating predefined business models (commonly referred to as "off-the-shelf").  As a result, they implicitly drove business strategy where DBM states that they should be driven by it.  By being "predefined" they do not:
Dynamic Business modeling is suited for open automation of strategy-driven business models. By removing the need for customization of core application servers it is postulated as more cost efficient, rapidly deployed and evolveable. Dynamic Business Modeling was initially described (though applied much earlier in practice) by Doug Zone at MetraTech Corp. in reference to the billing segment of the enterprise software market.  "Service Oriented Applications" (also known as "service based applications") coined by IBM describe potential methodologies to achieve DBM.

He has performed in distinguished concert series throughout the world, having made appearances in New York's Carnegie Hall, Concertgebouw Amsterdam, the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow, the Shanghai Conservatory, Madrid's Auditorio Nacional, Palau in Barcelona, recitals at the Ravinia and Gilmore International Festivals in Chicago, La Roque-d'Anthéron Festival in France and the Konzerthaus in Berlin.
He has been a frequent prize-winner at competitions, including First Prize and Gold Medal at the 42nd International Competition Premio Jaén de Piano; First Prize at the 8th International Piano Competition Fundación Jacinto e Inocencio Guerrero; and was a prize-winner at the 14th International Competition Vianna da Motta in Lisbon.
Javier Perianes has worked with leading conductors including Lorin Maazel, Daniel Barenboim, Zubin Mehta, Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos, Jesús López Cobos, Antoni Wit, Daniel Harding and Vasily Petrenko. Recent and forthcoming highlights include appearances with the Israel Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, including a performance at the Lucerne Festival, the New World Symphony conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, the London Philharmonic and Sao Paulo Symphony with Eduardo Portal, Tokyo Symphony Orchestra with Hiroshi Kodama, Warsaw Philharmonic, as well as recitals in Tokyo, Madrid’s Scherzo series, the Zurich Tonhalle and at the Moscow December Nights Festival.
Perianes has received critical acclaim for his recordings on Harmonia Mundi of Schubert's Impromptus and Klavierstücke, Manuel Blasco de Nebra’s keyboard sonatas and Mompou’s Música Callada. In September 2011 he released on this label a disc devoted to the music for piano by Manuel de Falla, including a live recording of Nights in the Gardens of Spain with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Josep Pons.
Quote from the Michael Kennedy of the Sunday Telegraph regarding his Schubert CD (Harmonia Mundi):
"This young Spanish pianist proves himself a natural Schubertian in the Impromptus (D 899). He is beautifully recorded so that his playing can be fully appreciated. The disc also includes the Klavierstücke (D 946) and the less well-known Allegretto in C minor (D 915), a wonderful piece all the more compelling for being understated. Perianes's playing captures its magic to perfection."Sunday Telegraph (Schubert: Impromptus, Allegretto Harmonia Mundi HMI 987080) - Feb 2008

CATEGORIES: Broadcast engineering

Wayne deck is a term used by video engineers to describe a backup program video record deck.
A Wayne deck is dedicated to recording the on-air program in addition to the standard program record decks installed.  Long tapes (often DVCAM 184min) are run in the Wayne deck to avoid frequent tape changes.
The term has become standard among event and corporate video engineers since 2001.   It is named after a video engineer Wayne Stockton based in Phoenix, Arizona.  Due to an undetected audio board failure in a Sony Betacam SP recorder, Wayne unfortunately recorded the video without any audio, rendering the program tape useless.  Event production companies started adding an extra video record deck in addition to the ones ordered by the clients as a safety record.

[[Hot chicken]]
CATEGORIES: American cuisine, Chicken dishes, Cuisine of the Southern United States, Culture of Nashville, Tennessee

Hot chicken or Nashville hot chicken is a type of fried chicken that is a local specialty of Nashville, Tennessee, in the United States. In its typical preparation, it is a portion of breast, thigh, or wing that has been marinated in buttermilk, breaded, sauced using a paste that has been heavily spiced with cayenne pepper, and pan-fried. It is served atop slices of white bread with pickle chips. It is both the application of a spicy paste and the presentation that differentiates it from similar dishes, such as Buffalo wings. It can be viewed in similar context to other foods that have been tweaked to be unique in a regional way, such as the slugburger or the Mississippi Delta tamale.
There are many restaurants in Nashville that serve a variant of the dish, and there is a city-wide festival and competition commemorating it.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.musiccityhotchickenfestival.com/ |title=Music City Hot Chicken Festival |work=Musiccityhotchickenfestival.com |accessdate=May 16, 2013[/tpl] The popularity of hot chicken has spread beyond the Southern United States due to the influence of Nashville's music industry.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.slashfood.com/2009/05/26/hot-chicken-what-the-heck-is-it |title=Hot Chicken - What the Heck is It? |work=Slashfood.com |first=Hanna |last=Raskin |date=May 26, 2009 |accessdate=May 16, 2013[/tpl] At least one restaurant in Michigan, Zingerman's Roadhouse in Ann Arbor, now serves the dish.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zingermansroadhouse.com/2008/02/26/nashville-hot-fried-chicken-tuesdays/ |title=Nashville Hot Fried Chicken Tuesdays! |work=ZingermansRoadhouse.com |first=Ari |last=Weinzweig |date=February 26, 2008 |accessdate=May 16, 2013[/tpl]

[[Albrecht Matrix Hybrid]]
CATEGORIES: Sports records and statistics

The Matrix Hybrid is a college football rating system that was developed by Scott Albrecht in 2006, and has been revised several times since. The hybrid rating is a compilation of the Matrix-Performance and Matrix-Elo ratings. The Performance rating uses location and point margin to rate teams, and the Elo rating uses location and win/loss outcome. Variations of these ratings also adjust for luck (an exceptional number of turnovers, field goal successes or failures, etc.), how well a team matches up against its opponents, and allow a team's performance to trend over time. 
Both ratings are based on a probabilistic iterative-fitting model. In the Performance rating, point margins are converted into probabilities based on the standard deviation of a team's performance from its "mean". In this case, a probabilistic model gives greater weight to points score in close games. For the Elo rating, probabilistic outcomes of one and zero are assigned to wins and losses, respectively. An iterative method has the distinct advantage when dealing with only wins and losses that a best fit short of infinity can be found for undefeated and winless teams. The Matrix-Elo was inspired by the Chess Elo rating system.

[[TAPAs model checker]]
CATEGORIES: Model checkers

TAPAS is a tool for specifying and analyzing concurrent systems, its aim is to support teaching of process algebras. Systems are described as process algebras terms that are then mapped to Labeled Transition Systems (LTSs). Properties can be verified by checking equivalences between concrete and abstract system descriptions, or by model checking temporal formulas (expressed as μ-calculus or ACTL) over the obtained LTS. A key feature of TAPAs, that makes it particularly suited for teaching, is that it maintains a consistent double representation of each system: both graphical and textual. After a change in the graphic notation, the textual representation is updated immediately, but when a modification concern of the textual notation the updating has to be forced.
In TAPAs, concurrent systems are described by means of processes, which are nondeterministic descriptions of system behaviors, and process systems, which are obtained by process compositions. Notably, processes can be defined in terms of other processes or process systems. Processes and process systems are composed by using the operators of a given process algebra. Currently, in TAPAs, is considered two process algebras: CCSP and PEPA. 
CCSP (= CCS + CSP) is obtained from CCS by considering some operators of CSP. Actually, after creating a CCSP process system, the user can analyze it using:
PEPA (Performance Evaluation Process Algebra) is a stochastic process algebra designed for modeling computer and communication systems introduced by Jane Hillston  in the 1990s. The language extends classical process algebras such as Milner's CCS and Hoare's CSP by introducing probabilistic branching and timing of transitions. Rates are drawn from the exponential distribution and PEPA models are finite-state and so give rise to a stochastic process, specifically a continuous-time Markov process (CTMC). Thus the language can be used to study quantitative properties of models of computer and communication systems such as throughput, utilization and response time as well as qualitative properties such as freedom from deadlock. The language is formally defined using a structured operational semantics in the style invented by Gordon Plotkin. 
TAPAS is the result of a collective work, started up in 1990 with the realization of a tool named JACK by IEI CNR of Pisa and continued by ISTI-CNR of Pisa. The new TAPAs version has been developed at the Dipartimento Sistemi ed Informatica of the University of Florence.

[[Extreme Element]]

CATEGORIES: Sports organisations of the United Kingdom

Extreme Element is a UK-based, online agency for extreme sports. The company was founded in 2006 by Tim Brickle with Al Gosling (CEO Extreme Group). The solely-online extreme sports agent is part of the Extreme Group and trades under the famous ‘EX’ of the Extreme brand. Ex Element operates from Hove, East Sussex and was initially established to cater for a niche in a market that is heavily dominated by generalist’ companies.
The company offers Extreme sport experiences in five different categories: Driving, Water, Air, Earth & Snow. The 1000+ extreme experiences include sports such as Skydiving, Track Driving, Bungee Jumping, Powerboating and many more activities considered to be ‘extreme.’
Extreme Element works on a gift voucher platform; where experiences are purchased and taken inside a defined validity period. In 2007, Extreme Element launched gift cards onto the high street and into the supermarket Sainsbury's, but these are no longer available as of 2009. 'Ex Element' as the company is also known differs from other activity providers in the gift voucher market by offering the option to ‘redeem’ a voucher against any of the sports offered, not just the one sport that the voucher was initially purchased for. Customers could also choose the ‘Ex Pack' up until November 2011, which contained a T-shirt and other merchandise to accompany the voucher.
In 2008, Extreme Element launched ‘Book&Go’, an on-site feature that allows customers to see the particular date or locations that are available for the experience they might be interested in booking. This changed the on site consumer experience for booking activities, as it allowed customers to get last minute bookings and aided activity providers in filling those hard to sell time slots. This booking service is only available with the voucher retailer; exelement.co.uk.
In September 2009, Extreme Element hosted the first annual ‘London Bungee Jump’ which took place next to Tower Bridge, London. The 26th and 27 September 2009 saw a record 297 people plummet 160 ft on the exclusive Bungee jump. The following event in 2010 saw Extreme Element awarded a Guinness World Record for 'The Most Bungee Jumps in 60minutes by One Person. The year 2009 also saw Extreme Element receive a new investor, Pascal Tiemann. The non-executive director brings in-depth experience from previous roles in The Tussauds Group and Legoland amongst others. 
In July 2011, Extreme Element Ltd. (and its assets including www.experiencedays.co.uk) was purchased by Robb Young and Michelle Geib, the owners of American gift company XperienceDays Inc.

From offices in Rooms 22 and 23 of the Watkins Block in Orlando, King designed handsome, dignified buildings, primarily in the Neo-Classical, Spanish Revival, Renaissance Revival and Prairie Style. King is noted for civic buildings of lasting elegance and beauty, the best known of which may be his last completed work, the stately Orange County Courthouse building which is now the headquarters of the Orange County Regional History Center (1927).  Constructed of variegated Indiana limestone from the Clear Creek Quarries of the Indiana Limestone Company,"Stone" Magazine, 1928 the completion of the building was supervised by Murry S. King's son, James B. King.
King was a charter member of the Florida State Association of Architects and served on the Florida State Board of Architecture.EARLY SETTLERS OF ORANGE COUNTY FLORIDA BY C. E. HOWARD, PUBLISHED IN 1915. He was a member of the American Institute of Architects.
King was the recognized leading architect among a group of architectural firms in Orlando in the 1920s.  The others included: Frank L. Bodine, Fred E. Field, Frederick H. Trimble, David Hyer, George E. Krug, Howard M. Reynolds, Ryan and Roberts (Ida Annah Ryan and Isabel Roberts) and Percy P. Turner.  This group of architects was quite intentional about creating in Central Florida a style of architecture that was suited to the region. Here is how they described it in an article from The Florida Circle of May 1924:
"Just as architects of old created styles to harmonize with their environment, so have the architects of Florida been creating, from native motifs, a style that is carefully adapted to the climatic conditions and surroundings of the state. This style has an individuality all its own and should have a fitting name to express its origins . . . The Florida Association of Architects will give a prize of $25.00 for the name selected."  Submissions were to be sent to King; the contest was to conclude in November 1924 and the winning name announced thereafter.[ref]The Florida Circle, Jacksonville, FL, Vol. 1 No. 2, May 1924 
[/ref]
In 1890 Murry S. King married Ruth Ann ("Anna") Riley Dible.  Their children were:  Leroy (1890), Florence (1893), James B. (1894), Murry Jr (1896), Merrit (1896),  and Edward (1901),  Pearl (1903), all of whom were born in Pennsylvania.  His son, James B. King entered into his architectural practice in the mid-1920s.Orlando Telephone directory - Winter-Spring 1927-8
Mr. King's first name appears both as "Murry" and "Murray" in contemporary sources and in Orlando histories.  It is spelled "Murray" in contemporary references such as his business listing in many issues of The Winter Park Post and Orlando telephone directories, as well as the excellent photograph and brief biographical sketch of "Murray S. King" available at the following:  http://www.cfhf.net/orlando/people/king.htm   However, a photograph of downtown Orlando with the sign outside his office, recently found by Orlando historians Joy Wallace Dickinson and Rick Kilby, shows the spelling as "Murry".
Murry S. King died in Orlando on Sep. 20, 1925.  He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, Orlando, Florida.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=king&GSfn=murry&GSbyrel=all&GSdyrel=all&GSst=11&GScntry=4&GSob=n&GRid=24363124&df=all&

Did You See...? was a long-running British television review programme which began on the BBC2 in 1980. The programme took a look back at the week's television with a discussion between the presenter and three guests. In the first run there was also a pre-filmed last segment on an aspect of TV by an independent reporter.. The presenters of Did You See...? were the journalist and broadcaster Sir Ludovic Kennedy, who fronted the programme from 1980 to 1988,David Steel Obituary: Sir Ludovic Kennedy, The Guardian, 19 October 2009 and from 1991 to 1993 Jeremy Paxman. Sarah Dunant hosted the show while Kennedy was absent due to ill health. The format was to review the week's TV highlights, followed by an in depth review and critique of three selected shows with a panel of three public figures (not necessarily 'celebrities').
Significant editions of Did You See...? include a 1986 edition which featured a look at the history of Blue Peter in which former presenter Peter Purves recalled that on the death of Blue Peter pet parrot Joey, the show's editor Biddy Baxter called him in floods of tears. He speculated that had he himself died, Baxter would have been far less upset and wouldn't have been likely to be calling his co-presenters telling them he'd died! This particular feature was one of several that was later expanded and extracted from the series, shown in a stand alone documentary format. Sea of Faith, a 1984 documentary series examining the history of Christianity in the modern world, was featured on another edition. Several of the features were dedicated to Doctor Who. In 1982, there was an item on The Cybermen, to mark their first appearance in the series in seven years. A later feature took a general look at monsters from the series.

Altenberg Abbey (Abtei Altenberg) ([tpl]lang-la|Vetus Mons[/tpl]) is a former Cistercian monastery in Altenberg, now a part of Odenthal in the Bergisches Land, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
It was founded in 1133 as a daughter house of Morimond Abbey and settled initially in the old castle of the Counts of Berg, Burg Berge, which the counts had left for Schloss Burg, but moved to the new purpose-built monastery in the valley of the Dhünn in 1153.Norbert Orthen: Unter dem Zeichen der Jakobsmuschel. Altenberg – eine Station auf dem Jakobusweg. (online) It flourished sufficiently to undertake the settlement of a number of daughter houses of its own: Mariental Abbey and Wagrowiec Abbey, both in 1143; Lad Abbey in 1146; Zinna Abbey in 1171; Haina Abbey in 1188; Jüterbog Abbey in 1282; and Derneburg Abbey in 1443.
In 1803 it was dissolved during the secularisation of Germany and fell into ruin. Starting in 1847 under King Frederick William IV of Prussia, a thorough restoration was carried out, and the restored church, known as the Altenberger Dom ("Altenberg Cathedral", although Altenberg was never the seat of a bishopric so this is not technically accurate), is now an interdenominational church used by both Roman Catholics and Protestants.

[[Old School Museum]]

The Old School Museum is a local-history museum in Merimbula, New South Wales, Australia, occupying the town's former schoolhouse.
In 1869 the Rev. William Thom, a Presbyterian minister, was appointed to the Twofold Bay charge, residing at Pambula. His wife (Clarinda Menie) was the eldest daughter of Sir Henry Parkes and both were ardent supporters of public education. Pambula already had a well established school but the Rev. and Mrs. Thom felt there was an urgent need for more schools in the district. It is known that Mrs Thom made a private approach to her father on the matter and received a sympathetic response. Formal application for a school at Merimbula was made to the Council of Education in October, 1869, signed by the Rev. W. Thom, Adam K. Page and Armstrong L. Munn. Parents undertook to pay one third of the cost of a building. School began in temporary premises in 1870. The stone building still standing in Main Street, on land donated by Sir William Montagu Manning, was first used on 8 October 1875 and is believed to be one of only three schools comprising both classrooms and a teacher's residence remaining in New South Wales.
In 1875 the enrollment was 39 children. School fees were set by the local board within limits specified in the legislation. Initially parents paid a weekly fee of 9 pence for the first child and 6 pence for each additional child, but in 1893 this was reduced to 3 pence per head per week, with a maximum of 9 pence per family. According to the Public Instruction Act of 1880, fees should have changed in 1880 to the new limits of 3 pence per child with a maximum of a shilling per family. The building was vacated at the end of 1945, and the school reopened in new premises, which have been enlarged over the years. The residence was repaired and leased for accommodation, and the schoolroom was used for community purposes for a number of years.
The building was eventually abandoned. In 1969 the Merimbula-Imlay Historical Society was formed and requested permission to use the building as a museum, which after extensive repairs was opened in 1973. The building is classified by the National Trust and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

[[TurboDOS]]

CATEGORIES: CP/M, Microcomputer software, Disk operating systems

TurboDOS is a multi user CP/M like operating system for the Z80 and 8086 CPU's developed by Software 2000 Inc.
It was released around 1982 for S100 bus based systems such as the NorthStar Horizon.
The multiprocessor nature of TurboDOS is its most unusual feature. Unlike other 
operating systems of its time where networking of processors was either an afterthought, or which only support a file transfer protocol, TurboDOS was designed from the ground up as a multiprocessor operating system.
It is modular in construction, with the operating system generation based on 
a  relocating, linking, loader  program. This makes the incorporation of 
different  hardware driver modules quite easy, particularly  for  bus-oriented 
machines, such as the IEEE-696 (S-100) bus which was commonly used for TurboDOS systems.

[[Idola tribus]]

CATEGORIES: Prejudices, Logical fallacies, Inductive fallacies, Types of scientific fallacy, Francis Bacon

Idola tribus (singular Idolum tribus) is a category of logical fallacy, normally translated as "Idols of the Tribe", which refers to a tendency of human nature, to prefer certain types of incorrect conclusions. It a Latin term, coined by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his Novum Organum, one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the methodical approach of modern science. 
The term is one of four such "idols" which represent "idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults".Novum Organum, Aphorism XXXVIII 
Besides idola tribus, there are also idola specus, (Idols of the Cave, caused by one's personal peculiarities and experiences) idola fori (Idols of the Market Place, caused by language) and idola theatri (Idols of the Theatre, caused by philosophers).
And so in this category are cases of people being misled by anthropomorphism. In more detail, Bacon enumerated several specific such barriers to science which are part of human nature, coming into this category:
Bacon said that the Idols of the Tribe "take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit, or from its preoccupation, or from its narrowness, or from its restless motion, or from an infusion of the affections, or from the incompetency of the senses, or from the mode of impression".Novum Organum, Aphorism LII

[[Pontypridd railway accident]]

CATEGORIES: Railway accidents in Wales, Railway accidents in 1911, 1911 in Wales, Rail transport in Rhondda Cynon Taf, History of Glamorgan, Taff Vale Railway

On Monday 23 January 1911, a collision between a passenger train and coal train on the Taff Vale Railway line at Hopkinstown, outside Pontypridd in Wales, resulted in the loss of eleven (twelve according to the official report) lives. The accident, also known as the Hopkinstown rail disaster or the Coke Ovens collision, occurred at 9:48am, when the 09:10 from Treherbert to Cardiff passenger train heading towards Pontypridd railway station, carrying roughly 100 people on board, rounded the bend at Gyfeillion Lower signal box with a clear signal ahead. The train collided with a stationary coal train that was using the same line. The impact caused the underframe of the lead carriage to rise up and pierce through the carriage directly behind it.Hopkinstown rail disaster Rhondda Cynon Taf, library service
On 24 January a preliminary hearing was conducted at the New Inn Hotel in Pontypridd, where interviews and witness statements were taken. On the following Thursday a coroner's inquest was opened at Pontypridd Police Court. The inquest heard conflicting reports from signalman Hutchings of the Gyfeillion Lower and signalman Quick of the Rhondda Cutting Junction, the other signal box in control of the stretch of line where the accident took place. Due to lack of definite evidence an open verdict was returned; though the fireman of the coal train was censured for not alerting the signal box of the stationary train's position as he was required under Rule 55.
The Board of Trade enquiry, subsequent to the inquest, concluded that Hutchings had not, in fact, given the "Train Entering Section" signal for the coal train after Quick had accepted it, and Quick had subsequently accepted the passenger train, having forgotten that he had accepted the coal train earlier.  Hutchings was also criticised for not replacing his signals to "Danger" as soon as he was aware of the conflict - if he had done so, the driver of the passenger train would have had approximately 30 seconds to observe the danger signal, and, even if he had been unable to stop the train, its speed would have been greatly reduced and the collision much less severe.  A contributory factor was the use of two-position block instruments, which did not have distinct "Line Blocked" and "Line Clear" indications.  If a three-position instrument had been used, Hutchings would not have offered the passenger train forward (and Quick would not have accepted it) while the instrument was still showing "Line Clear" for the coal train.

[[Truck-driving country]]
CATEGORIES: Country music genres, Trucking subculture

Truck driving country is a sub-genre of country and western music.   It is spoken word with accompaniment, instrumental, and lyrical song about trucks (i.e. commercial vehicles, not pick-up trucks), truck drivers or truckers, and the trucking industry experience. This would include, for example, references to truck stops, CB (Citizen Band) radio, geography, drugs, teamsters, roads, weather, fuel, law enforcement, loads, traffic, ICC (Interstate Commerce Commission), contraband, DOT (Department of Transportation), accidents, et al.Stern, Jane  Trucker, A Portrait of the Last American Cowboy (1975)  In truckmusic, references to “truck” include the following truck types: 10 wheeler, straight truck, 18 wheeler, tractor (bobtail), semi, tractor-trailer, semi tractor trailer, big rig, and some others.
It is often confused with road music (e.g. Willie Nelson "On the Road  Again", Roger Miller "King of the Road"),  pick-up truck music (e.g. Toby Keith "Big Old Truck"), and/or truck driving music. The last category would be the preferred choice of most truck drivers for eclectic listening while driving/operating all types, makes, and styles of trucks.
It is, at least partly, an oral history of trucking. A range of social and economic factors in the United States have strongly influenced the evolution of truckmusic as a sub-genera of 'country' music. These factors include wars, civil rights struggles, the demographic shift from rural to urban areas, the feminist movement, economic recessions, changes in the railroads, and the oil embargo. Their impacts have diversified the folklore of truck songs.Roach, Joyce Gibson "Diesel Smoke & Dangerous Curves: Folklore of the Trucking Industry"  Hunters and Healers (1977) pp 45–53
Technological developments and changes related to both the music business and the trucking industry, however, have brought about the greatest changes to truckmusic. Variously, these include the jukebox, 33⅓ rpm vinyl record albums, 8 track tape, cassette tape, the transistor to digital revolution, the Internet,  CB radio, all-night radio broadcasts targeting truckers, Interstate highways, and multiple truck components (sleeper cabs, air suspension, power steering, synchronized transmissions, air conditioning, air seats, and electronics).American Truck Historical Society, <www.ATHS.org>
Collectively, there are more than five hundred truckmusic songs, all of which more or less originate from the oral tradition of truck folklore. Occupations, of course, have traditionally provided the raw material and inspiration for folk music in the United State (e.g. riverboat, mining, Great Lakes water commerce, lumbering, cowboy, agricultural field work and others), influenced by regional culture as well.Danker, Frederick E.  "Trucking Songs: A comparison with Traditional Occupational Song" Journal of Country Music (Jan 1978) pp78-89  Folk songs adopt, adapt, and incorporate colloquialisms, slang, and occupational terms into verbal snapshots. In truckmusic, such specialized words and terms as truck rodeo, dog house, twin screw, Georgia overdrive, saddle tanks, jake brake, binder and others borrowed from the lingo of truckers are commonly utilized.Roach, Joyce Gibson  Hunters & Healers CB vocabulary - which is different from truck driver lingoPorter, Bernard H.  "Truck Driver Lingo"  American Speech (Apr 1942)  pp102-105 - is used by both truckers and the general public. Some of that vocabulary has evolved into popular culture and subsequently incorporated into truckmusic (e.g. “hammer down,” “shakey town,” “smokey,” and “pedal to the metal”).Seese, Gwyneth E. (Dandalion)  Tijuana Bear in a Smoke'um Up Taxi 1977
There has been a certain mystique attached to truck driving and truck drivers, especially those engaged in long distance driving.Schroeder, Fred  "A Bellyful of Coffee: The Truck Drivin' Man as Folk Hero" Journal of Popular Culture (Spring 1969)  pp 679–687  It is yet to be determined if the enduring image of the truck driver will achieve true folk hero status, even given the past popularity of truckmusic. The post-CB song era perception of “truck drivin'n country” music was that it was a passing fad. At times, the trucker also has been stereotyped as a “sexist, pill-poppin’, burly, pinball playin’, smokey dodgin’, philandering, truck driving son-of-a-gun,” hardly a flattering or positive image. Not surprisingly, many recording artists have not wanted to be associated with truckmusic because of such negativity, and major recording labels have considered truckmusic a novelty of little or lasting commercial value.

Mariental Abbey ([tpl]lang-de|Kloster Mariental[/tpl]) in the present Mariental in Lower Saxony, Germany,  is a former Cistercian monastery founded in 1138, along with Marienberg Abbey in Helmstedt, by Pfalzgraf Friedrich II von Sommerschenburg. 
It was a daughter house of Altenberg Abbey of the filiation of Morimond. The initial complement consisted of twelve monks from Altenberg under an abbot (Bodo) from Amelungsborn Abbey. In 1179 the von Sommerschenburgs died out and the monastery with its possessions fell into the hands of Henry the Lion.
The abbey became extremely wealthy: its estates extended as far as Magdeburg, Jüterbog and Braunschweig. In 1232 it established a daughter house of its own, Hude Abbey. However, at the end of the 14th century it entered upon a steady decline. 
The monastery was dissolved in 1569 as a consequence of the Protestant Reformation. A Lutheran school had been set up in the premises in 1542, and this lasted until 1745. A seminary for the training of teachers was also established here, and this continued until 1773, when it was transferred to Helmstedt. 
The buildings today belong to the Braunschweigische Vereinigte Kloster- und Studienfonds, while the church has become the Protestant parish church of Mariental.

Chinese media reports said the scheme would have cost more than $6b yuan ($880m, £610m) in total, many times more than the county government's annual expenditure. The council expected either local, regional or national help to complete the project, but this was not approved. In 2007, money for the project ran out, and development stopped, leaving both a half-developed and unoccupied city, as well as a lack of finances and resource to maintain the existing town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8698184.stm|title=China's unfinished ghost town|publisher=BBC News|date=26 May 2010|accessdate=2011-04-14[/tpl]

[[Tangier Tattoo]]

CATEGORIES: 2006 operas, English-language operas

Tangier Tattoo is an opera by John Lunn (composer) and Steven Plaice (librettist). It was commissioned by and written in 2006 for Glyndebourne Festival Opera as the third part of a trilogy of operas, the others being Misper (1997) and Zoë (2000). The trilogy was part of a Glyndebourne project that aimed to interest young people in opera.
Critical reception by the British national newspapers was mixed. The Daily Mail described Tangier Tattoo as "certainly operatic, accessible, melodic and eclectic". The Times said 
"If every opera production were like this, the genre would soon shake off its cumbersome geriatric image" and the Independent "the plot is sharp and smart, if initially slow-burning, and Plaice's libretto is promising." However a Guardian critic wrote: "Most worrying of all is the sense that any self-respecting youth audience is going to see through Glyndebourne's attempt to get with the kids as a patronising gesture of trendy inclusivity" and a Telegraph critic referred to it as "derivative drivel" which he said would "will never convert the iPod generation".

In mathematics, an nth-order Argand system (named after French mathematician Jean-Robert Argand) is a coordinate system constructed around the nth roots of unity. From the origin, n axes extend such that the angle between each axis and the axes immediately before and after it is 360/n degrees. For example, the number line is the 2nd-order Argand system because the two axes extending from the origin represent 1 and −1, the 2nd roots of unity. The complex plane (sometimes called the Argand plane, also named after Argand) is the 4th-order Argand system because the 4 axes extending from the origin represent 1, i, −1, and −i, the 4th roots of unity.

Lake Barombi Mbo or Barombi-ma-Mbu is a lake near Kumba in the Southwest Region of Cameroon. It is located in the Cameroon volcanic chain, and is the largest volcanic lake in this region. It is one of the oldest radiocarbon-dated lakes in Africa.Past climate variability through Europe and Africa On old colonial maps the area was known as Elefanten Sea (Elephant Lake), but the elephants living in the area were extirpated due to ivory trading.Elephants and Their Interactions with People and Vegetation in the Waza-Logone Region, Cameroon, Part I Introduction and General Background, 1.1 The Problem, pg 3.
Until now, 15 species of fishes have been recorded from the lake.Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (2008). Western Equatorial Crater Lakes. Among others, this includes a member of the Barbus aboinensis group, a member of the Fundulopanchax mirabilis group, and the endemic catfish Clarias maclareni.

[[Ælfwine Haroldsson]]

CATEGORIES: 11th-century English people, English Christian monks, Illegitimate children of English monarchs, House of Knýtlinga

Ælfwine Haroldsson or Ælfwine was most probably an illegitimate son of King Harold Harefoot of England. He was probably born during the early 1030s, either in Scandinavia or after 1035 in England.Bolton, T. (2007) "Ælfgifu of Northampton: Cnut the Great's other woman", in: Nottingham Medieval Studies; LI (2007), pp. 247-68, at 263-65 He appears in an early twelfth-century cartulary from the monastery of Sainte Foi at Conques in Aquitaine as Alboynus (a cognate of Ælfwine), alongside the records that he was born in London and was the son of a King Heroldus (a Latinised version of Harold) and one Alveva ("Ælfgifu" Latinised). It is also noted that he arrived in Conques in 1060 on pilgrimage and persuaded the local authorities to rebuild the church and make him prior. W. H. Stevenson showed the only chronologically plausible candidate for his father is King Harold Harefoot.Stevenson, W. H. (1913) "An Alleged Son of King Harold Harefoot", in: English Historical Review; 109 (1913), pp. 112–17 With Harold Harefoot's sudden death on 17 March 1040 Ælfwine was most likely left in his otherwise unknown mother's care, or even that of his powerful and influential grandmother Ælfgifu of Northampton, who may be the Ælfgifu of the record mistakenly named as his mother, rather than grandmother.Bolton, T. "Ælfgifu of Northampton"; pp. 247-68 at 267-68 He did not lay any claim to the throne of England. Little is known about him, but he is thought to have died in the 1070s or 1080s. He was a grandson of Cnut the Great.

Lieutenant Thomas Gillies Rae was a World War I flying ace credited with six aerial victories.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/scotland/rae.php Retrieved 18 February 2010.
He served with the Royal Flying Corps during World War I and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He served in Flanders and in Europe.

Sous Lieutenant Émile Julien Mathurin Régnier (29 July 1894 - 4 September 1940) was a World War I flying ace credited with six aerial victories.
Régnier was born in Plémy, Brittany.  He served in the French infantry from September 1914 until early June 1917, suffering two serious wounds in the process. On 28 June 1917, he transferred into aviation as a corporal. After earning his pilot's license and undergoing advanced training, he joined Escadrille 89 as a fighter pilot on 8 January 1918. He would serve through war's end, sharing in six confirmed victories scored in conjunction with other pilots.
Postwar, he would be granted the Legion d'honneur to add to his Medaille Militaire and Croix de guerre.

He died at Pozzi, Valeggio sul Mincio, aged 46.  Régnier's death did not close down his aircraft engine company, which subsequently was captured and used by the Nazis during World War II.

[[La Révolution Wikipédia]]
CATEGORIES: 2007 books, Books about Wikipedia

La Révolution Wikipédia ([tpl]lang-en|The Wikipedia Revolution[/tpl]), published in France in 2007, is a multi-authored study of Wikipedia focusing on the online encyclopedia's reliability and its likely influence on printed reference books. Special attention is given to the French Wikipedia. The preface is contributed by Pierre Assouline, known as a critic of Wikipedia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
La Révolution Wikipédia began as a team project by five postgraduate journalism students under Pierre Assouline's supervision at the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris.A. Dalby, The World and Wikipedia (2009. ISBN 978-0-9562052-0-9) pp. 66-72. The authors, who get equal credit on the title page, are Pierre Gourdain, Florence O'Kelly, Béatrice Roman-Amat, Delphine Soulas and Tassilo von Droste zu Hülshoff. The main text explores Wikipedia in a balanced way, with a detailed analysis of the comparison of Wikipedia and the Encyclopaedia Britannica published by Nature in December 2005:Pierre Gourdain and others, La Révolution Wikipédia (2007) pp. 37-50. this comparison relates to a main theme of the book, as signalled by its subtitle Les encyclopédies vont-elles mourir? ("Are encyclopedias about to die?").Léa Giret, "La Révolution Wikipédia, une enquête sur les rouages de l’encyclopédie collaborative" (3 November 2007). It includes interviews on this issue with editors of French encyclopedias and dictionaries.
La Révolution Wikipédia studies the internal structures of Wikipedia and reports on the motivations of some active French Wikipedians, with an interview of Esprit Fugace.Pierre Gourdain and others, La Révolution Wikipédia (2007) pp. 58-63. A review on Internet & Opinion(s) noted an apparent negative emphasis in this section and points out that Wikipedia has correction mechanisms, using the Essjay case (already discussed in the book) as an example: "So Essjay is banned and has had to close his Wikipedia page. Who says that anarchy reigns unchallenged on the Web?""“La révolution wikipedia”, remix n° 2: Faire et défaire une réputation au sein de la communauté Wikipedia" (December 2007?)
There is an unresolved conflict between the sceptical but neutral approach of the main authors and the fiercely anti-Wikipedia stance of Pierre Assouline, whose long preface is headed Et ça passe pour une source ... ("And people call it a source!") With the exception of the relatively suspicious approach of the Bulletin des bibliothèques de France (the house journal of French librarians),[tpl]Cite journal|last=Alix|first=Yves|year=2008|title=La Révolution Wikipédia|journal=BBF: Bulletin des bibliothèques de France|volume=53|issue=1|url=http://bbf.enssib.fr/consulter/bbf-2008-01-0109-008[/tpl] media reviews of La Révolution Wikipédia were in general more favourable to Wikipedia than the book itself is. "Wikipedia is disturbing," said Shvoong, "it's becoming livelier and more visible every day ... and it's overturning the traditional order by allowing users to share in the project.""La Révolution Wikipédia" (25 June 2008)
One feature of the research that went into La Révolution Wikipédia was the insertion of several deliberate errors into the French Wikipedia, with the aim of observing how long it would take for them to be corrected. According to Assouline, his instructions to the students had been for "a group study, lasting several months. Take Wikipedia apart and see how it works." This experiment was reported in the French daily newspaper Libération when the original student project was submitted.Pierre Roussel, "Wikipédia se trompe à tous vents" (9 July 2007); translation from A. Dalby, The World and Wikipedia (2009) p. 67-68. Information about edits that Wikipedians regarded as vandalism led to investigation by French Wikipedia administrators and to the blocking of the IP address from which they were made. The address was that of the Institut d'Études Politiques network; in response to the blocking, Agnès Chauveau, director of the Institute's School of Journalism, claimed that its students "did not sabotage the encyclopedia" and that the Institute was being "punished".Reported on French Wikinews, Quand des étudiants de Science Po vandalisent Wikipédia ...; translation from A. Dalby, The World and Wikipedia (2009) p. 66.

Myron A. Farber (born c. 1938) is an American newspaper reporter for The New York Times, whose investigations into the deaths of several patients at an Oradell, New Jersey, hospital led to the murder trial of Dr. Mario Jascalevich, a physician at the hospital who was alleged to have used a powerful muscle relaxant in what became known as the "Dr. X" case. After refusing to turn over notes from his investigation in response to a subpoena from the defense attorney in the case, Farber was jailed for contempt and the newspaper fined, ending up spending 40 days in jail with fines of $285,000 assessed. Appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, the case set a precedent for the limitations of shield laws in the United States.

Another circumstance of these big weekends is that local residents are inconvenienced by the hordes of people that flock to their city on these weekends. Traffic and parking get so bad that most locals refuse to leave their house and are essentially held captive in their own homes. CollegeWeekends.com’s website allows these residents to rent their property and get out of town while providing accommodation to visitors who otherwise would be forced to stay out of town.

Independent Albania was proclaimed on 28 November 1912. This chapter of Albanian history was shrouded in controversy and conflict as the larger part of the self-proclaimed region had found itself controlled by the Balkan League states: Serbia, Montenegro and Greece from the time of the declaration until the period of recognition when Albania relinquished many of the lands originally included in the declared state. Since the proclamation of the state in November 1912, the Provisional Government of Albania asserted its control over a small part of central Albania including the important cities of Vlorë and Berat.

[[Microfilmmaking]]
CATEGORIES: Filmmaking

Microfilmmaking is the production of ultra-low budget movies.  These films generally are made by impassioned filmmakers operating outside the Hollywood mainstream.  While a "low budget" Hollywood film can cost millions of dollars, 80% to 90% of all independent films are made for budgets of $30,000 or less.Microfilmmaker Magazine, Mission
Without the backing of major movie studio, microfilmmakers have to be resourceful in raising even their modest budgets.  They often hold a “regular” job and fund their film projects out of their own pockets.Microfilmmaker Magazine, Mission  Many begin the filmmaking process by approaching friends and family for donations of money or services.
Microfilmmakers are often the first to adopt new technologies and techniques, economic necessity leading to creative invention.  The lack of money leads them to try new ways of doing things, or invent new techniques.  Microfilmmakers were among the first to shoot movies on video.

(2002), 3(Bk. 2),  869-875

[[Cinema of Ecuador]]

CATEGORIES: Cinema of Ecuador

The cinema of Ecuador has a long history, including both short and feature-length films made throughout the 20th century, but until recently Ecuadorian film has generally not had a large impact.
Cinematic production in Ecuador began in the 1920s, with the production of the first Ecuadorian dramatic feature film, El Tesoro de Atahualpa, directed by the Ecuadorian Augusto San Miguel in 1924.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20166771 |title=Ecuador's film industry sees boom in productions |accessdate=2012-11-14|work=BBC News[/tpl]Enciclopedia del Ecuador, p. 605. Moreover, in the same decade, the Italian Carlos Crespi directed the major documentary Los Invisibles Shuaras del Alto Amazonas. Between 1930 and 1931, the advent of talkies stopped the development of Ecuadorian film, which tried to cope with the new films using "live sound" ("sonorización en vivo"), that is, the interpretation of texts and songs simultaneously with the projection, though without success. Because of this, for around two decades Ecuadorian cinema revolved around documentaries, news programs, and promotional tourist films, with the exception of dramatic feature films in 1950.Enciclopedia del Ecuador, p. 606. However, Ecuadorian cinema was promoted by intellectuals in the 1960s, including Ulises Estrella, director of the Cinemateca Nacional. During this period, Mexican-Ecuadorian co-productions proliferated.Enciclopedia del Ecuador, p. 607. During the next decade, the documentary genre was strengthened, and in 1977 the Asociación de Autores Cinematográficos del Ecuador was legalized.
Between the 1980s and the present, Ecuadorian cinema returned to the production of feature films. One example of this trend was the 1989 cinematic adaptation of José de la Cuadra's La Tigra, directed by Camilo Luzuriaga. Luzuriaga also directed Entre Marx y una Mujer Desnuda, a cinematic adaptation of 1809-1810: Mientras llega el día by Jorge Enrique Adoum, which related the story of Quiteño independence. Other major films in the rebirth of Ecuadorian cinema were Ratas, ratones y rateros (1999) and Crónicas (2004) by director Sebastián Cordero. As of 2008, Cordero was filming his third feature film in Spain, an adaptation of the novel Rabia by the Argentine writer Sergio Bizzio. Recently the film Qué tan lejos by Cuenca's Tania Hermida was highly acclaimed, receiving the Silver Zenith Award Montreal World Film Festival for the best directorial debut.http://www.ffm-montreal.org/palmares/en_2006.html Other recent productions that are making their way through festivals include the documentary El Comité by Mateo Herrera and Cuando me toque a mí by Víctor Arregui. When Cuando me toque a mí was presented at the Biarritz Festival of Film and Culture of Latin America, the lead actor, Manuel Calisto, won the prize for best actor.

General Garrard was ordered by General Sherman to interpose between General Joseph Wheeler's cavalry and detached infantry at Noonday Creek, which was just a few miles from Sherman's headquarters at Big Shanty.  When, after a week, Garrard failed to do so, two brigades of infantry and three brigades of cavalry with artillery support were advanced against the Confederate positions on June 9.  Two charges failed, and the Union Army retired from the field.

The Welshampton rail crash was a fatal railway accident in the Welsh borders village of Welshampton on 11 June 1897. It resulted in the deaths of 12 people.
An excursion to [tpl]rws|Barmouth[/tpl] had been organised by the United Sunday Schools of Royton. A group of 320 passengers were on board a train of mixed Cambrian Railways (CR) and Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) stock of 15 carriages, pulled by two locomotives. Earlier in the day a CR guard had complained of the rough-riding of a small 4-wheeled L&YR brake van, which on the return journey was at the front of the train.
The train left [tpl]rws|Barmouth[/tpl] at 18:00. At about 22:20 one of the engines and 13 of the coaches left the rails of the CR's Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway, [tpl]convert|154|yd[/tpl] east of Welshampton station. Nine passengers were killed in what was the first fatal accident on the line since it was built, two other passengers and a railway employee died later from injuries.
Although the initial investigation centered on the first carriage to leave the rails, an L&YR third-class brake coach, the enquiry concluded though that the speed of the train was too high considering the state of the track which had many sleepers in need of replacement, also too light a rail for high speed running. The CR disputed the findings and maintained that the L&Y vehicle was to blame.
A memorial on the front of the Town Hall in Royton, Oldham, Lancashire names, slightly inaccurately, those killed in the accident. A second memorial, installed by local people, at the side of the A495 Ellesmere to Whitchurch road, near to the site of the accident, shows the Cambrian Railways coat of arms. The railway line between Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch is now disused and, although some of the line is visible, the site of the accident itself has been ploughed out. Welshampton Station building still exists and has been converted into a house.

The Tulsa Shock are a professional basketball team based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, playing in the Western Conference in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). The team was founded in Detroit, Michigan before the 1998 WNBA season began; the team moved to Tulsa before the 2010 season. The team is owned by Tulsa Pro Hoops LLC, which is led by Bill Cameron and David Box.
The Shock have not qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in their years in Tulsa. The franchise has been home to many high-quality players such as athletic shooting guard Deanna Nolan, women's professional basketball all-time leading scorer Katie Smith, former NBA great Karl Malone's daughter Cheryl Ford, and young Australian center Liz Cambage. In 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2008 (as Detroit), the Shock went to the WNBA Finals; they won in 2003, 2006 and 2008, beating Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Antonio, respectively. They lost in 2007 to Phoenix.
The Shock are one of three WNBA teams that do not share a city with an NBA counterpart. However, they do share the city with an NBA Development League team (the Tulsa 66ers), and are just across the state from the Oklahoma City Thunder NBA team.

CATEGORIES: 2009 singles

Amy Jane is the third single to be produced by multi-instrumentalist/composer Tim Scott, first released on 9 November 2009.
The cover features a heart sculpted out of a brown paper bag from a fast food chain set in a stripped corrugated cardboard box, shadowed by spotlight, intended to represent how relationships have become more of a disposable commodity in today's society.
Like Guitar Mashing it features a fictional dictionary definition for the term Guitar Mashing which is in part derived from the official Oxford English Dictionary definitions for the words Guitar and Mash but heavily distorted for use as a propaganda tool in marketing the single's unusual genre and so no longer has any true meaning.
The single was recorded and mixed at Acer Studios in Greater Manchester by Tim Scott and mastered on 6 October 2009 by Geoff Pesche  at Abbey Road Studios, London.

Sintra ([tpl]IPA-pt|ˈsĩtɾɐ[/tpl]), located in the central Lisbon Region, is a municipality consisting of several civil parishes and two urbanized cities (Queluz and Agualva-Cacém) and known for many of its 19th-century Romantic architecture, which resulted in its classification as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Although the built and natural heritage are the most visible faces of the historical individuality of Sintra, there is an entire literary heritage that has made this area a legendary reference in Portuguese culture.

The LG Versa (VX9600) is a mobile phone for use on the Verizon Wireless network. Like the LG Dare VX-9700, the Versa has a full touch screen and onscreen QWERTY keyboard. The Vers also accepts handwriting recognition or gesture control for entering phone numbers and typing. The phone includes a HTML mobile web web browser, a built-in MP3 music player, access to Verizon Wireless's VCAST multimedia services, and mobile e-mail services. The phone includes a 3.2-inch digital camera with zoom, autofocus, and flash. The phone also had a built-in camcorder. An expandable MicroSD card slot is included into the phone, though no MicroSD card is pre-installed into the device. The difference between the LG Dare and the Versa is that the Versa featured a unique, foldout QWERTY keyboard that was detachable. Originally included with the Versa, the QWERTY keyboard was no longer included and only available as an accessory at Verizon Wireless retail stores. The attachment also included send and end call keys so that the user could answer an incoming call even with the flip closed. The attachment also included an integrated LED display screen that displayed information such as the currently-playing music track, current time, current date, signal strength, type of CDMA signal (1X or 3G) that the phone was currently operating on, the network provider's name, and who is calling, should an incoming call come through when the case is attached and closed.

[[Lindow Moss]]
CATEGORIES: Bogs of England, Geography of Cheshire, Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cheshire

Lindow Moss, also known as Saltersley Common, is a raised mire peat bog on the edge of Wilmslow in Cheshire, England. It has been used as common land since the medieval period and is best known for the discovery of the preserved bog body of Lindow Man in 1984.
The peat bog was formed in a collection of hollows left by melting ice at the end of the last ice age. The first written record of Lindow Moss was in 1421 when the lord of Mobberley and Wilmslow allowed people to dig peat from the mossland for use as fuel.[tpl]Harvnb|Turner|1995|p=10.[/tpl] It originally covered over 600 hectares (1,500 acres), but has since shrunk to a tenth of its original size. The bog can be a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there.[tpl]Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=13.[/tpl]
For centuries, peat from the bog was used as fuel. It continues to be extracted but now for mixing within compost products. The process is now mechanised with a mechanical digger.
The site is known for its flora and fauna such as Hare's-tail Cottongrass, Common Cottongrass[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002734.pdf |title=Lindow Common SSSI |author= |date=1979 |work= |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=2012-01-20[/tpl] and Green Hairstreak butterfly. It also has been a habitat for Water Voles although their continued existence is threatened by sinking water levels. The Saltersley Common Preservation Society promotes the preservation of the moss.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.wilmslow.co.uk/news/article/1305/online-fight-to-save-peat-bog |title=Online fight to save peat bog |first=Lisa |last=Reeves |publisher=wilmslow.co.uk |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-26[/tpl] In November 2011, they teamed up with a local amateur filmmaker to produce a short video detailing the history of the bog and some of the threats it faces.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.wilmslow.co.uk/news/article/5245/movie-highlights-threat-to-lindow-moss|title=Movie highlights threat to Lindow Moss|first=Lisa|last=Reeves|publisher=wilmslow.co.uk|date=24 November 2011|accessdate=2011-11-24[/tpl]

Howland & Aspinwall was a merchant firm based in New York City in the 1830s and 1840s.  It specialized in the Pacific Ocean trade, especially the importing of goods from China.  It is best known for taking a pioneering role in the financing of clipper ships, especially the American-built Rainbow and Sea Witch.[tpl]cite web |year= 2009 |url = http://www.eraoftheclipperships.com/seawitchcopyweb.html|title = The Sea Witch|publisher = eraoftheclipperships.com| accessdate = September 25, 2009 | last= |quote=[/tpl][tpl]cite web |year= 2009 |url = http://www.maritimeheritage.org/captains/waterman.htm|title = Captain Robert "Bully" Waterman|publisher = The Maritime Heritage Project| accessdate = September 25, 2009 | last=D. Blethen Adams Levy  |quote=[/tpl]
Howland & Aspinwall imported high-status goods such as porcelain, silk, and tea  from China, and sold them to Americans of means.  Import duties paid by firms such as Howland & Aspinwall played a significant role in the financing of the American federal budget during the 1840s.
In 1848, as a result of the United States's acquisition of California, partners G.S. Howland, S.S. Howland, and William Henry Aspinwall turned their attention from the China trade to California traffic.  Improvements in the marine steam engine had begun to make clipper ships and other fast sailing ships obsolete.  With other New York businessmen, the Howland and Aspinwall interests formed the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.  Pacific Mail eventually became American President Lines, which is now part of Neptune Orient Lines.Somerville, Col. Duncan S., The Aspinwall Empire, p. 22, Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., Mystic, CT, 1983.Niven, John, The American President Lines and its Forebears 1948-1984, p. 15, University of Delaware Press, Newark, NJ, 1987.Elias, Rahita, Beyond Boundaries: The First 35 Years of the NOL Story, p. 8, Neptune Orient Lines Ltd., 2004.
Part of the Aspinwall family fortune was eventually bequeathed, through grandmother Mary Aspinwall Roosevelt, to Franklin D. Roosevelt, 32nd President of the United States.

Reverend Ozro Thurston Jones Sr. (March 26, 1891 – September 23, 1972) was a Pentecostal - Holiness denomination leader and minister, who was the second Senior Bishop of the Church of God in Christ, Inc. from (1962–1968), succeeding Bishop Charles Harrison Mason, who was the founder. The Church of God in Christ (COGIC) is the world's largest Pentecostal denomination and fourth largest denomination in the United States. Ozro Jones was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas, the son of Baptist parents, Marion and Mary Jones. As a young man, in 1912, he experienced and confessed salvation and "spirit baptism" or "infilling" as a second work of grace. He answered a call to the ministry under the guidance of Elder Justus Bowe, a COGIC pioneer. Soon afterwards, he, his older sister and a brother developed into an evangelistic team in North Arkansas and the surrounding states. Over the next few years 18 congregations were established as a direct result of their evangelistic endeavors. In 1914 Jones organized the youth department of the Church of God in Christ and served as its first president. Two years later he founded and edited the Y.P.W.W. Quarterly Topics, an education-oriented journal. In 1920 he was appointed assistant to the state overseer in Oklahoma.
In 1925, Jones' career took a decisive turn when he became pastor of a small congregation of Pentecostal believers in Philadelphia. He moved to Philadelphia where he would reside for the rest of his life. The congregation grew into the historic Holy Temple Church of God in Christ. In 1926 he became the state overseer for Pennsylvania. Not forgetting his work with the youth of the church, in 1928 he founded the International Youth Congress of the Church of God in Christ.
In 1933 Bishop Charles Harrison Mason, the founder of the Church of God in Christ, selected Jones as one of the five men to be consecrated as the denomination's first "founding" bishops. He was later selected to serve on the executive commission created by Mason to assist him during his last years in office. Following Mason's death in November 1961, the commission then headed by Bishop A.B. McEwen, administered the affairs of the church for one year. Then in late 1962, the board of bishops moved to nominate a new senior bishop. They chose Jones and placed his name before the church's general assembly, which approved the motion. Jones retained authorship of the Y.P.W.W. Topics and he remained Jurisdictional Bishop of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Rev. Dr. O.T. Jones Jr. became the active pastor of Holy Temple Church in Philadelphia in order that Senior Bishop Jones could devote full time to his new position of Senior Bishop of the Church of God in Christ. At no time did Bishop Jones Sr. give up any of his offices.
Events moved smoothly for the first few years of Jones' tenure, but opposition began to appear in 1965. Voices rose demanding regular elections for the office of a presiding bishop. The situation threatened to split the denomination, and a number of lawsuits answered with counter-lawsuits were filed. The courts finally ordered an election, and in 1968 a constitutional convention held its first session on January 30, 1968. The convention established clear guidelines for the election of church leaders, and later that year the elections were held. Eventually, James Oglethorpe Patterson was elected presiding bishop. This effectively removed Bishop O.T. Jones Sr. from office. He remained Jurisdictional Bishop in Pennsylvania until he passed September 23, 1972. He was 81.

[[High pressure receptor zones]]
CATEGORIES: Sensory receptors

In physiology high pressure receptor zones are the places you find baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus. They are only sensitive above 60mmHg blood pressure. 
When these receptors are active they elicit a depressor response; which decreases the heart rate and gives a general vasodilation. An increase in arterial blood pressure reflexly elicits an increase in vagal neuronal activity to the heart (i.e. the resulting decreased heart rate). 
The afferent nerves from the baroreceptors are called buffer nerves.

Roopangarh Fort is a former fortress and palace in the town of Roopangarh, Rajastan, India that is today a hotel. The fortress was originally built by, and named after, Maharaja Roop Singh of Kishangarh in 1648. It was sited at strategic point atop a hill to the north of Kishangarh controlling the important trade route to the Sambhar Salt Lake. Around the fort a substantial town grew up that became a centre for artisans and manufacturers. For a century it also served as the primary residence of the Maharajas of Kishangarh, and the capital of the state. An ornate palace was built next to the fortress.
In 1999 the Maharaja opened the fort as a hotel, but left the interior and exterior little changed from its time as a palace. It has 20 rooms, some of which are vast former royal suites.

Etienne noted when he received the appointment. Describing how heard he noted that: "It was bizarre. I don’t know what else to say. papal nuncio Archbishop Sambi called the office at the parish and it was my day off. We had to play phone tag. I was up at the family farm with a chain saw, working in the woods. And, when he called, I was just getting out of my pickup truck. I was in my Carhart jeans and in my work boots, and had nothing to take notes with. I was just sitting there in my truck listening to him tell me that I’ve just been named bishop. And he had to say ‘Cheyenne’ four times before I could understand what he was saying."
He was consecrated on December 9, 2009 and took possession of the see on the same day.

[[Low pressure receptor zones]]
CATEGORIES: Sensory receptors

Low pressure receptor zones are areas with baroreceptors located in the venae cavae and the pulmonary veins, and in the atria. They are also called volume receptors. These receptors respond to changes in the wall tension, which is proportional to the filling state of the low pressure side of circulation (below 60mmHg). Their impulses regulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH/Vasopressin), renin and aldosterone. An elevated atrial pressure produces a decrease in ADH and aldosterone secretion. The decrease in vasopressin secretion results in an increase in the volume of urine excreted, serving to lower blood pressure. In addition, stretching of atrial receptors increases secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which promotes increased water and sodium excretion through the urine."Principles of medical physiology" by A Fonyo page 577
In the right atrium, the stretch receptors occur at the junction of the venae cavae. In the left atrium, the junction is at the pulmonary veins. Increasing stretch of the receptors stimulates both an increase in heart rate and a decrease in vasopressin (ADH) secretion from posterior pituitary.

Banking in Ecuador has a long history. At the time of the dissolution of Gran Colombia and its formation as a republic, Ecuador's economy was generally not monetized; gold and silver coins were circulated, and were brought into common use by successive currency laws.Superintendencia de Bancos y Seguros : superban.gov.ec - Historia (archived version of ) Little by little, with the growth of the nation, Ecuadorian banking also grew and was particularly centered on the city of Guayaquil. After the Liberal Revolution came a period called the Banking Plutocracy (Plutocracia bancaria) that was dominated by private banking, especially by the Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Guayaquil (Banco Comercial y Agrícola de Guayaquil). This period ended with the July Revolution (Revolución Juliana) of 1925.Diario Correo : diariocorreo.com.ec - Archivo del 2007/06/18

[[Island ecology]]
CATEGORIES: Ecology, Island restoration, Islands

Island ecology is the study of island organisms and their interactions with each other and the environment.  Islands account for nearly 1/6 of earth’s total land area,Paulay, G. 1994. Biodiversity on Oceanic Islands: Its Origin and Extinction. American Zoology 34: 134-144. yet the ecology of island ecosystems is vastly different from that of mainland communities.  Their isolation and high availability of empty niches leads to increased speciation.  As a result, island ecosystems comprise 30% of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, 50% of marine tropical diversity, and some of the most unusual and rare species.Gerlach, Justin.  2008. Island biodiversity - issues and opportunities. World Conservation Congress  Many species still remain unknown.
The diversity of species on islands is highly impacted by human activities such as deforestation and introduction of exotic species.  In response, ecologists and managers are directing attention towards conservation and restoration of island species.  Because they are simple systems, islands provide an opportunity to study processes of extinction that can be extrapolated to larger ecosystems.

(2006). The Land of Scholars: Two Thousand Years of Korean Confucianism,'' p. 75.

The chimpanzee–human last common ancestor (CHLCA, CLCA, or C/H LCA) is the last species that humans, bonobos and chimpanzees share as a common ancestor.
In human genetic studies, the CHLCA is useful as an anchor point for calculating single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rates in human populations where chimpanzees are used as an outgroup.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] The CHLCA is frequently cited as an anchor for the molecular most recent common ancestor (MRCA) determination because the two species of the genus Pan, the bonobos and the chimpanzee, are the species most genetically similar to Homo sapiens.

CATEGORIES: Terranes, Geology of Alaska, Geology of Yukon, Geology of British Columbia, Paleozoic

The Yukon-Tanana Terrane (YTT) is a tectonic terrane that extends from central Alaska through central Yukon and into northern British Columbia, Canada and Southeast Alaska, USA. Extending over 2000 km, the YTT is the largest tectonostratigraphic terrane in the northern North American Cordillera.http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/110/2/211.abstract The Yukon-Tanana Upland is a physiographic province mostly underlain by rocks of the Yukon-Tanana terrane. The YTT consists of polymetamorphosed and polydeformed metasedimentary, metavolcanic, and metaplutonic rocks of Upper Paleozoic and older ages that were deposited or emplaced near the edge of the North American continental margin.http://www.dggs.dnr.state.ak.us/webpubs/dggs/pdf/text/pdf1996_016.PDFEnergy, Mines, and Resources: 2. Ancient Pacific Margin NATMAP Rocks in the terrane record a variety of tectonic settings and have experienced varying amounts of tectonic transport, both before and after amalgamation of the YTT with North America. Sequences of mainly parautochthonous quartz-rich sedimentary rocks derived from the North American continent also include meta-igneous rocks with mostly continental geochemical and isotopic signatures. Structurally higher sequences contain meta-igneous rocks with arc and back-arc characteristics. The Slide Mountain/Seventymile terrane, composed of volcanic rocks typical of seafloor and of typical seafloor sediments, is recognized as an ocean basin that divided parts of the YTT before amalgamation of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane with the continental margin.http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2006CD/finalprogram/abstract_104364.htmhttp://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2006CD/finalprogram/abstract_104401.htm
Understanding and definition of the YTT is constantly progressing, the term "Yukon Tanana composite terrane," or "YTCT" is used by some workers, reflecting the disparate depositional and tectonic histories being recognized in rock units within the YTT.http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/110/2/211.abstract Some recent work dispenses altogether with the term Yukon-Tanana Terrane, in favor of more detailed subdivisions.
The right-lateral strike slip Tintina Fault occurs along the suture zone between the YTT (on the south and west) and ancestral North America to the east; it forms a significant boundary between North America cratonic rocks and rocks of the YTT and associated terranes - although displaced continental rocks are found south of the Tintina Fault and pieces of the YTT occur north of the Tintina Fault.http://www.geology.gov.yk.ca/pdf/bedrock_geology.pdfhttp://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2007CD/finalprogram/abstract_120641.htm Parts of the YTT have been offset by at least 400 km along the Tintina Fault. In most of the Alaskan part of the YTT the Denali Fault forms the modern day southern boundary of the terrane.http://econgeol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/88/2/344 In Yukon the ocean-basin rocks of the Windy/McKinley terrane, and the Coast Plutonic Complex (CPC) form the southern boundary of the YTT. Units assigned to the YTT also occur within the CPC; and the YTT partially encloses and is complexley related to the Intermontane Superterrane.

The initial version was not very satisfactory and it was cancelled when its factory was forced to evacuate in the autumn of 1941. But production was reinitiated in the summer of 1942 and continued until September 1945 to meet the need for an economical engine to power the Soviet long-range bombers like the Petlyakov Pe-8 and the Yermolayev Yer-2.

Child labour is the practice of having children engage in economic activity, on part or full-time basis. The practice deprives children of their childhood, and is harmful to their physical and mental development. Poverty, lack of good schools and growth of informal economy are considered as the important causes of child labour in India.

Tybee National Wildlife Refuge was established on May 9, 1938, by an executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a breeding area for migratory birds and other wildlife. Located in the mouth of the Savannah River, the [tpl]convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] refuge began as a [tpl]convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] oyster shoal, Oysterbed Island, used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a spoil disposal site to support their mandated harbor dredging activity. As a result, the majority of the refuge is now covered with sand deposits. The more stable portions of the island are densely covered with such woody species as eastern red cedar, wax myrtle, and groundsel. Saltwater marsh borders parts of the island.
The refuge is an important resting and feeding area for migratory birds including gulls, terns, neotropical migratory songbirds, and shorebirds. Least terns, black skimmers, Wilson's plovers, and several other shorebird species have nested on the spoil deposits on Tybee. During all seasons, the refuge's shoreline and open spoil deposits are used as resting sites for brown pelicans, gulls, and terns. Endangered species, including piping plovers and wood storks, have been observed on the refuge land, while shortnose sturgeon and manatees have been found in the waters bordering Tybee. With the use of telescopes, birdwatchers observe the refuge birdlife from levees located across the river within Fort Pulaski National Monument.

[[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery]]
CATEGORIES: Exploration, History of Europe, History of geography, World Digital Library related, Age of Sail

Major explorations continued after the Age of Discovery. By the early seventeenth century, vessels were sufficiently well built and their navigators competent enough to travel to virtually anywhere on the planet by sea. In the 17th century Dutch explorers such as Willem Jansz and Abel Tasman explored the coasts of Australia. Spanish expeditions from Peru explored the South Pacific and discovered archipelagos such as Vanuatu and the Pitcairn Islands. Luis Vaez de Torres chartered the coasts of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and discovered the strait that bears his name. European naval exploration mapped the Western and northern coasts of Australia, but the east coast had to wait for over a century, while in the eighteenth century it was British explorer James Cook who mapped much of Polynesia. Cook traveled as far as Alaska. In the later 18th century the Pacific became a focus of renewed interest, with Spanish expeditions reaching northern Canada and Alaska, and Northern Europeans exploring other unknown regions in the North-American west coast.
The centers of the Americas had been reached by the mid 16th century, although there were unexplored areas until the 18th and 19th centuries. Australia's and Africa's deep interiors were not explored by Europeans until the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries; this being due to a lack of trade potential in this region, and to serious problems with contagious tropical diseases in sub-Saharan Africa's case. Finally, Antarctica's interior was explored, with North and South Poles reached in the 20th century.

[[Yngwin]]

CATEGORIES: Geats, Kings of the Geats, Mythological kings of Denmark, People in Norse mythology and legends

Yngwin ("Yngve") was, according to Gesta Danorum, a king in Götaland, who was a close friend to one of the Danish kings named Halfdan.
This Danish king had no sons, so he left his treasures and his kingdom to Yngwin. Yngwin then moved to Denmark and ruled the kingdom for a while, until he was slain by a competitor to the throne by the name Ragnald. 
Yngwin had a son named Siwald, who became king in Denmark after him. Then Siwald's son Sigar took the throne after him. He had three sons.
One of his sons was Alf, who was a Viking. On a raiding tour to Finland, he met Alfhild, the daughter of king Siward in Götaland. Alfhild had her own fleet of Viking ships, some of them manned with maidens. Alf and Alfhild later married, and they had a daughter named Gurid.
In a war fought against a revolting Danish Viking clan, Sigar, Alf and his brothers were killed, while defending their dear Danish subjects. In the end of the war, Alf's comrade Borgar arrived with fresh chivalry from Scania, and slew all the enemies. But without a king, the country now fell apart, and chieftains took control of the different parts.
Only Alf's daughter Gurid had survived of the royal family. She later married one of Borgar's sons, Halfdan, and they had a son named Harald who became the new king. Harald restored the Danish kingdom to its former glory and unity.

[[Maya death gods]]
CATEGORIES: Maya mythology and religion, Maya deities, Death gods, Underworld gods

The Maya death gods, known under various names, belong to only two basic types, respectively represented by the 16th-century Yucatec deities Hunhau[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] and Uacmitun Ahau[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] mentioned by Spanish Bishop Landa. Hunhau is the lord of the Underworld. Iconographically, Hunhau and Uacmitun Ahau correspond to the Gods A and A'. 
In recent narratives, particularly in the oral tradition of the Lacandon people, there is only one death god (called "Kisin"[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] in Lacandon), who acts as the antipode of the Upper God in the creation of the world and of the human body and soul. This death god inhabits an Underworld that is also the world of the dead. As a ruler over the world of the dead (Metnal or Xibalba), the principal death god corresponds to the Aztec deity Mictlantecuhtli. The Popol Vuh has two leading death gods, but these two are really one: Both are called 'Death', with only the prefixes ('One' and 'Seven') being different. They were vanquished by the Hero Twins.   
The two principal death gods count among the many were-animals and spooks (wayob) inhabiting the Underworld, with the God A way in particular manifesting himself as a head hunter and a deer hunter.

[[Fish carving]]

CATEGORIES: Collecting, Folk art, Woodcarving

Fish sculpture, fish decoys, fish carvings and  fish trophies are the names given to a style of painted wood carving practiced by various artisans. The works are kept as decorations and collectible as folk art.
British fish carvers include John B. Russell (Scottish), John and Dhuie Tully, P.B. Malloch and the Hardy Brothers. Artists Ellen McCaleb & Eric L Knowlton work in the United States.  Styles of carving can range from simple folk art, miniature decoys, 'European' style carvings (side profile of fish usually displayed on a wood panel) and  highly detailed lifesized and ultra realism.  For realism, some paint on scale patterns, others carve in the scale details but most of the World Championship realistic carvings feature scales burned in with a wood burning pen, one at a time, often with scale designs created just for that specific fish.  Example from artist Eric L Knowlton of Reel Trout Studio, Alaska, shown here:
The Gathering (show) bills itself as the world's largest wooden-carved fish decoy show and is held annually in Perham, Minnesota.

Nagula Chavithi (Telugu: నాగుల చవితి) is an auspicious day to observe Naga Puja. Nagula Chavithi is observed on the fourth day (Chaturthi) after Deepavali Amavasya during Karthika masam. Nag Panchami and Nagasashti are observed after Naga Chaturthi. In some parts of Andhra Pradesh it is also celebrated in the month of Sravana masam.
Nagula Chavithi, a festival to worship Nag Devatas (Serpent Gods), is mainly a women festival. Nagula Chavithi is observed by married women for their wellbeing of their children. During the Chavithi festival, women keep fast and observe Naga Puja. Devotees offer milk and dry fruits to Sarpa Devata at the Valmeekam or Putta (snake pits). On Nag Chaturthi day, Ashtanag (seven hooded cobra) is worshipped.
Nagula Chavithi in Kartika masam is a major festival in Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Karnataka. The rituals and puja procedures are different from place to place. Some people place Naga devatha idol at home and perform puja. But in some places, devotees go to 'Putta' (Snake pit) and offer naivedyam and perform other pujas there
The popular legend associated with Nagula Chavithi in Telugu Hindu culture suggests that on the day Lord Shiva drank the poison Halahala or Kalkuta to save the universe during the famous incident of Samudra Manthan.
Pujas and prayers are held in Naga temples across the state.

Nowadays, Nagula Chavithi day is noted for the notorious practice of offering milk and eggs to the snakes, especially cobras near snake pits. Snake charmers also bring cobras to villages and towns which are fed with milk by devotees. Such practices should not be encouraged as it leads to the death of snakes.
Snakes don’t drink milk but the practice has been encouraged by popular beliefs.
Worship of Nagas is a constant reminder to humans to live in harmony with Nature. And the ideal way to worship Nagas is by protecting the forests and grooves that are home of snakes and other animals.

Clyde Williams Field was an outdoor stadium on the campus of Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. It was the home of the Iowa State Cyclones football and track and field teams.
It was originally built in 1914-15, just south of the recently completed State Gym. It originally held 5,000 spectators, but expansions in 1925, 1930, 1932, 1961 and 1966 brought the final capacity up to approximately 35,000. The stadium was the home of the Cyclones football team from its completion until 1975, when Jack Trice Stadium opened in the newly built Iowa State Center complex to the south of the main campus. Clyde Williams Field was razed in 1978. The site is now occupied by Eaton and Martin Halls, two residence halls constructed in 2002 and 2004, respectively.
The stadium was named for Clyde Williams, alumnus, coach and athletic director at the school in the early 20th century.

[[Birds of Western Australia]]

CATEGORIES: 1948 books, Books about Australian natural history, Books about Western Australia, Ornithological handbooks

The Birds of Western Australia is a book first published in 1948 by Patersons Press Ltd in Perth, Western Australia.  Its full title originally was A Handbook of the Birds of Western Australia (with the exception of the Kimberley Division), though with the publication of the 5th edition only the shorter form was used.  It was authored by Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittell.  It was issued in octavo format (228 x 148 mm) and contains 372 pages bound in blue buckram with a dustjacket illustrated with a painting of Australian Pelicans by Harley Webster.  It contains a coloured frontispiece of paintings of the heads of Meliphaga honeyeaters, with numerous black-and-white drawings and maps scattered through the text.
The book covered birds recorded within the Australian state of Western Australia except, as the full title of the first edition indicates, the tropical Kimberley region of its north.  It was the first Australian regional ornithological handbook.  In the Introduction the authors state:
 ”The need for some such Handbook as this one was impressed on the authors by their own early experiences in Western Australian ornithology.  Perhaps, however, they flatter themselves unduly for presenting to the bird-loving public a book which they like to feel is one of the type they wished had been available to them when beginning the study of local birds.”Serventy & Whittell (1948), p.1.
 
With regard to the layout of the book, they say:
 ”The first two sections deal with the history of Western Australian ornithology and a discussion of the bird geography of the State.  Though complete in themselves both are supplementary to the third section, the detailed treatment of the species of birds occurring in our area.”Serventy & Whittell (1948), pp.1-2.
 
The success of the book was such that, for many years, it was the principal source of information on the birds of the state.  Further editions appeared in 1951, 1962, 1967 and 1976, the fifth and final one being published by the University of Western Australia Press, with the length having increased by then to some 490 pages.  It was described later in the preface to the state’s next ornithological handbook as:
 ”…a landmark in Australian ornithology.  Its high standard and concise presentation provided a stimulus for a great deal of ornithological research in this State.”Johnstone & Storr (1998), p.ix.

Salmacisia is a genus of fungi in the Tilletiaceae family. It is a monotypic genus, containing the single species Salmacisia buchloëana, first described as Tilletia buchloëana in 1889, and renamed in 2008. Plants infected by the fungus undergo a phenomenon known as "parasitically induced hermaphroditism", whereby ovary development is induced in otherwise male plants. Because of the pistil-inducing effects of the fungus, the authors have named the species pistil smut; it is the only species in the Tilletiales order known to have hermaphroditic effects.

[[Larval hemolymph feeding]]
CATEGORIES: Myrmecology

Larval hemolymph feeding is a behaviour trait found in the queens of some species of ant. This is found mainly in the ants of the subfamily Amblyoponinae and give them the other name of Dracula ant. In colonies of the Amblyopone silvestrii the queens feed on the hemolymph (or insect blood, also spelt haemolymph) of their larvae when food is not available. This is said to be a precursor to trophallaxis in other ant families. The larvae themselves are not killed by this process. This behaviour is also seen in Proceratium and in Leptanilla the larvae have special organs that exude the haemolymph.  are exclusively dependent on the hemolymph of their own larvae as a nutrient, even when prey feeding is possible. On the other hand, the foundresses suppress larval hemolymph feeding (LHF) when prey is available, allowing them to rear the first workers more swiftly. The nondestructive form of cannibalism can be regarded as a nutritive adaptation related to: (1) the lack of social food transfer in this species, and (2) its specialized predation on large sporadic prey (centipedes). LHF similar to that in Amblyopone was found in Proceratium and another type of LHF, with a larval specialized exudatory organ, in Leptanilla.[tpl]cite journal|author=Masuko, K. |year=1986|title= Larval hemolymph feeding: a nondestructive parental cannibalism in the primitive ant Amblyopone silvestrii (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|journal= Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=19|pages=249–255|doi=10.1007/BF00300639|issue=4[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Masuko K|year=1989|title= Larval hemolymph feeding in the ant Leptanilla japonica by use of a specialized duct organ, the "larval hemolymph tap" (Hymenoptera: Formicidae).

[[Compressed data structure]]

CATEGORIES: Data structures

The term compressed data structure arises in the computer science subfields of algorithms, data structures, and theoretical computer science.  It refers to a data structure whose operations are roughly as fast as those of a conventional data structure for the problem, but whose size can be substantially smaller.  The size of the compressed data structure is typically highly dependent upon the entropy of the data being represented.  
Important examples of compressed data structures include the compressed suffix arrayR. Grossi and J. S. Vitter, Compressed Suffix Arrays and Suffix Trees with Applications to Text Indexing and String Matching], Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, May 2000, 397-406.  Journal version in SIAM Journal on Computing, 35(2), 2005, 378-407.R. Grossi, A. Gupta, and J. S. Vitter, High-Order Entropy-Compressed Text Indexes, Proceedings of the 14th Annual SIAM/ACM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, January 2003, 841-850. and the FM-index,P. Ferragina and G. Manzini, Opportunistic Data Structures with Applications, Proceedings of the 41st IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, November 2000, 390-398.  Journal version in Indexing Compressed Text, Journal of the ACM, 52(4), 2005, 552-581. both of which can represent an arbitrary text of characters T for pattern matching.  Given any input pattern P, they support the operation of finding if and where P appears in T.  The search time is proportional to the sum of the length of pattern P, a very slow-growing function of the length of the text T, and the number of reported matches.  The space they occupy is roughly equal to the size of the text T in entropy-compressed form, such as that obtained by Prediction by Partial Matching or gzip.  Moreover, both data structures are self-indexing, in that they can reconstruct the text T in a random access manner, and thus the underlying text T can be discarded.  In other words, they simultaneously provide a compressed and quickly searchable representation of the text T.  They represent a substantial space improvement over the conventional suffix tree and suffix array, which occupy many times more space than the size of T.  They also support searching for arbitrary patterns, as opposed to the inverted index, which can support only word-based searches.  In addition, inverted indexes do not have the self-indexing feature. 
An important related notion is that of a succinct data structure, which uses space roughly equal to the information-theoretic minimum, which is a worst-case notion of the space needed to represent the data.  In contrast, the size of a compressed data structure depends upon the particular data being represented.  When the data are compressible, as is often the case in practice for natural language text, the compressed data structure can occupy space very close to the information-theoretic minimum, and significantly less space than most compression schemes.

Elias Smith (17 June 1769 – 29 June 1846) was a preacher, physician, journalist and clergyman.  Smith, along with the preacher Abner Jones, founded a group of Christian Churches in New England that eventually merged with other like-minded, regional groups to become the denomination known as the Christian Connexion.  Smith founded The Herald of Gospel Liberty in 1808, which he claimed (in his autobiography) to be "the world's first religious newspaper". It was not the first in the world, but may have been the first in the U.S. The Herald had two purposes: (1) reporting news of revivals and (2) promoting "religious liberty", by which he meant an end to tax supported churches. (Several states had official tax supported churches at the time.)Hines, Michael. The Christian Chronicler
Smith proved to be a controversial figure in the Christian Connexion, leaving the denomination for several years to become a Universalist. Smith's apostacy to Universalism encouraged the Christian Connexion to more clearly define the boundaries of their beliefs and identity. Smith publicly renounced Universalism in 1823, but was not well received and reverted to it for a couple of years. Smith again attempted a re-entry to the Connexion with another repudiation of Universalism in 1827. His brethren were understandably hesitant to accept him, but his home congregation of Portsmouth, NH received him back in fellowship in 1840.Smith, Elias.  The Life, Conversion, Preaching, Travels and Sufferings of Elias Smith, pp 360–1.
Smith spent his later years as a vigorous proponent and practitioner of the Thomsonian system of herbal medicine, though he and Thomson had a public dispute and falling out in 1827. Smith died in Lynn, Massachusetts.Burnett, J.F. Elias Smith: Reformer, Journalist, Doctor; Horace Mann, Christian Statesmen and Educator.

Nickerson was born in Swanville, Maine in 1826.  He graduated from the East Corinth Academy in Maine and practiced law.  He worked as a U.S. Customs agent prior to the Civil War.
In 1861 Nickerson joined the 4th Maine Volunteer Regiment as a major.  He fought at the first Battle of Bull Run where he was commended by Oliver O. Howard.  He became lieutenant colonel, then colonel of the 14th Maine Volunteer Regiment and was sent to Louisiana.  He fought in the Battle of Baton Rouge and was subsequently promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on November 29, 1862.Eicher p.407
General Nickerson took command of the 3rd Brigade in General Thomas W. Sherman's 2nd Division of the Army of the Gulf.  He led the brigade at the siege of Port Hudson.  On May 28 Generals Sherman and Dow were wounded in the Union assault across the Slaughter Field, but Nickerson being the ranking officer in the division wasn't notified until later in the day.  Therefore the division briefly fought leaderless.Brig. Gen. Nickerson Nickerson led the division for only a short time until replaced by General William Dwight two days later.  Nickerson continued to lead his brigade throughout the siege.  He was transferred to command the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division in the XIX Corps during the Red River Campaign.  In July 1864 he was placed in command of the Defenses of New Orleans and resigned in May 1865.
After the war Nickerson resumed his law practice.  He died in Boston, Massachusetts in 1917.

[[Ken Snyder]]

CATEGORIES: Living people, Pennsylvania Democrats, Pennsylvania political consultants, American public relations people

Ken Snyder is a principal and co-founder of SnyderPickerill Media Group, a political media firm that specializes in the production of television advertising for political campaigns and candidates.  Snyder was formerly a prominent press secretary and public relations manager. He is best known for his work with Democrats, including John F. Street, Ed Rendell, and Vince Fumo.
He earned a master's degree from Loyola University Chicago and pursued a Ph.D. at University of Wisconsin. He began his career working on John F. Street's first campaign for Mayor of Philadelphia. In that position, he became known to Senator Vince Fumo, who hired Snyder to work in the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. During the 2002 United States Senate election in New Jersey, he managed the campaign for Bob Torricelli, a job that PoliticsPA called "masochism" and "a challenge and huge opportunity." After Torricelli was replaced by Frank Lautenberg on the ballot, Snyder stayed on the campaign and helped achieve victory.[tpl]cite web| title =Pennsylvania's Smartest Staffers and Operatives|work = PoliticsPA| publisher =The Publius Group| url = http://www./politicspa.com/FEATURES/smarteststaff.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040405121357/politicspa.com/FEATURES/smarteststaff.htm|archivedate=2004-04-05[/tpl]
Immediately following the Pennsylvania gubernatorial election in 2002, Fumo lent Snyder, who was one of Fumo's "key political staffers," to Ed Rendell, where he worked as acting press sectary for the Governor-elect from November 2002 to March 2003.[tpl]cite news | last = Neri| first = Al| authorlink = Albert J.

He is "considered by many ... to be among the most intelligent spokesmen and strategists around."

In July 2010, Snyder and fellow political consultant Terrie Pickerill formed SnyderPickerill Media Group. They met while working for David Axelrod on John Schmidt's unsuccessful 1997 gubernatorial campaign, and both cite him as a mentor.  Snyder's commercials for Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez were deemed "brilliant" by the Reader's Mick Dumke, and a reason Alvarez, a political unknown, was able to win her race in 2008.

"Russian Roulette" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna, for her fourth studio album Rated R (2009). It premiered on radio stations worldwide on October 20, 2009 and was released as the album's lead single on October 27, 2009 through Def Jam Recordings. Written and produced by Ne-Yo and Chuck Harmony, "Russian Roulette" is a pop beat-driven ballad that contains dark, haunting, morbid, and tense atmospheric elements. Lyrically, the single is about an abusive romantic relationship that ended abruptly. Critics noted the lyrical theme as a response to the domestic violence case between Rihanna and her boyfriend, fellow R&B singer Chris Brown.
"Russian Roulette" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many praising Rihanna's vocal performance and the song's lyrics. The song received commercial success, reaching number one in Israel, Norway, Slovakia and Switzerland. It also charted within the top ten of eighteen other countries worldwide, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and Sweden. The song reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also topped the UK R&B  and US Hot Dance Club Songs charts.
The song's accompanying music video, directed by Rihanna's regular collaborator Anthony Mandler, includes dark imagery depicting Rihanna playing a game of the titular Russian roulette with the character of actor Jesse Williams, with a revolver. Other scenes include Rihanna in the woods where she is run over by a car, in a gas chamber, in a padded cell, and shots being fired at her underwater. "Russian Roulette" has been performed on both sides of the Atlantic, including on the sixth series of The X Factor in the United Kingdom, and on the Late Show with David Letterman in the United States. The song was included on Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour (2010–11).

In 2002, it was merged with the Birdtail River School Division to create the new Park West School Division.Nick Martin, "School division mergers move through hearings", Winnipeg Free Press, A13; Nick Martin, "Ban expires, schools to close", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 August 2005, A6.
In 1985, the division made a controversial decision not to allow Manitoba Premier Howard Pawley to address a group of high-school students.  Trustee Len Derkach argued that the school board "wanted to keep politics out of the school system", although a spokesperson for the premier indicated that the talk would not have been partisan in nature.  The spokesperson added that Pawley had never been refused permission to speak to students before."School turns down premier's proposal to address students", Globe and Mail, 2 November 1985, A4.

A larger entity under the same name was then reestablished in the late 11th century and lasted until the mid-12th century, when its count elevated it into an independent Portuguese kingdom.

[[Burlingame's Fort]]
CATEGORIES: Forts in Kansas, Buildings and structures in Osage County, Kansas

In 1862 the citizens of Burlingame, Kansas, constructed a stone fort around the town well, in an intersection in the business district.  This was done to prevent the burning of Burlingame by Confederate guerrilla William Anderson, later known as Bloody Bill Anderson.  He and his family had lived in a neighboring county up to 1862, but Anderson got into considerable trouble and was forced to leave.  Upon leaving, Anderson threatened to burn Burlingame.Heidi Strohm-Stromgren, letter to William C. Pollard, Jr., November 3, 1993, p. 1; Pollard, "Forts and Miliatry Posts in Kansas:  1854-1865," (Ph.D. dissertation, Faith Baptist College and Seminary, 1997), pp. 13-4; History of the State of Kansas (Chicago:  A. T. Andreas, 1883), p. 1534.
The townspeople constructed the circular fort day and night until it was completed.  When completed the fort was twenty-five feet across and had a wall thirty inches thick, constructed of stone.  The wall was eight feet high and had twenty-five gunholes for its defenders to fire through if under attack.  Supposedly the fort was large enough to contain the entire population of Burlingame within its walls."Burlingame, Kas., Was Important Town in Days When Travelers Over Trail Passed Through Its Main Street," Kansas City Journal-Post, September 6, 1925, p. 3; James H. Rogers, "History of Osage County," The Osage City Free Press, September 14, 1876, p. 2; "Burlingame Church Built from Stones, Once Part of Old Fort," The Topeka State Journal, February 27, 1923, p. 6; Pollard, "Need Info," The Osage County Chronicle (Burlingame), October 28, 1993, p. 4; H. Dean Parsons, interview with Pollard, Burlingame, Kans., November 11, 1993; Kurt Kessinger, interview with Pollard, Burlingame, Kans., November 11, 1993.
The fort was manned periodically by armed men or troops.  When troops manned it, they camped nearby, not inside the fort.  When the area's men were called to duty to fight Confederates elsewhere, women and children manned the fort.  Mrs. G. W. "Aunt Fanny" Hoover commanded the fort during these times."Burlingame Church Built from Stones," p. 6; Mrs. Alice Mundell, "Pioneer Days of Kansas" (Parker, Kans.:  December 8, 1939), p. 2 (from The Osage County Chronicle Office, Burlingame, Kans.).
When the men left in September 1864 to meet the Confederate invasion under Maj. Gen. Sterling Price, Mrs. Hoover received word that the Union forces had been decimated.  She abandoned the fort, but the information about the defeat was incorrect.
After the Civil War the fort's stones were used to construct a Baptist church."Burlingame Church Built from Stones," p. 6; Kessinger interview.

In Great Britain, the term North–South divide refers to the perceived economic and cultural differences between Southern England and the rest of Great Britain (Northern England, Wales and Scotland). The divide cuts through the English Midlands.  Sometimes, the term is widened to include the whole United Kingdom, with Northern Ireland included as part of "the North".
In political terms, the South, and particularly the South-East (outside inner London), is largely centre-right, and supportive of the Conservative Party, while the North (particularly the towns and cities) is generally more supportive of the Labour Party as well as, in Scotland, the SNP. Support for the Liberal Democrats, and for many of the smaller parties, is generally more equally spread out. There is some criticism of this analysis in the West Country which has consistently provided a solid base for the Liberal Democrats, and also in places (particularly parts of Bristol, Devon, and Cornwall) which suffer from many of the same economic problems as the North.

Rigby was commissioned in the Royal Flying Corps on 22 May 1916. He joined 40 Squadron on 1 August, but left a month later due to illness. Subsequently, he joined 1 Squadron on 2 February 1918, being promoted to captain shortly thereafter. Piloting a Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5A, he scored his first victory on 13 March 1918, sharing it with fellow aces Percy Jack Clayson, Herbert Hamilton, William Patrick, Guy Borthwick Moore, and four other pilots. In the next two months, Rigby would singlehandedly rack up five more triumphs, the last being 11 May 1918. His final tally was one Albatros D.V set afire, two enemy planes destroyed, and three enemy fighters  sent down out of control. On 17 May, illness once again removed Rigby from duty.[tpl]cite book |title= Above the Trenches: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the British Empire Air Forces 1915–1920 |page= 321 [/tpl]

[[Constant (mathematics)]]
CATEGORIES: Algebra, Elementary mathematics

In mathematics, the adjective constant means non-varying. The noun constant may have two different meanings. It may refer to a fixed and well defined number or other mathematical object. The term mathematical constant (and also physical constant) is sometimes used to distinguish this meaning from the other one.  A constant may also refer to a constant function or its value (it is a common usage to identify them). Such a constant is commonly represented by a variable which does not depend on the main variable(s) of the studied problem. This is the case, for example, for a constant of integration which is an arbitrary constant function (not depending on the variable of integration) added to a particular antiderivative to get all the antiderivatives of the given function.
For example, a general quadratic function is commonly written as:
where a, b and c are constants (or parameters), while x is the variable, a placeholder for the argument of the function being studied. A more explicit way to denote this function is
which makes the function-argument status of x clear, and thereby implicitly the constant status of a, b and c. In this example a, b and c are coefficients of the polynomial. Since c occurs in a term that does not involve x, it is called the constant term of the polynomial and can be thought of as the coefficient of x0; any polynomial term or expression of degree zero is a constant.[tpl]cite book | last = Foerster | first = Paul A. | title = Algebra and Trigonometry: Functions and Applications, Teacher's Edition | edition = Classics | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-13-165711-9 | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ[/tpl][tpl]rp|18[/tpl]

Sara Szweber ([tpl]IPA-pl|ˈsara ˈʂfɛbɛr[/tpl]; born Pesl KatelianskaJack Lester Jacobs, Bundist Counterculture in Interwar Poland, Syracuse University Press, 2009, pg. 88 http://books.google.com/books?id=r9ZZta3xCvoC&pg=PA88&dq=Sara+Szweber#v=onepage&q=Sara%20Szweber&f=false.) (born circa 1875 in Brest Litovsk, died 1966 in New York)Gertrud Pickhan, "Sara Szweber" in Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/szweber-sara. was one of the leaders of the Bund and a trade unionist in Tsarist Russia, the Second Polish Republic and later in the United States. She was one of the few women that held leadership positions in the Jewish socialist and trade union movements of the late 19th and early 20th century.
Sara came from a family that was initially prosperous but became impoverished while she was young. Her parents died during her childhood and she was raised by her aunt. She worked as a dressmaker in a tailor shop which she helped to organize into a union shop. The workshop she organized, where all workers were paid the same wage and worked the same hours, was used as an example of a democratic workplace by the Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky in his novel What Is to Be Done?.
In 1900 Szweber joined the Jewish Labour Bund (The Bund) and became active in its educational activities and meetings. As a result, she was arrested by the Tsarist authorities in 1903.  After her release, during the Revolution of 1905 she headed a joint Polish and Jewish workers' demonstration in Kalisz and for the first time spoke before a large crowd. Afterward she moved to Lublin and then Łódź. She was arrested by the Russians again, imprisoned in Lublin castle,Nochum Winik, The “Bund” in Chelm and its Socialist-Revolutionary Work, translated by Howard Bergman http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/chelm/che129.html. and went on a hunger strike. Possibly because of the hunger strike, she contracted tuberculosis and was therefore released on bail. She took that opportunity to escape to Galicia where she later met her future husband, Elijahu Szweber, an activist who promoted the use of Yiddish.Henryk Piasecki, Sekcja Żydowska PPSD i Żydowska Partia Socjalno-Demokratyczna, 1892-1919/20, Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, 1982, pg. 226 http://books.google.com/books?id=RKFtAAAAMAAJ&q=Szweber&dq=Szweber. They lived there until the break out of World War I.
In 1918 Sara moved to Warsaw where she worked as a trade union official in the local garment worker's union. Later, together with the Bundist Victor Alter she headed a one hundred thousand strong labor union which joined together Polish and Jewish workers, the Landrat. According to Szweber, the activities of the Landrat were hampered by splits within the party which were being organized by Communist party members in the 1920s and '30s. While Warsaw Szweber became one of the members of Bund's Central Committee. In 1938 she was elected to the Warsaw City Council, together with sixteen other Bund members.
After the Nazi invasion of Poland Szweber initially escaped to the east, making her way back to her home town of Brest (which had been occupied by the Soviet Union). However, because she was a notable member of the Bund she was in danger of arrest by the NKVD. She managed to escape the Soviets via Vilna, eventually making her way to the United States.
In New York she once again worked as a dressmaker and remained active in the Bund émigré community. At the age of 90, she took part in Bund's fourth World Congress.

[[Toyota Camry (XV20)]]

CATEGORIES: Toyota Camry, Vehicles introduced in 1996, Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States

Introduced on September 3, 1996, the Toyota Camry XV20 is a mid-size car that was sold by Toyota between September 1996 and 2001 in Japan and North America, and 1997 and 2002 in Australia.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XZQVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iwsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3659,842946&dq=toyota+camry+1997&hl=en |title=Toyota lowers price of Camry |work=Manila Standard |date=1996-09-06 |accessdate=2014-04-29[/tpl] The XV20 series represented the fourth generation of the Toyota Camry in all markets outside of Japan, which followed a different generational lineage. The XV20 Camry range is split into different model codes indicative of the engine. Four-cylinder models utilize the SXV20 (gasoline) and SXV23 (CNG) codes, with MCV20 designating the six-cylinder versions.
The XV20 Camry continued as a sedan and station wagon (called the Camry Gracia in Japan), though the latter model was not sold in North America, where the sedan was launched in 1996 for the 1997 model year. The XV20 Camry was offered in 2.2-liter I4 and 3.0-liter V6 versions. This was the first Camry to be badge-engineered as a Daihatsu; the Daihatsu Altis sold in Japan was identical to the export version of the Camry. The Japanese Scepter ceased to exist as the Japanese Camrys adopted the [tpl]convert|1795|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] wide platform, thereby incurring an increased tax liability in Japan due to its extended length and width according to Japanese exterior dimension limits. The Vista began departing from the Camry, remaining [tpl]convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] wide and eventually forming the basis of the growing Corolla. In addition, the Vista's sheet metal resembled a tall, formal sedan, while the Camry became sleeker. The Lexus ES 300 was again built from the Windom, which uses the Camry chassis.
As Japanese yen soared in the mid-1990s, the redesigned Camry had less content than the previous model under pressure to reduce costs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111128/OEM01/311289957/1292 |title=Japanese play the risky game of removing content |date=2011-11-28 |first1=Mark |last1=Rechtin |first2=Ryan |last2=Beene |first3=Hans |last3=Greimel |work=Automotive News |accessdate=2014-04-29[/tpl] Following the debut of the XV10 in 1991, development immediately began under Kosaku Yamada in early 1993. Styling also began in 1993, with a winning design competition proposal "C" by Masahiko Kawatsu being chosen. The final XV20 design was later frozen in April 1994, 28 months ahead of scheduled production start in August 1996.

In August 1999 for the 2000 model year, the sedan models in North America received a mid-model upgrade to the front and rear fascias, this included larger headlights that now feature a four-bulb system instead of two, a separated grille with chrome surround, larger taillights, and larger body-side modeling.

[[Pyrrhias of Aetolia]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Aetolians, Hellenistic generals, First Macedonian War, Ancient Olympic competitors, 3rd-century BC Greek people

Pyrrhias ([tpl]lang-el|[tpl]lang|grc|Πυρρίας[/tpl][/tpl]) was an Aetolian general, who was sent by his countrymen during the Social War (220–217 BC), to take the command in Elis. Here he took advantage of the absence of Philip V of Macedon, and the incapacity of Eperatus the Achaean strategos, to make frequent incursions into the Achaean territories. Having established a fortified post on Mount Panachaikon, he laid waste the whole country as far as Rhion and Aigion. The next year (217 BC) he concerted a plan with Lycurgus, king of Sparta, for the invasion of Messenia. However, he failed in the execution of his part of the scheme, being repulsed by the Cyparissians before he could effect a junction with Lycurgus. In consequence he returned to Elis, but as the Eleans were dissatisfied with his conduct, he was shortly after recalled by the Aetolians and replaced by Euripidas. (Polybius V. 30, 91, 92, 94.) At a later period he obtained the office of strategos of the Aetolians, in the same year (208 BC) that this office was bestowed as an honorary title upon Attalus I, king of Pergamon. In the spring of that year he advanced with an army to Lamia to oppose the passage of Philip V of Macedon towards the Peloponnese. Though supported with an auxiliary force both by Attalus and by the Roman praetor Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus, he was defeated by Philip in two successive battles (First and Second Battle of Lamia) and forced to retire within the walls of Lamia. (Livy, XXVII.30) It is not improbable that Sipyrrhicas, who appears in Livy (XXXI.46) as chief of the Aetolian deputation which met Attalus at Heracleia, is only a false reading for Pyrrhias.
Pyrrhias was also an Aetolian Olympic winner in the stadion in 200 BC, according to the Chronicon of Eusebius of Caesarea.

[[Lumia (art)]]

CATEGORIES: Art genres

Lumia is the term coined by 20th Century Artist Thomas Wilfred to refer to art created from light.
Lumia as conceived, was a self-contained and silent art, not to be combined with music or dance. Wilfred, being a pragmatist, would occasionally experiment or collaborate with other artists and disciplines (most notably for a performance with Maestro Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Symphony at Carnegie Hall).
Though Wilfred intended the term to refer to any art created using light, its use was never widely adopted. Contemporary use of the term by artists are mostly artists themselves creating works utilizing Wilfred's visual vocabulary.
Lumia is distinguished mostly by its amorphous spindly moving forms.

[[Open hatch bulk carrier]]
CATEGORIES: Bulk freighters, Ship types

The open hatch bulk carrier, often referred to as OHBC or conbulker, is designed to offer direct access to the hold through hatches which extend the full width of the vessel. As a result, large cargo units can be lowered into place. If it is possible, the holds or hatches are designed around standard cargo unit sizes. Sometimes a gantry crane is fitted. There is special attention for cargo-handling shipping gear. These conbulkers are expensive because there is extra steel necessary to widen the hatches. This is crucial to provide strength. The open hatches are useful for forest products, such as pre-slung timber and logs. The heavy units are more easy to handle than in a conventional bulk carrier. The open hatch bulk carriers can also be used to carry containers on the outward leg, and dry bulk on the return leg. The first open hatch bulk carrier was built in 1962, for the use of paper trade.STOPFORD,M.,Maritime economicsr,3rd edition,2009.

This would make megaraptorans the last surviving allosauroids; at least one megaraptoran, Orkoraptor, lived near the end of the Mesozoic era, dating to the early Maastrichtian stage of the latest Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Benson | first1 = R.B.J. | last2 = Carrano | first2 = M.T | last3 = Brusatte | first3 = S.L. | year = 2010 | title = A new clade of archaic large-bodied predatory dinosaurs (Theropoda: Allosauroidea) that survived to the latest Mesozoic | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 97 | issue = 1| pages = 71–78 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-009-0614-x | pmid=19826771 | bibcode=2010NW.....97...71B[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Matthew T.

Healing the centurion's servant is one of the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels of Matthew Biblegateway Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke.Biblegateway Luke 7:1-10
According to the Gospels, a Roman centurion asked Jesus for help because his boy servant was ill. Jesus offered to go to the centurion's house to perform the healing, but the centurion suggested that Jesus perform the healing at a distance. When Jesus heard this, he said:
 
 Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, whern there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.

And the boy was healed at that very hour.

Based in Toulouse, Southern France, Les Siestes électroniques is a summer festival dedicated to emerging artists from the field of music & digital culture. Its motley line-up mainly focuses on electronic musicians and aims at a professional audience as well as the general public. The fact that its open air concerts are free of charge makes Les Siestes électroniques a rare occurrence within the landscapes of European festivals. Les Siestes offers an opportunity to experience contemporary music though concerts, club nights, workshops and sometimes exhibitions.

The festival runs for four or five days, usually starting on a Wednesday or a Thursday in the last week of June. Next edition of the festival will be held June 26-29 2014.

Les Siestes Electroniques has been an event by Rotation since 2002.
Since 2011 the festival falls into two editions. One takes place in Toulouse and the other in Paris at the Musée du quai Branly. Born of a reflection around the themes of the cultural diversity, the parisian edition proposes to musicians an exceptional access to the audio collection of the museum (dedicated to non-occidental cultures). These musicians will thus be invited to sample a set of resources of an unsuspected wealth, and then to replay it during an ultimate public event which is free and open-air

The Sidekick data outage of 2009 resulted in an estimated 800,000 smartphone users in the United States temporarily losing personal data, such as emails, address books and photos from their mobile handsets. The computer servers holding the data were run by Microsoft.[tpl]cite news |title=Data loss puts cloud on Microsoft |author= |newspaper=Financial Times |date=13 October 2009 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cce17b14-b78e-11de-9812-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss&nclick_check=1 [/tpl] The brand of phone affected was the Danger Hiptop, also known as the "Sidekick", and were connected via the T-Mobile cellular network. At the time, it was described as the biggest disaster in cloud computing history.[tpl]cite news |title=The Sidekick Cloud Disaster |newspaper= |date=13 October 2009 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/10/the_sidekick_cloud_disaster.html [/tpl]
The Sidekick smartphones were originally produced by Danger, Inc., a company that was bought by Microsoft in February 2007. After the acquisition, the former Danger staff were then absorbed into the Mobile Communications Business (MCB) of the Entertainment and Devices Division at Microsoft, where they worked on a future Microsoft mobile phone platform known as Project Pink.[tpl]cite news |title=Microsoft's Pink Struggles Spill Over To Sidekick |newspaper=ChannelWeb |publisher=UMB |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://www.crn.com/software/220600334;jsessionid=KCFRRMAUPYH2NQE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN?pgno=1 [/tpl] However, most of the ex-Danger employees soon left Microsoft to pursue other things.[tpl]cite news |title=The Sidekick catastrophe: A curse for Microsoft, but a blessing for Motorola? |newspaper=Betanews |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://www.betanews.com/article/The-Sidekick-catastrophe-A-curse-for-Microsoft-but-a-blessing-for-Motorola/1255361704 [/tpl] Microsoft took over the running of the data servers, and its data centers were hosting the customers' data at the time it was lost.[tpl]cite news |title=Danger no backups |author= |newspaper=The Inquirer |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1558214/danger-backups [/tpl]
In late September 2009, T-Mobile Sidekick phone users started noticing data service outages occurring. The outages lasted approximately two weeks, and on 10 October 2009, T-Mobile announced that personal information stored on Sidekick phones would be permanently lost, which turned out to be incorrect.[tpl]cite news |title=T-Mobile Sidekick data outage tests mettle of 800,000 customers, carrier |newspaper=ZDNet |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/gadgetreviews/?p=8306&tag=col1;post-11306 [/tpl]
According to the Financial Times, Microsoft said the data centre it acquired from Danger 18 months previously had not been "updated to run on Microsoft technology." A company statement said the mishap was due to "a confluence of errors from a server failure that hurt its main and backup databases supporting Sidekick users." T-Mobile blamed Microsoft for the loss of data.
The incident caused a public loss of confidence in the concept of cloud computing, which had been plagued by a series of outages and data losses in 2009.[tpl]cite news |title=From Sidekick to Gmail: A short history of cloud computing outages |author= |newspaper=Network World |date=13 October 2009 |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/101209-sidekick-cloud-computing-outages-short-history.html?hpg1=bn [/tpl] It also was problematic for Microsoft, which at the time was trying to convince corporate clients to use its cloud computing services, such as Azure and My Phone.
On 14 October 2009, a class action lawsuit was launched against Microsoft and T-mobile. The lawsuit alleged:
 T-Mobile and Microsoft promised to safeguard the most important data their customers possess and then apparently failed to follow even the most basic data protection principles.  What they did is unthinkable in this day and age.[tpl]cite news |title=Class Action Suit Filed after T-Mobile and Microsoft Lose Data |newspaper=PR NewsChannel |date=14 October 2009 |url=http://www.prnewschannel.com/absolutenm/templates/?a=1732&z=4 [/tpl]

Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer disputed whether there had ever been a data loss, instead describing it as an outage. Ballmer said, “It is not clear there was data loss". However, he said the incident was "not good" for Microsoft.[tpl]cite news |title=Ballmer: Sidekick outage 'not good' |newspaper=Network World |date=19 October 2009 |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/101909-microsoft-balmer-sidekick.html [/tpl]

Despite having an AB and PhD in clinical psychology, Wexler instead chose to work in genetics. Herself the daughter of a Huntington's sufferer, she led a research team into a remote part of Venezuela where the disease is prevalent. The samples that team collected were the key data allowing a global collaborative research group to locate the gene that causes the disease. Wexler participated in the successful effort to create a chromosomal test to identify carriers of Huntington's Disease.
Her older sister, Alice Wexler, also contributed to the field of Huntington's.

He ran unsuccessfully in a by-election held in St. John's later that year. In 1861, he became editor of the St. John's Record. Hogsett became leader of the Liberals in 1865 after John Kent and Ambrose Shea joined the Conservative coalition government.

Breadon Field was a minor league ballpark in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, located on the east side of MacArthur Road, about 0.5 mile north of the U.S. Route 22 interchange. It was named for St. Louis Cardinals owner Sam Breadon, who built the ballfield in 1948. In 1958, it was purchased by Max Hess, Jr, owner of the Allentown Hess Brothers department store. After the last team moved out after the 1960 season, and several attempts to obtain another minor league team failed, the facility was torn down in 1964.
After being razed, the former baseball field eventually was sold by Hess in October 1965.  The land was undeveloped for about a decade, going through several owners and eventually being incorporated into a larger tract.  It was developed into the Lehigh Valley Mall, which opened in 1976.  The site of Breadon Field is located approximately where the entrance road from MacArthur Road enters the mall parking lot.

The Jewish Socialist Verband (JSV) was a secular Jewish Yiddish-oriented organization founded in the United States of America in 1921 as a result of a political split in the Jewish Socialist Federation (JSF) regarding the Federation's position in support of the Bolshevik Revolution. With the disaffiliation of the JSF from the Socialist Party of America in 1921, the minority opposed to this formed the JSV, which became the SPA's Jewish language federation.[ref]
</ref> Prominent members of the JSV at its foundation included [[Jacob Panken]], [[Otto Branstetter]], Benjamin Feigenbaum, [[Charles Solomon (politician)|Charles Solomon]], B C Vladek, Alexander Kahn and [[Abraham Cahan]] (editor of the [[The Forward|Jewish Daily Forward]]).<ref name="NYT 1921"/>
In 1936 when the Socialist Party split, the JSV joined the "Old Guard" Social Democratic Federation. In 1957 when the SDF reunited with the Socialist Party the JSV and the SDFs largest local, New York, opposed this and founded the Democratic Socialist Federation.[ref]2 SOCIALIST UNITS VOTE FOR MERGER

[[Captive white tigers]]

CATEGORIES: Tigers, Zoos

Captive white tigers are of unknown lineage and likely of mixed ancestry. The Tiger Species Survival Plan devised by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums has condemned the breeding of white tigers. The genes responsible for white colour are represented by 0.001% of the population. However, in 2008–2009, a closing stock of 264 Bengal tigers and 100 white Bengal tigers were accounted for in Indian zoos. The disproportionate growth in numbers of the latter points to the relentless inbreeding resorted to among homozygous recessive individuals for selectively multiplying the white animals. This progressively increasing process will eventually lead to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability.Xavier, N.

The building is designed by Danish architectural practice Bjarke Ingels Group.

Each apartment has a "backyard" on the roof of the in front, lower-level apartment. The resulting courtyard panthouses are an attempt to balance "the splendours of the suburban backyard with the intensity of an urban lifestyle".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2008/02/17/mountain-dwellings-by-big/|title=Mountain Dwellings by BIG|publisher=Dezeen|accessdate=2009-06-23[/tpl] Throughout the building, it plays on a mountain metaphor as well as the clash between the urban vibe of the interior parking space as well as the surroundings and the peaceful and organic hillside

The Jewish Socialist Federation (JSF) was a secular Jewish Yiddish-oriented organization founded in 1912 which acted as a language federation in the Socialist Party of America (SPA).  Many of the founding members of the JSF had previously been members of the Bund in Eastern Europe and sought to bring Bundist politics to the socialist movement in the USA. The JSF split in 1921 over the question of the Bolshevik Revolution, the majority disaffiliating from the SPA and the minority forming the Jewish Socialist Verband (JSV) and affiliating to the SPA.  The JSF subsequently joined the Workers Party of America (which would later become the Communist Party USA).

Sir Henry de Bohun (died 23 June 1314) was an English knight, the nephew of Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. He was killed on the first day of the Battle of Bannockburn by Robert the Bruce.
Riding in the vanguard of heavy cavalry, de Bohun caught sight of the Scottish king who was mounted on a small palfrey (ane gay palfray Li till and joly) armed only with a battle-axe.Maxton, Sir Herbert, Robert the Bruce and the struggle for Scottish independence, 1909 De Bohun lowered his lance and charged, but Bruce stood his ground. At the last moment Bruce manoeuvred his mount nimbly to one side, stood up in his stirrups and hit de Bohun so hard with his axe that he split his helmet and head in two. Despite the great risk the King had taken, he merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe.Hyland, Ann. The Warhorse 1250-1600, UK: Sutton Publishing, 1998, p 38

Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI) is a patient pulmonary index which uses information from capnography and pulse oximetry to provide a single value that describes the patient’s respiratory status. IPI may be used by clinicians to quickly assess the patient’s respiratory status to determine the need for additional clinical assessment or intervention. 
The Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI) is a patient index which provides a simple indication in real time of the patient’s overall ventilatory status as an integer ranging from 1 to 10.  IPI integrates four major physiological parameters provided by a patient monitor, using this information along with an algorithm to produce the IPI score.  The IPI score is not intended to replace current patient respiratory parameters, but to provide an additional integrated score or index of the patient ventilation status to the caregiver.

In December 2012 - Mihai Apostol was arrested and charged with allegedly being involved with an elaborate Nova Scotia marijuana related seizure. Mr. Apostol has not been convicted, and or has any evidence been brought to his attorney's attention that he had any involvement or knowledge about the illegal activity.  As stated by a local resident of Mr. Apostol's community: "Mihai's name was used in the papers to bring publicity to the local police department".  This of course has tarnished Mr. Apostol's name for the time being, with having no criminal conviction.  The same local resident in the community has quoted: "''Mihai is a stand up citizen who attends charity functions and puts his time and heart into the community.  Especially at the canoe club, Mihai shares his previous Olympic experience with future competitors.  Mihai is absolutely the definition of a true gentleman".  Mihai intends to fight these charges and this accusation, and in the future seek for restitution for damages done.

The text, which is signed by Cormac Murphy O'Connor on the Catholic side and Mark Santer on the Anglican side, also gives a valuable portrait of Catholic teaching surrounding marriage, and why it is regarded as indissoluble.Anglican – Roman Catholic International Commission: Life in Christ: Morals, Communion and the Church

CATEGORIES: Flora of India, Dioscorea

Eklahare, or Himalayan yam, is a little-studied plant which appears above the ground as a low vine, but underground bears long, convoluted tuber growth stretching sometimes as deep as 2 metres. It is native to northern India. So far it has received very little attention from botanists, and its species has not even been determined or named, although its morphology and life patterns show it to belong in the Dioscorea genus, so it is tentatively referred to as Dioscorea sp. nov., literally, "new species of Dioscorea".
The tubers are edible, and are eaten during traditional religious festivals. Digging and selling taradi is a major source of income in the region, and there is even a village named Eklahare (Taluka District) due to the plant's abundance there.Dr. Chiranjit Parmar, in article "Taradi", The Heirloom Gardener, 2007.FAO Plant Breeding Newsletter, 1.01

The pilot episode of the television series Modern Family, written by Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd and directed by Jason Winer, premiered on ABC in the United States on September 23, 2009.

In the episode, Jay's family tries to function despite the age difference between himself and his wife. Claire's family tries to punish their son and watch over her daughter and her new boyfriend. Mitchell  tries to hide the fact that he and his partner Cameron have adopted a daughter in Vietnam from his family until Cameron invites Mitchell's family without consulting him (which is revealed to be the other two families).

After several years of political crisis, the government of Rafael Correa, elected in 2005 following the dismissal of Lucio Gutiérrez by Congress, proposed a new Magna Carta for the country with the goal of stability and social development. This constitution, approved in 2008, is the last episode of Ecuador's constitutional history.

When the University moved to its new site in Gilmorehill in 1870, the staircase was transported and incorporated into the new building, along with parts of the High Street gatehouse, which were rebuilt as Pearce Lodge. When the Main Building of the University was originally built, the West Quadrangle was not enclosed on all sides; instead, on the west side, a staircase stood at each end of a small landscaped garden leading from the elevated grass of the quadrangle to the lower level of The Square, where the Principal's and Professors' houses were. The Lion and Unicorn Staircase was the southern of these. The staircase is protected as a category A listed building.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=32922 |title=University of Glasgow Lion and Unicorn Staircase: Listed Building Report |accessdate=25 November 2011 |publisher=Historic Scotland[/tpl]
The quadrangle was subsequently enclosed when the new Memorial Chapel and additional facilities were built along that side between 1914 and 1929, and the Lion and Unicorn Staircase provided access to these from The Square. When first installed, in Gilmorehill, the staircase turned right at its middle landing, but was altered at this time to turn left. At its original site in the Old College, the staircase had led to the Fore Hall; amongst the new rooms created with the 1929 expansion was a hall, also called the Fore Hall.

The brigade was formed in June 1941, at Poona in India and assigned to the 17th Indian Infantry Division. Under the command of Brigadier George Ballentine, on establishment the brigade drew a mix of regular soldiers, reservists and new recruits to form three infantry battalions; various supporting units were formed between August and September. A signals section was formed in late December.[tpl]cite book |last=Wigmore |first=Lionel |title=The Japanese Thrust |series=Australia in the War of 1939–1945, Series 1 – Army |volume= IV |year=1957 |publisher=Australian War Memorial |location=Canberra |edition=1st |oclc=3134219 |page=290 [/tpl] Due to the rapid expansion of the Indian Army, the brigade suffered from a shortage of experienced leaders, with each infantry battalion having on average only three British officers and also lacking Indian viceroy-commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers. The brigade's manpower problems were made worse in late 1941 when an experienced cadre of 250 personnel were transferred from the brigade in order to form another unit. They were replaced by a large number of inexperienced soldiers, many of whom were under 18 years old. 
In January 1942, the 44th was transferred to Malaya Command which was giving ground to a strong Japanese force that had invaded Malaya the previous December. During the campaign on the peninsula, the brigade was involved in the Battle of Muar. After the withdrawal of British Commonwealth forces across the Johore Strait to Singapore, the brigade was briefly placed under the command of the Australian 8th Division in February 1942 and assigned to defend an area around the Causeway.Wigmore 1957, p. 297. The Japanese launched an invasion of the island on 8 February. The brigade took part in the subsequent fighting, but after a week surrendered to the Japanese along with the rest of the garrison on 15 February.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2009-10-19|publisher=Order of Battle|title=44 Brigade|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=6144&Tab=Su[/tpl]

Here the limestone was burnt to provide farmers with the lime to spread on their fields. The limestone carrier Laurina was wrecked at Kilve in 1876.
From Williton to Minehead the route is close to the track of the West Somerset Railway which opened in 1862 and was extended from Watchet to [tpl]stnlnk|Minehead[/tpl] by the Minehead Railway in 1874. Although just a single track, improvements were needed in the first half of the twentieth century to accommodate the significant number of tourists that wished to travel to the Somerset coast. Despite this traffic it was closed in 1971 but was then reopened in 1976 as a heritage railway.
Watchet is a harbour town, which, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, was plundered by Danes led by Ohtor and Rhoald[tpl]cite book |title=Portrait of the Quantocks |last=Waite |first=Vincent |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1964 |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |isbn=0-7091-1158-4 |pages= [/tpl] in 987 and 997. It is known that it was in frequent use by small boats in 1564 possibly for the import of salt and wine from France. During the English Civil War Royalist reinforcements for the siege of Dunster Castle was sent by sea, but the tide was on the ebb and a troop of Roundheads rode into the shallows and forced the ship to surrender, so a ship at sea was taken by a troop of horse.[tpl]cite book |title=Curiosities of Somerset |last=Leete-Hodge |first=Lornie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985 |publisher=Bossiney Books |location=Bodmin |isbn=0-906456-98-3 |pages=41–42 [/tpl] The primitive jetty was damaged in a storm of 1659 and a larger, stronger pier was built in the early 18th century supported by local wool merchants, although by 1797 the largest export was kelp made by burning seaweed for use in glass making. In the 19th century trade increased with the export of iron ore from the Brendon Hills, paper, flour and gypsum.[tpl]cite book |title=Somerset Harbours |last=Farr |first=Grahame |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |pages=125–137 [/tpl] Harbour trade was aided by the coming of the railway. In the mid-1860s two independent railways terminated at Watchet. The West Somerset Mineral Railway ran down from the iron mines on the Brendon Hills, and the West Somerset Railway came up from the Bristol & Exeter Railway at Norton Fitzwarren. Both lines made extensive use of the harbour at Watchet from where iron ore was shipped across the Bristol Channel for smelting at Ebbw Vale in South Wales. 
The foreshore at Watchet is rocky, with a high [tpl]convert|6|m[/tpl] tidal range. The cliffs between Watchet and Blue Anchor show a distinct pale, greenish blue colour, resulting from the coloured alabaster found there.

The Rabbinical Conference of Brunswick was a conference held in 1844 in Brunswick, convoked by Levi Herzfeld and Ludwig Philippson. Other attendees included Solomon Formstecher, Samuel Hirsch, Mendel Hess, Samuel Holdheim. Although he did not attend due to impending death, following the conference Áron Chorin, on his death-bed, wrote a declaration of his support of its conclusions.
Responding to the various complaints raised over the centuries against the Kol Nidre, the rabbinical conference decided unanimously that the formula was not essential, and that the members of the convention should exert their influence toward securing its abolition,"Protocolle der Ersten Rabbiner Versammlung," p. 41, Brunswick, 1844 before the following Yom Kippur.[tpl]JewishEncyclopedia|article=Conferences[/tpl]
The conference endorsed the Grand Sanhedrin's conclusions, except that they went further in relation to inter-faith marriage, arguing that the marriage of a Jew with the adherent of any monotheistic religion is permissible in Judaism, as long as the civil law in the place of marriage permits the children of such a union to be raised in the Jewish religion.
They also decided that the oath of a Jew would be binding if it invoked the name of God, regardless of any other consideration.
Some Jews opposed the decisions of the conference; Israel Moses Hazan wrote a letter condemning the reforms advocated by it.published in the collection "Kin'at Tziyyon," Amsterdam, 1846 Hirsch Lehren, circulated a letter among several rabbis, which in the autumn following the conference resulted in a protest, signed by seventy-eight Orthodox rabbis of Germany, Bohemia, Moravia, and Hungary, against the results of the conference.June 12-19, 1844; see "Univ.

[[Nicolao Dorati]]

CATEGORIES: Italian Roman Catholics, Italian composers, Renaissance composers, 1510s births, 1593 deaths, Madrigal composers, Italian trombonists

Nicolao Dorati (c. 1513 – February 1593) was an Italian composer and trombone player of the Renaissance, active in Lucca.  Although he was primarily an instrumentalist, all of his published music is vocal, and consists mainly of madrigals.
A few details are known of his life.  He was part of a family of musicians, many of whom were trombonists in Lucca, and he was born in that town.  A younger brother, Bartolomeo, also played the trombone.  Nicolao was hired as a trombonist by the city when it created the Cappella di Palazzo in 1543, and in 1557 he became director of that ensemble, a position he kept for the rest of his life.Gabriella Biagi Ravenni. "Dorati, Nicolao." In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08027 (accessed October 20, 2009).
Most of Dorati's surviving music was published in Venice. He produced three collections of madrigals for five voices (1549, 1561, 1567); a book of madrigals for from five to eight voices (1551); a collection of madrigals for four voices entitled Le stanze della signora Vittoria Colonna (1570); and a book of madrigals for six voices (1579).  In addition to this considerable output of secular music, he wrote at least three motets, two of which were for six voices and published in 1585, and one of which survives incomplete.  Additionally, a few works appear in publications primarily devoted to the music of others. As is usual with composers of the time, much of his music may not have been published and could be lost.  Even though he was a professional trombonist, he is not known to have written any instrumental music.
His madrigals often use the new time signature (C – the misura cromatica) rather than the increasingly archaic Image:mensural proportion1.gif, the misura comune.  Some of them use a declamatory and chordal style related to that concurrently being developed in Florence by Francesco Corteccia and others.  Other innovative features include the use of five or more voices, including division of the ensemble into two groups for the madrigals for six to eight voices (polychoral music was in its infancy in the mid-16th century, and even then was a relative rarity outside of Venice).
One of his madrigals, a setting of the several stanzas of Ariosto's romantic epic Orlando Furioso describing the charms of the sorceress Alcina, appears in a collection by Cipriano de Rore, indicating the esteem in which the composer was held, either by Rore or his Venetian publisher.  These same stanzas were set by numerous other composers of the same era, including a young Orlande de Lassus.Alfred Einstein, The Italian Madrigal.  Three volumes.

Kate Elizabeth "Katie" Piper (born 12 October 1983) is an English philanthropist, television presenter and former model from Andover, Hampshire. Piper had hoped to have a full-time career in the media, but in March 2008 sulphuric acid was thrown in her face. The attack, which blinded Piper in one eye, was arranged by Piper's ex-boyfriend and carried out by an accomplice; both men were arrested and are serving life sentences in prison for their crimes.
The attack took place in North London and Piper was treated in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where the surgeons removed all the skin from her face before rebuilding it with a skin substitute and then a skin graft. The procedure was the first of its kind to be completed in a single operation. Katie also underwent Ex-vivo limbal stem cell allograft transplantation (EVSCALT) at the Centre for Sight to restore her vision.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-16918223|title=Acid attack model Katie Piper gets sight back|date=7 February 2012|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 February 20012[/tpl]
In 2009, Piper chose to give up her anonymity in order to increase awareness about burn victims. The Channel 4 documentary Katie: My Beautiful Face was first aired on 29 October 2009 as part of the Cutting Edge series; it has subsequently been repeated on several occasions, made available for online on-demand access and sold internationally.
More recently, Piper has appeared in follow-up series for Channel 4, released a best-selling autobiography, and had a regular column in weekly magazines; however, she primarily works for her charitable organisation the Katie Piper Foundation.
In October 2013 she announced that she was pregnant. Piper gave birth to her first child, Belle Elizabeth, in March, 2014.

[tpl]About|Windmill Hill, Hampshire||Windmill Hill (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Windmill Hill[/tpl]
Windmill Hill is a chalk hill running alongside the A3(M) in the East Hampshire District of Hampshire, England, overlooking Chalton to the East, and Clanfield to the west. It measures 193 metres above sea level and is named so because of Chalton Windmill which sits upon its summit. This windmill is a grade ll listed building and lay derelict until the late 1970s, when it was restored and converted into a private residence.
On its northern slopes at Bascomb Copse sits Butser Ancient Farm, which moved there in 1991. The hill has numerous footpaths some of which lead to the small village of Blendworth and then to Horndean to the south, and Queen Elizabeth Country Park and Butser Hill, which is well within walking distance to the north.

[[Ross Island, Killarney]]
CATEGORIES: Archaeology of Ireland, Ancient Ireland

Ross Island is a claw-shaped peninsula in Killarney National Park, County Kerry.www.killarneynationalpark.ie Copper extraction on the site is believed to be the source of the earliest known Irish Pre-Bronze Age metalwork, namely copper axe heads, halberds and knife/dagger blades dating from 2,400 - 2,200 BC. These finds have been distributed throughout Ireland and in the West of Britain - in South Britain the metalwork was imported from across the Channel.p142-146, Richard Bradley The prehistory of Britain and Ireland, Cambridge University Press, 2007, ISBN 0-521-84811-3 
The archaeology of the site has unearthed both mining operations and a smelting camp where the Copper ore was processed into a type of metal distinctive enough to be traced these early tools. As there is no evidence that the complex technology had developed spontaneously, this early metallurgy would indicate contacts with mainland Europe - in particular, extending along the coastline from Spain through Normandy. The Ross island operation was associated with beaker pottery and continued until ca 1,900 BC

[[The Congressional Effect]]

CATEGORIES: Stock market

The Congressional effect is a stock market phenomenon where stock prices tend to show a correlation in performance and volatility to the operating schedules of the US Congress.  The phenomenon was coined as “The Congressional effect” by Eric T. Singer, a New York based finance professional and mutual fund manager.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.congressionaleffectmanagement.com/congressionaleffect.php |title=CongressionalEffectManagement.com |publisher=CongressionalEffectManagement.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14[/tpl]
Singer found that in aggregate, the S&P 500 Index performs better on days both houses of Congress are out of session versus days when both houses of Congress are in session.  There is also a decrease in volatility as measured by standard deviation.
Congressional effect management found that the S&P 500 Index had a daily annualized price appreciation of 0.31% on days Congress was In session from January 1, 1965 to December 31, 2008.  Over that same time span there was a 16.15% annualized price gain on trading days Congress was Out of session.  From January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 Congressional Effect Management shows an acceleration of the Congressional effect.  Over the aforementioned span in session days saw an annualized price decrease of −12.45% while out of session days saw an annualized increase of 8.81%. 
The effect was first reported on in Barrons on March 2, 1992 by Singer and entitled “Legislator, Go Home! –How Congress Can Help the Stock Market”.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.congressionaleffectmanagement.com/articles.php?id=1 |title=CongressionalEffectManagement.com |publisher=CongressionalEffectManagement.com |date=1992-03-02 |accessdate=2012-02-14[/tpl]

Inverquharity Castle is a 15th-century tower house in Angus, Scotland. It lies around [tpl]convert|4.5|km[/tpl] north-east of Kirriemuir, on the south bank of the River North Esk.
The lands of Inverquharity came to the Ogilvie family around 1420. The castle was first constructed as a rectangular tower in the 1440s, by Alexander Ogilvie, 2nd Lord Inverquharity. In the 16th century a wing was added to form a four-storey L-plan castle.
In 1445 a dispute between Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity and the son of the Earl of Crawford from nearby Finavon Castle culminated in the Battle of Arbroath in which Ogilvy and the Earl were killed.[tpl]cite web|title=Prospectus for Inverquharity Castle t|url=http://www.bellingram.co.uk/assets/0003/9759/KF_Inverquharity_Castle_-_Final.pdf|publisher=Bell Ingram|accessdate=25 January 2013[/tpl]
In the late 18th century, the tower was sold by the 5th Ogilvy Baronet, and the wing demolished. The castle decayed until the 1960s, when it was restored and the wing rebuilt. The original 15th-century yett, or iron gate, is still in place.  In 2014, a BBC documentary followed the sale of the castle from the owners who had restored and lived there for the previous 40 years.[tpl]cite web|title=Key of the Castle, BBC Two documentary t|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01nnztr|accessdate=1 March 2014[/tpl]  It sold in 2012  for £611,000 and this category A listed building remains a private family home.

thumb|right|20-hydroxyecdysone, a key regulatory hormone involved in cuticle development in insectsThe halloween genes are a set of genes identified in Drosophila melanogaster that influence embryonic development. All of the genes code for cytochrome P450 enzymes in the ecdysteroidogenic pathway (biosynthesis of ecdysone from cholesterol). Ecdysteroids such as 20-hydroxyecdysone and ecdysone influence many of the morphological, physiological, biochemical changes that occur during molting in insects.

[[Ispah Rebellion]]
CATEGORIES: Battles of the Yuan dynasty, 14th-century conflicts, History of Fujian, Islam in China, Rebellions in China, 14th century in China

The Ispah Rebellion (Chinese: 亦思巴奚兵乱; Pinyin: Yìsībāxī Bīngluàn) was a series of civil wars in Fukien (Fujian) of the Great Yuan Empire (present day China), occurring in the middle of 14th century. The term Ispah might derive from the Persian word "سپاه" (sepâh) meaning "army" or "Sepoy". Thus, the rebellion is also known as the Persian Sepoy Rebellion (波斯戍兵之乱; Bōsī Shùbīng zhī Luàn) in Chinese documents.
Under Mongolian rule, the number of Arabic and Persian Muslims residing in the Chinese seaport city of Quanzhou was greatly boosted. In 1357, an army of predominantly Muslims led by two Quanzhou Persians, Saif ad-Din (赛甫丁) and Amir ad-Din (阿迷里丁), revolted against the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. In defiance of Imperial forces, the army seized hold of Quanzhou, Xinghua (present day Putian), and even overreached themselves to the provincial capital Fuzhou. 
In 1362, the Ispah army collapsed into internal conflict and was eventually crushed in 1366 by the Yuan commander Chen Youding (陈友定).http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/chinese-iranian-vii

[[Volunteer-per-order]]
CATEGORIES: Royal Navy, Naval ranks

Volunteer-per-order was a name for a rating for young boys in the Royal Navy for young gentlemen who were training to become officers. The rating was introduced by Samuel Pepys in 1676 and the recipient received £24 a year and a letter from the crown which virtually guaranteed him promotion after the spending two years at sea and passing the examination for lieutenant.  The letter instructed the admirals and captains that the bearer was to be shown "such kindness as you shall judge fit for a gentleman, both in accommodating him in your ship and in furthering his improvement".[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Midshipman|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11th|volume=XVIII|page=423|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|location=New York|year=1911|editor-last=Chisholm|editor-first=Hugh|editor-link=Hugh Chisholm|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4FEEAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN11027773&lr=&as_brr=4&pg=PA423#v=onepage&q=Midshipman&f=false|accessdate=2009-09-15[/tpl]  
Volunteers-per-order took the place of a midshipman on board the ship, which originally was a post for an experienced seaman.  Because of their higher social class and the aforementioned letter, they were nicknamed King's Letter boys to distinguish them from rest of the crew.  Another method of entry into the Royal Navy was serving as a servant to one of the officers, and by 1732 the last volunteer-per-order entered the navy to be replaced by service as a servant, or attending the new Royal Naval Academy.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Midshipman|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11th|volume=Volume XVIII|page=423|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|location=New York|year=1911|editor-last=Chisholm|editor-first=Hugh|editor-link=Hugh Chisholm|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4FEEAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN11027773&lr=&as_brr=4&pg=PA423#v=onepage&q=Midshipman&f=false|accessdate=2009-09-15[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=King's Letter boy|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O225-KingsLetterboy.html|accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl]

Healing the mother of Peter's wife is one of the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels, namely in Mark 1:29-31, Luke 4:38-41 and Matthew 8:14-15.Biblegateway Mark 1:29-34 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:29-31&version=NIVBiblegateway Luke 4:38-41 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%204:38-39&version=NIVBiblegateway Matthew 8:14-15 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%208:14-15&version=NIVJohn Clowes, 1817 The Miracles of Jesus Christ published by J. Gleave, Manchester, UK page 31
In the Gospels of Mark and Luke this episode takes place after the exorcism at the Synagogue in Capernaum. Jesus goes to Apostle Peter's house. There he sees the mother of Peter's wife lying in bed with a high fever. Jesus touches her hand and the fever leaves her, and she gets up and begins to wait on him.
Following this, the Gospels report that at sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness or were demon-possessed, and laying his hands on each one, Jesus healed them and cast demons out of them (Matthew 8:16-18).

[[Choroid fissure]]
CATEGORIES: Human eye anatomy

The choroid is the middle, vascular coat of the eye which resides between the sclera and the retina. Early in development the choroid fissure is a groove that extends along the ventral aspect of the optic stalk. In effect, it is a continuation of the invagination that forms the optic cup during early development in amniotes. For a period of time this groove extends to the closing lips of the optic cup. During development it is through the choroid fissure that the retinal vessels enter and leave the eye. While optic neural components (e.g. axons arising from retinal ganglion cells in the sensory retina) do not lie in the groove that is the choroid fissure, they do extend through the portions of the optic stalk that form the walls of the fissure. These axons will form the optic nerve. The fissure is eventually sealed when the lips of the optic cup, as well as the edges of the groove in the optic stalk, fuse.  Failure of this fissure to close results in coloboma iridis.[tpl]cite book|last=Fix|first=James D.|title=High-Yield Neuroanatomy|year=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|pages=13[/tpl]

In mathematics, the term cosocle has several related meanings.
In group theory, a cosocle of a group G, denoted by   Cosoc(G), is the intersection of all maximal normal subgroups of G. Adolfo Ballester-Bolinches, Luis M. Ezquerro, Classes of Finite Groups, 2006, ISBN	1402047185,  p. 97
If G is a quasisimple group, then Cosoc(G) = Z(G).
In the context of Lie algebras, a cosocle of a symmetric Lie algebra is the eigenspace of its structural automorphism which corresponds to the eigenvalue +1. (A symmetric Lie algebra decomposes into the direct sum of its socle and cosocle.)Mikhail Postnikov, Geometry VI: Riemannian Geometry, 2001,  ISBN	3540411089,p. 98

CATEGORIES: Antisemitism in Germany, Political organisations in Germany, Germanic mysticism, Germanic neopaganism

Reichshammerbund (Reich Hammer League) was a German anti-Semitic movement founded in 1912 by Theodor Fritsch.
Based on The Hammer, a journal founded by Fritsch in 1902, the Bund argued that Jewish influences had contaminated Germany and attempted to argue that their racism had a basis in biology.Marius Turda, Paul Weindling, "Blood and Homeland": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940, Central European University Press, 2007,p. 441 The aim of the group was to co-ordinate the activities of the many small anti-Semitic organisations active at the time and to bring as many of these as possible under its banner.Heinrich August Winkler & Alexander Sager, Germany: The Long Road West, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 287 A movement rather than a political party, it sought to be above party politics and to instead encourage a renewal of the German way of life from an anti-capitalist perspective.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-45, Routledge, 2001, p. 151 The battle sign of the group was the swastika, making the Bund one of the first Völkisch movements to use the symbol.Steven Heller, The Swastika: Symbol Beyond Redemption?, Allworth Communications, Inc., 2000, p. 11 The founding document for The Hammer had been Willibald Hentschel's 1901 book Varuna, which preached racial purity and antisemitism.Richard S. Levy, Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 297
A sister organisation, the Germanenorden, also appeared in 1912 under Fritsch, although it was a clandestine group for leading members of society who wished to work in secret rather thsn the Bund which was open.Levy, Antisemitism, p. 269 The Bund itself was close to the occultism of the Guido von List Society as amongst its founder members were List Society activists Philipp Stauff, Eberhard von Brockhusen and Karl August Hellwig.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism, Tauris Parke, 2005, p. 45 It was Hellwig who drafted the group's constitution and who exercised effective control in the early days of the Bund.Goodrick-Clarke, Occult Roots, p. 126
They welcomed the outbreak of the First World War as an opportunity to banish softness from Germany and return the country to its harsh, militaristic roots.Turda & Weindling, "Blood and Homeland":, p. 443 From 1914 the group took a leading role in gathering anecdotal evidence relating to the involvement of the Jews in the German war effort, much of which later formed the basis of the stab-in-the-back legend.Michael Brenner, Rainer Liedtke, David Rechter, Werner Eugen Mosse, Two Nations: British and German Jews in Comparative Perspective, Mohr Siebeck, 1999, pp.177-8
In 1919 the group, at the instigation of Fritsch's friend Alfred Roth, merged into the Deutschvölkischer Schutz und Trutzbund as part of its continuing policy of forming an umbrella anti-Semitic movement.Levy, Antisemitism, p. 266

By combining chromosomal translocation, chromosomal inversion,and chromosomal deletion, chromosome engineering has been shown to identify the underlying genes that cause certain diseases in mice. In coming years, it is very likely that chromosomal engineering will be able to do the same identification for diseases in humans, as well as all other organisms.Ramirez-Solis, R., P. Liu, and A.

Cowichan knitting is a form of knitting developed by the Cowichan people of southeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The distinctively patterned, heavy-knit Cowichan sweaters, popular among British Columbians and tourists, are produced using this method. Cowichan knitting is an  acculturated art form, a combination of European textile techniques and Salish spinning and weaving methods. From this union, new tools, techniques and designs developed over the years.
Cowichan sweaters are also called Siwash Sweaters,[tpl]cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861734849/siwash_sweater.html |title=Siwash Sweater Definition [/tpl] Curling Sweaters or sometimes Mary Maxim Sweaters.

[[Debs and grads]]
CATEGORIES: School dances, Education in the Republic of Ireland

A debs or grad is a formal ball for students in their final year of secondary school in Ireland, analogous to the prom in North American schools or the school formal in Australia.  "Debs (ball)", from "débutantes' (ball)", is the usual name for girls' schools, coeducational schools, and some boys' schools; "grad" (from graduation) is often used in boys' schools. Debs occur at the end of the final year of secondary school. Each secondary school will host their own ball. Most schools have the debs in the autumn after the final year, but some chose to begin the final year with the debs. In some schools, before the debs, a smaller ball, known as a "pre-debs", "mini-debs" or "grads" is held; usually in January/February but sometimes as late as May. These are usually organised by someone other than the school itself. Traditionally a committee is created in the school to organise the event. 
Students sometimes worry about being invited or finding a date but many attend with friends or in a group, not worrying about the dating aspect. It is not uncommon for students to not go with their boyfriend/girlfriend and instead go with a friend. Whether the female asks the male, or vice versa, is irrelevant. Men are usually attired in dinner jackets with bow ties; however, some do go in ordinary casual suits. Women usually wear formal gowns or dresses adorned with a corsage given to them by their date. It is customary for men to purchase an orchid or bouquet of flowers and/or a box of chocolates. 
The debs is usually held at a hotel or other large function room. The debs usually, though not always, is a formal dinner, followed by music (usually pop,dance and rock music, but occasionally traditional Irish music) and dancing. Alcohol is served.
Traditionally there is a photographer present, who will take individual shots of each couple, and several throughout the night, of the dancing etc.. 
It is common for the event to last all night, hence attendees do not to return home until the following morning, often going for breakfast together. Sometimes the hotel will provide this. Usually, people return from the Debs about 6-7a.m.

The 1914–15 season was Stoke's sixth and final season in the Southern Football League.
After the resignation of chairman Hurst and manager Alfred Barker, the board elected Mr E. Reynish as the new chairman and brought Scotsman Peter Hodge as the club's new manager.[tpl]cite book|last=Matthews|first=Tony|title=The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City|year=1994|publisher=Lion Press|isbn=0-9524151-0-0[/tpl] With World War I on the horizon, there was debate as to whether football should be cancelled; it wasn't but a number of clubs in the Southern League Division Two withdrew, claiming it to be unpatriotic. Stoke had a good season and won the division with 38 points, which prompted the club to seek re-election to the Football League. They were successful in their efforts and after seven seasons in the wilderness Stoke could finally reclaim their place in the Football League. However at the end of the season war was declared and the league was indeed cancelled; Stoke would have to wait until 1919 to play league football.

[[Death of Khalil al-Mughrabi]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 deaths, Children in war, Palestinian casualties during the Second Intifada, Palestinian children, People from the Gaza Strip, Year of birth missing

Khalil al-Mughrabi, a Palestinian boy aged 11, was killed on 7 July 2001, by shots fired from an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tank while Khalil was resting with friends after a game of soccer in Rafah. Two of his companions, aged 10 and 12, were also seriously wounded. This incident took place during the Second Intifada.
The Israeli Army said immediately that their forces had been attacked and that they had returned fire. Palestinian sources and a friend of Khalil said they were part of group throwing stones at Israeli troops when al-Mugrahbi was killed. A later investigation by the chief military prosecutor found that the clashes that had involved Palestinians throwing stones and grenades at Israeli soldiers had broken up at noon, and that al-Mughrabi was killed at 7 P.M, seven hours after the clashes. The investigation found that, later in the evening, Palestinian adults and children had attempted to seal a road with debris and barbed wire, drawing warning shots from an Israeli tank, with one shot evidently killing al-Mughrabi, who had been playing football in a field a half mile away.
Despite having determined that the circumstances "must dictate a military police investigation", the military prosecutor cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing on the grounds of the violence that had taken place earlier in the day. An independent investigation by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said that the Israeli army's investigation of the incident amounted to a whitewash, calling the investigation "shallow and superficial" and that the actions by the Judge Advocate General "raises a serious concern that lying is considered legitimate practice in the office of the Judge Advocate General."[tpl]cite book|title=Terrorism and Tyranny: Trampling Freedom, Justice, and Peace to Rid the World of Evil|last=Bovard|first=James|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2004|isbn=9781403966827|page=281[/tpl] Human Rights Watch, commenting on the army's failure to investigate the al-Mughrabi case further, noted that in international law, the governing principle where there is credible or prima facie evidence of a possible violation of international humanitarian law is that an investigation is required.Human Rights Watch, Promoting Impunity, Human Rights Watch, vol.17, No 7 (E), June 2005 p.51.

Through his pioneering studies of watermarks, Stevenson solved "the most fascinating, and perhaps the most notorious, bibliographical problem of our time,"The Problem of the Missale Speciale, p. 1. the dating of the Missale Speciale or Constance Missal, an undated incunable (book printed before 1501) believed by many to pre-date the Gutenberg Bible (c. 1455), and possibly to have been the first printed European book. Stevenson proved that the book in fact had been printed nearly twenty years later, in 1473. Through similar analysis of watermarks, he also established that most block books,  small religious books in which the text and images were printed from a single woodcut block and which many believed dated from the early 15th century, had in fact been printed after 1460.

[[Discovery and development of TRPV1 antagonists]]

CATEGORIES: Analgesics, Drug discovery

Relief from chronic pain remains a recognized unmet medical need. Consequently, the search for new analgesic agents is being intensively studied by the pharmaceutical industry. The TRPV1 receptor is an ion channel that has been implicated in mediation of many types of pain and therefore studied most extensively. The first competitive antagonist, capsazepine, was first described in 1990, since then development of novel TRPV1 antagonists has come a long way. This effort has led to the identification of several TRPV1 antagonists that have entered clinical trials as analgesic agents. Should these new chemical entities relieve symptoms of chronic pain then this class of compounds may offer one of the first novel mechanisms for the treatment of pain, in many years.

Generally, the dance portrays troops riding horses, but another type of Kuda Lumping performance also incorporates trances and magic tricks. When the "possessed" dancer is performing the dance in trance conditions, he can display unusual abilities, such as eating glass and resistance to the effects of whipping or hot coals. Although the dance is native to Java, Indonesia, it also performed by Javanese communities in Suriname, Malaysia and Singapore.

[[Scientific myth]]
CATEGORIES: Mythology, Science education

A scientific myth  is a myth about science.  For example, scientific discoveries are often presented in a mythological way with a theory being presented as a dramatic flash of insight by a heroic individual rather than as the result of sustained experiment and reasoning.  For example, Newton's law of universal gravitation is commonly presented as the result of an apple falling upon his head.  Newton's observation of an apple falling did indeed play a part in starting him thinking about the problem but it took him about twenty years to fully develop the theory and so the story of the apple has been described as a myth.[tpl]citation |author=Scott Berkun |date=27 August 2010 |title=The Myths of Innovation |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |page=4 |isbn=978-1-4493-8962-8[/tpl]
The extent to which this occurs and is problematical is debatable.  Scientific historian Douglas Allchin suggests that mythical accounts are misleading because they present the results as handed down by authority figures and understate the importance of error and its resolution by the scientific method.[tpl]citation |title=Scientific myth-conceptions |author=Douglas Allchin |date=20 March 2003 |doi=10.1002/sce.10055 |journal=Science Education |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=329–351[/tpl]  In responding to this, Westerlund and Fairbanks agreed that romantic accounts of science tend to distort its nature but, in the case of Mendel's discovery of the rules of inheritance, they argue that Allchin's criticism of Mendel's role and reasoning is over-stated.[tpl]citation |title=Gregor Mendel and "myth-conceptions" |doi=10.1002/sce.20007 |author=Julie Westerlund, Daniel Fairbanks |date=7 June 2004 |journal=Science Education |volume=88 |issue=5 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20007/pdf[/tpl]

The Henry J. Wheeler Farm is one of the few remaining late 19th century farmsteads in the Salt Lake Valley that have not been lost to expanding housing developments of metropolitan Salt Lake City. Listed on the National Register of Historical Places since 1976, it is situated on [tpl]convert|75|acre|m2[/tpl] in Murray, Utah.[tpl]Cite document| last = Powell | first = Kent | last2 = Roberts | first2 = Allen D. | title = National Register of Historic Places Nomination: Henry J.

There are, in addition to the home, a granary, ice house, chicken house, and work shed. A barn, also built in 1898, burned down in 1973. Together, this complex of buildings, along with the fences, trees, stream, ice ponds, roads, constitutes one of the few complete and operating historic farmsteads in the county. It is currently operated as the Wheeler Historic Farm by the Salt Lake County Parks and Recreation Department.Wheeler Historic Farm website
The farm was established by Henry J. Wheeler, the third son of English Mormon converts, who came to Utah in 1852.  Born February 18, 1866, Henry grew up on his father’s farm in the South Cottonwood (now Murray) area. In 1886, at the age of twenty, he married Sariah Pixton and established his own farm in the vicinity of his father's farm.Beverly Wheeler Mastrim, “History of the Henry J, Wheeler Farm, Manuscript,Utah State Historical Society, Salt Lake City,, Utah The present brick home and several outbuildings were constructed in 1898 by Sid Gills and Hans Yorgensen. A Mr. Hayes, employed by the Sugar House Lumber Company, was the carpenter for the interior woodwork. The home, according to the 1902 publication, Biographical Record of Salt Lake City and Vicinity, "...was planned by Mrs. Wheeler and reflects great credit upon her knowledge of architecture, as it is not only homelike and convenient, but one of the prettiest little farm houses to be found in the county.Biographical Record of Salt Lake City and Vicinity; Containing Biographies of Well-Known Citizens of the Past and Present, National Historical Record Company Chicago, 1902.” 
The House was built upon a granite foundation, the interior walls were made of adobe, much of which was taken from a previous residence, while the exterior walls were of ochre brick, later painted white. The Wheeler home is Victorian in style. The building is roughly "L" shaped and has an entry tower at the nexus of the L, there were eleven rooms in the house. The bottom floor had a pantry, kitchen-dining area, and formal dining room, bathroom, living room, parlor, large staircase and hall. Upstairs were four bedrooms with walk-in closets and one large central storage closet. The interior was distinguished by its fine fireplaces, high ceilings, cherry and oak woodworking and staircase.
In 1969 Salt Lake County purchased the [tpl]convert|75|acre|m2[/tpl] which comprise today’s farm. Wheeler Historic Farm was placed on both the Utah State and National register of Historic Places in 1976. Originally started as a 1976 project of the United States Bicentennial of the American Revolution, the restored museum farm evolved into several buildings including a blacksmith shop, store, and reconstructed barn. An amphitheatre was installed in the 1980s, followed by a large "activity barn" in the 1990s that would function as a multi-purpose center. In the 2000s, Salt Lake County purchased remaining farmland south of the farm to create South Cottonwood Regional Park. Wheeler Farm is fully functional with farm animals and crops that are overseen by Utah State University's outreach programs. Granite School District uses the farm as an agricultural classroom for some of its vocational programs.

Vampirococcus is an informally described genus of ovoid Gram-negative bacteria, but the exact phylogeny of these bacteria is not yet known. They were first described in 1983, as small bacteria about 0.6 μm wide that attached to the surfaces of the larger photosynthetic purple sulfur bacterium Chromatium minus. Vampirococcus has since been identified as aquatic obligate parasite that is specific to Chromatium.  They are epibionts, attaching to the exterior of their host and attacking via a specialized cytoplasmic bridge. They are commonly mentioned as an example of epibionts when discussing strategies employed by bacterial predators.

[[Hybrid solar lighting]]

CATEGORIES: Solar thermal energy, Energy conversion, Lighting

Hybrid solar lighting (HSL) or hybrid lighting systems combine the use of solar with artificial light for interior illumination by channelling sunlight through fiber optic cable bundles to provide solar light into rooms without windows or skylights, and by supplementing this natural light with artificial --typically LED-- light as required.Technically, any combination of the use of natural and artificial light, such as e.g. simple windows and incandescent lamps, could be called hybrid lighting, but the term "hybrid lighting" is usually understood to mean hybrid solar lighting as defined here.
 
The bundles are led from exterior/rooftop optical light collectors through small openings or cable ducts and carry the light to where it is needed. The optical fibers end in hybrid luminaires where the sunlight is joined with electric light, either on demand or to automatically maintain a constant light level even as the available sunlight decreases.Maxey, Curt.

[[Groundwater-dependent ecosystems]]
CATEGORIES: Hydrology, Ecosystems, Habitat

Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are a vital yet poorly understood component of the natural environment. Typical examples of these systems are spring (hydrosphere) and wetland ecosystems where groundwater seep to soil surface occur. In these systems groundwater contribute to water and nutrients which maintain a rich and unique biodiversity adjusted to these special conditions. Also rivers receive groundwater particularly in low flows and dry conditions. Some terrestrial ecosystems such as forests may also depend on groundwater. 
Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are vulnerable to environmental change. Groundwater contribution can change due to i) regional changes, ii) reduced groundwater level and input and (iii) by increased seepage from ecosystems. The degree and nature of dependency of groundwater will influence the extent to which ecosystems are affected by changes in the groundwater system, both in quality and quantity.
Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are of special concern in EC groundwater directive. On-going research activities on these systems are financed by the European Community in the Seventh Framework Programme-project GENESIS - Groundwater and Dependent Ecosystems.

[[Coral reef protection]]

CATEGORIES: Coral reefs, Environmental protection

Coral reef protection is a process of maintaining healthy coral reefs. Two types of stressors are associated with reef systems: the natural and human-induced. The effects of these stressors can range from negligible to catastrophic.
Reefs are not well adapted to survive exposure to long-term stress. Some examples include agricultural and industrial runoff, increased sedimentation from land clearing, human sewage and toxic discharges.http://www.epa.gov/OWOW/oceans/coral/ Reducing these stressors mitigates the effects of increased ocean temperature associated with climate change.[tpl]cite doi| 10.3354/meps08584[/tpl]
Short-term stressors can also inflict damage, such as from boat anchors or accidental groundings. Boaters can protect coral by dropping their anchors on sandy patches of sea bed.Bartels, Paul. "Fragile reefs: handle with care." Cruising World 22.n1 (Jan 1996). 15 Oct. 2009 http://find.galegroup.com/gps/start.do?prodId=IPS. Accidental groundings by boats can obliterate large areas of coral reef. Lettuce corals and branching corals such as elkhorn and finger coral are extremely fragile, but even massive boulder corals can be crushed or snapped off and turned upside down to die by a sailboat keel. Groundings in sand, or even the churning action of propellers, can cause major localized siltation, indirectly killing adjacent corals.http://find.galegroup.com/gps/start.do?prodId=IPS

CATEGORIES: 1786 births, 1870 deaths, People from Ząbkowice Śląskie, People from the Province of Lower Silesia, Prussian politicians, Prussian Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars, German untitled nobility

Karl Adolf von Strotha (22 February 1786 in Frankenstein – 15 February 1870, in Berlin) was a Prussian officer and Minister of War from 1848 to 1850.
Strotha was born into an officers' family and joined the Prussian infantry in 1805 and participated in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. He was dismissed from active service due to the cutbacks in the army after the Prussian defeat, although he was made an ensign in 1809. In 1811, Strotha was re-activated as Lieutenant in the artilleryy. During the War of the Sixth Coalition he was in the Guard Battery. He participated in the battles of Lützen, Bautzen, Haynau, Kulm, Dohna and Leipzig.
In 1815 Strotha was made a First Lieutenant. A year later he was made a Captain and commander of a battery of artillery on horseback. He also traveled to several European countries. From 1827 to 1830 he commanded the artillery in Magdeburg. After that, he was a Major in a Guard artillery brigade. In 1842, Strotha was made a colonel and, in 1847 commander of the 3rd artillery brigade. In March 1848 he was made commander of the fortress of Saarlouis, and in May of the same year, was made a Major General.
In November 1848, Strotha became Minister of War in the Brandenburg government. He played a significant role in the military organisation of the counter-revolution, and had General Friedrich Graf von Wrangel march into Berlin. He later organised the fight against the revolutionaries in Dresden and in Baden, and the suppression of the Palatinate revolt.
In 1850 he submitted his resignation, due to differences of opinion between him and King Frederick William IV. His resignation was also caused by power disputes between the King and his minister. The King had made appointments without the minister's counter-signature that was usual in other ministries.
After his resignation as minister, Strotha was made a Lieutenant General in 1850, as well as commander of the 2nd Artillery inspection, and chairman of the artillery examination board, before retiring in 1854.
Strotha was a member of the first chamber of the Prussian parliament in 1849 and 1850, and was a member of the parliament of the Erfurt Union in 1850.
Strotha was the author of several works on military history.

The album features 40 songs which span their entire career (10 of them were determined by Japanese fan voting), and first issued by Universal Japan on April 22, 2009 (forty years after they signed to A&M Records).[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.asahi.com/showbiz/music/TKY200904300174.html 「カーペンターズは進行中」　デビュー４０周年に兄語る| title= ("Carpenters goes on": Elder brother of Carpenter siblings talks about their pop group's 40th anniversary project)| editor= Masayuki Nishi| language= Japanese| work= asahi.com| publisher=Asahi Shimbun| date=April 30, 2009| accessdate=November 23, 2009[/tpl] It was issued worldwide half a year later, leaving out its subtitle.
The cover art was taken from the photo sessions for the album Horizon, showing a healthy and glowing Karen and Richard.

In Japan, 40/40 received a commercial success upon its release. It debuted and peaked at the number-three position on the Japanese Oricon, making them one of the Western artists with the most top-ten albums in the history of that country's chart (following Madonna and The Beatles, tying with Queen, The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney/Wings).[ref]

The original Japanese release was pressed on the SHM-CD (super high material CD) with improved sound, while the cheaper international edition was issued on the standard CD format.

During this same period he gained a knowledge of metalworking, precision work and the design of musical instruments, as well as a proficiency in the composing of music.http://www.clockguy.com/SiteRelated/SiteReferencePages/LenzkirchHistory.html
The firm acquired a reputation for building particularly fine regulators.http://www.lenzkirchclocks.com/vienna-regulator-history.shtml Up to the 1920s it still produced regulators with compensated pendulums and precision movements.

"Mash-Up" is the eighth episode of the American television series Glee. The episode premiered on the Fox network on October 21, 2009. It was written by series co-creator Ian Brennan and directed by Elodie Keene. The episode sees glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) attempt to create a wedding medley in the style of a mash-up for his colleagues Emma (Jayma Mays) and Ken (Patrick Gallagher). Students Finn (Cory Monteith) and Quinn (Dianna Agron) find that they are no longer considered popular, while glee club members Rachel (Lea Michele) and Puck (Mark Salling) become romantically involved, as do cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) and local news anchor Rod Remington (Bill A.

The episode features covers of five songs. Studio recordings of three of the songs were released as singles, available for digital download, and three are included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1.

| bgcolor=#EEEEEE colspan=3 valign=top |Kennedy filed a statement respecting the Court's denial of certiorari, to note that, although he agreed with the denial in this instance, the petition for certiorari raised issues of constitutional importance.  In a class action lawsuit, the New Jersey state trial court had imposed the costs of class notification upon the defendants apparently for no other reason than their ability to pay it.  Kennedy believed that serious Due Process implications were raised if New Jersey law permitted this solely based on the relative wealth of the parties, without any consideration of the underlying merits of the case.  As the petition to the Court was interlocutory, however, due to the state courts denying leave to appeal, the Court would have to interpret state law without any state court opinion on the matter.  Further, the defendant had declared bankruptcy, and the applicability of the automatic stay raised an unrelated procedural obstacle to the case.  Kennedy believed that under those circumstances, it was best to deny the petition notwithstanding the substantive constitutional issues.

[[Gonzalo Soriano]]
CATEGORIES: Spanish classical pianists, 1913 births, 1972 deaths

Gonzalo Soriano (March 14, 1913[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]April 14, 1972) was one of Spain's most distinguished classical pianists of the twentieth century.
Born in Alicante, Soriano began studying music at an early age, but soon began to concentrate on piano. Graduating from the Royal Conservatory in Madrid in 1929, he went on to study piano and composition with Amzel in Lisbon. Back in Madrid, as a protégé of Manuel de Falla, whose work he played on numerous occasions, Soriano's talent soon began to be recognized. He enjoyed the company of Ramón Gómez de la Serna and a group of like-minded artists and writers. 
The Spanish Civil War interrupted his career and it was only after the end of the Second World War that he began to acquire a reputation in Europe, impressing the public and critics alike for his versatility, technique and musical sensitivity. He began to give concerts in Europe in 1947 and made his first U.S. tour in 1954 to considerable critical and commercial success. From this tour came the first American recording containing Albéniz's Suite española (Boston Records: B302). With the same company he recorded the Variations sérieuses by Mendelssohn, Schumann's Three Romances, Op 27 and Schubert's Sonata in A minor Op 164, all on a single LP (BR, B303). 
In 1955 he made his first tour of the Far East and in December 1959 visited the Scandinavian countries, which included a concert given before the King of Sweden on the occasion of the award of the Nobel Prize in Medicine to Dr. Severo Ochoa. Soriano recorded with the best performers and conductors. Among others, he worked with Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos on more than one occasion, recording with him the Nights in the Gardens of Spain and Concerto in D major for harpsichord, both by de Falla (Angel Records, 36131). Another memorable recording of the first work was done under the direction of Ataúlfo Argenta (Alhambra, MCC 30008). 
Victoria de los Angeles, outstanding soprano and a big admirer of Soriano's talent, was a keen collaborator for both concerts and recordings. It is said that the dialogue between voice and piano achieved a perfect balance when these two artists performed together in works by Frederic Mompou, Xavier Montsalvatge or Joaquin Turina. (20th Century Spanish Songs, Angel (S) 35775). Soriano is thought to have been one of the pianists best able to appreciate the talent of Montsalvatge and accept the challenge of interpreting some of his more difficult pieces. The composer wrote expressly for him, Sonatine pour Yvette being dedicated to the  composer's daughter and premiered by Soriano (recorded by EMI / His Master's Voice, FALP 874). Other great composers like Mompou and Rodolfo Halffter also wrote works for Soriano - in Mompou's case, No. 9 of Cançons i Danses was dedicated to him. 
Soriano died suddenly from a stroke on 14 April 1972 at home in Madrid, with his latest recording, Granados' Twelve Dances (EMI-Odeon, J 063-10913) still in production - a work that had already won the Grand Prix du Disque de l'Académie française. Soriano left a large collection of performances and recordings, including de Falla's complete works for keyboard (His Master's Voice, 053-00731 and 063-01289). He was survived by his mother, Consuelo Simó and his partner, John Ross who, after Soriano's death, joined a religious order of Benedictine Monks, remaining in retreat for 20 years before returning to his birthplace on the Big Island of Hawaii, where he resided in the city of Hilo until his death in 2013.

[[William & Mary Tribe football, 1970–79]]
CATEGORIES: William & Mary Tribe football seasons, 1970s in Virginia

The William & Mary Indians / Tribe football[tpl]ref label|Note 1|a|a[/tpl] teams represented the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, United States. Now known as the William & Mary Tribe, the program was established in 1893. Their long-time football rival is the University of Richmond. Their annual meeting is dubbed the I-64 Bowl (renamed the Capital Cup starting in the 2009 season), so named for the highway connecting the two nearby schools.
The 1970s was a time of transition for the William & Mary football program. Aside from switching head coaches after the 1971 season, the Indians would also eventually switch athletic conferences and create a new nickname. Prior to the 1977 season, William & Mary left the Southern Conference after having been a member since 1936. Then, effective as of the 1978 season, the NCAA decided to split their Division I status for schools into two sub-groups: Division I-A and Division I-AA. It was also this year that William & Mary switched their long-standing nickname, the Indians, to a more politically correct Tribe.
Though the overall decade winning percentage was below .500 (49–61–1), the era started off on a strong note. Future College Football Hall of Famer Lou Holtz, in his second year as head coach, guided the Indians to be the 1970 Southern Conference Champions and make an appearance in the school's third (and final) major bowl game. Though the Indians would lose the Tangerine Bowl, 12–40, they later took solace in knowing that they lost to a Toledo Rockets team who were in their second of three straight undefeated seasons (Toledo went into the contest ranked 15th by the Associated Press and would finish #12 in the final AP Poll). 
William & Mary had seven NFL Draft selections, and they were also able to split the decade's I-64 Bowl series with Richmond 5–5.

Samuel Nathan Blatchford (1925–2005) was an American soldier and civil engineer. 
His mother, Pauline Manuelito was the great-granddaughter of the great warrior Chief Manuelito who fought Kit Carson in the Navajo Wars (1869–63) and led his people in exile to the current Navajo Reservation.  
In 1941, Samuel Nathan Blatchford began his own journey as a warrior, enlisting into the US Army Air Corps pre WWII. At the age of 17, standing 5’9” and weighing 130 pounds it seemed unlikely that Samuel would make much of a name for himself as a warrior. 
During World War II, his plane was shot down and exploded midair over enemy lines. Thrown from the plane, he was able to pull the ripcord on his parachute before losing consciousness. Thereon in, he fought with the French before being captured and spending 18 months as a Prisoner of War in Stalag 17. Upon his rescue and return to the United States, he discovered that his fiancée, who presumed he was dead, had married someone else and was expecting a child. 56 years later, when both had become widows, they finally married.
All in all, Master Sergeant Blatchford earned 28 medals including; the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross with one oak leaf cluster, four Purple Hearts, six Air Medals and the Prisoner of War Medal. The French government presented him with its Freedom Medal for his work with the French Resistance, a Citizenship Medal bestowing honorary citizenship, as well as the key to the city of Lisio.Samuel Nathan Blatchford - Arlington Cemetery
In recognition of his life, the Lakota Sioux adopted Blatchford and gave him the Yellow Eagle Feather, the highest honor a Lakota warrior can receive. 
In between wars, Samuel earned a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering and a master’s degree in business administration. In addition to his native Navajo and second language of English, he also learned to speak Turkish, French, German and Japanese. 
Mr. Blatchford died at the age of 81 on December 23, 2005. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. 
In 2008, the US opened a $106 million military complex at al Udeid Air Base and named it the Blatchford-Preston Complex, so that the memories of Sergeant Samuel Blatchford and General Maurice A. Preston would not be forgotten."SECAF declares new complex officially open", February 7, 2008, U.S. Air Force

[[Historical trauma]]

CATEGORIES: Anxiety disorders, Clinical psychology, Mental health, Stress

Historical trauma (HT), in social work, refers to cumulative emotional and psychological wounding, exceeding over an individual lifespan and across generations, caused by significant group traumatic experiences. The historical trauma response (HTR) is a constellation of features in reaction to this trauma. 
The HTR may include substance abuse as a vehicle for attempting to numb the pain associated with trauma. The HTR often includes other types of self-destructive behavior, suicidal thoughts and gestures, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, anger, and difficulty recognizing and expressing emotions. Associated with HTR is historical unresolved grief that accompanies the trauma.Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart "The historical trauma response among natives and its relationship to substance abuse: A Lakota illustration." Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 35(1)
Historical trauma is an example of transgenerational trauma. For example, a pattern of maternal abandonment of a child at a young age might be seen across three generations.Abrams, M. S. (1999). Intergenerational transmission of trauma: Recent contributions from the literature of family systems approaches to treatment. American Journal of Psychotherapy, 53(2), 225-231. Significant original research on the mechanisms of transmission of intergenerational violent trauma has been done by Daniel Schechter. His work builds on pioneers in this field such as: Judith Kestenberg, Dori Laub, Selma Fraiberg, Alicia Lieberman, Susan Coates, Charles Zeanah, Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Yael Danieli, Rachel Yehuda and others. Schechter's work has included the study of experimental interventions that may lead to changes of trauma-associated mental representations that can help intergenerational cycles of violence.Schechter DS, Myers MM, Brunelli SA, Coates SW, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Grienenberger JF, Marshall RD, McCaw JE, Trabka KA, Liebowitz MR (2006).

CATEGORIES: Distance education, Mobile technology

Offline mobile learning refers to the ability to access learning materials on a mobile device without requiring an Internet connection.
Generally, web-based applications functionalities are dependent on ability to access to the Web. While there are many practical reasons why the application require an access to the data on server, every feature of an application may not necessarily need to have such real-time access and therefore it may be possible to enhance the user experience and wider applicability of application by providing offline access to certain features.
Before choosing which features to support locally (offline) and when to connect to the server, simply list all the features of your application as in Table 1 below and identify the need.
Table 1: List of features of web application and identifying need of connectivity.
Tasks that require a single service request are well suited to offline scenarios. Such tasks follow a "compose and forward" model, where the user specifies all of the required data for the service request, which is then forwarded to the actual service when the client reconnects. Examples of this type of task are: composing an e-mail, composing a meeting request, and entering order information. All of these tasks are discrete items that the user can complete offline and that result in a single service request.MSDN "Smart Client Offline Application Block". Retrieved on 08/01/2010.

[[Calming the storm]]
CATEGORIES: Christian miracle narrative, Miracles attributed to Jesus

Calming the storm is one of the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels, namely in Mark 4:35-41, Luke 8:22-25 and Matthew 8:23-27.Biblegateway Mark 4:35-41 Biblegateway.comBiblegateway Luke 8:22-25 Biblegateway.comBiblegateway Matthew 8:23-27 Biblegateway.com This episode is distinct from Jesus' walk on water which also involves a boat on the lake and appears later in the narrative, in chapter 14 of Matthew.
According to the Gospels, one evening Jesus and his disciples were crossing the Sea of Galilee in a boat when a furious storm came up, with the waves breaking over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion, but the disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"The People's New Testament Commentary by M. Eugene Boring and Fred B. Craddock (Oct 1, 2004) ISBN 0664227546 page 126 The Gospel of Mark then states that:
 
 He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?" They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"Mark 4:39-41.

Author Michael Keene commented that the Sea of Galilee was known for its sudden and fierce storms and that the Jews were people of the land who were generally uncomfortable at sea, specially since they believed the sea to be full of frightening creatures.Michael Keene 2002 St Mark's Gospel and the Christian faith ISBN 0-7487-6775-4 page 26
Author John Clowes commented that by asking the question "Why are you so afraid?" Jesus was asking his disciples to explore in their own minds the cause and origin of fear, so they would realize that all fear has its roots in natural affection and thought, separate from spiritual affection and thought. And by asking "Do you still have no faith?" Jesus was manifestly pointing to a defect in their spiritual principles. 
Clowes further commented that by that last question Jesus was manifestly instructing his disciples, and through them all future generations of mankind, that fear is the constant result of the weakness of Heavenly principles in the human mind.John Clowes, 1817 The Miracles of Jesus Christ published by J. Gleave, Manchester, UK page 47

[[Winchburgh rail crash]]
CATEGORIES: Railway accidents in Scotland, Railway accidents in 1862, 1862 in Scotland, History of West Lothian, Transport in West Lothian

The Winchburgh rail crash occurred on Monday 13 October 1862, a mile and a half northwest of Winchburgh in Linlithgowshire (now West Lothian).  At that point, the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway passes through a cutting on a curve. On the day of the accident, only one line was in use due to track maintenance when two trains met head-on. The drivers saw each other when they were some 300 yards apart and managed to slow down so that their relative speed was under 30 mph when they collided. The driver of the Glasgow train leapt clear prior to the impact and survived though badly injured, but both firemen and the driver of the other train along with 15 passengers were killed and 35 injured. One of the passengers made their way to a local home named Craigton House and commandeered a horse and cart to drive over 4 mi to Linlithgow, raise the alarm and summon doctors to the scene. A special train arrived from Edinburgh bringing workmen who laboured all night to free the dead and injured, and then to clear the wreckage; indeed the line was back in use the following day.
To prevent such collisions, the line was being worked by a pilot engine to escort every train through the length of single track. However, the pilot engine was being used for other duties and had waggons attached to it; moreover the distinctive small engine had been substituted for a larger one. The inexperienced pointsman saw a ballast train following the train from Glasgow and wrongly assumed it to be the pilot engine and so let the train through; just then, the Edinburgh train was approaching from the east.

[[Joseph Judah Chorny]]

Joseph Judah Chorny was a Russian traveller, born at Minsk in 1835, on the 20th April.
His parents arranged for him to start working in the wine-growing industry, but his real passion was for travel and exploration, and he soon abandoned wine-growing. For eight years Chorny, with practically no finance, explored a great part of the Caucasus, Transcaucasia, and many Asiatic countries; studying everywhere the life, customs, and history of the inhabitants, and chiefly those of the Jews. 
In 1875, on returning from his travels, he endeavored to publish his studies on the Jews of the countries he had visited, but failed to find the necessary money. He resumed the life of an explorer; and after five years of hardships and privations returned, in ill health and poverty, to Odessa, where he died, on the 28th April, 1880, shortly after his arrival.
Chorny was highly appreciated by the officials of the Russian government, and his studies on the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, published in various Russian papers, attracted the attention of the minister of the interior, Mikhail Loris-Melikov, who recommended Chorny to the protection of the governor-general of Odessa. The most noteworthy of Chorny's studies were:
Chorny bequeathed his manuscripts to the Society for Promoting Culture Among the Russian Jews; and the latter commissioned A. Harkavy to edit them. They were published with Harkavy's notes under the title Sefer ha-Massa'ot (Book of Travels), at St. Petersburg, in 1884.

Riverdell Hospital was an 80-bed hospital at 576 Kinderkamack Road in Oradell, New Jersey in the United States. The hospital was established in 1959 and thrived for many years until it became associated with the "Dr. X" murder trial of former chief surgeon Dr. Mario Jascalevich. In an effort to revive its sinking fortunes, the hospital renamed itself in 1979, but closed in 1981 because of declining utilization and was torn down in 1984.
Jascalevich was hired as a surgeon in 1962 and developed a surgical stapler that was named for him. A series of unexplained deaths occurred in 1966. Initial investigations by the Bergen County, New Jersey prosecutor's office found the deaths to be suspicious, but did not turn up any hard evidence of criminal action in the deaths. The case lay dormant for a decade, until M. A. Farber of The New York Times ran a six-month series of articles in 1976 that disclosed the fact that there had been 13 suspicious deaths at the hospital, referring to Jascalevich using the pseudonym "Dr. X". The case went to trial, with Jascalevich charged with three murders after two of the five original counts from the indictment were dropped. After what was then the longest criminal trial in New Jersey history, Jascalevich was acquitted.Berger, Joseph. "DR. MARIO E. JASCALEVICH DIES; JERSEY SURGEON IN 'DR. X' CASE", The New York Times, April 3, 1985. Accessed October 20, 2009.
A former administrator of the hospital told a reporter from The New York Times that admissions had dropped significantly once the hospital and doctor were identified in the media, and that the hospital's ability to attract qualified physicians had been severely harmed. The 80-bed hospital changed its name to Northern Community Hospital in 1979. By 1981 the decision was made to close the hospital, as only a third of its patient beds were filled and the hospital was losing a quarter of a million dollars annually. Efforts to turn the site into an alcohol rehabilitation center were turned down and the site became a target of vandalism. In June 1984, Riverdell Hospital was demolished. A 300-bed nursing home was proposed to fill the empty site of the demolished building.Parisi, Albert J. "ORADELL HOSPITAL IS RAZED", The New York Times, June 24, 1984. Accessed October 19, 2009.

[[The Haunted House (story)]]
CATEGORIES: Short stories by Charles Dickens, 1859 short stories, Works originally published in All the Year Round, Ghost stories, Christmas fiction

The Haunted House is a story published in 1859 for the weekly periodical All the Year Round. It was "Conducted by Charles Dickens", with contributions from others. It is a "portmanteau" story, with Dickens writing the opening and closing stories, framing stories by Dickens himself and five other authors:The Haunted House, Published in All the Year Round Extra Christmas Number 13 December 1859
"The Mortals in the House" (Charles Dickens)
"The Ghost in the Clock Room" (Hesba Stretton)
"The Ghost in the Double Room" (George Augustus Sala)
"The Ghost in the Picture Room" (Adelaide Anne Procter)
"The Ghost in the Cupboard Room" (Wilkie Collins)
"The Ghost in Master B's Room" (Charles Dickens)
"The Ghost in the Garden Room" (Elizabeth Gaskell)
"The Ghost in the Corner Room" (Charles Dickens)
The story appeared in the Extra Christmas Number on 13 December 1859. Dickens began a tradition of  Christmas publications with A Christmas Carol in 1843 and his Christmas stories soon became a national institution. The Haunted House was his 1859 offering.
Dickens's opening story, The Mortals in the House, is the strongest of the collection and demonstrates his mastery of storytelling and characterisation. When the narrator sees a deserted house from his railway carriage he becomes determined to take up residence there. However, the house is said to be haunted and the servants gradually become agitated. The narrator sends them away and invites a group of his friends to stay with him and fend for themselves. 
On Christmas Eve the friends arrive with the aim of discovering evidence of the supernatural. Secluded in their rooms for the holiday, the friends agree to keep silent about any ghostly experiences until they gather on Twelfth Night. 
The ghosts the characters see have no connection with the house, and are not even really ghosts; the stories are of injustice, terror, or regret. 
The tales are all very different, but each has an element of the strange and scary. Some of the house guests have heard stories from ghosts while others have had out-of-body experiences. Wilkie Collins tells a seafaring story of Spanish pirates and the torment of a candle that, as it burns, takes the narrator ever closer to explosion and death. Dickens himself contributes The Ghost in Master B's Room, a very peculiar tale of the ghost of innocence that hints at the author’s own feelings of melancholy. Elizabeth Gaskell contributes a strong story of working people in the north of England. The stories by the other authors are adequate. The closing story, The Ghost in the Corner Room, is again by Dickens.[tpl]cite web|url=http://charles-dickens.com/Charles-Dickens2.html |title=Charles Dickens Bibliography |publisher=Charles-dickens.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05[/tpl]

Due to the race's coincidence with French regional elections in 2010, the event was shortened to a half marathon, and Dennis Mehlfeld of Germany and American runner Heidi Freitag won the men's and women's races, respectively. The 10 km race continued as originally planned and a total of 1800 runners from 39 countries took part in the day's events that year.Merlino, Stephane (2010-03-21). 1800 take to the streets of Monaco for Half Marathon and 10Km.

[[Combo guard]]
CATEGORIES: Basketball positions, Basketball terminology

A combo guard is a basketball player who combines the attributes of a shooting guard (2) and point guard (1), but does not necessarily fit the standard description of either position. Such guards are usually within the 6'2" to 6'4" (1.88 to 1.93 m) height range.
Combo guards became prominent in the 1990s, when players such as Allen Iverson and Penny Hardaway were switched between playing point guard and shooting guard, depending on offensive and defensive situations. Combo guards use their ball-handling skills to bring the ball up the court and set up teammates, while also having the ability to shoot well.
The best combo guards use their "in-between" height and athleticism to their own advantage: smaller point guards will use speed and quickness to run past bigger players, while bigger shooting guards will shoot over the top of smaller players with their jump shots.
Historically, combo guards have been viewed as difficult for coaches to fit into an offensive system; however, combo guards have more recently become an important part of basketball, especially in the NBA. Dwyane Wade, a shooting guard with point-guard-like ball handling, led the Miami Heat to their first-ever NBA Championship in 2006, and won the Finals MVP award for the same championship series. In addition, the shift in the sport from a fundamental-driven style of play to one more scoring-oriented[tpl]clarify|date=January 2014[/tpl] means that the inferior passing ability of such guards is not viewed as a serious detriment. This shift is in part explained by hand-checking rules instituted by the NBA in 2007, which makes it a foul for a defender to use his hands to impede an offensive player. This allowed many smaller, weaker combo guards to use their speed to drive around stronger, taller players.http://www.nba.com/features/stujackson_bogpresentation_070503.html In fact, many shorter young players (6'2" or less) focus on developing their scoring abilities, whereas previously they would have to be proper point guards with the innate ability to pass to succeed in the professional leagues.
This is in contrast to "true" (or "pure") point guards such as Rajon Rondo, Deron Williams, Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Ricky Rubio and Jason Kidd (for the vast majority of his NBA career). These players exhibit a pass-first mentality, value assists and steals over points, and embrace the responsibility of playmaker rather than finisher. They conform to the perception that a point guard's duties are to direct the offense, distribute the ball, create scoring opportunities for others, and attempt the shot only if there are no open teammates to be found.
Some players, for example Tyreke Evans, Greivis Vasquez, James Harden, and Rodney Stuckey, have the requisite size for a shooting guard (around 6'5" or 6'6"), but due to their above-average passing and playmaking ability, are used as combo guards.
In the Euroleague, the most notable example is Vassilis Spanoulis, who has led his teams to 3 Euroleague championships. Other examples include American-born Macedonian player, Lester "Bo" McCalebb.

[[Schulklopfer]]
CATEGORIES: Jewish religious occupations

A schulklopfer is the person who calls a Jewish community to prayer in the local synagogue.[tpl]JewishEncyclopedia|article=schulklopfer[/tpl] In modern times, the custom has more or less died out[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl], but it was historically common.
The schulklopfer was usually a beadle, who would perform the task by wandering around the community, knocking on each household's door. In Neustadt, he would knock four times, in the pattern KNOCK - pause - KNOCK KNOCK - pause - KNOCK; Israel Isserlein (a famous rabbi from Neustadt) argued that this pattern was a reference to the Biblical phrase I shall come to thee and bless thee[tpl]bibleverse||Exodus|20:24|[/tpl] (in gematria, the letters of the first word of this phrase have the values 1, 2, and 1, respectively). In the Rhine, the custom was to strike merely thrice, in the pattern KNOCK - pause - KNOCK KNOCK. 
In mediaeval Eastern Europe, the schulklopfer also had the role of individually inviting people to marriage ceremonies (nissuin); the invitations were made to the entire community by the schulklopfer on the morning of the marriage ceremony itself (such ceremonies were usually an evening affair)[tpl]JewishEncyclopedia|article=marriage ceremonies[/tpl]
The name stems from the Holy Roman Empire (Germany) in the middle ages. Christians in nearby communities sometimes referred to schulklopfers as campanatores (a Latin term meaning bell-strikers) or as Glöckner (German for bell-striker); these were the terms which the Christian equivalents were given.

[[FIFA Puskás Award]]
CATEGORIES: Association football trophies and awards, FIFA, Awards established in 2009

The FIFA Puskás Award is an award established on 20 October 2009 by FIFA at the behest of FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) President Sepp Blatter in order to award the player, male or female, judged to have scored the most aesthetically significant and "most beautiful" goal of the year.
The award is in honor of Ferenc Puskás, the striker for Real Madrid team of the late 1950s and the 1960s, and central member of the highly successful Hungarian side of the same era. Puskás is widely considered by many to be the most powerful and prolific forward European football produced in first division football, and scored a once world record of 84 goals in 85 internationals. He is one of the top scorers of the 20th century with 512 goals in 528 matches.
"It is important to preserve the memory of those footballing greats who have left their mark on our history. Ferenc Puskás was not only a player with immense talent who won many honours, but also a remarkable man. FIFA is therefore delighted to pay tribute to him by dedicating this award to his memory," said Blatter at the inauguration of the award in Budapest.
The time-frame for the first award was July 2008 to July 2009. The annual award was presented for the first time during the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year Gala on 21 December in Switzerland, with the Portuguese player, Cristiano Ronaldo, being the first prize winner.

The Academia Antártica ("Antarctic Academy") was a society of writers, poets and intellectuals—mostly of the criollo caste—that assembled in Lima, Peru, in the 16th and 17th Centuries. Their objective was to author a body of literature that matched or surpassed that of Europe's and would prove that literariness indeed thrived in Spain's remotest colonies.See Chang-Rodríguez ("Ecos") 67. Members of this collective together published several anthologies of original writings and translations, the most famous of which are the Primera parte del Parnaso Antártico de obras amatorias (Antarctic Parnassus, Part One: Poems of Romance) and the Segunda parte del Parnaso Antártico de divinos poemas (Antarctic Parnassus, Part Two: Poems of the Divine).Neither volume of the Parnaso Antártico has been published in English. These titles have been translated by Dustin Hixenbaugh, a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin, solely to achieve clarity in this article. These are dated 1608 and 1617, respectively.See Vélez-Sainz.

[[Neue Marx-Lektüre]]
CATEGORIES: Marxist theory

Neue Marx-Lektüre (German for “New Marx Reading″) in its broader meaning refers to the reception of the economic theory of Karl Marx, which started in the mid-1960s in Western and partly Eastern Europe, in distinction from both Marxism-Leninism and Social Democracy. In its specific meaning, Neue Marx-Lektüre refers to a loose group of authors mainly from the German-speaking countries, who go beyond to revise a certain historising and empirical interpretation of Marx' analysis of economic forms which can be traced back to Friedrich Engels. 
Departing from the early approaches of Evgeny Bronislavovich Pashukanis and Isaak Illich Rubin in the 1920s, the works submitted by Helmut Reichelt and Hans-Georg Backhaus in the seventies and eighties, and the writings of Michael Heinrich in the nineties, were at the turn of the millennium a partly academic, partly off-academic debate concerning the question of how economic value has evolved. These authors, who meanwhile are labeled by the umbrella term Neue Marx-Lektüre distinguish themselves in a variety of aspects from the traditional Marx reading related with both, the workers movement and state socialism. 
The Neue Marx-Lektüre rejects
On the other hand, the authors of the Neue Marx-Lektüre in contrast to the academically dominant neo-classic economy maintain the relevance of the approach of Marx. Especially they insist that the micro-economic approaches of the neoclassic theory of economy can't explain the constitution, maintenance and dynamics of the economic value-relations, and only can exhibit insufficient theoretical means when it comes to macro-economic constructs such as e.g. the gross national income. 
On the contrary, they point out that Marx, although unable to answer these questions, nevertheless provides a higher degree of reflection and awareness for the problems, which has  to be recovered in a critical manner for the contemporary discussion.

The Pharmaceutical Management Agency or Pharmac is a New Zealand Crown entity that decides, on behalf of District Health Boards, which medicines and related products are subsidised for use in the community and public hospitals.
Pharmac was created in 1993 to ensure that New Zealanders get the best possible health outcomes from the money the Government spends on medicines. Trying to meet the public's growing demand for new medicines within a defined budget is challenging. PHARMAC has made a wider range of subsidised medicines available while staying within an agreed budget each year.
Pharmac has four main roles in New Zealand:
Pharmac's role has been expanded to include all medicines used in DHB hospitals, and in preparation for the national management of medical devices. On 1 July 2012, the management of the national immunisation schedule, and assessment of new vaccines, transferred to Pharmac from the  Ministry of Health.

Sometimes bulky amino acids such as valine or leucine are used in cases where conservation of the size of mutated residues is needed. 
This technique can also be used to determine whether the side chain of a specific residue plays a significant role in bioactivity. This is usually accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis or randomly by creating a PCR library. Furthermore, computational methods to estimate thermodynamic parameters based on a theoretical alanine substitutions have been developed.
This technique is rapid, because many side chains are analyzed simultaneously and the need for protein purification and biophysical analysis is circumvented.[tpl]cite journal | author = Weiss GA, Watanabe CK, Zhong A, Goddard A, Sidhu SS | title = Rapid mapping of protein functional epitopes by combinatorial alanine scanning | journal = Proc.

[[Healing the deaf mute of Decapolis]]
CATEGORIES: Christian miracle narrative, Miracles attributed to Jesus, Deafness, Communication disorders, Supernatural healing

Healing the deaf mute of Decapolis is one of the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels, namely Mark 7:31-37.Biblegateway Mark 7:31-37 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207:31-37&version=TNIV Its narration offers many parallels with the healing of the blind man of Bethsaida in Mark 8:22-26. 
According to the Gospel of Mark, when Jesus entered the region of the Decapolis after passing through Sidon and down the Sea of Galilee, some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. The Gospel of Mark then states:
 
 33 After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. 34 He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means "Be opened!"). 35 At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak." 

Commentator of Mark, Lamar Williamson, writes that this is the last unit in a series of miracles concerned with the identity of Jesus, as earlier confirmed by Apostle Peter's christological affirmation in Mark 8:29 where Peter exclaimed: "You are the Messiah".Lamar Williamson 1983 Mark ISBN 0-8042-3121-4 pages 138-140

Discovery Hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott during the Discovery Expedition of 1901–1904 in 1902 and is located at Hut Point on Ross Island by McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Visitors to Antarctica, arriving at either the US Base at McMurdo or New Zealand's Scott Base are likely to encounter Discovery Hut as all three are located on Hut Point. Discovery Hut is just 300m from McMurdo Base. The hut has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 18), following a proposal by New Zealand and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM35/WW/atcm35_ww003_e.pdf|title= List of Historic Sites and Monuments approved by the ATCM (2012)|accessdate=2013-10-27 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat |year=2012[/tpl]
Some confusion arises because Discovery Hut can correctly be referred to as Scott's Hut, in that his expedition built it, and it was his base 'ashore' during the 1901–1904 expedition. But the title 'Scott's Hut' correctly belongs to the building erected in 1911 at Cape Evans.

George Archibald Lingo (April 30, 1901 - May 21, 1976), was a Democratic politician from the U.S. territory of Alaska, commemorated as "a pioneer Alaskan in the true sense of the word."University of Alaska: George Lingo 1934-1943, http://www.alaska.edu/bor/history/george-lingo-1934-1943/, retrieved 20 Oct 2009.
A native of Anaconda, Montana, Lingo came to Alaska in 1918 with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Archie Lingo. He finished high school in Seattle at Lincoln High, then entered the University of Washington.David Tewkesbury and William Tewkesbury: Tewkesbury's Who's Who in Alaska and Alaska Business Index, Tewkesbury Publishers, Juneau, Alaska, 1947, pp. 47-48 After a short UW student career, in 1923 he enrolled in the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines. He received a degree in mining engineering in 1927.
After graduation, he worked with the Mount McKinley Tourist and Transportation Company and was active in the Mount McKinley Tourist Organization, putting the mountain on the map as a tourist attraction as early as the late 1920s. In 1932 he was elected to the Alaska Territorial Legislature from Fairbanks as a representative of the 4th district; he was 31 at the time, the youngest man ever elected to the House[tpl]dubious|date=April 2010[/tpl] and the first AAC&SM graduate to hold public office. He served two terms in the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives.
In 1934, he was appointed to the AAC&SM Board of Trustees. The following year, the Territorial Legislature, thanks in part to Lingo's efforts, changed the name of AAC&SM to the University of Alaska, and the Board of Trustees to the Board of Regents. He continued on the Board until 1943.
On May 15, 1935, he married Dorothy Minerva (Troy) Morgan, the younger daughter of then Governor John Weir Troy, in the Alaska Governor's Mansion in Juneau; they honeymooned in Mount McKinley Park. In September they moved to Anchorage, where he served as registrar and receiver in the U.S. Land Office, Third Division.
Shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Lingo enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to Naval Intelligence in Sitka. He retired from the Navy at the end of World War II in 1945 as a commander and moved back to Anchorage.
