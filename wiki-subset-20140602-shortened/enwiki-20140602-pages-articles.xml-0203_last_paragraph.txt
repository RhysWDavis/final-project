The Lady Lever Art Gallery was opened in 1922 by Princess Beatrice who was the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria; the museum was founded and built by Edwarian philanthropist the Lord Leverhulme. The museum is the best surviving example of late Victorian and Edwarian taste and is still the only major public urban gallery built by its founder to house the collection that the owner had assembled for it. The Lady Lever Art Gallery is set in the picture like village of Port Sunlight. Visitors inside will discover the most beautiful collections of fine and decorative art in the UK, along with many of the world famous Pre-Raphaelite artworks and beautiful Chinese ceramics and Wedgwood jasperware. The collections are an expression of Lord Leverhulme’s personal and favorite taste. He also mainly bought pictures which in his opinion would attract the housewives who were his main customers. He began collecting art in the late 19th century to use as advertising for the popular Sunlight Soap brand that helped to create his fortune therefore at this point he was collecting arts for business, but as he grew richer his collections began to expand, his confidence grew as well and had developed a taste for collecting. He mostly collected British art, he was also fascinated by Chinese art i.e. Chinese porcelain, Roman sculpture and Greek vases which he had chosen to collect to show the certain styles that had influenced British artists in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. The Eighteenth century furniture found its way into his collection and can now be seen on display along with everything else. The Gallery is famous for its Pre-Raphaelite paintings by Millais, Rossetti and Burne-Jones and holds works by Leighton, Turner, Constable, Gainsborough and Reynolds.

Due to its unique geography – the only place in hundreds of miles from which one can easily access the Colorado River – it historically served as an important river crossing and starting in the mid-1800s was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for whom it is named. Boat service at Lee's Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.
Lee's Ferry has also served as a military outpost for 19th century Mormon Utah, a center of limited gold seeking and since the 1920s the principal point at which river flow is measured to determine water allocations in the [tpl]convert|246000|mi2|km2|sing=on[/tpl] Colorado River basin.

[[Military ranks and insignia of Norway]]
CATEGORIES: Military ranks of Norway, Military insignia

The green part represents soldiers and the equivalent of non-commissioned officers. The blue part represents officers. Norway does not have a NCO-system and thus Sergeant and Quartermaster are grouped with the officers under the common designation befal. The officers are divided into three groups: The befal (company officers, ranks Ensign to Captain inclusive), the staff officers (stabsoffiser, ranks Major to Brigader inclusive), and the generals (Major General to General inclusive).
Fenrik (Ensign) was previously referred to as Second Lieutenant (Norwegian: Fenrik), while the rank of lieutenant went by First Lieutenant. The rank of Brigadier is not an old tradition in the Norwegian armed forces and was instated as a replacement for Oberst I (First Colonel); what is now Oberst was previously Oberst II (Second Colonel). 
As shown, the Cavalry have two ranks which differ from the regular Army: Dragon (Dragoon) instead of Menig (Private), and Rittmester (Master of the Horse) instead of Kaptein (Captain).
The ranks of Grenader and Matros are bestowed upon soldiers who have finished the 12 months compulsory service and have signed one or more three-year contracts to continue serving. The ranks of Visekorporal/Visekonstabel/Vingsoldat (Corporal/Leading Rate) are usually ascribed to soldiers with long and/or outstanding service, though may be bestowed on soldiers with extra responsibilities (e.g. the shift-commander among a group of soldiers on guard-duty). A UB-Korporal/Kvartermesteraspirant (Rate Corporal/Petty Officer-in-training) is a soldier who has finished the UB course (Utskrevet Befalskurs), a course intended to prepare conscripted soldiers for non-commissioned officer duties, but is still under training in "the field". After one year course and service these soldiers are qualified for the rank of Sersjant or Kvartermester.

CATEGORIES: Bulbuls, Monotypic bird genera, Birds of Asia, Birds of India, Pycnonotidae

The  Yellow-browed  Bulbul (Acritillas indica) is a species of bulbul found in the forests of southern India and Sri Lanka. It is mainly yellow on the underside and olive above with a distinct yellow brow. They are easily located by their loud calls but tend to skulk within foliage below the forest canopy. Three subspecies are recognised within its range and its generic placement has changed over time with some considering it as a sole species in the genus Acritillas.

Ergotamine is an ergopeptine and part of the ergot family of alkaloids; it is structurally and biochemically closely related to ergoline. It possesses structural similarity to several neurotransmitters, and has biological activity as a vasoconstrictor.
It is used medicinally for treatment of acute migraine attacks (sometimes in combination with caffeine). Medicinal usage of ergot fungus began in the 16th century to induce childbirth, yet dosage uncertainties discouraged the use. It has been used to prevent post-partum haemorrhage (bleeding after childbirth).  It was first isolated from the ergot fungus by Arthur Stoll at Sandoz in 1918 and marketed as Gynergen in 1921.AJ Giannini, AE Slaby. Drugs of Abuse. Oradell, NJ, Medical Economics Books, 1989.

[[Base level]]

CATEGORIES: Geomorphology, Erosion

The base level of a river or stream is the lowest point to which it can flow, often referred to as the 'mouth' of the river. For large rivers, sea level is usually the base level, but a large river or lake is likewise the base level for tributary streams. All rivers and streams erode toward sea level, which is also known as the "ultimate base level."[tpl]cite book|title=McKnight's Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation|author1=Darrell Hess|author2=Dennis Tassa|edition=11|year=2013|page=480[/tpl] If a river is dammed, a new base level (the level of the reservoir) replaces the ultimate base level. As a result, the stream’s base level is raised. Consequently, this reduces the stream’s velocity, leads to deposition, and a reduction of the gradient upstream from the reservoir. A rather rare exception can be seen in the Jordan River, for which the base level is the Dead Sea, 417 m below modern sea level. 
Base level is also significant for subsurface drainage. A low base level is a prerequisite for the formation of karst topography, a network of sinkholes and caverns that can develop as slightly acidic groundwater enlarges joints (by solution) in limestone rock. Often this network of underground drainage feeds back to surface drainage along the edges of larger rivers, which are the effective base level.
When the source of a stream is very high relative to its base level (high stream gradient), erosion proceeds rapidly due to the energy of the rapidly moving water and the topography becomes rugged, and it is considered a young stream (geologically speaking). When erosion has acted for a long geologic time, wearing down the high points and making a small difference between the source and the base level of a stream (low stream gradient), then the stream is called mature. Mature stream valleys have gentle slopes, rounded higher points and meandering courses.
A very hard layer of rock can form a temporary base level, until it is cut through. For example, Lockport dolomite has created a temporary base level for the Niagara River. Eventually this will be cut through as Niagara Falls recedes, and Lake Erie will be drained to near the lower base level of Lake Ontario.
Movements of land can greatly affect base levels. As an illustration, the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, combined with the opening of the Gulf of California to the sea, established sea level as the base level for the Colorado River and led to the (geologically) rapid erosion that resulted in the Grand Canyon.
The many meanders of the Kentucky River show that it was a mature stream with little relief. Uplift of the central Kentucky area rejuvenated the stream, causing it to cut a deep canyon, but preserving the meanders that indicate the stream existed prior to the uplift.
Other geologic processes can affect base levels. In the Finger Lakes of New York, Ice age glaciation greatly deepened the lake valleys and rejuvenated tributary streams. These streams have deep ravines and often waterfalls where hard rock layers slow erosion; they are said to be hanging valleys. 
Sea level can also change (primarily due to the formation or melting of continental ice sheets), and raise or lower the final base level for coastal rivers. Along the east coast of North America, river valleys extend out onto the continental shelf, indicating a time when erosion was possible due to the lower base level of a lower sea level in the past. Today many of these same rivers end in bays, indicating that sea level has risen in recent geologic time. This is referred to as a drowned coastline.

[[Carole Hersee]]
CATEGORIES: 1958 births, British costume designers, Living people, People from Redhill, Surrey

Carole Hersee (born 25 November 1958 in Redhill, Surrey) is a costume designer who is best known for appearing in the centrepiece of the iconic United Kingdom television Test Card F (and latterly J, W, and X), which aired on BBC Television from 1967 to 1998. As such she became the most aired face in British television history.Paul Sawtell, ‘Hersee, George (1924–2001)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2005
The card was developed in 1967 by her father, BBC engineer George Hersee, who started by snapping test photographs of Carole and her younger sister, Gillian, with Carole ultimately being chosen to appear on the card simply because Gillian was without her two front teeth at the time.Personal Column: Test-card special – The Independent, 27 May 2007 She was posed with a strategically placed Noughts and Crosses board (the "X" painted in the left centre square was directly in the middle of the screen) and her own clown doll named Bubbles, which was brought on set specifically for the photo shoot. She was paid £100 for the shoot.Talking about the Test Card – The Telegraph, 25 May 2007 The card was used on television in the UK and elsewhere for more than four decades, usually while there was no on-air programming.
Because of the card's prolonged exposure on the BBC, Hersee received fan mail during her teenage years and was regularly contacted by media outlets for interviews, but she quickly tired of the publicity. According to a November 2006 article featuring test card enthusiast Keith Hamer, Hersee is in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest television appearance in history — an estimated total of 70,000 hours, equivalent to nearly eight continuous years.The man who listens to test cards by choice – The Telegraph, 3 November 2006 However, she denied this in a May 2007 interview with The Telegraph, saying,  "It can’t be put in the Guinness Book of Records because it isn’t a record that somebody else can achieve, apparently." Hersee still owns the Bubbles doll, which she today keeps stored inside a box.
Hersee went on to attend Heath End School in Farnham, and as an adult became a seamstress for a supplier of theatrical costumes. She has designed costumes for several West End theatre productions and films, including The Last Emperor, Flash Gordon and Dangerous Liaisons.
On the 2006–2007 television series Life on Mars, Hersee was depicted as a fictional character called the Test Card Girl, played by Rafaella Hutchinson in Series One and by Harriet Rogers in Series Two. Appearing to the protagonist in brief visions, she would often taunt Sam Tyler (John Simm) and occasionally scare him greatly. She is the final character seen in the series when she mimes turning a switch at the side of the screen and the image disappears, similar to an old television set.

The celebrations begin in the early afternoon when a large fête takes place on the Land of Caanan park. At 6 pm the celebrations focus on Ottery's town square. Hundreds of 'pixies' (made up of local Cubs and Brownies dressed in pixie attire) capture the St. Mary's church bell ringers and drag them from the church to the square, where a reenactment of the pixies' banishment takes place.
The evening climaxes back in the Land of Canaan where a huge fireworks display takes place.

CATEGORIES: Torpedoes of Russia, Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union

Type 53 is the common name for a family of 53 cm torpedoes manufactured in Russia, starting with the 53-27 torpedo and continuing to the modern UGST.
With the exception of the UGST which uses Mark 48 style monopropellants, Soviet 53 cm torpedoes generally use electric power, or kerosene mixed with various oxidizers for propulsion. Russian torpedoes are often named descriptively for their characteristics - examples include "acoustic homing" or "electric torpedo", all in Russian acronyms.
The first Soviet torpedo with homing capability was the SAET-50. The 53-61 was the first Soviet homing torpedo to exceed 40 knots.
The 53-65 torpedo family are Russian made, wake-homing torpedoes designed to destroy surface ships. The 53-65 became operational in 1965, while the 53-65K and 53-65M both became operational in 1969. The 53-65KE is an exported version. China received an unknown number of 53-65KE torpedoes from Russia after purchasing 4 Kilo class submarines in the 1990s.

The RPK-2 Viyuga ([tpl]Lang-ru|РПК-2 Вьюга[/tpl], meaning blizzard), also designated 81R, and identified by NATO as Starfish and the United States Department of Defense as SS-N-15, is a Russian submarine-launched, nuclear-armed anti-submarine missile system, launched exclusively through 533mm torpedo tubes.
Analogous to the now retired Subroc missile carried by US Navy submarines, it is designed to be fired from a 533 mm (21 in) torpedo tube. It is boosted by a choice of mechanisms depending on model before clearing the water, firing a solid fuel rocket and delivering its payload up to 45 km (28 mi) away. The payload ranges from a simple depth charge to a 200 kt nuclear warhead.
The RPK-2 uses a 82R torpedo or 90R nuclear depth charge in the 533 mm version, and a 83R torpedo carrying[tpl]Clarify|date=September 2010[/tpl] or 86R nuclear depth charge in 650 mm version.
Both submarine- and surface-launched versions exist. The surface-launched versions are used by the Slava, Kirov, Neustrashimyy and Udaloy classes.  The submarine-launched versions are used by the Akula, Oscar, Typhoon, Delta, Kilo, and Borei classes. However, the munition package used in either is identical and hence the ship-launched version is launched into the water and submerges before firing its engines.

It can be proven that for any choice of β, the limit
exists almost surely. In informal words, the sequence behaves exponentially with probability one, and σ(β) can be interpreted as its almost sure rate of exponential growth.

SS-N-16 ''Stallion refers to a Soviet 650 mm anti-ship missile that was deployed between 1979 and 1981.  The name is a combination of the American designation of SS-N-16 and the NATO term of Stallion'' for Soviet RU-100s.
It refers to either
The 53.3 cm version carried either the 82R torpedo or the 90R nuclear depth charge. The 65 cm version carried the 83R torpedo or 86R nuclear depth charge.
Serving dual roles, the missile could be outfitted with either an RU-100 Veter, a 20 kiloton nuclear warhead for use against surface ships, or alternatively an RU-100 Vodopad, a Type-40 torpedo for use against submarines.[tpl]clarify|date=March 2011[/tpl]
Its increased range of up to 120 kilometres offered an impressive boost over its predecessor the SS-N-15 Starfish, which could only reach half the distance; although it meant refitting all the old 533 mm torpedo tubes to carry this new 650 mm torpedo.

Benjamin Jekhowsky ([tpl]lang-ru |Вениамин Павлович Жеховский[/tpl], born 1881 in Saint-Petersburg (Russia), died in 1975, Encausse-les-Thermes (France)) was a Russian-French astronomer, born in Saint-Petersburg in a noble family of a Russian railroad official. After attending Moscow University, he worked at the Paris Observatory beginning in 1912.  Later he worked at the Algiers Observatory (at the time, Algeria was a colony of France), where he became known as a specialist in celestial mechanics. After 1934, he appears to have begun signing scientific articles as Benjamin de Jekhowsky. The Minor Planet Center credits his discoveries under the name "B. Jekhovsky" (with a v). In modern English transliteration, his name would be written as Zhekhovskii or Zhekhovsky.  He discovered a number of asteroids, made more than 190 scientific publications and the asteroid 1606 Jekhovsky is named after him.

The Edge of Destruction (also referred to as Inside the Spaceship) is the third serial in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast in two weekly parts on 8 February and 15 February 1964. It was written by David Whitaker and directed by Richard Martin for the first episode and Frank Cox for the second.
In the story, the Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) are in the Doctor's time and space machine the TARDIS when it appears to be taken over by an outside force. The travellers begin acting strangely and turn against each other.
The serial is distinguished as a rare "bottle episode", in that the entire story is shot on a single set, with just the main cast. It also serves to resolve several character threads that had been presented over the previous eleven weeks.

[[Cartan's theorems A and B]]
CATEGORIES: Several complex variables, Topological methods of algebraic geometry, Theorems in algebraic geometry

In mathematics, Cartan's theorems A and B are two results proved by Henri Cartan around 1951, concerning a coherent sheaf [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] on a Stein manifold [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl]. They are significant both as applied to several complex variables, and in the general development of sheaf cohomology.
Theorem B is stated  in cohomological terms (a formulation that Cartan (1953, p.51) attributes to J.-P. Serre):
Analogous properties were established by Serre (1955) for coherent sheaves in algebraic geometry, when [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] is an affine scheme. The analogue of Theorem B in this context is as follows [tpl]harv|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Theorem III.3.7[/tpl]:
These theorems have many important applications.  Naively, they imply that a holomorphic function on a closed complex submanifold, [tpl]mvar|Z[/tpl], of a Stein manifold [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] can be extended to a holomorphic function on all of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl]. At a deeper level, these theorems were used by Jean-Pierre Serre to prove the GAGA theorem.
Theorem B is sharp in the sense that if [tpl]math|H 1(X, F) [tpl]=[/tpl] 0[/tpl] for all coherent sheaves [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] on a complex manifold [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] (resp. quasi-coherent sheaves [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] on a noetherian scheme [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl]), then [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] is Stein (resp. affine); see  Serre (1952) (resp. Serre (1957) and Hartshorne|1977|loc=Theorem III.3.7).

Zhang Yuzhe or Yu-che Chang ([tpl]zh|t=張鈺哲|s=张钰哲|p=Zhāng Yùzhé|w=Chang Yu-che[/tpl]) (16 February 1902 – 21 July 1986) was a Chinese astronomer who is widely regarded as the father of modern Chinese astronomy.http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987S&T....73Q.481. accessed 3 October 2006
He was born in Minhou, Fujian province. In 1919, he entered Tsinghua University and graduated in 1923. That same year he went to the United States and, in 1925, entered the University of Chicago and got his Ph.D. in 1929. That same year he returned to China and took up a teaching post at National Central University.
While studying in Chicago in 1928, he discovered an asteroid, which was given the provisional designation 1928 UF and later the number 1125. He named it "China" or "中華" (Zhōnghuá). However, this asteroid was "lost", that is, it was not observed beyond its initial appearance and a precise orbit could not be calculated (see lost asteroids). In 1957, the Purple Mountain Observatory in China discovered a new asteroid, and with his agreement the new object [tpl]mp|1957 UN|1[/tpl] was re-assigned the official designation 1125 China in place of the lost 1928 UF. However, in 1986, the newly discovered object [tpl]mp|1986 QK|1[/tpl] was confirmed to be a rediscovery of the original 1928 UF, and this object was named 3789 Zhongguo. Note "中国" (Zhōngguó) is the Mandarin Chinese word for "China", in pinyin transliteration, and Zhōnghuá is a slightly older word for "China".
From 1941 to 1950, he was head of the astronomy research institute at National Central University. From 1946 to 1948, he once again went to the United States to study variable stars. From 1950 to 1984, he was director of Purple Mountain Observatory, and, from 1955 on, he was a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
He devoted himself to observing and calculating the orbits of minor planets and comets. Many asteroids were discovered at Purple Mountain Observatory, as well as three new comets: two periodic, 60P/Tsuchinshan (Tsuchinshan 2) and 62P/Tsuchinshan (Tsuchinshan 1), and one non-periodic, C/1977 V1. Tsuchinshan is the Wade-Giles transliteration corresponding to the pinyin Zĭjīn Shān, which is Mandarin Chinese for "Purple Mountain".
He studied the light curves of asteroids and thus their rotation, and also studied the variable star CZ Cassiopeiae, and the evolution of the orbit of Comet Halley.
Zhang Yuzhe is credited by the Minor Planet Center for the discovery of 3789 Zhongguo under the name "Y. C. Chang". The asteroid 2051 Chang is named after him. The moon crater Zhang Yuzhe  is also named after him.

Wulfenite is a lead molybdate mineral with the formula PbMoO4. It can be most often found as thin tabular crystals with a bright orange-red to yellow-orange color, sometimes brown, although the color can be highly variable. In its yellow form it is sometimes called "yellow lead ore".
It crystallizes in the tetragonal system, often occurring as stubby, pyramidal or tabular crystals. It also occurs as earthy, granular masses. It is found in many localities, associated with lead ores as a secondary mineral associated with the oxidized zone of lead deposits.  It is also a secondary ore of molybdenum, and is sought by collectors.

Federico da Montefeltro, also known as Federico III da Montefeltro (7 June 1422 – 10 September 1482), was one of the most successful condottieri of the Italian Renaissance, and lord of Urbino from 1444 (as Duke from 1474) until his death. In Urbino he commissioned the construction of a great library, perhaps the largest of Italy after the Vatican, with his own team of scribes in his scriptorium, and assembled around him a  large humanistic court in  the Ducal Palace of Urbino, designed by Luciano Laurana and Francesco di Giorgio Martini.

[[Radioactive contamination]]
CATEGORIES: Radioactive contamination, Radioactive waste, Nuclear accidents and incidents, Nuclear safety, Radiobiology, Hazards, Pollution, Radiation accidents and incidents

Radioactive contamination, also called radiological contamination, is the deposition of, or presence of radioactive substances on surfaces or within solids, liquids or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable (from IAEA definition).[tpl]cite book |title=IAEA Safety Glossary: Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn=92-0-100707-8 |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1290_web.pdf |accessdate=[/tpl]
Such contamination presents a hazard because of the radioactive decay of the contaminants, which emit harmful ionising radiation such as alpha or beta particles, gamma rays or neutrons. The degree of hazard is determined by the concentration of the contaminants, the energy of the radiation being emitted, the type of radiation, and the proximity of the contamination to organs of the body. It is important to be clear that the contamination gives rise to the radiation hazard, and the terms "radiation" and "contamination" are not interchangeable.
Contamination may affect a person, a place, an animal, or an object such as clothing. Following an atmospheric nuclear weapon discharge or a nuclear reactor containment breach, the air, soil, people, plants, and animals in the vicinity will become contaminated by nuclear fuel and fission products. A spilled vial of radioactive material like uranyl nitrate may contaminate the floor and any rags used to wipe up the spill. Cases of widespread radioactive contamination include the Bikini Atoll, the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the Chernobyl disaster, and the area around the Mayak facility in Russia.

[[Parachurch organization]]

CATEGORIES: Evangelical parachurch organisations, Social welfare parachurch organizations, Christian parachurch organizations, Christian terms

Parachurch organizations are Christian faith-based organizations that work outside of and across denominations to engage in social welfare and evangelism, usually independent of church oversight. These bodies can be businesses, non-profit corporations, or private associations. Most parachurch organizations, at least those normally called parachurch, are Protestant and Evangelical. Some of these organizations cater to a defined spectrum among evangelical beliefs, but most are self-consciously interdenominational and many are ecumenical.
In Protestant and Catholic theology, parachurch organizations are termed sodality, as distinct from modality, which is the structure and organization of the local or universal church.

The company was formed by the privatisation of the British Airports Authority as BAA plc, and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
The company was bought in 2006 and taken private by a consortium led by Ferrovial, a Spanish firm specialising in the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of transport, urban and services infrastructure. The company's head office is located in The Compass Centre on the grounds of London Heathrow Airport in the London Borough of Hillingdon.
The company makes money from charging landing fees to airlines and increasingly from ancillary operations within those airports such as retail and property. It owns and operates four airports within the UK. Even under the name BAA, it did not operate all UK airports as most are in the ownership of local authorities or other corporations. The company was renamed as Heathrow Airport Holdings in 2012 to reflect Heathrow Airport being its main business.

Marjorie Rice (born 1923, St. Petersburg, Florida) is an American amateur mathematician most famous for her discoveries in geometry. http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/jbperplex.htm She lives in San Diego.
In 1975, Rice came across a Scientific American article on tessellations. Despite having only a high-school education, she began devoting her free time to discovering new ways to tile the plane using pentagons. She developed her own system of notation to represent the constraints on and relationships between the sides and angles of the polygons and used it to discover three new types of tessellating pentagons and over sixty distinct tessellations by pentagons by 1977.  http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/jbperplex.htm Rice's work was eventually examined by mathematics professor Doris Schattschneider, who deciphered the unusual notation and formally announced her discoveries to the mathematics community. http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/jbperplex.htm

[[Low-dimensional topology]]
CATEGORIES: Geometric topology

In mathematics, low-dimensional topology is the branch of topology that studies manifolds of four or fewer dimensions.  Representative topics are the structure theory of 3-manifolds and 4-manifolds, knot theory, and braid groups.  It can be regarded as a part of geometric topology.
A number of advances starting in the 1960s had the effect of emphasising low dimensions in topology. The solution by Smale, in 1961, of the Poincaré conjecture in higher dimensions made dimensions three and four seem the hardest; and indeed they required new methods, while the freedom of higher dimensions meant that questions could be reduced to computational methods available in surgery theory.  Thurston's geometrization conjecture, formulated in the late 1970s, offered a framework that suggested geometry and topology were closely intertwined in low dimensions, and Thurston's proof of geometrization for Haken manifolds utilized a variety of tools from previously only weakly linked areas of mathematics.  Vaughan Jones' discovery of the Jones polynomial in the early 1980s not only led knot theory in new directions but gave rise to still mysterious connections between low-dimensional topology and mathematical physics.  In 2002 Grigori Perelman announced a proof of the three-dimensional Poincaré  conjecture, using Richard Hamilton's Ricci flow, an idea belonging to the field of geometric analysis.   
Overall, this progress has led to better integration of the field into the rest of mathematics.

radio engineering and mathematics. He is now famous for his mathematical discoveries in number theory.
Heegner was born and died in Berlin.  In 1952 he published what he claimed was the solution of a classic problem proposed by the great mathematician Gauss, the class number 1 problem, a significant and longstanding problem in number theory. Heegner's work was not accepted for years, due mainly to mistakes in the paper. Heegner's proof was finally accepted as essentially correct in 1969, after Harold Stark, who had independently arrived at a similar proof, showed that Heegner's proof was more or less equivalent to his own, with only a minor gap in it. Stark attributed Heegner's mistakes to the fact he was using a textbook by Weber which contained some results with incomplete proof. However this was four years after Heegner's death, and he never saw his proof become widely accepted.

A Sanskrit-English Dictionary.  Oxford Clarendon Press, p. 159) is a body position, typically associated with the practice of Yoga, originally identified as a mastery of sitting still.s:Hatha Yoga Pradipika/1#Asanas   In the context of Yoga practice, asana refers to two things: the place where a practitioner (or yogin, in general usage), yogi (male), or yogini (female) sits and the manner (posture) in which he/she sits."Patanjali Yoga sutras" by Swami Prabhavananda , published by the Sri Ramakrishna Math ISBN 81-7120-221-7 p. 111 In the Yoga sutras, Patanjali suggests that asana is "to be seated in a position that is firm, but relaxed" for extended, or timeless periods.Verse 46, chapter II; for translation referred: "Patanjali Yoga Sutras" by Swami Prabhavananda , published by the Sri Ramakrishna Math ISBN 81-7120-221-7 p. 111
As a repertoire of postures were promoted to exercise the body-mind over the centuries to the present day, when yoga is sought as a primarily physical exercise form, modern usage has come to include variations from lying on the back and standing on the head, to a variety of other positions. However, in the Yoga sutras, Patanjali mentions the execution of sitting with a steadfast mind for extended periods as the third of the eight limbs of Classical or Raja yoga,Patanjali (± 300-200 B.C.) Yoga sutras, Book II:29 but does not reference standing postures or kriyās.  Yoga practitioners (even those who are adepts at various complex postures)  who seek the  "simple" practice of chair-less sitting generally find it impossible or surprisingly grueling to sit still for the traditional minimum of one hour (as still practiced in eastern Vipassana),  some of them then dedicating their practice to sitting asana and the sensations and mind-states that arise and evaporate in extended sits.
Asana later became a term for various postures useful for restoring and maintaining a practitioner's well-being and improving the body's flexibility and vitality,  with the goal of cultivating the ability to remain in seated meditation for extended periods.Feuerstein, Georg (1996). The Shambhala Guide to Yoga. Shambhala Publications, Boston. pp. 26 Asanas are widely known as "Yoga postures" or "Yoga positions". "Asana" quite simply means "a posture". Any way that we may sit, stand or position our hands is an asana. Therefore, many asanas are possible. However, a particular posture that leads you to a higher possibility is called a yogasana.
Yoga in the West is commonly practised as physical exercise or alternative medicine, rather than as the spiritual self-mastery meditation skill it is more associated with in the East.[tpl]cite book|title=The Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America|first=Stefanie |last=Syman|publisher=Macmillan|year=2010|page = 5|isbn= 0374236763|quote = But many of those aspects of yoga—the ecstatic, the transcendent, the overtly Hindu, the possibly subversive, and eventually the seemingly bizarre—that you wouldn't see on the White House grounds that day and that you won’t find in most yoga classes persist, right here in America.[/tpl]

The Saint-Chamond was the second French heavy tank of the First World War, with 400 manufactured from April 1917 to July 1918. Born of the commercial rivalry existing with the makers of the Schneider CA1 tank, the Saint-Chamond was an underpowered and fundamentally inadequate design. Its principal weakness was the "caterpillar" tracks. They were much too short in relation to the vehicle's length and heavy weight ( 23 tons ). Later models, however, attempted to rectify some of the tank's original flaws by installing wider and stronger track shoes, thicker frontal armor and the more effective 75mm Mle 1897 field gun. The Saint-Chamond tanks remained engaged in various actions until the late summer of 1918, belatedly becoming more effective since combat had moved out of the trenches and onto open ground. Eventually, however, the Saint-Chamond tanks were scheduled to be entirely replaced by imported British heavy tanks.

[[Tinfoil barb]]

CATEGORIES: Fish of Southeast Asia, Fish of Thailand

The Tinfoil Barb (Barbonymus schwanenfeldii) is a tropical Southeast Asian freshwater fish of the family Cyprinidae. This species was originally described as Barbus schwanenfeldii by Pieter Bleeker in 1853, and has also been placed in the genera Barbodes and Puntius. The specific epithet is frequently misspelled schwanefeldii.
Nowadays it is usually placed in the genus Barbonymus, which was only established in 1999. It is the genus' type species, and indeed seems to represent a quite distinct lineage of large "barbs". It is not very similar to the barbels which are the core of the genus Barbus, and though closer to these than to some African barbs, they seem to be closer still to the Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) and to Cyclocheilichthys than to either of the aforementioned.
It is distinguishable from other species of the genus in having a red dorsal fin with a black blotch at the tip, red pectoral, pelvic and anal fins, red caudal fin with white margin and a black submarginal stripe along each lobe, and 8 scale rows between dorsal-fin origin and lateral line. Large individuals are silvery or golden yellow while alive with its dorsal fin red and caudal fin orange or blood-red. It grows up to 14 inches (35 cm) in length. Tinfoil Barbs have a lifespan of 8 to 10 years.
Originating in the Mekong and Chao Phraya basins of Thailand, and Sumatra, Borneo, and Malayan peninsula, the tinfoil barb is found in rivers, streams, canals, and ditches. It also enters flooded fields.   Its natural habitat is in water with a 6.5–7.0 pH, a water hardness of up to 10 dGH, and a temperature range of 72–77 °F (22–25 °C). In Indonesia, a temperature range of 20.4°C to 33.7°C was recorded for this species. It is largely herbivorous, consuming aquatic macrophytes and submerged land plants, as well as filamentous algae and occasionally insects. It also feeds on small fishes, worms, and crustaceans.
The tinfoil barb is commercially important in the aquarium hobby trade, as well as commercial aquaculture, subsistence farming, and occasionally as bait. It is usually marketed fresh.
There are no obvious distinguishing characteristics used to determine the sex of the fish. They reproduce by egg scattering of several thousand eggs per spawning. They are not often bred in captivity for the aquarium trade due to their large size.

CATEGORIES: 1984 births, Living people, New York University people

Bobst Boy is the nickname of Steven Stanzak (born  January 25, 1984), a New York University student who spent eight months living in the basement of the school's Bobst Library from September 2003 to April 2004.[tpl]cite web | publisher = BBC News | title =  Broke student 'slept in library' | date = April 28, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/3665885.stm[/tpl]
Before living in the Bobst Library, Stanzak was an ordinary student living on loans and part-time jobs, without financial assistance from his parents. In September 2003, he found that his NYU scholarship, four jobs, and private loans would cover his tuition costs, but he could not get enough loans to cover housing. He refused to drop out or transfer to a cheaper university, choosing instead to live in the library.[tpl]citation | first = Karen | last = Arenson | newspaper = New York Times | title =  Yes, Some Students Live in the Library (But Not Like This) | date = April 27, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/nyregion/27NYU.html | publisher = The New York Times[/tpl][tpl]cite web | publisher = East Carolinian | title =  It's your typical 2 a.m., winter 2002 | date = April 12, 2005 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://media.www.theeastcarolinian.com/media/storage/paper915/news/2005/04/12/Opinion/Its-Your.Typical.2.A.m.Winter.2002-2210390.shtml[/tpl] Stanzak quickly tired of answering peoples' questions about life in the library, and posted a Q&A online, which eventually grew into the blog and web site, and Stanzak developed an underground fan following on NYU's campus.
The Washington Square News, NYU's student paper, was told of Stanzak's situation and asked to do a profile on him. At first Stanzak refused, fearing how NYU would react to the situation. However, once Stanzak was told that the article would only be printed with his consent, he agreed to an interview. In April 2004, just before the release of the news article, an NYU dean was told of Stanzak's situation, and requested a meeting. At the meeting, the dean told Stanzak that his initiative was remarkable, but that he could no longer live in the library, and Stanzak was provided free NYU housing for the last few weeks of classes.[tpl]citation | last = Palsson | first = Nils | newspaper = Washington Square News | title = Ousted Bobst Boy gets dorm | date = April 26, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://nyunews.com/2004/04/26/19/ | publisher = Washington Square News [/tpl]
The day the profile was published, reporters started calling Stanzak, and he became an overnight celebrity.[tpl]citation | last = Chung | first = Jen | newspaper = Gothamist | title = Living at the Library: The Bobst Library's Tenant | date = April 27, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://gothamist.com/2004/04/27/living_at_the_library_the_bobst_librarys_tenant.php[/tpl][tpl]citation | first = Karen | last = Arenson | newspaper = New York Times | title =   Page Two: April 25-May 1; Reading Oneself to Sleep | date = May 2, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EED8123DF931A35756C0A9629C8B63[/tpl] Stanzak received widespread media attention, appearing on Good Morning America on April 29.[tpl]cite web | title = NYU Student Caught Living in the Library | date = April 30, 2004 | publisher = American Library Association | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/alnews2004/april2004ab/bobstboy.cfm[/tpl]
Stanzak continued to receive financial assistance from NYU until graduation, and no longer updates his blog or web site. After his time in the library, he became a Resident Assistant at NYU's Lafayette Street Residence, in Chinatown.
He is currently attending Indiana University, pursuing a graduate degree in folklore which he began in fall 2006.

Operation Quicksilver was a Second World War military deception. Undertaken by the Allies in 1944, the operation threatened an invasion of France in the Pas de Calais region through the simulation of a large Field Army in South East England. Quicksilver formed part of the Operation Fortitude deception, itself part of the stratefic Operation Bodyguard plan. The key element of Quicksilver was the creation in German minds that "First United States Army Group" (FUSAG) commanded by General George Patton supposedly would land in the Pas-de-Calais for the major invasion of Europe, after the landings in Normandy had lured the German defenders to that front. (FUSAG was a genuine army group headquarters which later became Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group, but was given a fictitious role and many non-existent divisions for purposes of deception.)
Joan Pujol Garcia, known by the British code name Garbo and the German code name Arabel, was a double agent loyal to the Allies who played a crucial role in the deception by supplying Germany with detailed information from a network of non-existent sub-agents supporting the idea that the main invasion was to be in the Pas-de-Calais.

The First Coast roughly comprises the five counties surrounding Jacksonville: Duval, Baker, Clay, Nassau and St. Johns, largely corresponding to the Jacksonville metropolitan area. The term originated in a marketing campaign in the 1980s, and has since emerged as one of Florida's best known vernacular regions. The First Coast refers to the same general area as the "directional" region of Northeast Florida, which may further include Putnam and Flagler counties.

"I Want to be a Cowboy's Sweetheart" is a country and Western song written and first recorded in 1935 by Rubye Blevins, who performed as Patsy Montana.  It was the first country song by a female artist to sell more than one million copies.[tpl]cite web| title= Patsy Montana's Vest and Skirt | url= http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=106|work= HistoryWired: A few of our favorite things| publisher= Smithsonian Institution |accessdate= 2012-08-03 [/tpl] Montana wrote the song in 1934 when she was feeling lonely and missing her boyfriend; it was recorded a year later when producer Art Satherly, of ARC Records, needed one more song at a Prairie Ramblers recording session. Montana was the group's soloist at the time. Her song is based on Stuart Hamblen's western song Texas Plains: he is therefore credited as a cowriter. Patsy Montana embellished the simpler musical pattern of the original, especially with her yodeling. Patsy also used a lot of the original words: the song is somewhat of a feminine answer to its precursor.
In 2012 her record was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry list of "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important" American sound recordings.[tpl]cite web|title=The National Recording Registry 2011|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2011reg.html|work=National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|date=May 24, 2012| quote=Her song's lively, quick polka tempo and yodeling refrain, and Montana's exuberant delivery, resulted in it being requested at every performance; it became one of the first hits by a female country and western singer.|accessdate=2012-08-03 [/tpl]

[tpl]nihongo|Ghibli Experimental Theater On Your Mark|ジブリ実験劇場 On Your Mark||Jiburi Jikkengekijō On Yua Māku[/tpl] is an animated music video created by Studio Ghibli for the song "On Your Mark" by the Japanese rock duo Chage & Aska. The song was released in 1994 as part of the single "Heart". In 1995, Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed the short film for the song as a side-project after having writer's block with Princess Mononoke. The anime music video is non-linear, providing multiple reiterations and alternate scenes to depict the events. The music video added sound effects to the audio track, but contains no dialogue. Miyazaki purposely misinterpreted the lyrics to present his vision of a world where the surface becomes inhospitable and humans live in an underground city. Miyazaki purposely made the video cryptic to evoke creative interpretations among viewers.
The music video follows two policemen who raid a religious cult and find an angelic being only to have her taken away and confined to a laboratory. Haunted by the fate of the "angel", the two men formulate a plan and break into the laboratory. Fleeing in an armored truck the three plummet into an abyss after trying to force past a police aircraft along a narrow suspended roadway. After a montage of the previous scenes, the armored truck suddenly rockets into an apartment complex, allowing their escape. The three escape to the surface, ignoring the radiation and danger signs, emerging near an encased nuclear reactor. The two men set the "angel" free and she flies off into the sky.
The music video was well-received and praised for its animation and attention to detail. It premiered as a short before the movie "Whisper of the Heart" and has since been released on Laserdisc and DVD as part of All Things Ghibli Special Short Short. It has not been released outside of Japan.

Pedro Menéndez de Avilés (15 February 1519–17 September 1574) was a Spanish admiral and explorer from the region of Asturias, Spain, remembered for planning the first regular trans-oceanic convoys and for founding St. Augustine, Florida in 1565. This was the first successful Spanish settlement in La Florida and the most significant city in the region for nearly three hundred years. St. Augustine is the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the continental United States. Menéndez subsequently became the first governor of Florida.Viele, John (1999).

Menéndez made his career as a sailor in the service of the Spanish king, Philip II of Spain. His initial plans for a voyage to Florida revolved around searching for his son, Juan, who had been shipwrecked there in 1561. However, following the founding of Fort Caroline in present-day Jacksonville by French Huguenots under René Goulaine de Laudonnière, he was commissioned to conquer the peninsula as Adelantado. He established St. Augustine in 1565, then seized Fort Caroline and displaced the French.[tpl]cite book|author1=Margaret F. Pickett|author2=Dwayne W.

CATEGORIES: Horse breeds

  
Miniature horses are found in many nations, particularly in Europe and the Americas. The designation of miniature horse is determined by the height of the animal, which, depending on the particular breed registry involved, is usually less than [tpl]convert|34|-|38|in|cm[/tpl] as measured at the last hairs of the mane, which are found at the withers. While miniature horses are the size of a very small pony, many retain horse characteristics and are considered "horses" by their respective registries.   They have various colors and coat patterns.
Miniature horses are friendly and interact well with people. For this reason they are often kept as family pets, though they still retain natural horse behavior, including a natural fight or flight instinct, and must be treated like an equine, even if they primarily serve as a companion animal. They are also trained as service animals, akin to assistance dogs for people with disabilities.  Miniature horses are also trained for driving, equine agility and other competitive horse show type events.

Fort Caroline was the first French colony in the present-day United States, located on the banks of the St. Johns River in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. It was established under the leadership of René Goulaine de Laudonnière on June 22, 1564 as a new territorial claim in French Florida and a safe haven for Huguenots. The French settlement came into conflict with the Spanish, who established St. Augustine in September 1565, and Fort Caroline was sacked by Spanish troops under Pedro Menéndez de Avilés on September 20. The Spanish continued to occupy the site as San Mateo until 1569.[tpl]Cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Tony |year=2008 |title=A Voyage Long and Strange: Rediscovering the New World |location=New York |publisher=Henry Holt & Co. |isbn=9780805076035[/tpl]Morris, p. 470

Ramón Montoya (November 2, 1880, Madrid, Spain – June 20, 1949, Madrid, Spain), Flamenco guitarist and composer.
Born into a family of Gitano (Romani) cattle traders, Ramón Montoya used earnings from working in the trade to purchase his first guitar. He began playing in the cafés de cante before he was twenty years of age.
He formed a partnership with the great flamenco cantaor (singer) Antonio Chacón that started in 1912 and lasted more than a decade. Both participated in the Concurso de Cante Jondo of 1922 held in Granada. These two were largely responsible for establishing the form of the various traditional flamenco cantes that are recognized today.
In traditional flamenco, the guitar was relegated to a supporting role. Cante (singing) and baile (dance) were the main performers whom the guitarist supported. Montoya was one of the first to challenge this role. His strong playing often overpowered the singer whom he accompanied. He eventually took the next logical step and began to play as a solo or lead performer in a concert setting. His performances are widely credited by flamenco historians as establishing the flamenco guitar in this role.Cf., D. E. Pohren, Lives and Legends of Flamenco (Madrid 1964, 1988) at 273-277.
He was the single most influential flamenco guitarist of the 20th century. His innovations made possible the solo careers of such later greats as Sabicas, Paco de Lucía and Tomatito.
He is the uncle of flamenco guitarist Carlos Montoya.

He left Vårgårda at age 19, in 1873, for Motala to work as a navvy. Following military service in 1874, he moved to Eskilstuna where he worked for the Bolinder-Munktell factory, and in 1878 he moved to Västerås where he found employment at a mechanical workshop. Following that, he worked as a blacksmith at a nearby farm.
At this time, he had made a decision to leave Sweden for the United States. This never happened; he was instead offered a more esteemed job by his former employer Munktells, and the offer changed his mind.
He eventually decided to start his own business and, in 1886, moved to Enköping where he started Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad (the Mechanical Workshop of Enköping) which quickly became a successful venture. It was during the years in his workshop that he invented the adjustable spanner and the plumber wrench. In 1890, B.A. Hjort & Company agreed to distribute his tools worldwide under the "Bahco" trademark. The Bahco tools became greatly successful, and the company is still in operation and has manufactured over 100 million wrenches to date.
Johansson transferred the then-large enterprise to his son, Hannes Brynge, and the B.A. Hjort & Company in 1916. He started experimenting with electrical armature and in 1919 opened a new factory, Triplex, which manufactured electrical pendulums and various devices.
He died 89 years old after having been productive for the most of his life.

[[Connecting rod]]

CATEGORIES: Engine technology, Locomotive parts

In a reciprocating piston engine, the connecting rod or conrod connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. Together with the crank, they form a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion.
Connecting rods may also convert rotating motion into reciprocating motion. Historically, before the development of engines, they were first used in this way.
As a connecting rod is rigid, it may transmit either a push or a pull and so the rod may rotate the crank through both halves of a revolution, i.e. piston pushing and piston pulling. Earlier mechanisms, such as chains, could only pull. In a few two-stroke engines, the connecting rod is only required to push.
Today, connecting rods are best known through their use in internal combustion piston engines, such as automotive engines. These are of a distinctly different design from earlier forms of connecting rods, used in steam engines and steam locomotives.

Highway 28 is an east-west highway on the northern part of Vancouver Island, within the Strathcona Regional District.  It is the main link to the northern part of Strathcona Provincial Park and the remote logging communities of Gold River and Tahsis, on the northwest coast of the Island.  The highway first opened in 1970.  Before the section of Highway 19 from Campbell River to Port Hardy was opened in 1979, Highway 28 acted as the main access to Port Hardy and various other communities on the northern tip of the Island (in the Regional District of Mount Waddington), aided by a system of local logging roads leading from the highway to the various north Island communities.

[[S-matrix]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum field theory, Scattering theory, Matrices

In physics, the S-matrix or scattering matrix relates the initial state and the final state of a physical system undergoing a scattering process. It is used in quantum mechanics, scattering theory and quantum field theory.
More formally, the S-matrix is defined as the unitary matrix connecting asymptotic particle states in the Hilbert space of physical states (scattering channels). While the S-matrix may be defined for any background (spacetime) that is asymptotically solvable and has no horizons[tpl]what?|date=January 2014[/tpl], it has a simple form in the case of the Minkowski space. In this special case, the Hilbert space is a space of irreducible unitary representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group[tpl]clarification needed|reason=Do they mean Poincaré group, or ?|date=January 2014[/tpl]; the S-matrix is the evolution operator between time equal to minus infinity (the distant past), and time equal to plus infinity (the distant future). It is defined only in the limit of zero energy density (or infinite particle separation distance). It can be shown that if a quantum field theory in Minkowski space has a mass gap, the state in the asymptotic past and in the asymptotic future are both described by Fock spaces.

[[Opisometer]]

CATEGORIES: Dimensional instruments, Cartography, Navigational equipment, Measuring instruments

An opisometer, also called a curvimeter, meilograph, or map measurer, is an instrument for measuring the lengths of arbitrary curved lines.
A simple opisometer consists of a toothed wheel of known circumference on a handle.  The wheel is placed in contact with the curved line to be measured and run along its length.  By counting the number of teeth passing a mark on the handle while this is done, the length of the line can be ascertained:
In more sophisticated models, sometimes called a chartometer, the wheel is connected via gearing to a rotary dial from which the line length can be directly read.[ref]Gerard L'Estrange Turner, Scientific Instruments, 1500-1900: An Introduction, Philip Wilson Publishers 1998, ISBN 0-85667-491-5 (p.83)
[/ref]
The instrument is most commonly used to measure the lengths of roads, rivers and other line features on maps.  Opisometers designed for this purpose provide scales reading the measured distance in kilometers and miles.
Early versions of this instrument were patented in 1873 by the English engineer Edward Russell Morris.THE LONDON GAZETTE, DECEMBER 12, 1873 The instruments he produced were initially described as a Patent Chartometer although later versions were sold under the curious name of Wealemefna.Mathematical Instruments: Map Measurers Writing in 1881, Morris described how he had created a wholly original name in an attempt to outwit his imitators; he also refused to disclose the origin of the word.English Mechanic and World of Science: Vol. 33, London, 1881

The line of succession to the Swedish throne is determined by the Act of Succession ([tpl]lang-sv|Successionsordningen[/tpl]), originally approved jointly by the Riksdag of the Estates assembled in Örebro and King Charles XIII in 1810.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.riksdagen.se/Global/dokument/dokument/laws/the-act-of-succession-2012.pdf | title = Act of Succession | publisher = The Riksdag | accessdate = 2014-01-29 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Successionsordning-18100926_sfs-1810-0926/ | title = Successionsordning (1810:0926) | accessdate = 2014-01-29 | publisher = The Riksdag | language = Swedish[/tpl]
In 1979, the Riksdag introduced absolute primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, regardless of gender, is first in the line of succession.

[[Pastured poultry]]

CATEGORIES: Sustainable agriculture, Poultry farming, Animal welfare

Pastured poultry is a sustainable agriculture technique that calls for the raising of laying chickens, meat chickens (broilers), and/or turkeys on pasture, as opposed to indoor confinement. Humane treatment, the perceived health benefits of pastured poultry, in addition to superior texture and flavor, are causing an increase in demand for such products.
Joel Salatin of Swoope, Virginia, helped to reintroduce the technique at Polyface Farm, and wrote his book Pastured Poultry Profits to spread the idea to other farmers. Andy Lee and Herman Beck-Chenoweth expanded on Salatin's techniques, and created some of their own.
The American Pastured Poultry Producers' Association (APPPA) was formed to promote pastured poultry. Its membership consists
largely of pastured poultry farmers.
Though pasture feeding improves the nutritive quality of ruminant meats, the effect of pasture feeding on poultry meat composition is not well established. One trial showed low impact of pasture feeding on vitamin E and fatty acid composition.Ponte, P.I.P et al..http://ps.fass.org/cgi/content/abstract/87/1/80 Influence of Pasture Intake on the Fatty Acid Composition, and Cholesterol, Tocopherols, and Tocotrienols Content in Meat from Free-Range Broilers. Poult Sci 2008. 87:80-88 2008. 2009-11-20
The pens that house the fowl can be made from wood and scrap metal or out of PVC pipe and white tarps.
Pastured poultry is also gaining popularity because it helps the farmer, through reducing capital costs, and increasing pasture fertility. It is very well suited for incorporation within a system of managed intensive grazing.
Pastured poultry is not limited to chickens and turkeys. It includes a variety of other birds, including ducks, geese and exotics in the poultry family.

[[Bobtail squid]]

CATEGORIES: Bobtail squid, Squid

Bobtail squid (order Sepiolida) are a group of cephalopods closely related to cuttlefish. Bobtail squid tend to have a rounder mantle than cuttlefish and have no cuttlebone. They have eight suckered arms and two tentacles and are generally quite small (typical male mantle length being between 1 and 8 cm). Sepiolids live in shallow coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean and some parts of the Indian Ocean as well as in shallow waters on the west coast of the Cape Peninsula off South Africa. Like cuttlefish, they can swim by either using the fins on their mantle or by jet propulsion. They are also known as dumpling squid (owing to their rounded mantle) or stubby squid.

It was intended to be sold first to Arab and other Third World countries, jump-starting production — and enabling the Brazilian Army to later place its own orders without having to fund development costs. However macro-political events including the Gulf War and North American political pressure led to the tank's demise, and the tank was never acquired by the Brazilian Army.

[[Choline acetyltransferase]]

CATEGORIES: EC 2.3.1

Choline acetyltransferase (commonly abbreviated as ChAT, but sometimes CAT) is a transferase enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. ChAT catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from the coenzyme, acetyl-CoA, to choline yielding acetylcholine (ACh). ChAT is found in high concentration in cholinergic neurons, both in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). As with all nerve terminal proteins, ChAT is produced in the body of the neuron and is transported to the nerve terminal, where its concentration is highest. Presence of ChAT in a nerve cell classifies this cell as a “cholinergic” neuron. In humans, the choline acetyltransferase enyzme is encoded by the CHAT gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Strauss WL, Kemper RR, Jayakar P, Kong CF, Hersh LB, Hilt DC, Rabin M | title = Human choline acetyltransferase gene maps to region 10q11-q22.2 by in situ hybridization | journal = Genomics | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 396–8 |date=February 1991 | pmid = 1840566 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(91)90273-H| url =  [/tpl]

[[Syntactic pivot]]
The syntactic pivot is the verb argument around which sentences "revolve", in a given language. This usually means the following:
The first two characteristics have to do with simple morphosyntax, and from them it is quite obvious the syntactic pivot in English (and most other European languages) is what we call the subject. An English verb cannot lack a subject (even in the imperative mood, the subject is implied to be "you" and is not ambiguous or unspecified), and cannot have just a direct object and no subject; and (at least in the present tense, and for the verb to be) it agrees partially with the subject.
The third point deserves an explanation. Consider the following sentence:
There are two coordinated propositions, and the second proposition lacks an explicit subject, but since the subject is the syntactic pivot, then the second proposition is assumed to have the same subject as the first one. One cannot do this with a direct object (in English). The result would be either ungrammatical or with a different meaning:
The syntactic pivot is a feature of the morphosyntactic alignment of the language. In nominative–accusative languages the syntactic pivot is the so-called "subject" (the argument marked with the nominative case). In ergative–absolutive languages the syntactic pivot may be the argument marked with the absolutive case, but this is not always so, since ergative languages are often not "pure" and show a mixed behaviour (e. g. ergative morphology and accusative syntax).
Languages with a passive voice construction may resort to it in order to allow the default syntactic pivot to shift its semantic role (from agent to patient) in a coordinated proposition:

He was born at Lobberich in the Rhineland, in Germany. He studied in Bonn and Berlin, receiving his doctorate in 1877. He worked at observatories in Gotha and at Bothkamp, discovering the asteroid 230 Athamantis at the latter in 1882. He then worked at Ougrée Observatory in Ougrée, Belgium, where he analyzed the mass of Saturn and worked on celestial mechanics and measurements of parallax and of double stars.
From 1891 until his death in 1916 he was director of the Kuffner observatory in Vienna. Among other things, he measured the parallax of a number of stars and compiled data for a star catalog.

[tpl]nihongo|Pikmin 2|ピクミン2|Pikumin Tsū[/tpl] is a 2004 real-time strategy video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube video game console. The game is the direct sequel to the 2001 game Pikmin and is the second game in the Pikmin series.
Like its predecessor, Pikmin 2 focuses on exploring the surface of an unknown planet from a microscopic perspective, where the player directs and delegates tasks to a horde of tiny plant-like creatures called Pikmin. The Pikmin can be directed to destroy obstacles, defeat enemies, and retrieve objects. Pikmin 2 introduces many gameplay mechanics not seen in Pikmin, including the ability to control two different leaders of the Pikmin at once and the addition of new Pikmin types.
Pikmin 2 received critical acclaim, gaining aggregate scores of 89.60% and 90 on GameRankings and MetaCritic, respectively. Many critics praised the additions to the Pikmin gameplay, such as the removal of the 30-day time limit imposed in the original game. The game (and its predecessor) was ported to the Wii in 2009 as a New Play Control! title. The sequel to the game, Pikmin 3, was released in 2013 for the Wii U console.

Ernesto Laclau ([tpl]IPA-es|laˈklau|lang[/tpl]; 6 October 1935 – 13 April 2014) was an Argentine political theorist often described as post-Marxist. 
He studied History in Buenos Aires, graduating from the Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires in 1964, and received a PhD from the University of Essex in 1977. 
Since 1986 he served as Professor of Political Theory at the University of Essex, where he founded and directed for many years the graduate programme in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, as well as the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Under his directorship, the Ideology and Discourse Analysis programme has provided the suitable research framework for the development of a distinct type of discourse analysis that draws on post-structuralist theory (especially the work of Lacan, Foucault, Derrida, and Barthes) in order to articulate innovative analyses of concrete political phenomena (identities, discourses and hegemonies). This theoretical and analytical orientation is today known as the 'Essex School of discourse analysis'.See Jules Townshend, 'Discourse theory and political analysis: a new paradigm from the Essex School?’, British Journal of Politics and International Relations, Vol. 5, No. 1, February 2003, pp. 129–142. 
Over the years, Laclau has lectured extensively in many universities in North America, South America, Western Europe, Australia, and South Africa. Most recently he has held positions at SUNY Buffalo and Northwestern University, both in the US.
His long-term partner was Chantal Mouffe.  He died, of a heart attack, in Seville in 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rivadavia.com.ar/articulos/ultimo-momento-fallecio-en-sevilla-el-teorico-y-politologo-ernesto-laclau/ |title=ÚLTIMO MOMENTO: Falleció en Sevilla, el téorico y politólogo argentino, Ernesto Laclau | Radio Rivadavia |publisher=Rivadavia.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2014-04-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Blackburn |first=Robin |url=http://www.versobooks.com/blogs/1556-ernesto-laclau-1935-2014 |title=Ernesto Laclau, 1935-2014 |publisher=VersoBooks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]

Julian Eltinge (May 14, 1881 – March 7, 1941), born William Julian Dalton, was an American stage and screen actor and female impersonator. After appearing in the Boston Cadets Revue at the age of ten in feminine garb, Eltinge garnered notice from other producers and made his first appearance on Broadway in 1904. As his star began to rise, he appeared in vaudeville and toured Europe and the United States, even giving a command performance before King Edward VII. Eltinge appeared in a series of musical comedies written specifically for his talents starting in 1910 with The Fascinating Widow, returning to vaudeville in 1918. His popularity soon earned him the moniker "Mr. Lillian Russell" for the equally popular beauty and musical comedy star.
Hollywood beckoned Eltinge and in 1917 he appeared in his first feature film, The Countess Charming. This would lead to other films including 1918s The Isle of Love with Rudolph Valentino and Virginia Rappe. By the time Eltinge arrived in Hollywood, he was considered one of the highest paid actors on the American stage; but with the arrival of the Great Depression and the death of vaudeville, Eltinge’s star began to fade. He continued his show in nightclubs but found little success. He died in 1941 following a show at a New York nightclub. He leaves a legacy as one of the greatest female impersonators of the 20th century.

The Archipelago is a township in central Ontario, Canada, along the Georgian Bay in the District of Parry Sound.
The municipality consists of two non-contiguous parts, separated by Carling Township and the Parry Sound. The northern part includes the village of Pointe au Baril on the mainland and most of the geographic townships of Shawanaga and Harrison.  This covers the islands and shoreline of Georgian Bay from the Twin Sisters (at the northern boundary of Carling Township) north to Charles Inlet and the Naiscoot River, a few miles south of Britt. The southern part consists of the geographic townships of Cowper and Conger that includes the islands and shoreline of Georgian Bay southwest of Parry Sound, from Twelve Mile Bay (at the Muskoka District boundary) to Parry Island and up the South Channel almost to the Town of Parry Sound.  Almost a third of the population of the southern part lives on the islands in the Sans Souci and Copperhead area, centred around Frying Pan Island.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thearchipelago.on.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23&Itemid=16 |title=History of the Archipelago |publisher=Township of The Archipelago |accessdate=2010-07-26[/tpl]
The township is characterized by numerous islands (hence its name) and bays that attract large amounts of vacationers and boaters in the summer. Much of its area is undeveloped and crown-owned land: in the north, 96 percent of the mainland and 50 percent of the islands remain in the public domain, and in the south, 83 percent of the mainland and 70 percent of the islands, a large part of it protected in the Massasauga Provincial Park.

[[Growth hormone treatment]]

CATEGORIES: Growth hormones, Pediatrics, Endocrine procedures

Growth hormone treatment refers to the use of growth hormone (GH) as a prescription medication—it is one form of hormone therapy. Growth hormone is a peptide hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates growth and cell reproduction. In the past, growth hormone was extracted from human pituitary glands. GH is now produced by recombinant DNA technology and is prescribed for a variety of reasons. GH therapy has been a focus of social and ethical controversies for 50 years.
This article describes the history of GH treatment, current uses and risks arising from GH use. Other articles describe GH physiology, diseases of GH excess (acromegaly and pituitary gigantism), deficiency, the recent phenomenon of HGH controversies, growth hormone in sports, and growth hormone for cows.

The Oldsmobile Intrigue was a mid-size sedan manufactured from 1998 through 2002 by the Oldsmobile division of General Motors. The Intrigue's design cues were first seen in 1995 with the Oldsmobile Antares concept car. The Intrigue was the first casualty in the phase-out process of Oldsmobile.
The Aurora-inspired Intrigue was designed to compete more with Japanese automobiles, and replaced the aging Cutlass Supreme. Unlike the Cutlass Supreme, which was available as a 5- or 6-passenger sedan, coupe, or convertible, the Intrigue was strictly a 5-passenger, 4-door sedan. It went into production on May 5, 1998.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] Although similar to a range of mid-sized sedans from other GM divisions, including the Buick Century, Buick Regal, Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Monte Carlo and the Pontiac Grand Prix, the Intrigue sported a decidedly more "Euro" look and feel as part of its import-fighter position.
The Intrigue was available in three trim levels: base GX, mid-level GL, and high-end GLS. All models were well equipped with standard features such as V6 power, antilock brakes, 4-wheel independent suspension, dual front airbags, and full power accessories. GL trim included the addition of a 6-way power adjustable driver's seat, 6-speaker audio system, foglamps, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Top-line GLS added 6-way power front passenger seat, faux woodgrain interior trim, steering wheel audio controls, leather seating, and full-function traction control.Oldsmobile Factory Sales Brochure "1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue"
All Intrigues were built at the GM Fairfax plant in Kansas City, Kansas, where the Grand Prix was also built (the Buick Century and Regal, and the Chevrolet Impala and Monte Carlo were all built in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada). For the 1999 model year, a new  3.5 L DOHC engine was introduced it was a six-cylinder design based on Cadillac's Northstar V8, which was nicknamed the "Shortstar". The 3.5 L engine became standard for 2000, giving the Intrigue the most powerful standard engine of any W-body car.
Another exclusive was a standard 140 mph speedometer. With the Autobahn package the Intrigue came with larger 12-inch front brake rotors, being the first 2nd Gen W-body to incorporate bigger brakes. For 1998-99 models the Autobahn package consisted of a 3.29 differential ratio opposed to the standard 3.05, H-rated tires, 12-inch front brakes with ceramic pads, and a 128 mph speed limiter. For 2000 it was renamed Precision Sport Package which included everything from the Autobahn package except the larger 12-inch front brake rotors, and added the Precision Control System (also known as Vehicle Stability Control (VSC)).[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] For 2002 the Intrigue Final 500 Collector’s Edition cars came in a unique Dark Cherry Metallic paint and featured Aurora-styled 17x7.5-inch chrome wheels.
On June 14, 2002, the final Intrigue rolled off the assembly line as part of the Final 500 Collectors Edition.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

Watsessing Park is a park in Essex County, New Jersey, in the city of East Orange and the town of Bloomfield.  The park covers 69 acres (279,000 m²), just west of the Garden State Parkway, and contains the confluence of the Second River and Toney's Brook.
The name "Watsessing" comes from the language of the Lenni Lenape Indians who inhabited the area before European colonization; it means "crooked" or "elbow".  This etymology might have been related to the Third River, which also flows through Bloomfield (though not through Watsessing Park), and which forms an abrupt elbow near the town's center.
Watsessing Park was designed in 1899 by the famous Olmsted Brothers of Brookline, Massachusetts (sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of Manhattan's Central Park).

The Aurora became the high-end sport sedan Oldsmobile powered by a 4 cam 32 valve 4.0L V-8 supplanting the Oldsmobile Toronado coupe and eventually the Oldsmobile 98 in the line-up. The Aurora offered both the V6-powered version and a V-8 powered version from 2001-03.  It was equipped with a 4-speed automatic transmission with performance algorithm shifting.

U.S. Route 202 (US 202) is a highway stretching from Delaware to Maine, also passing through the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Its parent route, U.S. Route 2, only goes through three of these same states: New York, New Hampshire, and Maine.
The road has borne the number 202 since at least 1935. Before this, sections of the road were designated U.S. Route 122, as it intersected U.S. Route 22. Its current designation is based on its intersection with US 2 in Maine.
This route is considerably longer than the eastern segment of US 2, making it one of several 3-digit US routes to be longer than their parent routes.

[[Unfair business practices]]
CATEGORIES: Business law

Unfair business practices encompass fraud, misrepresentation, and oppressive or unconscionable acts or practices by business, often against consumers and are prohibited by law in many countries. For instance, in the European Union, each member state must regulate unfair business practices in accordance with the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, subject to transitional periods. Unfair business practices may arise in many areas, including:
In addition to providing for the award of compensatory damages, laws may also provide for the award of punitive damages as well as the payment of the plaintiff's legal fees.
At common law, individuals were not entitled to attorneys fees or punitive damages for wrongful acts committed by businesses in most states.  Most often, laws prohibiting unfair business practices require consumers to send demand letter to the business prior to commencing with a lawsuit.  If the business fails to make a reasonable offer of settlement within a specified period of time, and is subsequently found liable in court, it may be liable for punitive damages and the injured parties reasonable attorney's fees under many statutes.  In some instances, the statutes provide for prevailing plaintiffs to recover double or triple the actual damages against non-settling defendants.  
When statutes prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices provide for the award of punitive damages and attorneys fees to injured parties, they provide a powerful incentive for businesses to resolve the claim through the settlement process rather than risk a more costly judgment in court.

[[Dialogic]]

CATEGORIES: Literary concepts, Postmodern theory, Post-structuralism

The English terms dialogic and dialogism often refer to the concept used by the Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin in his work of literary theory, The Dialogic Imagination.  Bakhtin contrasts the dialogic and the "monologic" work of literature.  The dialogic work carries on a continual dialogue with other works of literature and other authors.  It does not merely answer, correct, silence, or extend a previous work, but informs and is continually informed by the previous work.  Dialogic literature is in communication with multiple works.  This is not merely a matter of influence, for the dialogue extends in both directions, and the previous work of literature is as altered by the dialogue as the present one is. Though Bakhtin's "dialogic" emanates from his work with colleagues in what we now call the "Bakhtin Circle" in years following 1918, his work was not known to the West or translated into English until the 1970s. For those only recently introduced to Bakhtin's ideas but familiar with T.S.Eliot, his "dialogic" is consonant with Eliot's ideas in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," where Eliot holds that "the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past".http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html For Bakhtin, the influence can also occur at the level of the individual word or phrase as much as it does the work and even the oeuvre or collection of works.  A German cannot use the word "fatherland" or the phrase "blood and soil" without (possibly unintentionally) also echoing (or, Bakhtin would say "refracting") the meaning that those terms took on under National Socialism.  Every word has a history of usage to which it responds, and anticipates a future response.
The term 'dialogic' does not only apply to literature.  For Bakhtin, all language — indeed, all thought — appears as dialogical.  This means that everything anybody ever says always exists in response to things that have been said before and in anticipation of things that will be said in response.  In other words, we do not speak in a vacuum.  All language (and the ideas which language contains and communicates) is dynamic, relational and engaged in a process of endless redescriptions of the world.
Bakhtin also emphasized certain uses of language that maximized the dialogic nature of words, and other uses that attempted to limit or restrict their polyvocality.  At one extreme is novelistic discourse, particularly that of a Dostoevsky (or Mark Twain) in which various registers and languages are allowed to interact and respond to each other. At the other extreme would be the military order (or 1984 newspeak) which attempts to minimize all orientations of the work toward the past or the future, and which prompts no response but obedience.
When scholars, like Julia Kristeva, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, rediscovered Bakhtin, his work seemed to fit with the then-nascent concepts of "intertextuality". And European social psychologists applied Bakhtin's work to the study of human social experience, preferring it as a more dynamic alternative to Cartesian monologicality.

[[Maturation promoting factor]]

CATEGORIES: Proteins, Cell cycle

Maturation-promoting factor (abbreviated MPF, also called mitosis-promoting factor or M-Phase-promoting factor) is a heterodimeric protein composed of cyclin B and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1, also known as Cdc2 or p34 kinase) that stimulates the mitotic and meiotic phases of the cell cycle. MPF promotes the entrance into mitosis (the M phase) from the G2 phase by phosphorylating multiple proteins needed during mitosis. MPF is activated at the end of G2 by a phosphatase, which removes an inhibitory phosphate group added earlier.
The MPF is also called the M phase kinase because of its ability to phosphorylate target proteins at a specific point in the cell cycle and thus control their ability to function.

CATEGORIES: Infiniti vehicles, Rear-wheel-drive vehicles, Vehicles with four-wheel steering, Mid-size cars, Sedans, 1990s automobiles

 
The Infiniti J30, or Nissan Leopard J Ferie (férié is French for "holiday") in Japan, was a rear wheel drive luxury car. The J30 went into production on April 7, 1992 as a 1993 model to replace the M30 (which was a coupe), and was launched in the United States after its competitor, the Lexus ES. The car was designed to slot between the smaller G20 and the larger Q45, as Infiniti's first mid-size sedan to compete directly with the Acura Legend. Also, it was fairly small but featured rounded styling uncharacteristic of the crowded executive car class, that is now reminiscent of a four-door coupé.  Chief exterior designer for the J30 was Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design International (NDI). In a promotional video produced in 1994, it was referred to as a "personal luxury sedan" as attempt to define it as a four-door coupé.
To establish that this was a luxury vehicle, the interior was largely designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau http://www.poltronafrau.com/portal/page/portal/UI/webpages/poltronafrau/home?lang=en  of Italy, whom they had previously worked with on the larger Q45. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement from the larger Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door panels, headliner, carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window lockout switch installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed at the top of the interior door pull handle.
Unlike earlier Infinitis, the J30 received effective advertisement with jazz music and artistic camera shots. Power came from a 3.0 L VG30DE V6 (shared with the 300ZX) which produced 210 hp and [tpl]convert|192|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque. While it shares the Y32 Chassis with the Nissan Cedric/Gloria, it was essentially a rebadged version of the Japan-market Nissan Leopard, where it was offered with both the VG30DE and VH41DE V8.
All J30s were built in Tochigi, Tochigi, Japan. Production of the J30 ended on June 18, 1997, replaced by the Infiniti I30 (introduced in 1996). The J30 was packaged with a long list of standard features including (but not limited to) a leather interior, bronze tinted exterior glass, digital climate control, real burlwood trim surrounding the climate control unit, Bose sound system control module,and front ashtray, a power metal panel sunroof, dual 8-way power seats, dual airbags, variable speed sensitive power steering, and three-channel Anti-Lock brakes with ventilated discs front and rear.  
One of the shortcomings of the J30 was its lack of interior room. It had the distinction of being a mid-size car with the space of a subcompact (less than a Sentra) due to its sloping roofline and shrunken trunk. 
Infiniti also produced a touring model, the J30t. This model featured a rear spoiler, BBS style alloy wheels, a MacPherson strut front suspension with a multi-link suspension for the rear wheels (standard equipment on all J30 versions), and HICAS, Nissan's four wheel steering technology (available in the J30t from 1993-1994).  The J30 remained nearly unchanged through its production period.  Heated seats became standard equipment in the 1994 model year.  For 1995, the J30 received subtle vertical ribbing in the tail light lenses and in '96 the diagnostic system was upgraded to "OBD2".  Otherwise, the J30 received only minor alterations between 1993 and 1997 model years.

[[Logical atomism]]
CATEGORIES: Bertrand Russell, Theories of language, Theories of deduction, Metaphysical theories

Logical atomism is a philosophical belief that originated in the early 20th century with the development of analytic philosophy. Its principal exponents were the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, the early work of his Austrian-born pupil and colleague Ludwig Wittgenstein, and his German counterpart Rudolf Carnap.
The theory holds that the world consists of ultimate logical "facts" (or "atoms") that cannot be broken down any further. Having originally propounded this stance in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein rejected it in his later Philosophical Investigations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
The name for this kind of theory was coined in 1918 by Russell in response to what he called "logical holism"—i.e., the belief that the world operates in such a way that no part can be known without the whole being known first.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] This belief is commonly called monism, and in particular, Russell (and G. E. Moore) were reacting to the absolute idealism dominant then in Britain.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]

The Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising or simply the Ilinden Uprising of August 1903 ([tpl]lang-bg|Илинденско-Преображенско въстание[/tpl], Ilindensko-Preobrazhensko vastanie; [tpl]lang-mk|Илинденско востание[/tpl], Ilindensko vostanie; [tpl]lang-el|Εξέγερση του Ίλιντεν[/tpl], Eksegersi tou Ilinden) was an organized revolt against the Ottoman Empire, which was prepared and carried out by the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization.The Establishment of the Balkan National States, 1804-1920, C. & B. Jelavich, 1977, pp 211-212 The name of the uprising refers to Ilinden (Cyrillic script: Илинден), the Bulgarian and Macedonian name for Elijah's day, and to Preobrazhenie (Cyrillic script: Преображение), which means Transfiguration.
The British researcher of the Balkans H. N. Brailsford wrote in his book Macedonia: Its Races and Their Future: "The moment for which the Bulgarian population had been preparing for ten years arrived on the festival of the Prophet Elijah's day — the evening of Sunday, August the 2nd, 1903."[tpl]Citation | title=Macedonia: Its Races and their future | author=H. N. Brailsford | year=1906 | publisher=New York, Arno Press | location=London | pages=148[/tpl] At the same time on the other end of the SMARO's territory, in Eastern Thrace, the leaders of the Adrianople Vilayet comitajis, had unanimously agreed that they were not ready for uprising, but out of a feeling of solidarity, had voted for a rising. So in Strandzha the rising had begun on the Feast of the Transfiguration, August 19, 1903.For freedom and perfection. The Life of Yané Sandansky. Mercia MacDermott  (Journeyman, London, 1988), p. 134.
The rebellion in the region of Macedonia affected most of the central and southwestern parts of the Monastir Vilayet receiving the support mainly of the local Bulgarian peasants and to some extent of the Aromanian population of the region. Provisional government was established in the town of Kruševo (to the west of Prilep), where the insurgents proclaimed the Kruševo Republic under the presidency of the school teacher Nikola Karev, which was overrun after just ten days, on August 12. On August 19, a closely related uprising organized by Bulgarian peasants in the Adrianople Vilayet led to the liberation of a large area in the Strandzha Mountains near the Black Sea coast, and the creation of a provisional government in Vassiliko, the Strandzha Republic. This lasted about twenty days before being put down by the Turks.
By the time the rebellion had started, many of its most promising potential leaders, including Ivan Garvanov and Gotse Delchev, had already been arrested or killed by the Ottomans, and the effort was quashed within a couple of months. The survivors managed to maintain a guerrilla campaign against the Turks for the next few years, but its greater effect was that it persuaded the European powers to attempt to convince the Ottoman sultan that he must take a more conciliatory attitude toward his Christian subjects in Europe.

Restoule is a community and designated place in geographic Patterson Township[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.geologyontario.mndmf.gov.on.ca/website/historic_claim_maps/P/Patterson.pdf |format= PDF|title= Patterson|work= Geology Ontario - Historic Claim Maps|publisher= Ontario Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and Forestry|accessdate= 2013-06-11[/tpl] in the Centre Unorganized Part of Parry Sound District in Central Ontario, Canada. It is situated on the Restoule River between Commanda Lake, and Restoule Lake and is part of the Almaguin Highlands region.
Restoule has a local services board that covers the main community of Restoule and the small communities of Carr and Farley's Corners in neighbouring geographic Pringle Township. Along with the nearby communities of Loring and Port Loring and other smaller hamlets, the area promotes itself as the Loring-Restoule tourist area.
Restoule is located south of Lake Nipissing, and north of Ontario's famous cottage country. Despite being north of this area, Restoule is a major centre for cottages, as is the entire Loring-Restoule region. Due to location and distance from Toronto, Restoule is not as popular as regions such as Muskoka to the south. The largest nearby city is North Bay 65 kilometres by road northeast of Restoule. 
Restoule is located on Ontario Highway 534 and is a 9 kilometre drive southeast of Restoule Provincial Park. There is only one way to get into Restoule, and that's on Highway 534 from the east. There's a secondary route from the west from Dokis territory and leads into town on Hawthorne Rd. Entering the village, one can see the main General Store off the highway on the right. The main centre of the community however can be found off Highway 534, across the Restoule River. On this side of the river, there is a Royal Canadian Legion (Branch #639), a Lion's Club, Community Centre, Outdoor Hockey Rink, Play structures, a United Church and an Anglican Church. There is a Pentecostal Corner Gospel Church 5 km east of the village at the intersection of Hwys. 524 and 534. There are several housekeeping cottages, camps and lodges.
Cottages dot the shores of both Restoule Lake north of town and Commanda Lake south of town. Also dotting the rolling countryside are various farms. Most of all, the scenery is dominated by majestic forests on the Canadian Shield.
Restoule residents elect three local government organizations to manage their affairs: The Restoule Local Services Board, Patterson Township Local Roads Board and Restoule Sanitary Landfill Committee. 
Restoule has broadband Internet access and cell phone service provided by Bell. As of Apr. 30, 1014 Rogers has not co-located on the Bell tower so there is little to no Rogers coverage.

A need is something that is necessary for organisms to live a healthy life. Needs are distinguished from wants because a deficiency would cause a clear negative outcome, such as dysfunction or death. Needs can be objective and physical, such as food, or they can be subjective and psychological, such as the need for self-esteem. On a social level, needs are sometimes controversial. Understanding needs and wants is an issue in the fields of politics, social science, and philosophy.

Hristo Naumov Shopov ([tpl]lang-bg|Христо Наумов Шопов[/tpl]) (born 4 January 1964 in Sofia) is a Bulgarian actor. Shopov's father, Naum Shopov, is a famous Bulgarian actor as well.
He is most noted for his portrayal of Pontius Pilate in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. He has become one of Bulgaria's most successful actors, making his debut in 1981 with Dishay, choveche (Breathe, Little Man!). His body of work includes many Bulgarian films such as Vchera (Yesterday) and Sledvay me (Follow Me). He has also appeared in several low-budget US film productions including Phantom Force, Target of Opportunity and Alien Hunter. In his homeland, he is best known for his role in the movie Vchera, which became a symbol of several generations. The movie tells the story of young Bulgarian people studying in an English college during Communist rule.
Mary Soan, an assistant director of the film I Am David, suggested that he would be suited for the role of Pilate to Shaila Rubin, who was casting the film. After Hristo and Gibson had a brief conversation, Hristo was given the part. Shopov also played the role of Pontius Pilate in the 2006 film The Inquiry, which also cast Max von Sydow as Emperor Tiberius.
He recently played the Russian premier in the upcoming Command Performance starring and directed by Dolph Lundgren. In 2011 he starred in the films Love.net and Operation Shmenti Capelli.

In the 1960s, he spent several years as an arranger and composer for Stan Kenton and Duke Ellington orchestras. Kenton's album Standards In Silhouette consists entirely of Mathieu's arrangements and revealed the young Mathieu (then 22 years of age) to be an incredibly adept manipulator of compositional materials.
Mathieu was one of the founders and the musical director for the Second City in Chicago,Coda Magazine: Issue 319–330 the first ongoing improvisational theater troupe in the United States, and was later the musical director for the Committee, an improv theater in San Francisco that was an offshoot of Second City. In the 1970s, he was on the faculties of San Francisco Conservatory of Music and Mills College.  Allaudin was the original director of the Sufi Choir founded in 1969 in San Francisco among followers of Samuel L. Lewis.
Mathieu began recording solo piano albums in 1980, and has composed a large variety of chamber pieces, choral works, and song cycles.
His books include:
Harmonic Experience (561 pages) offers a view of music theory that harmonizes Western and Eastern perspectives. Understanding can be actively enhanced by utilizing its  autodidactic ear-training and sight-singing exercises, especially  using singing sargam syllables over a drone such as a tamboura or possibly a Western fifth played in just intonation.
An audio edition of The Listening Book was issued on two cassette tapes in 1991 By Shambhala Lion Editions. That audio material was remastered and issued along with new audio material read from The Musical Life in 2008 on the Manifest Spirit Records label.

[[Nibbler]]
CATEGORIES: Cutting tools, Metalworking cutting tools, Fabrication (metal)

A nibbler is a tool for cutting sheet metal with minimal distortion. One type operates much like a punch and die, with a blade that moves in a linear fashion against a fixed die, removing small bits of metal and leaving a kerf approximately 6 mm wide.  Another type operates similar to tin snips, but shears the sheet along two parallel tracks 3–6 mm apart, rolling up the waste in a tight spiral as it cuts.  Nibblers may be manual (hand operated) or powered. 
Power nibblers are often powered by compressed air, though electrical types also exist. A common DIY nibbler tool is an electric drill attachment, which converts the rotary motion of the drill into a reciprocating motion of the jaw.

[[Ubiquitin ligase]]
CATEGORIES: EC 6.3, Posttranslational modification

A ubiquitin ligase (also called an E3 ubiquitin ligase) is a ligase enzyme that combines with a ubiquitin-containing E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, recognizes the target protein that is to be ubiquinated, and causes the attachment of ubiquitin to a lysine on the target protein via an isopeptide bond. An E3 ubiquitin ligase targets specific protein substrates for degradation by the proteasome.  In general, the ubiquitin ligase is involved in poly-ubiquitination: a second ubiquitin is attached to the first, a third is attached to the second, and so forth.  Poly-ubiquitination marks proteins for degradation by the proteasome.
However, there are some ubiquitination events that are limited to mono-ubiquitination, in which only a single ubiquitin is added by the ubiquitin ligase to a substrate molecule.  Mono-ubiquitinated proteins are not targeted to the proteasome for degradation, but may instead be altered in their cellular location or function, for example, via binding other proteins that have domains capable of binding ubiquitin.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
Further complicating matters, different lysines on ubiquitin can be targeted by an E3 to make chains.  The most common lysine is Lys48 on the ubiquitin chain.  This is the lysine used to make polyubiquitin, which is recognized by the proteasome.   However, Lys63 can also be used, and chains using this lysine are important for DNA repair, among other functions.

[[Collegiate wrestling]]

CATEGORIES: Amateur wrestling, College wrestling in the United States, Student sport, Sports rules and regulations

Collegiate wrestling, sometimes known in the United States as folkstyle wrestling, is a style of amateur wrestling practiced at the college and university level in the United States. Collegiate wrestling emerged from the folk wrestling styles practiced in the early history of the United States. This style, with some slight modifications, is also practiced at the high school and middle school levels, and also among younger participants, where it is known as scholastic wrestling. These names help distinguish collegiate wrestling from other styles of wrestling that are practiced around the world such as those in the Olympic Games: freestyle wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling.
Collegiate wrestling, like its international counterpart, freestyle wrestling, has its main origins in catch-as-catch-can wrestling.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99289/catch-as-catch-can-wrestling In both styles, the ultimate goal is to pin the opponent to the mat, which results in an immediate win. Collegiate and freestyle wrestling, unlike Greco-Roman, also both allow the use of the wrestler's or his opponent's legs in offense and defense. However, collegiate wrestling has had so many influences from the wide variety of folk wrestling styles brought into the country that it has become distinctly American.

Karl Hermann Struve (October 3, 1854 – August 12, 1920) was a Russian astronomer. In Russian, his name is sometimes given as German Ottovich Struve (Герман Оттович Струве) or German Ottonovich Struve (Герман Оттонович Струве).
Herman Struve was a part of the famous group of astronomers from the Struve family, which also included his grandfather Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, father Otto Wilhelm von Struve, brother Ludwig Struve and nephew Otto Struve. Unlike other astronomers of the Struve family, Herman spent most of his career in Germany. Continuing the family tradition, Struve's research was focused on determining the positions of stellar objects. He was particularly known for his work on satellites of planets of the Solar System and development of the intersatellite method of correcting their orbital position. The mathematical Struve function is named after him.

Mohawk Valley Community College is a two-year college of the State University of New York located in Oneida County, New York in the United States. The college has campuses in Rome and Utica. 
Mohawk Valley Community College offers degrees and certificates in more than 90 areas and reported in the Spring 2011 semester that it currently had about 7,200 full- or part-time students.
Mohawk Valley Community College was the first community college established in New York State. Founded in 1946 as the New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences at Utica, it was one of five post-secondary institutions established on an experimental basis after World War II. The two-year public college offered programs leading to technical and semiprofessional employment in business and industry.
In 1948, the State University of New York was created and authorized to recommend the establishment of community colleges. The College became a constituent unit of the State University in 1950. The following year, the College was authorized to grant the Associate in Applied Science degree.
In 1953, the County of Oneida assumed the sponsorship of the College, then known as Mohawk Valley Technical Institute, under the "Community College Law" section of the 1948 Education Law. This section authorized the cost of operating a community college to be shared equally through student tuition, state aid and charges to the counties of New York State.
The following year, the college began offering classes in Rome, New York, to better serve the needs of northern and western Oneida County. Classes were offered at the former Griffiss Air Force Base from 1954 to 1958 and again from 1969 to 1974. In 1974, a branch campus was established in Rome at the current location on Floyd Avenue.
As a community college, MVTI saw its enrollment and facilities grow. From 1946 to 1960, the College occupied temporary quarters in New Hartford and downtown Utica. In 1960, the College moved to new buildings on an [tpl]convert|80|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] site in southeast Utica. In 1963, the college change its name to Mohawk Valley Community College.
In August 2004, MVCC was given the Pepsi/NATYCAA Award.  This award recognized that MVCC was the most successful, non-scholarship athletic program for a two-year college in the nation (2003-2004.)
As of Spring 2011, the MVCC "Hawks" had an overall winning record of more than 70 percent in 22 different collegiate sports.

The Movement for Democratic Renewal and Development ([tpl]lang-fr|Mouvement pour le Renouveau Démocratique et le Développement[/tpl]), ([tpl]lang-ar|لحركة التجديد الديموقراطي والتنمية[/tpl]) is a political party in Djibouti. It was originally known as the Party for Democratic Renewal. The PRD of Djibouti was created with the purpose of forming a national democratic party.  The PRD gained popularity at the collapse of the communist bloc and the end of the Cold War.  It used its military power gained through its coalition with the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) and the Movement for Peace and Reconciliation (MPR).  The current leader of PRD is Abdillani Hamariteha.
The PRD was founded by Mohamed Djame Elabe, a former minister in the government, on 27 September 1992;"Djibouti: Political opposition parties (This Response replaces an earlier version dated 13 January 1999).", Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (UNHCR Refworld), DJI31018.FE, 1 February 1999. it replaced the Movement for Peace and Reconciliation, a group founded by Djame in early 1992.Political Parties of the World (6th edition, 2005), ed. Bogdan Szajkowski, page 181. The party participated in the December 1992 parliamentary election and won 24.41% of vote, although it obtained no representation in the National Assembly; no other opposition party participated in the election, and all seats were won by the ruling People's Rally for Progress (RPP).
Standing as the PRD presidential candidate in the May 1993 presidential election, Djame placed second behind President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and received about 22% of the vote. Djame died on 26 November 1996, and the PRD held a congress on 23 May 1997, electing Hamariteha as PRD President, Maki Houmed Gaba as First Vice-President, and Carton Dibeth Oblik as Second Vice-President.
In the December 1997 parliamentary election, the PRD received 19.2% of the vote but again failed to win any seats.

[[Brillouin scattering]]
CATEGORIES: Scattering, absorption and radiative transfer (optics), Scattering, Fiber-optic communications

Brillouin scattering, named after Léon Brillouin, occurs when light, transmitted by a transparent carrier interacts with that carrier's time-&-space-periodic variations in refractive index.   As described by optics, the index of refraction of a transparent material changes under deformation (compression-distension or shear-skewing).
The result of the interaction between the light-wave and the carrier-deformation-wave is that a fraction from the passing-through light-wave changes its momentum (thus its frequency and energy) along preferential angles, as if by being diffracted by an oscillating 3-D grating. 
If the involved light carrier is a solid crystal, a macromolecular chain condensate or a viscous liquid, then the low frequency atomic-chain-deformation waves in the carrier (represented as a quasiparticle) could be for example: 1. mass oscillation (acoustic) modes (called phonons); 2. charge displacement modes (in dielectrics, called polarons); 3. magnetic spin oscillation modes (in magnetic materials, called magnons).

[[National Democratic Party (Djibouti)]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties in Djibouti

The National Democratic Party ([tpl]lang-fr|Parti National Démocratique[/tpl]), ([tpl]lang-ar|الحزب الوطني الديموقراطي[/tpl]) is a political party in Djibouti. It was founded as an opposition party in 1992 by Aden Robleh Awaleh, who remains the party's president. It was part of the ruling coalition in 2005,Political Parties of the World (6th edition, 2005), ed. Bogdan Szajkowski, page 181. but has since rejoined the opposition against President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh.
The PND was founded on 13 September 1992,"Discours de M. ADEN ROBLEH AWALEH, Président du PND", PND website (2003 archive page), September 13, 1995 [tpl]fr icon[/tpl]. and it boycotted the December 1992 parliamentary election. Seeking greater democracy, it then called for a transitional national unity government to be formed. Awaleh stood as the party's candidate in the May 1993 presidential election, receiving 12% of the vote and placing third.
On 27 October 1995, a PND protest was broken up by the police and many PND members, including Awaleh, were arrested."Un parti d'opposition réclame la libération de ses dirigeants arrêtés", AFP (PND website, 2003 archive), 28 October 1995 [tpl]fr icon[/tpl]. The party participated in the December 1997 parliamentary election, but failed to win any seats, obtaining 2.3% of the vote."Djibouti: Political opposition parties (This Response replaces an earlier version dated 13 January 1999.", Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (UNHCR Refworld), DJI31018.FE, 1 February 1999.

The PND experienced internal division in the late 1990s. In May 1997, Awaleh suspended PND spokesman Farah Ali Wabert from the party, a move that reportedly exacerbated the situation. By November 1998, a rival leadership under Mahdi Ahmed Abdillahié controlled the PND headquarters, and in the same month, the PND headquarters was attacked with a grenade; there was no claim of responsibility for the attack.

[[Communist League (Canada)]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties established in 1977, Communist parties in Canada

The Communist League  in Canada was founded as the "Revolutionary Workers League/Ligue Ouvrière Révolutionnaire" (RWL) in 1977 as the result of a merger of the League for Socialist Action (LSA), the Revolutionary Marxist Group (RMG) and the Groupe Marxiste Revolutionaire.http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ca.secondwave/announceccl.html
Originally a Trotskyist party, the RWL was the Canadian section of the United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USFI). The group followed the US Socialist Workers Party's (SWP) trajectory away from Trotskyism in favour of a view of Fidel Castro's Cuba as the vanguard of world revolution[tpl]Failed verification|date=March 2011[/tpl]. The RWL purged members who did not support the new orientation [tpl]Failed verification|date=March 2011[/tpl], many of whom went on to form Socialist Challenge and Gauche Socialiste.
In the late 1980s, the RWL left the USFI to become part of the new Pathfinder tendency based around the SWP. It changed its name to the Communist League in 1990. The new group ceased publication of the English Socialist Voice in favour of selling The Militant, published in New York City by the SWP.
Michel Prairie is the group's general secretary and primary spokesperson.
In early 2004, two former activists in the group left the CL over a dispute regarding protests against the US invasion of Iraq, and started Socialist Voice, taking the name of the RWL's old newspaper.
The CL operates a Pathfinder Bookstore in Montreal.http://www.themilitant.com/direct.shtml#3
The Communist League should not be confused with the Young Communist League which is youth wing of the Communist Party of Canada and is Marxist-Leninist.

The Battle of Blue Licks, fought on August 19, 1782, was one of the last battles of the American Revolutionary War. The battle occurred ten months after Lord Cornwallis's famous surrender at Yorktown, which had effectively ended the war in the east. On a hill next to the Licking River in what is now Robertson County, Kentucky (but was then in Kentucky County, Virginia), a force of about 50 American and Canadian Loyalists along with 300 American Indians ambushed and routed 182 Kentucky militiamen. It was the worst defeat for the Kentuckians during the frontier war.

[[Canadian pale]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Canada, Heraldic ordinaries, Vexillology

In vexillology a Canadian pale is a centre band of a vertical triband flag (a pale in heraldry) that covers half the length of a flag, rather than a third in most triband designs. This allows more space to display a central image (common charge). The name was suggested by Dr. George Stanley, and first used by Elizabeth II of Canada proclaiming the new Canadian flag on 28 January 1965. Properly, the term should only apply to Canadian flags, though in general use the term is also used to describe non-Canadian flags that have similar proportions.
The classic Canadian pale is a square central panel occupying half of a flag with 1:2 proportions. However, vexillological usage applies it to any central band that is half the width of the flag, even if this renders it non-square. Though technically incorrect, the term Canadian pale is also used for flags which do not originate in Canada. The 3:5 proposed flag of Taiwan and the 7:11 flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are both described as having a Canadian pale.
The Canadian pale is a popular feature of sub-national and municipal flags from Canada developed after 1965. A few examples can be found in the flag of the Northwest Territories, and the cities of Edmonton, Alberta; Cornwall, Ontario and Burlington, Ontario.
The term is sometimes used in an even looser sense to refer to any flag with a larger central panel, irrespective of whether or not it covers half the flag. By this looser description, the flag of Norfolk Island (stripes in a ratio of 7:9:7) and the flag of Iowa (ratio legally undefined, but usually the central stripe is less than twice that of the outer stripes) are sometimes considered to have a Canadian pale.
By analogy, any flag which has a central horizontal stripe that is half the height of the flag is sometimes said to have a Spanish fess.

It was formed by followers of Melchior Ndadaye from the disbanded Burundi Workers' Party in 1986. FRODEBU was legalized as a political party in 1992.
In 1993, FRODEBU won power in Burundi. The election of the Hutu government triggered violence between Hutu and Tutsi militias, and the President was assassinated. In retaliation, FRODEBU killed 25 000 Tutsi. Tutsi responded with an outbreak of violence against Hutus and killed civilians in retaliation. The violence was on a smaller scale then the mass genocide occurring in Rwanda where Hutu were massacring Tutsi.

[[GD Graphics Library]]

CATEGORIES: Free software programmed in C, Graphics libraries

The GD Graphics Library is a graphics software library by Thomas Boutell and others for dynamically manipulating images. Its native programming language is ANSI C, but it has interfaces for many other programming languages. It can create GIFs, JPEGs, PNGs, and WBMPs. Support for drawing GIFs was dropped in 1999 when Unisys revoked the royalty-free license granted to non-commercial software projects for the LZW compression method used by GIFs. 
When the Unisys patent expired worldwide on July 7, 2004, GIF support was subsequently re-enabled.
GD originally stood for "GIF Draw". However, since the revoking of the Unisys license, it has informally stood for "Graphics Draw".
GD can create images composed of lines, arcs, text (using program-selected fonts), other images, and multiple colors. Version 2.0 adds support for  truecolor images, alpha channels, resampling (for smooth resizing of truecolor images), and many other features.
GD supports numerous programming languages including C, PHP, Perl, Python, OCaml, Tcl, Lua, Pascal, GNU Octave, REXX, Ruby and Go. In addition, the "Fly" command line interpreter allows for image creation ("on the fly") using GD.  GD scripts can thus be written in potentially any language and run using this tool.http://martin.gleeson.com/fly/ "fly" site by Martin Gleeson
GD is extensively used with PHP, where a modified version supporting additional features is included by default as of PHP 4.3 and was an option before that. As of PHP 5.3, a system version of GD may be used as well, to get the additional features that were previously available only to the bundled version of GD.

A multivitamin is a preparation intended to be a dietary supplement with vitamins, dietary minerals, and other nutritional elements. Such preparations are available in the form of tablets, capsules, pastilles, powders, liquids, and injectable formulations. Other than injectable formulations, which are only available and administered under medical supervision, multivitamins are recognized by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the United Nations' authority on food standards) as a category of food.Codex Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements Accessed 27 December 2007
Multivitamin supplements are commonly provided in combination with dietary minerals. A multivitamin/mineral supplement is defined in the United States as a supplement containing 3 or more vitamins and minerals that does not include herbs, hormones, or drugs, where each vitamin and mineral is included at a dose below the tolerable upper level, as determined by the Food and Drug Board, and does not present a risk of adverse health effects.National Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science Panel. National Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science Conference Statement: multivitamin/mineral supplements and chronic disease prevention" Am J Clin Nutr 2007;85:257S-64S The terms multivitamin and multimineral are often used interchangeably. There is no scientific definition for either.http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/85/1/269S.pdf Accessed 21 July 2009
In otherwise healthy people, some scientific evidence indicates that multivitamin supplements do not prevent cancer, heart disease, or other ailments. However, there may be specific groups of people who may benefit from multivitamin supplements (for example, people with poor nutrition or at high risk of macular degeneration). According to the Harvard School of Public Health: "Looking at all the evidence, the potential health benefits of taking a standard daily multivitamin seem to outweigh the potential risks for most people."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/vitamins/index.html |title=Harvard School of Public Health » The Nutrition Source » Vitamins |publisher=Hsph.harvard.edu |accessdate=2013-09-22[/tpl]

The Democratic Republican Movement (MDR, French: Mouvement démocratique républicain) was a political party of Rwanda.  It was founded in 1991, after the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) lost its monopoly on politics and opposition parties became legal. The MDR took its name from President Grégoire Kayibanda's political party, Parmehutu-MDR. Like Parmehutu, the MDR's primary base of political support was in the center of the country, particularly Kayibanda's home prefecture of Gitarama.
In late 1991, the MDR joined with the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party to form an opposition coalition that placed pressure on President Juvénal Habyarimana and the MRND to implement democratic reforms.  In March 1992, President Habyarimana named a multiparty government with a prime minister, Dismas Nsengiyaremye, from the MDR.Gérard Prunier, The Rwanda Crisis: History of a Genocide, New York: Columbia University Press, 1995, 145.  He was succeeded as prime minister in July 1993 by another MDR figure, Agathe Uwilingiyimana.
Following their 1994 victory, the RPF named a new Broad Based Government of National Unity with the MDR's Faustin Twagiramungi as prime minister.  The party was banned in 2006 following allegations that it promoted genocide ideology against Tutsi.
The MDR was primarily Hutu in composition. It is not to be confused with the  former MRND party, which was the dominant party of Rwanda until 1994.
The former Prime Minister of Rwanda, Bernard Makuza, was a member of the MDR.

Salacca is a genus of 20 species of palms native to Indonesia and Malaysia. They are very short-stemmed palms, with leaves up to 6–8 m long. The leaves have a spiny petiole; in most species they are pinnate with numerous leaflets, but some species, notably S. magnifica, have undivided leaves.
The fruit grow in clusters at the base of the plants, and are edible in many species, with a reddish-brown scaly skin covering a white pulp and one to two large inedible seeds. The Salak (S. zalacca) or snakefruit is the species most widely grown for its fruit; the firm white pulp has a slight acidic taste. The skin of the snakefruit has a unique texture not unlike that of a snake's skin, rough to the touch in one direction but smooth in the other.

[[Degree (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Scale degrees

In music theory, a scale degree is the name given to a particular note of a scaleKolb, Tom (2005). Music Theory for Guitarists, p.16. ISBN 0-634-06651-X. to specify its position relative to the tonic (the main note of the scale). The tonic is considered to be the first degree of the scale, from which each octave is assumed to begin.
Any musical scale may be thought to have degrees. However, the notion of scale degree is most commonly applied to scales in which a tonic is specified by definition, such as the 7-tone diatonic scales (e.g. the C-major scale C–D–E–F–G–A–B, in which C is the tonic). As for the 12-tone chromatic scale, the selection of a first degree is possible in theory, but arbitrary and not meaningful, because typically all the notes of a chromatic scale have the same importance.
The expression scale step is sometimes used as a synonym of scale degree, but it may also refer, perhaps more properly and less ambiguously, to the distance, or interval, between two successive scale degrees (see Steps and skips). Indeed, the terms whole step and half step are commonly used as interval names. The number of scale degrees and the distance between them together define a scale.

[[Navigational database]]
CATEGORIES: Data management, Types of databases

A navigational database is a type of database in which records or objects are found primarily by following references from other objects. Navigational interfaces are usually procedural, though some modern systems like XPath can be considered to be simultaneously navigational and declarative. 
Navigational access is traditionally associated with the network model and hierarchical model of database interfaces, and some have even acquired set-oriented features.[tpl]cite book | author = Błażewicz, Jacek | coauthors = Królikowski, Zbyszko; Morzy, Tadeusz | title = Handbook on Data Management in Information Systems  | publisher = Springer  | year = 2003  | location =  | page = 18  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=AvLziHKyuLcC&pg=PA18&dq=%22Navigational+database%22+-wikipedia+network+model+and+hierarchical+model&ie=ISO-8859-1| doi =  | isbn = 3-540-43893-9 [/tpl] Navigational techniques use "pointers" and "paths" to navigate among data records (also known as "nodes"). This is in contrast to the relational model (implemented in relational databases), which strives to use "declarative" or logic programming techniques that ask the system for what to fetch instead of how to navigate to it.  
For example, to give directions to a house, the navigational approach would resemble something like "Get on highway 25 for 8 miles, turn onto Horse Road, left at the red barn, then stop at the 3rd house down the road", whereas the declarative approach would resemble "Visit the green house(s) within the following coordinates...."
Hierarchical models are also considered navigational because one "goes" up (to parent), down (to leaves), and there are "paths", such as the familiar file/folder paths in hierarchical file systems. In general, navigational systems will use combinations of paths and prepositions such as "next", "previous", "first", "last", "up", "down", "owner", etc.
"Paths" are often formed by concatenation of node names or node addresses. Example:
  Node6.Node4.Node5.Node1
Or
  Node6/Node4/Node5/Node1
If there is no link between given nodes, then an error condition is usually triggered with a message such as "Invalid Path".  The path "Node6.Node2.Node1" would be invalid in most systems because there is no direct link between Node 6 and Node 2.
The usage of the term "navigational" allegedly is derived from a statement by Charles Bachman in which he describes the "programmer as navigator" while accessing his favored type of database.[tpl]cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=362534&coll=portal&dl=ACM |title=The programmer as navigator |doi=10.1145/355611.362534 |publisher=Portal.acm.org |accessdate=2012-10-01[/tpl]
Except for hierarchical file systems (which some consider a form of database), navigational techniques fell out of favor by the 1980s. However, object oriented programming and XML have kindled a renewed, but controversial interest in navigational techniques.
Critics of navigational techniques view them as "unstructured spaghetti messes", and liken them to the "goto" of pre-structured programming. In other words, they are allegedly to data organization what goto's were to behavior flow. In this view, relational techniques provide improved discipline and consistency to data organization and usage because of its roots in set theory and predicate calculus. 
Some also suggest that navigational database engines are easier to build and take up less memory (RAM) than relational equivalents. However, the existence of relational or relational-based products of the late 1980s that possessed small engines (by today's standards) because they didn't use SQL suggest this is not necessarily the case. Whatever the reason, navigational techniques are still the preferred way to handle smaller-scale structures.
A current example of navigational structuring can be found in the Document Object Model (DOM) often used in web browsers and closely associated with JavaScript. The DOM "engine" is essentially a light-weight navigational database. The World Wide Web itself and Wikipedia could potentially be considered forms of navigational databases, though they focus on human-readable text rather than data (on a large scale, the Web is a network model and on smaller or local scales, such as domain and URL partitioning, it uses hierarchies).  In contrast, the Linked Data facet of the Semantic Web is specifically concerned with network-scale machine-readable data, and follows precisely the 'follow your nose' paradigm implied by the navigational idea.
A new kind of navigational databases has recently emerged, the Graph databases. This category of databases is often included as one of the four family of the NoSQL databases.

The Country of Carnival (Portuguese: O País do Carnaval) is a Brazilian Modernist novel. It was written by Jorge Amado in 1931. In this debut novel, the themes that would come to permeate the author's work can already be seen, albeit in an embryonic form. The book is an account of the typical Brazilian intelligentsia of the 1920s.
Paulo Rigger, a Brazilian intellectual who studied in Europe, wants to participate in the political and intellectual life of the country. He criticizes the racial miscegenation of the country and particularly the institution of carnaval, which he blames for the country's lagging development. Paulo finally becomes disillusioned and returns to Europe.

Jubiabá is a Brazilian modernist novel written by Jorge Amado in 1935. It was the basis for the 1986 motion picture of the same name, written and directed by Nelson Pereira dos Santos.
It tells the story of the friendship between a poor black youngster from Salvador de Bahia, Antonio Balduino, and a candomblé magician, Jubiabá. After the death of his insane aunt when he was a boy, Balduino is sent to work in a rich white family. However, he has to escape when he is injustly accused of violence towards Lindinalva, the beautiful daughter of his hosts. Balduino thenceforth spends the rest of his youth in freedom as a beggar, and later as a boxer. Depressed after his first defeat, he starts to work in a tobacco plantation, but a bloody feat forces him to flee again. At his return in Bahia, he surprisingly meets back his first love Lindinalva, who now works as a prostitute and, in point of death, entrusts her son to Balduino.
Balduino is then employed as a port worker. His encroachment in the general strike will cause him for the first time a conflict with his old friend Jubiabá, which he considers too much connected to past.

Karoline "Lina" Radke-Batschauer (18 October 1903 – 14 February 1983) was a German runner. She was the first Olympic champion in the 800 m for women.
Born as Lina Batschauer, she started competing in athletics at the age of 20. In those years sports such as running were considered far too exhausting for women. This vision was shared by many, including the originator of the modern Olympic movement, Pierre de Coubertin. 
In 1927, she married Georg Radke, who was her coach and a manager of her club SC Baden-Baden. The couple moved to Georg's hometown of Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland), where in 1927 Lina Radke set her first 800 m world record. Together with her husband, Lina Radke was one of the pioneers of female athletics in the mid-1920s. Competitions for women were not held frequently, but Radke nevertheless won several regional and national titles. She first specialised in the 1000 m, but when this was changed into the 800 m (because that distance would be held at the upcoming 1928 Summer Olympics), she switched to that event. The highlight of Radke's career were those 1928 Summer Olympics, as she won the inaugural title in the 800 m, earning the first German gold medal in athletics. Along the way, she set the first officially recognised world record in that event, 2:16.8, which would last until 1944. The IOC was however not pleased with the fact that several of Radke's competitors had been totally exhausted after the race, and decided to banish the event from the Games; it would not be included again until 1960. 
In 1930 Radke set a 1,000 m world record. She retired in 1934, after finishing fourth in the 800 m at the last Women's World Games (the winner, Zdenka Koubková, was later disqualified when discovered to be a man). After that she worked as athletics coach in Breslau and Torgau. Her husband took part in World War II and was held as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. Upon his release in 1950, the family moved to Karlsruhe.

[[Homogeneous function]]
CATEGORIES: Linear algebra, Differential operators, Types of functions

In mathematics, a homogeneous function is a function with multiplicative scaling behaviour: if the argument is multiplied by a factor, then the result is multiplied by some power of this factor. More precisely, if [tpl]nowrap|ƒ : V → W[/tpl] is a function between two vector spaces over a field F, and k is an integer,  then ƒ is said to be homogeneous of degree k if
for all nonzero [tpl]nowrap|α ∈ F[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|v ∈ V[/tpl]. This implies it has scale invariance. When the vector spaces involved are over the real numbers, a slightly more general form of homogeneity is often used, requiring only that ([tpl]EquationNote|1[/tpl]) hold for all α > 0. 
Homogeneous functions can also be defined for vector spaces with the origin deleted, a fact that is used in the definition of sheaves on projective space in algebraic geometry.  More generally, if S ⊂ V is any subset that is invariant under scalar multiplication by elements of the field (a "cone"), then an homogeneous function from S to W can still be defined by ([tpl]EquationNote|1[/tpl]).

Ivo Van Damme (21 February 1954 – 29 December 1976) was a Belgian middle distance runner.
Van Damme was born in Dendermonde.[tpl]cite news | title=À 22 ans, Ivo est entré dans l'Olympe | newspaper=Le Soir | date=30 August 2006[/tpl] He played football until he was 16, but then switched to athletics. His breakthrough came in 1973, when he placed fourth in the 800 m at the European Junior Championships.
He suffered from mononucleosis the following season, but returned strong beating Roger Moens's 1955  national 800 m record. In 1976, he won the European indoor title over this distance, and was one of the favourites for a medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. He eventually ended up second in both the 800 and 1500 m, finishing behind Alberto Juantorena and John Walker, respectively.
These were his last successes, as Van Damme was killed in a car accident later that year while travelling home from Marseille in southern France. He was to marry Rita Thijs in 1977. Since 1977, a memorial competition has been held in Brussels to remember him, the Memorial van Damme. It has become one of the major track and field meetings of the season.
After his death, Belgian athletics entered a long period without athletes with international fame. Together with the athletics event named after him, this turned Van Damme into a national icon and a reminder of a glorious past and missed opportunity. It was not until the arrival of Kim Gevaert and Tia Hellebaut that Belgian athletics got a boost again.

After Communism, Russian television channels struggled to gain viewers because of low budgets and lack of programming. To attract viewers, the M1 Network began experimenting in November 1999 with having Pesotskaya strip while delivering the news.  The ratings soared and the show, renamed Golaya Pravda (The Naked Truth), became the most widely viewed news program in Russia.  Pesotskaya took off her clothes on camera daily with a pair of hands, strategically placed as the only thing to preserve her decency.

Cantillation is the ritual chanting of readings from the Hebrew Bible in synagogue services. The chants are written and notated in accordance with the special signs or marks printed in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh) to complement the letters and vowel points.  These marks are known in English as accents and in Hebrew as טעמי המקרא ta`amei ha-mikra or just טעמים te`amim.  Some of these signs were also sometimes used in medieval manuscripts of the Mishnah.  The musical motifs associated with the signs are known in Hebrew as niggun or neginot (not to be confused with Hasidic nigun) and in Yiddish as טראָפ trop: the word trope is sometimes used in English with the same meaning.
A primary purpose of the cantillation signs is to guide the chanting of the sacred texts during public worship. Very roughly speaking, each word of text has a cantillation mark at its primary accent and associated with that mark is a musical phrase that tells how to sing that word.  The reality is more complex, with some words having two or no marks and the musical meaning of some marks dependent upon context. There are different sets of musical phrases associated with different sections of the Bible. The music varies with different Jewish traditions and individual cantorial styles.
The cantillation signs also provide information on the syntactical structure of the text and some say they are a commentary on the text itself, highlighting important ideas musically. The tropes are not random strings but follow a set and describable grammar.  The very word ta'am means "taste" or "sense", the point being that the pauses and intonation denoted by the accents (with or without formal musical rendition) bring out the sense of the passage.
There are two systems of cantillation marks in the Tanakh.  One is used in the twenty-one prose books, while the other appears in the three poetical books of Psalms, Proverbs and Job.  Except where otherwise stated, this article describes the "prose" system.
The current system of cantillation notes has its historical roots in the Tiberian masorah. The cantillation signs are included in Unicode as characters U+0591 through U+05AF in the Hebrew alphabet block.
The names of the cantillation signs are not quite the same as between the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Italian and Yemenite traditions; for example Sephardim use qadma to mean what Ashkenazim call pashta, and azla to mean what Ashkenazim call qadma.  In this article, as in almost all Hebrew grammars, the Ashkenazi terminology is used.  The names in other traditions are shown in the table below.

Alexandre Schaumasse (1882 – 1958) was a French astronomer.
He discovered the periodic comet 24P/Schaumasse.  He also discovered two non-periodic comets:  C/1913 J1 (Schaumasse) or 1913 II; and C/1917 H1 (Schaumasse) or 1917 II.
He also discovered two asteroids.
Gaston Fayet, director of the Observatory of Nice, gave him the responsibility of the Chercheur de comètes (Comet finder), a 25 cm (F/D 7.2) refractor offered by Germany to France after the World War 1, but it seems he never made serious observations with this instrument, which is "plenty of aberrations," according to the astronomer Robert Jonckheere. The 2 instruments he used most were the Grand Equatorial Coudé (with which he performed most of his observations) and the Petit Equatorial (current dome Charlois). 
 
 
He was severely wounded in 1914 while serving in the French army in World War I and spent at least a year in hospital.
 
 
The building built in 1931 to house the Chercheur de comètes now bears his name (Schaumasse dome).

Michel Giacobini (1873 – 1938) was a French astronomer.
He discovered a number of comets, including 21P/Giacobini-Zinner (parent body of the Giacobinids meteor shower), 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak, and 205P/Giacobini. The latter he had discovered at Nice on September 4, 1896, but it was not seen on its return, a little less than 7 years later, and was considered a lost comet and consequently designated D/1896 R2. On September 10, 2008, amateur supernova hunters Koichi Itagaki and Hiroshi Kaneda rediscovered it, on its seventeenth return.
He won the Lalande Prize in 1900 and worked at the Nice Observatory until 1910, when he requested a transfer to the Paris Observatory. He volunteered for military service in World War I and suffered the effects of poison gas. He recovered and resumed his astronomical activities after the war.

[[Single system image]]

CATEGORIES: Cluster computing

In distributed computing, a single system image (SSI) cluster is a cluster of machines that appears to be one single system. The concept is often considered synonymous with that of a distributed operating system, but a single image may be presented for more limited purposes, just job scheduling for instance, which may be achieved by means of an additional layer of software over conventional operating system images running on each node. The interest in SSI clusters is based on the perception that they may be simpler to use and administer than more specialized clusters. 
Different SSI systems may provide a more or less complete illusion of a single system.

"The Jaunt" is a short story by Stephen King first published in The Twilight Zone Magazine in 1981, and collected in King's 1985 collection Skeleton Crew. It belongs primarily to the genre of science fiction rather than King's customary horror, but is quite characteristic of King in probing deeply the minds of its characters when they are placed in incredible circumstances. 
The story takes place early in the 24th century, when the technology for teleportation, referred to as "Jaunting", is commonplace, allowing for instantaneous transportation across enormous distances, even to other planets in the solar system.
The term "Jaunting" is stated within the short story to be an homage to The Stars My Destination, a science fiction novel by Alfred Bester.  King also includes a reference to two "American heroes... President Lincoln and President Hart," presumably meaning Abraham Lincoln and Gary Hart.  King supported Hart's 1984 and 1988 campaigns for President of the United States.

Of Mice and Men is a 1992 film based on John Steinbeck's novella of the same name. Directed and produced by Gary Sinise, the film features Sinise as George Milton alongside John Malkovich as Lennie Small, Casey Siemaszko as Curley, John Terry as Slim, Ray Walston as Candy, Joe Morton as Crooks, and Sherilyn Fenn as Curley's wife. Horton Foote adapted the story for film.

With their work passes, the two end up on Tyler Ranch. Milton finds a property for sale, and calculates that they can buy the land at the end of the month with Candy's help. The film explores themes of discrimination, loneliness, and the American Dream.
Of Mice and Men took part in the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, where Sinise was nominated for the Palme d'Or award, given to the director of the best featured film. After the film debuted in the United States on October 2, 1992, it received positive acclaim from critics.

Its ice creams are made from milk, sugar, cream and eggs and flavoring, which derives from natural sources like cocoa, vanilla bean, fruit, etc. Up to fifteen flavors may be produced every day by the chefs depending on the season, market availability and demand. In total, about sixty different flavors are produced by the Maison Berthillon throughout the year.
Many consider Berthillon to be the best ice cream in Paris. In 1954 the owners decided to stop the restaurant and concentrate only on ice creams and a café.
Competitors to Berthillon include Raimo, Amorino, Ben & Jerry's and Häagen-Dazs.

Thomas "Tom" or "Tommy" Simpson (30 November 1937 – 13 July 1967) was one of Britain's most successful professional cyclists. He was born in Haswell, County Durham and later moved to Harworth, Nottinghamshire. Simpson began road cycling as a teenager before taking up track cycling, specialising in pursuit races. He won a bronze medal for track cycling at the 1956 Summer Olympics and a silver at the 1958 Commonwealth Games.
In 1959 at age 21, Simpson was signed by the French professional road-racing team St. Raphaël-Géminiani. He advanced to their first team (Rapha-Gitane-Dunlop) the following year, and won the 1961 Tour of Flanders. Simpson then joined Gitane-Leroux-Dunlop; in the 1962 Tour de France he became the first British rider to wear the yellow jersey, finishing sixth overall.
In 1963 Simpson moved to Peugeot-BP-Englebert, winning Bordeaux–Paris that year and Milan – San Remo in 1964. In 1965 he became Britain's first world road race champion and won the Giro di Lombardia; this made him the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, the first cyclist to win the award. Injuries hampered much of Simpson's 1966 season. He won two stages of the 1967 Vuelta a España before taking the general classification of Paris–Nice that year.
During the 13th stage of the 1967 Tour de France, Simpson collapsed and died during the ascent of Mont Ventoux. He was 29 years old. The post-mortem examination found that he had mixed amphetamines and alcohol; this diuretic combination proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and a stomach complaint. A memorial near where he died has become a place of pilgrimage for many cyclists. Simpson was known to have taken performance-enhancing drugs during his career, when no doping controls existed. Despite this, he is held in high esteem by many cyclists for his character and will to win.

José Luis Cuevas is a Mexican artist and was one of the first to challenge the then dominant Mexican muralism movement as a prominent member of the Generación de la Ruptura (Breakaway Generation).  He is a mostly self-taught artist, whose styles and influences are moored to the darker side of life, often depicting distorted figures and the debasement of humanity.  He has remained a controversial figure throughout his career, not only for his often shocking images, but also for his opposition to writers and artists who he feels participate in corruption or create only for money. In 1992, the José Luis Cuevas Museum was opened in the historic center of Mexico City holding most of his work and his personal art collection.

Borley Rectory was a Victorian mansion that gained fame as "the most haunted house in England".[tpl]sfnp|Floyd|2002|p=36[/tpl] Built in 1862 to house the rector of the parish of Borley and his family, it was badly damaged by fire in 1939 and demolished in 1944.
The large Gothic-style rectory in the village of Borley had been alleged to be haunted ever since it was built. These reports multiplied suddenly in 1929, after the Daily Mirror published an account of a visit by paranormal researcher Harry Price, who wrote two books supporting claims of paranormal activity.
The uncritical acceptance of Price's reports prompted a formal study by the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price's credibility. His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in the stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.
A short programme commissioned by the BBC about the alleged manifestations, scheduled to be broadcast in September 1956, was cancelled owing to concerns about a possible legal action by Marianne Foyster, widow of the last rector to live in the house.[tpl]r|HauntedRectory[/tpl]

Atrial flutter (AFL) is an abnormal heart rhythm that occurs in the atria of the heart.Atrial flutter at Mount Sinai Hospital  When it first occurs, it is usually associated with a fast heart rate or tachycardia (beats over 100 per minute),[tpl]DorlandsDict|three/000041158|atrial flutter[/tpl] and falls into the category of supra-ventricular tachycardias.  While this rhythm occurs most often in individuals with cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathy) and diabetes, it may occur spontaneously in people with otherwise normal hearts.  It is typically not a stable rhythm, and frequently degenerates into atrial fibrillation (AF).  However, it does rarely persist for months to years.
Atrial flutter was first identified as an independent medical condition in 1920 by the British physician Sir Thomas Lewis (1881–1945) and colleagues.[tpl]cite journal | author=Lewis T, Feil HS, Stroud WD | title=Observations upon flutter, fibrillation, II: the nature of auricular flutter | journal=Heart | year=1920 | volume=7 | pages=191[/tpl]

[[Cold turkey]]
CATEGORIES: Drug rehabilitation, Substance dependence, Slang

"Cold turkey" describes the actions of a person who abruptly gives up a habit or addiction rather than gradually easing the process through gradual reduction or by using replacement medication.
The supposed advantage is that by not actively using supplemental methods, the person avoids thinking about the habit and its temptation, and avoids further feeding the chemical addiction. The supposed disadvantages related to the abuse of drugs such as alcohol and benzodiazepines are unbearable withdrawal symptoms from the total absence, which may cause tremendous stress on the heart and blood vessels (and, in a worst case scenario, death). Heroin withdrawal shares many of these same symptoms, although deaths only occur in 'rapid-detox' treatments alongside other administered medications, such as Naltrexone or Naloxone.All About Addiction by Adi Jaffe, Ph.D. (http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-addiction/201001/alcohol-benzos-and-opiates-withdrawal-might-kill-you)
Sudden withdrawal from drugs such as alcohol, benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be extremely dangerous, leading to potentially fatal seizures. In long-term alcoholics, going cold turkey can cause life-threatening delirium tremens and thus is not an appropriate method for breaking an alcohol addiction.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=John R. |title=Alcohol withdrawal seizures |journal=Epilepsy & Behavior |volume=15 |pages=92–7 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.02.037 |pmid=19249388 |issue=2[/tpl]

The Welsh Football League (also known as the MacWhirter Welsh Football League for sponsorship reasons) is a club football league in Wales. Division One of the Welsh Football League is at Level 2 of the Welsh football league system, immediately below the national Welsh Premier League. 
The Welsh Football League's history stretches back to 1904 when the competition was first formed and Aberdare were crowned first champions of a seven-team First Division. Abergavenny were champions of Division 2 and Trelewis the winners of Division 3.
Its current title was adopted in 1912 when it changed from the Glamorgan League. Prior to that it was known as the Rhymney Valley League (1904-1909).
During the early days of the Rhymney Valley and Glamorgan League's there was also the South Wales League (1890-1911) but this competition had no connection with the origins of the Welsh Football League.
Despite its name, the Welsh Football League covers only South Wales. The Cymru Alliance and feeder leagues to the Cymru Alliance are its equivalent in north Wales and mid Wales. The Welsh Football League Division Three is above the Level 5 leagues: Carmarthenshire League, Gwent County League, Neath & District League, Pembrokeshire League, South Wales Amateur League, South Wales Senior League and the Swansea Senior League. 
It also has its own knock-out competition, the Nathaniel Car Sales Welsh Football League Cup, which was won by Goytre in 2011 when they beat Aberbargoed Buds 2-1 (aet) in the final at Bryntirion.

For each (or foreach) is a computer language idiom for traversing items in a collection. Foreach is usually used in place of a standard for statement. Unlike other for loop constructs, however, foreach loops   usually maintain no explicit counter: they essentially say "do this to everything in this set", rather than "do this x times". This avoids potential off-by-one errors and makes code simpler to read. In object-oriented languages an iterator, even if implicit, is often used as the means of traversal.

Unlike its sister group Nautiloidea, whose members have a rigid outer shell for protection, the coleoids have at most an internal bone or shell that is used for buoyancy or support (usually a cuttlebone or gladius). Some species have lost their bone altogether, while in some it has been replaced by a cartilaginous support structure.
The major dividings of Coleoidea are based upon the number of arms or tentacles and their structure. The extinct and most primitive form, the Belemnoidea, presumably had ten equally sized arms, in five pairs numbered dorsal to ventral as I, II, III, IV and V. More modern species either modified or lost a pair of arms. The superorder Decapodiformes has arm pair IV modified into long tentacles with suckers generally only on the club-shaped distal end. Superorder Octopodiformes has modifications to arm pair II; it is significantly reduced and used only as a sensory filament in the Vampyromorphida, while Octopoda species have totally lost that arm pair.

He won Pot Black in 1974 (after entering as a late replacement for Fred Davis, who withdrew because of illness), and again in 1975, but had little subsequent success. Other notable moments in Miles's career included the runner-up spot in the 1976 Masters, again losing to Reardon.
1978/9 represented something of a purple patch for Miles. At the UK Championship, Miles defeated Rex Williams 9-8 and then hammered Willie Thorne 9-1 which included what was then a championship record break of 139 in the last frame.
However, he was then dispatched 9-1 by eventual winner Doug Mountjoy.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, January 1978, pp23-27.
This form continued in January 1979, when he reached the final of the Holsten Lager International by defeating John Pulman, Dennis Taylor and Alex Higgins. He led John Spencer 7-6 in the final, having made a break of 107, but eventually lost 11-7, to take £2000 as runner up.Everton Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, February 1979, pp13-15.
Miles led defending champion Ray Reardon 3-0 and 5-3 in the first round of the 1979 World Championship, but a dose of flu overcame him and he lost 13-8.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1979, p13. Straight after this, Miles defeated Doug Mountjoy 4-3 and Perrie Mans 5-2 in the group stages of the Pontins Professional Event. Miles then beat Steve Davis 4-0 in the semi-final, but lost 8-4 in the final to Doug Mountjoy.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1979, p21.  
At the inaugural World Team Cup, Miles represented England along with John Spencer and Fred Davis, where they reached the final, only to be beaten 14-3 by Wales.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, December 1979, pp5-9. His last major title was the Tolly Cobbold Classic in 1981, when he beat Cliff Thorburn 5–1 in Ipswich. During the 1980s, he slid down the rankings and he last played at the World Championship in 1984.
Miles is left-eyed and has a large chin, so had one of the most distinctive styles in snooker to line up his left eye with the cue. The cue runs beneath his left ear, his chin hanging far over his cue; as he strikes the cue ball, the cue brushes his left cheek. He retired in 1992. After stopping playing, he ran two snooker clubs at Sandwell, West Midlands,Birmingham snooker pundit pays tribute to 'Hurricane' Higgins. - Birmingham News - News - Birmingham Mail and one at Crewe, Cheshire. However, he did play at the Seniors Pot Black competition in 1997.

[[Sifu]]
CATEGORIES: Chinese honorifics, Chinese martial arts terms, Martial arts ranking

Sifu (Cantonese Chinese) or shifu (Mandarin Chinese) is an accomplished teacher who oversees apprentices in certain traditions and philosophies.
It is written with the Chinese characters: 師傅 and 師父. The character 師 means "teacher", while the meaning of 傅 is "tutor" and the meaning of 父 is "father". Both characters are read fu with the same tones in Cantonese and Mandarin, creating some ambiguity. A similar term often used in Chinese is 老師 (Cantonese Chinese pronunciation: lou5 si1; Mandarin Chinese pronunciation: lǎoshī), meaning "teacher". 
Though pronounced identically and bearing similar meanings, the two terms are distinct and usage is different. The former term (師傅) bears only the meaning of "master", and is used to express the speaker's general respect for the addressee's skills and experience. Thus, for example, a customer may address a motor mechanic as such. The latter term (師父) bears the dual meaning of "master" and "father", and thus connotes a linearity in a teacher-student relationship. As such, when addressing a tradesperson, it would only be used to address the speaker's own teacher or master. In the preceding example, the motor mechanic's apprentice would address his or her master as such, but the customer would not. On the other hand, a religious personality, and by extension, experts of Chinese martial arts, can be addressed as "master-father" (師父) in all contexts.

Most switchblade designs incorporate a locking blade, in which the blade is locked against closure when the spring extends the blade to the fully opened position. The blade is unlocked by manually operating a mechanism that unlocks the blade and allows it to be folded and locked in the closed position.
During the 1950s, U.S. newspapers promoted the image of a young delinquent with a stiletto switchblade or flick knife with lurid stories of urban youth gang warfare, often featuring lower class youth and/or racial minorities. In 1954, Democratic Rep. James J. Delaney of New York authored the first bill submitted to the U.S. Congress banning the manufacture and sale of switchblades, beginning a wave of legal restrictions worldwide and a consequent decline in their popularity. Assisted-opening knives, where the user must apply some manual pressure to the blade to open it, generally have fewer legal restrictions - so have effectively replaced the switchblade in general use.

CATEGORIES: Robot navigation, Cartography, Indoor positioning system

Robotic mapping is a discipline related to cartography. The goal for an autonomous robot to be able to construct (or use) a map or floor plan and to localize itself in it. Robotic mapping is that branch of one, which deals with the study and application of ability to construct map or floor plan by the autonomous robot and to localize itself in it.
Evolutionarily shaped blind action may suffice to keep some animals alive. For some insects for example, the environment is not interpreted as a map, and they survive only with a triggered response. A slightly more elaborated navigation strategy dramatically enhances the capabilities of the robot. Cognitive maps enable planning capacities, and use of current perceptions, memorized events, and expected consequences.

The asteroid's name does not come directly from the character of Mr. Spock in Star Trek, but rather indirectly from the discoverer's male cat who was named after the science fiction character. Like his namesake, the feline Mr. Spock was, according to Gibson, "imperturbable, logical, intelligent, and had pointed ears". The cat had accompanied Gibson on astronomical observations carried out in the United States, Africa, and South America. The naming created an uproar, and the International Astronomical Union subsequently decided that pet animal names were to be discouraged.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/public/naming|title=Naming Astronomical Objects|publisher=International Astronomical Union|accessdate=July 1, 2013[/tpl] A number of other asteroids have since been named after Star Trek characters, as well as after musicians and other figures in pop culture.

Windage is a force created on an object by friction when there is relative movement between air and the object.
There are two causes of windage:
The term can refer to:
Aerodynamic streamlining can be used to reduce windage.
There is a hydrodynamic effect similar to windage.
In firearms parlance, windage refers to the side-to-side adjustment of a sight used to change the horizontal component of the aiming point. By contrast, the up-down adjustment for the vertical component is the elevation. It can also refer to the difference in diameter between the bore and the shot, especially in muskets and cannons.[tpl]Cite book|title=An elementary treatise on artillery and infantry|last=Kingsbury|first=Charles P.|authorlink=|last2=|first2=|editorn-last=|editorn-first=|edition=|volume=|year=1849|origyear=|page=59|pages=|publisher=GP Putnam|place=New York|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z9xVAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22cannon%22%20bronze%20iron&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q=windage&f=false|accessdate=|isbn=|oclc=761213440[/tpl]
In automotive parlance, windage refers to parasitic drag on the crankshaft caused by oil splashing out of the sump at high RPM. At 6,000 RPM, for example, the crankshaft must rotate 100 times per second. As the crankpins and counterweights rotate at such high speeds, they create a swirling cloud of air around them. Windage is considered to occur when excess oil is caught up in this turbulent air, drawing energy from the engine to spin the oil mist. Windage may also inhibit the migration of oil into the sump and back to the oil pump, creating lubrication problems. Some manufacturers and aftermarket vendors have developed special scrapers to remove excess oil from the counterweights and windage screens to create a barrier between the crankshaft and oil sump.http://www.crank-scrapers.com/What%20is%20a%20crank-scraper.htmlhttp://www.circletrack.com/techarticles/ctrp_0603_oil_pan_design_windage_tech/index.html

[[Renal function]]

CATEGORIES: Renal physiology

Renal function, in nephrology, is an indication of the state of the kidney and its role in renal physiology. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. Creatinine clearance rate (CCr or CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit time and is a useful measure for approximating the GFR. Creatinine clearance exceeds GFR due to creatinine secretion,[tpl]fact|date=February 2014[/tpl] which can be blocked by cimetidine.  In alternative fashion, overestimation by older serum creatinine methods resulted in an underestimation of creatinine clearance, which provided a less biased estimate of GFR.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stevens LA, Coresh J, Greene T, Levey AS |title=Assessing kidney function--measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=23 |pages=2473–83 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16760447 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra054415[/tpl]  Both GFR and CCr may be accurately calculated by comparative measurements of substances in the blood and urine, or estimated by formulas using just a blood test result (eGFR and eCCr). 
The results of these tests are important in assessing the excretory function of the kidneys. For example, grading of chronic renal insufficiency and dosage of drugs that are excreted primarily via urine are based on GFR (or creatinine clearance).
It is commonly believed to be the amount of liquid filtered out of the blood that gets processed by the kidneys.  In physiological terms, these quantities (volumetric blood flow and mass removal) are related only loosely.

The dihydrogen monoxide hoax involves calling water (H2O) by an unfamiliar name, "dihydrogen monoxide", followed by a listing of the real effects of this chemical, often presented as an argument that this substance should be regulated, labeled as hazardous, or banned. The hoax is intended to illustrate how the lack of scientific literacy and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears.[tpl]citation|last1=Carder|first1=L|last2=Willingham|first2=P.|last3=Bibb|first3=D.|title=Case-based, problem-based learning: Information literacy for the real world|journal=Research Strategies|volume=18|issue=3|year=2001|pages=181–190|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0734331002000873|doi=10.1016/S0734-3310(02)00087-3[/tpl].

"Dihydrogen monoxide" may sound dangerous to those with a limited knowledge of chemistry or who hold to an ideal of a "chemical-free" life (chemophobia). The only familiar common usage of the term "monoxide" is in the highly toxic gas "carbon monoxide", and the simplified term "monoxide poisoning" is commonly used to refer to poisoning by this colorless and odorless substance.[tpl]Citation |url=http://books.google.com/?id=CMA4_NHHc8wC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22monoxide+poisoning%22+-carbon |title=Lawyers Guide to Forensic Medicine |last=Knight |first=Bernard |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-85941-159-9 |pages=280[/tpl]

Most of the films were made in France and were intended to be shown in brothels. The collection also includes a pornographic animation from the United States, Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure, made by unknown artists in or around 1928 and never theatrically released before.
Themes covered include pornographic adaptations of classics such as Madame Butterfly, precursors of pornography clichés such as the encounter between the "musketeer" and the milkmaid, stock characters such as lascivious nuns and priests, and footage showing bestiality (sexual acts with animals), which according to the film-maker Michel Reilhac shows that "the modern porn industry did not invent anything – everything had already been filmed by our great-grandparents."
At the time of its release (2003) it was the first R18 film to be rated for display in cinemas in the United Kingdom for over ten years, despite its contents, partly due to its 'classic' style and age and as "historical footage".

A radial arm saw is a cutting machine consisting of a circular saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. Invented by Raymond DeWalt in 1922, the radial arm saw was the primary tool used for cutting long pieces of stock to length until the introduction of the power miter saw in the 1970s.
In addition to making length cuts, a radial arm saw may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. In addition some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence, allowing a rip cut to be performed.

The Adult Industry Medical Associates P.C. (formally Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation), also known simply as AIM or AIM Medical, was an organization that tested pornographic actors for HIV and other STDs on a scheduled basis.
Tests for the sex industry actors were done at the Foundation's offices in San Fernando Valley, Sherman Oaks and Granada Hills. Each month, about 1,200 actors were tested for HIV, with results as early as 14 days after infection. This test is effective 10 days after potential infection, and anytime thereafter (HIV-1 DNA, by PCR) as compared to the alternative HIV test (HIV ELISA) which requires a six-month waiting period to be effective. Other tests include such STDs as chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis.

The policy of Russification of Finland (1899–1905 and 1908–1917, called sortokaudet/sortovuodet (times/years of oppression) in Finnish and förtrycksperioderna in Swedish) was a governmental policy of the Russian Empire aimed at limiting the special status of the Grand Duchy of Finland and possibly the termination of its political autonomy and cultural uniqueness. It was a part of a larger policy of Russification pursued by late 19th–early 20th century Russian governments which tried to abolish cultural and administrative autonomy of non-Russian minorities within the empire. The two Russification campaigns evoked widespread Finnish resistance, starting with petitions and escalating to strikes, passive resistance (including draft resistance) and eventually active resistance.  Finnish opposition to Russification was one of the main factors that ultimately led to Finland's declaration of independence in 1917.

The Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) was the UK agency in charge of publicly funded scientific and engineering research activities, including astronomy, biotechnology and biological sciences, space research and particle physics, between 1965 and 1994. The SERC also had oversight of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, Royal Observatory Edinburgh, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the Daresbury Laboratory.
From its formation in 1965 until 1981 it was known as the Science Research Council (SRC). The SRC had been formed in 1965 as a result of the Trend Committee enquiry into the organisation of civil science in the UK. Previously the Minister for Science had been responsible for various research activities in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and more loosely with a variety of agencies concerned with the formulation of civil scientific policy. One of the main problems addressed by the enquiry was how to decide the priorities for government funding across all areas of scientific research. Previously this task had been the responsibility of the Treasury without direct scientific advice. The other Research Councils formed in 1965 were the Natural Environment Research Council, and the Social Science Research Council which joined the Medical Research Council which had existed since 1920, and the Agricultural Research Council.
In 1981, to reflect the increased emphasis on engineering research, the SRC was renamed the Science and Engineering Research Council.
In 1994, the new Director General of Research Councils was charged with reorganization of the four existing research councils, and this resulted in the SERC being split into the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). The two Observatories were moved under the aegis of PPARC, and the Laboratories initially into EPSRC and later into their own organization, the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC).
In 2007 CCLRC and PPARC were merged to form the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), with responsibility for nuclear physics being transferred from EPSRC to STFC.

Scandza was the name given to a "great island" by the Roman historian Jordanes in his work Getica, written while in Constantinople around 551 AD. This island was located in the Arctic regions of the sea that surrounded the world.[tpl]cite book |author=Jordanes| title=The origin and deeds of the Goths| url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html[/tpl] He described the area to set the stage for his treatment of the Goths' migration to Gothiscandza, the island in front of the Vistula river. Composed of information from several sources, his account contains several accurate descriptions of the mouth of the Vistula river. It is possible that Jordanes was describing Scandinavia.  Prominent Swedish archaeologist, Göran Burenhult, regards Jordanes' as a unique glimpse into the tribes of Scandinavia in the 6th century.
Jordanes was himself of Gothic descent. It is believed that Jordanes wrote Getica for the Romans to consider Goths not as barbarians who conquered them but as equals who also had a glorious ancient history, literature, philosophy and who became emperors by intermarrying the Roman royal families.

In 2003, a poll of international rugby players conducted by Rugby World magazine, Edwards was declared the greatest player of all time. In 2007, former England captain Will Carling published his list of the '50 Greatest Rugby players' in The Telegraph, and ranked Edwards the greatest player ever, stating; "He was a supreme athlete with supreme skills, the complete package. He played in the 1970s, but, if he played now, he would still be the best. He was outstanding at running, passing, kicking and reading the game. He sits astride the whole of rugby as the ultimate athlete on the pitch".
Edwards was prominent in the Welsh national team that was to the fore in European rugby in the 60s and 70s. He is one of a small group of Welsh players to have won three Grand Slams including Ryan Jones, Adam Jones, Gethin Jenkins, Gerald Davies and JPR Williams.Three Grand Slams

[[Tracy]]

CATEGORIES: English given names, Given names

Tracy ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|eɪ|s|i[/tpl]; also spelled Tracey or Traci or Trasci) is originally a British personal name, that refers to the family de Tracy or de Trasci from Tracy-Bocage in Normandy, France. There are several places called Tracy in Northern France and there are themselves a combination of the Gaulish male 's name Draccios or Latin Thracius and the well identified Celtic suffix -āko (place, property).Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France, Librairie Guénégaud 1979. p. 682.
While the name is unisex within the United Kingdom it is more generally considered to be a female name. This may, in part, be due to its association with the "Essex Girl". Particularly during the 1980s, alongside the name Sharon, it was a name considered to be archetypal of the Essex Girl. Its popularity peaked during the 1960s, when Tracey was the sixth most popular female name and the alternate spelling Tracy was the 12th most popular in 1964.http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2011/03/26/the-most-popular-baby-names-past-and-present/

[[Flying Scot (dinghy)]]

CATEGORIES: Dinghies

The Flying Scot is a day sailer dinghy used for pleasure sailing as well as racing throughout North America.  The Flying Scot was designed in 1957 by Gordon K. (Sandy) Douglass who had already designed the Thistle and Highlander dinghies.  It is manufactured by Flying Scot Inc. based in the western Maryland town of Deer Park.http://www.flyingscot.com/contact.html
The Flying  Scot is noted for ease of handling and durability, and has been a popular choice of individual owners, sailing schools, and rental operators since its introduction. A highly popular design, about 6000 Flying Scots have been built, and it has been included as a Sailing Hall of Fame Design. Based in Maryland its manufacturer is Flying Scot Inc., originally the Gordon  Douglass  Boat Company.
The hull design of the Flying Scot makes it able to plane in winds of 15 knots or more, exceeding the waterline hull speed.
Races are held throughout the year in the USA and Canada by the Flying Scot Sailing Association and its local fleets.  As a one-design, all Flying Scot boats are built to the same specifications and thus have equal chances in winning a race, no matter when the boat was built. This makes the boats especially appealing to amateur racing associations since this type of construction strives to eliminate variables other than the skill of the crew. The Flying Scot was inducted into the American Sailboat Hall of Fame in 1998.
The Flying Scot Association says, "The Scot's performance offers thrills to even the experienced sailor and provides for tight, competitive racing. There are more than 100 fleets racing Flying Scots in the USA and Canada. The Scot is normally raced with a crew of two or three, but can be single handed as well.   It can also carry as many as eight adults. The sail plan consists of main, jib and spinnaker. Simple rigging and uniform construction fosters tactical racing."

Walter Duranty (1884 – October 3, 1957) was a Liverpool-born, Anglo-American journalist who served as the Moscow Bureau Chief of The New York Times (1922–36). Duranty won a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for a series of stories on the Soviet Union. Duranty has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, most particularly the Ukraine mass starvation (1932–33). Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer; even The Times acknowledged his articles constituted "some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper."
His reporting and motivations have been hotly debated, leading to calls to revoke his Pulitzer (which was for reporting unrelated to the later famine controversy). Duranty's reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the Soviet regime, including having presented Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/national/23PAPE.html

He is the second senior most leader of the Nepali Congress. He has twice been elected as the leader of parliamentary party of the Nepali Congress, thus enabling him to be elected twice as the Prime Minister of Nepal.
He was elected as Prime Minister for the second time when he succeeded Girija Prasad Koirala, who resigned in July 2001. A coup d'etat by King Gyanendra removed Deuba in October 2002.
After two other governments, much political protest for his restoration especially in capital Kathmandu, Gyanendra restored Deuba to the position of Prime Minister in 2004.
He was removed on February 1, 2005 by King Gyanendra, who dissolved the government for three years and seized direct power.
He was sentenced to two years in prison in July 2005 under corruption charges, but was subsequently released on February 13, 2006, after the anti-corruption body that sentenced him was outlawed. An official from Deuba's Nepali Congress Democratic Party, Dip Kumar Upadhaya, told the Associated Press that the former premier's release was "a victory for democracy and a humiliating defeat for the royal regime". http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4711120.stm

[[Desh, Maharashtra]]
CATEGORIES: Regions of Maharashtra

Desh ([tpl]lang-mr|देश[/tpl], derived from the Sanskrit word deśa (देशः) meaning "country"), is a region of Maharashtra state in central India.
Desh is bounded on the west by the Western Ghats or Sahyadri range, on the north by the Kandesh and on the east by the Marathwada regions of Maharashtra, and on the south by the state of Karnataka. The region is hilly and slopes towards the east, and is drained by the upper reaches of the Godavari and Krishna rivers and their tributaries.[tpl]cite book|pages=52–54|title=Religions and communities of India|first=Pran Nath|last=Chopra|publisher=Vision Books|year=1982|isbn=978-0-85692-081-3[/tpl]
In the context of the history of Maharashtra, "Desh" is an abbreviation for "Maharashtra-desh", that historical region of the west-central Deccan Plateau that is called the Divisions of Pune and Marathwada or Aurangabad. Marathwada came to be called separately because it had been conquered by the Nizam of Hyderabad as part of the former Princely state of Hyderabad.
The Desh region was the birthplace and core of the Maratha Empire, founded by Shivaji in the 17th century, and is home to a number of cities, like Satara and Pune, associated with Maratha history. The region came under British rule in 1818, at the conclusion of the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Most of the region was ruled directly by the British as part of the Bombay Presidency, but several princely states, including Satara, Sangli, and Kolhapur, remained under Maratha rulers in subsidiary alliance with the British. Satara was annexed by the British in 1848. After Indian Independence in 1947, Bombay Presidency became the Indian state of Bombay. Bombay state was divided into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat in 1960.

The fish lives natively in calm tropical waters in the lowlands in water with a 5–6 pH, a water hardness of 5–12.0 dGH, and a temperature range of 74–84 °F (23–29 °C).
The fish has commercial importance in the aquarium hobby and is frequently inaccurately referrered to as a tiger barb.
Pentazona barbs are egg-scatterers that spawn among a course gravel bed in open water. Once spawning is finished, they will usually eat any of the approximately 200 eggs that they find. It is usually necessary to separate the fish from the eggs after spawning in order to prevent the eggs from being eaten. The eggs will hatch in approximately 1 day.

[[Tent of Miracles (novel)]]
CATEGORIES: Modernist novels, 1969 novels, Novels by Jorge Amado, Brazilian novels, Portuguese-language novels, Novels set in Salvador, Bahia

Tent of Miracles ([tpl]lang-pt|Tenda dos Milagres[/tpl]) is a Brazilian Modernist novel. It was written by Jorge Amado in 1967 and published the following year. It was later adapted to a 1977 Cinema Novo (Nouvelle Vague) film by director/screenplay writer Nelson Pereira dos Santos.
Tent of Miracles was written three years after the military overthrew Brazilian democracy, and it is part of a series Amado called "The Bahia Novels", works exploring the region's past.  The novel chronicles the chaos that results when a prominent Columbia University professor arrives in Brazil, with nothing but praise on his lips for a long-forgotten local Bahian writer and self-taught social scientist named Pedro Archanjo.  The year is 1968, which Levinson announces is the centennial of Archanjo's birth, setting off a media stampede to figure out who Archanjo was so that they can profit from a celebration of his life.  When a few people finally uncover who Arcanjo was and what he espoused, media barons and advertisers are horrified to discover that he was an Afro-Brazilian social critic, womanizer and heavy drinker who died penniless in the gutter.  So, they invent their own Pedro Archanjo, which they hype in various advertising-driven events, enlisting some Brazilian academics who are as superficial and self-promoting as Levinson.
The novel moves back and forth between events in the life of the historical hero, Pedro Archanjo, and the present.  Most of the characters are types that lend themselves to the author's relentless satire.  The historical setting is the colorful old Pelourinho neighborhood of Salvador, Bahia, that flows down the hill from the main plaza, where Archanjo works as a lowly runner at the School of Medicine adjacent to the cathedral.  The place of the title is the home of the hero and his best friend, Lidio Corro, which also serves as barber shop, cultural center, print shop and artist's studio.  The historical sections explore Afro-Brazilian culture and racial discrimination.  Author Jorge Amado once declared that "Brazil is a racial democracy", and the novel is consistent with that belief, because he situates all racism in the past. 
The hero's male children are all over the city, but he is father to none.  They call him "godfather," and he takes one of his "godchildren," Tadeu, under his wing to help him pursue an engineering degree.  The womanizing of the hero serves to highlight the belief of both Pedro Archanjo and the novel's author that uninhibited sexual passion between people of different races and colors (and the resulting mixed children) is Brazil's unique solution to racism.  The theory behind this view was disseminated by Brazilian sociologist and historian Gilberto Freyre in his treatise Casa-Grande & Senzala (1933), translated into English as The Masters and the Slaves. A number of the female characters in the novel are highly sexualized in ways that, according to critics, represent racial stereotypes.  Freyre's theory is now discredited among most Brazilian and foreign scholars of race relations, but the belief still is used by some Brazilians (mostly white men)[tpl]Who|date=February 2012[/tpl] in their denial of their country's racism. 
In the face of criticism of his portrayals of women and Afro-Brazilian culture, Jorge Amado declared: "It is not a question of literary pride.  It is only the certainty that no one until today had dared to look face-to-face with so much love at Bahian humanity and its problems.  No one knows better than I, who wrote them, what the weaknesses and defects of my novels are.  But, by the same token, no one can measure the sacrifice they cost me, the honesty that went into their making, the disinterest and pure love that made the novelist return to his people."[tpl]Attribution needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
Beyond Amado's treatment of women and Afro-Brazilian culture, Tent of Miracles is a powerful[tpl]says who|date=February 2012[/tpl] satire of modern Brazilian institutions, especially the mass media and parts of academia.  Notably spared from the author's knife is the Brazilian military, which in 1967 was detaining, torturing and exiling some of Amado's political friends.  A few scholars have suggested that the novel hides in its story a parable critical of the military dictatorship, particularly through the portrayal of a repressive but ineffectual assistant police commissioner, Pedrito Gordo.  If so, the ridicule was mild, perhaps urging Brazilians to not be afraid of the regime, and so well disguised that the novel was not censored.

The R.E. Olds Transportation Museum is named for Ransom E. Olds, founder of Oldsmobile, and is located in Lansing, Michigan. It is one of the top-rated automotive museums in the United States.
The final Oldsmobile, a dark cherry metallic "Final 500 Collector's Edition" (#500 of 500) Alero sedan, was donated to the museum on April 29, 2004, but the museum later had to sell the car because General Motors did not donate funds.
It houses a diverse collection of Oldsmobiles dating from 1897 to 2004. The 1897 Olds, one of four built that year, is on loan from the Smithsonian Institution. There is also an 1893 steam carriage built by Ransom E. Olds on display, prior to the founding of the Olds Motor Works, which was the official name of Oldsmobile until the 1940s.
This museum also houses automobilia covering nearly a century, including a nearly complete collection of Michigan license plates, early traffic signs and a working 1950s-era traffic signal. A bicycle collection shows the connection between early automakers and cycle makers who had the tools, know-how and creativity to successfully produce an automobile.
It also houses a collection of REO vehicles from the company that Ransom E. Olds created after he was forced from Oldsmobile by that company's management. A well-known vehicle from that company is the REO Speed Wagon, from which a major musical band got its name. Another well-known truck that was made by a successor of that company is the Diamond REO.
Another significant part of this museum's collection are items from the Ransom E. Olds household.

His singing career with Sonora Matancera puts him at the peaks and among the top singers of Cuba of all times. He has made a valuable contribution, along with Arturo Sandoval, Rosendo Rosell, Celia Cruz, and musicologist Eloy Crespo to the documentary Son, la antesala de la salsa. He is considered one of Cuba's highest assets in music.
Cuban-born singer, bandleader, percussionist, composer, producer and label boss Roberto Torres started singing in his mid-teens. He worked in Havana with Conjunto Universal and Orquesta Swing Casino before leaving Cuba in June 1959 for New York City. There he organised the cooperative charanga Orquesta Broadway in 1962 with Cuban flautist Eddy Zervigón, making a string of popular LPs with them on the Gema, Musicor and Tico labels between 1964 and 1968. After leaving Broadway he worked with José Fajardo and Sonora Matancera. In 1972 he sang lead vocals with Mike Martínez's Latin Dimensions on their eponymous LP on Mericana. Torres made his solo debut on same label with El Castigador (1973), including the hit "El Caminante" ("The Stroller", which became his nickname), followed by Roberto Torres y Chocolate Juntos '74 on Mericana (a collaboration with Cuban trumpeter Alfredo "Chocolate" Armenteros), De Nuevo, Roberto Torres y sus Caminantes and El Duro del Guaguancó '76-8 on the Mericana subsidiary Salsoul.
In 1979 he launched the New York-based SAR label (co-founded by Sergio Bofill, boss of premier 10th Avenue Latin record distributor GB Records, Adriano García and Roberto) with his own El Rey del Montuno. Over the next three years he produced over 50 LPs on SAR and allied Guajiro, Toboga and Neon labels for Papaíto, Monguito "El Unico", Linda Leida, Chocolate, Henry Fiol, La India de Oriente, Charanga De La 4, Alfredo Valdés Jr and his father, Alfredo Valdés, Fernando Lavoy and many others. Torres and SAR headed an early '80s revival of típico (typical, traditional) Cuban music which was not simply imitation of the orthodox; with African and French Caribbean market in mind he went for a "rootsy" sound, extended tracks: millions of albums were sold. Using many of the same New York-based musicians on various sessions, he formed the SAR All Stars, including Chocolate, Leopoldo Pineda on trombone, the Zervigón brothers from Orquesta Broadway, Valdés Jr. and many others.
Torres' SAR albums included Recuerda A Portabales (songs associated with Cuban singer / composer Guillermo Portabales), Presenta: Ritmo de Estrellas (an all-star charanga), Recuerda Al Trio Matamoros (songs from repertoire of the Cuban trio), Charanga Colonial (another all-star lineup), all '79-81; also three LPs by his Charanga Vallenata '80-2, fusing Cuban charanga and conjunto elements with Colombian vallenata accordion played by Jesús Hernández, vol. 2 yielded the massive hit "Caballo Viejo"; Corazón De Pueblo '84; Elegantemente Criollo '86, made in Miami (where he had relocated, taking SAR with him) with Israel "Cachao" López. The SAR group's output fell off after '82; many stars switched to Caimán Records, formed in 1983 by Bofill and Humberto Corredor; others moved to Laslos Records, formed in 1984; Monguito "El Unico", Valdés Jr. and others also recorded for the Ivory Coast's Sacodis label from 1980 to the mid-'80s, which mirrored the SAR sound. Torres continued to issue solo albums on SAR out of Miami up to 2000 and produce other projects for the label. In the Noughties he recorded with the Tropicana All Stars on Recaredo Gutiérrez's Regu Records and issued Con Mucho Swing - Roberto Torres & Cha Cha Cha All Stars Orchestra on the same imprint in 2004
After Cuba fell under communist dictatorship following the revolution, he moved to New York, New York and then to Miami, Florida where he blended his own Cuban roots with a hot rhythm style from Colombia, vallenato. Information provided by Alain Gomez.
On 2 June 2011, the heavily Cuban-American community of Union City, New Jersey honored Torres with a star on the Walk of Fame at Celia Cruz Plaza.Sanabria, Santo. "Latinos honored in Union City", The Union City Reporter, 12 June 2011, pages 1 and 12

Sheikh Hasina acted as the leader of the opposition in the parliament for almost 12 years. She has led the Bangladesh Awami League since 1981. She is the eldest of five children of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father and first President of Bangladesh, and widow of the nuclear scientist M. A. Wazed Miah. Hasina's party defeated the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led Four-Party Alliance in the 2008 parliamentary election, assuring her of the post of prime minister for the second time. She secured this post for the third time in the 2014 parliamentary election.
Hasina's political career has spanned more than four decades during which she has been both Prime Minister and opposition leader. As opposition leader, she was the target of an assassination attempt in 2004. In 2007, she was arrested for corruption and charged with murder by the military-backed Caretaker Government during the 2006–2008 Bangladeshi political crisis, when the generals imposed a state of emergency. She returned as Prime Minister after a landslide victory for the Awami League-led Grand Alliance in 2008, when they took two-thirds of the seats in parliament. In January 2014 she became the prime minister for the third time after winning the general  election which was boycotted by the main opposition BNP led alliance.  
For the better part of the last two decades, Hasina's chief rival has been BNP leader Khaleda Zia.  The two women have alternated as non-interim Prime Ministers since 1991.

It has also been introduced to waters in Colombia.  It natively inhabits rivers, and standing water with a silty bottom.  They live in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 6.5 pH, a water hardness of 8 - 15 dGH, and a temperature range of 68 - 77 °F (20 - 25 °C).  It feeds on benthic and planktonic crustaceans, and insects. This species can grow in length up to [tpl]convert|5.1|cm|in[/tpl] TL.  It is sometimes known as "Glass Barb" but that is properly Puntius guganio.  It can also be found in the aquarium trade.[tpl]FishBase species |genus= Pethia|species= gelius| month = April | year = 2013[/tpl]

Julianne Moore co-stars, taking over for Jodie Foster in the role of U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent Clarice Starling.

Toshimaru Nakamura is a Japanese musician, active in free improvisation and Japanese onkyo.
He began his career playing rock and roll guitar, but gradually explored other types of music, even abandoning guitar and started working on circuit bending. He uses a mixing console as a live, interactive musical instrument: "Nakamura plays the 'no-input mixing board', connecting the input of the board to the output, then manipulating the resultant audio feedback."http://www.shef.ac.uk/~ps/efi/labels/erstwhil/erst013.htmlTodd S. Jenkins (2004). Free jazz and free improvisation, p.250. ISBN 0-313-29881-5. "His principal tool is his 'no-input' mixing board used to create feedback and tiny electronic sounds that are amplified tremendously."
Nakamura's music has been described as "sounds ranging from piercing high tones and shimmering whistles to galumphing, crackle-spattered bass patterns."http://www.furious.com/perfect/toshimarunakamura.html
He founded an ensemble A Paragon of Beauty in 1992.
Nakamura has recorded solo albums and has worked as a session musician, collaboration with Otomo Yoshihide, Keith Rowe, John Butcher, and Nicholas Bussmann among others. He has also collaborated with Taku Sugimoto, Tetuzi Akiyama, dancer Kim Ito, drummer Jason Kahn, and Sachiko M, "a kindred spirit".

[[Metallate]]

CATEGORIES: Anions

Metallate is the name given to any complex anion containing a metal ligated to several atoms or small groups. The spelling metalate is almost as common.
Typically, the metal will be one of the transition elements and the ligand will be oxygen or another chalcogenide or a cyanide group (though others are known). The chalcogenide metallates are known as oxometallates, thiometallates, selenometallates and tellurometallates; the cyanide metallates are known as cyanometallates.
Oxometallates include permanganate, chromate and vanadate.
Thiometallates include tetrathiomolybdate and similar ions.
Cyanometallates include ferricyanide and ferrocyanide.
Metallate is also used as a verb by bioinorganic chemistry to describe the act of adding metal atoms or ions to a site (synthetic ligand or protein.)

The British Psychological Society (BPS) is a representative body for psychologists and psychology in the United Kingdom. The BPS is also a Registered Charity and, along with advantages, this also imposes certain constraints on what the Society can and cannot do. For example, it cannot campaign on issues which are seen as party political.
Founded on 24 October 1901 at University College, London (UCL) as The Psychological Society, the organisation initially admitted only recognised teachers in the field of psychology.  Its current name of The British Psychological Society  was taken in 1906 to avoid confusion with another group named The Psychological Society. Under the guidance of Charles Myers, membership was opened up to members of the medical profession in 1919. In 1941 the society was incorporated,
In 2012 the BPS had 49,678 members and subscribers, in all fields of psychology, 18,342 of whom were Chartered Members. Its current President, for 2013-14, is Dr Richard Mallows, formerly Head of the Psychology Department at York St John University. Every year, usually in June, the Society holds its Annual Conference, in a different town or city each year. In recent years it has been held in Dublin (2008), Brighton (2009), Stratford-upon-Avon (2010), Glasgow (2011), London (2012) and Harrogate (2013). In 2014 the conference will be in Birmingham.

[[Polyoxometalate]]

CATEGORIES: Oxoanions, Cluster chemistry, Catalysts

In chemistry, a polyoxometalate (abbreviated POM) is a polyatomic ion, usually an anion, that consists of three or more transition metal oxyanions linked together by shared oxygen atoms to form a large, closed 3-dimensional framework.
The metal atoms are usually group 5 or group 6 transition metals in their high oxidation states. In this state, their electron configuration is d0 or d1. Examples include vanadium(V), niobium(V), tantalum(V), molybdenum(VI), and tungsten(VI).
The framework of transition metal oxyanions may enclose one or more hetero atoms such as phosphorus or silicon, themselves sharing neighbouring oxygen atoms with the framework. For example, the phosphotungstate anion PW12O403− consists of a framework of twelve octahedral tungsten oxyanions surrounding a central phosphate group.

[[Germanía]]

CATEGORIES: Cant languages, Spanish language

Germanía is the Spanish term for the argot used by criminals or in jails in Spain during 15th and 16th centuries. Its purpose is to keep outsiders out of the conversation. The ultimate origin of the word is the Latin word germanus, through Catalan germà (brother).
Some documentation for it occurs in picaresque works as early as the Spanish Golden Century, such as in Quevedo's El Buscón.Christopher J. Pountain, A History of the Spanish Language Through Texts (Routledge, 2000), 159.  Some writers used it in poetry for comical effect.
After the arrival of the Romani people and their frequent imprisonment, germanía incorporated much vocabulary from Romany and its descendant, the caló jargon. As time passed, several words entered popular use and even standard Spanish, losing their value for secrecy. Germanía  survives today in the cheli jargon.

CATEGORIES: Pornographic films by genre, Sex scandals, Celebrity

A celebrity sex tape is typically an amateur pornographic video recording involving one or more celebrity famous person(s) which has, intentionally or unintentionally, been made available publicly. Such video tapes are often released without the consent of their subjects, and could potentially damage celebrities' careers. In 1988, a sex tape caused significant damage to Rob Lowe's career.[tpl]cite news|last=Ogunnaike|first=Lola|title=Sex, Lawsuits and Celebrities Caught on Tape|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/fashion/sundaystyles/19tapes.html?_r=0&pagewanted=all|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2006[/tpl] In recent years, however, many celebrities have benefited from the publicity resulting from the release of a sex tape. The release of Paris Hilton's sex tape in 2003 as well as Kim Kardashian's in 2007 brought them to a new level of fame, leading to magazine covers, book deals and reality TV series.[tpl]Dubious|date=December 2012|reason=Hilton and Kardashian were already notable and Hilton was already producing a realty series at the time her tape was released. Source?[/tpl]
The surfacing of sex tapes has become so common that some are "leaked" as a marketing tool to advance or establish a media career. A celebrity can fight the release in court to maintain deniability while still enjoying the career benefits. In contrast, a celebrity may take the route of openly releasing the tape and benefit directly from royalties as well as indirectly from the publicity. The current public acceptance of celebrities with sex tapes is speculated by Joe Levy, executive editor of Rolling Stone, to be due to the easy availability of pornography, as well as couples more commonly making their own tapes due to the prevalence of video cameras.

[[Boardwalk Bowl]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct college football bowls, Indoor American football competitions, Sports in Atlantic City, New Jersey

The Boardwalk Bowl is a post-season college football game held at the former Atlantic City Convention Center (now Boardwalk Hall) in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The game featured an annual matchup between Pennsylvania Military College (now Widener University) and the United States Merchant Marine Academy, known as the "Little Army–Navy Game" until 1967.  The playing surface in the earlier years consisted of natural grass sod that was grown outside and then moved indoors for the game. This game was first held in 1961 and continued annually through 1973. From 1968 through 1972, it was the NCAA College Division East championship game. In 1973, under a new playoff system, it became the Division II national semifinal. It was discontinued after the 1973 game. The Boardwalk Bowl, along with the Liberty Bowl (played in the Convention Center in 1964), showed the feasibility of playing football indoors and led the promoters of football games to look seriously at developing indoor facilities primarily for this purpose. Since 1981, the NCAA Division I FCS Playoff East Regional Championship (National Quarterfinal) is commonly referred to as the Boardwalk Bowl in honor of its College Division heritage. The game is played at the highest remaining seed in the East Region with the winner advancing to the NCAA Division I FCS Playoff Final Four (National Semifinal).

Ramon Pichot Gironès ([tpl]IPA-ca|rəˈmom piˈtʃɔt[/tpl]) (1872 - 1 March 1925) was a Catalan and Spanish artist. He painted in an impressionist style.
He was a good friend of Pablo Picasso and an early mentor to young Salvador Dalí. Salvador Dalí met Ramon Pichot Gironès in Cadaqués, Spain when Salvador was only 10 years old. Ramon also made many trips to France. Once in a while, Salvador Dalí and his family would go on a trip with Ramon Pichot and his family.
He married Germaine Pichot, a well-known artist's model, in 1906. Together, they had a restaurant near the Bateau Lavoir, called La maison rose. Pichot left Paris after World War I but returned often to buy books, as he had turned into a bibliophile. On such a trip, he suddenly died on May 1, 1925. Picasso was so shaken by this that he included Ramon's figure in the painting Three Dancers on which he was working at the time.John Richardson A Life of Picasso I: 139

[[Townshend Acts]]
CATEGORIES: 1767 in the Thirteen Colonies, Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, Great Britain Acts of Parliament 1767, Laws leading to the American Revolution

The Townshend Acts were a series of acts passed, beginning in 1767, by the Parliament of Great Britain relating to the British colonies in North America. The acts are named after Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who proposed the program. Historians vary slightly in which acts they include under the heading "Townshend Acts", but five laws are often mentioned: the Revenue Act of 1767, the Indemnity Act, the Commissioners of Customs Act, the Vice Admiralty Court Act, and the New York Restraining Act.Dickerson (Navigation Acts, 195–95) for example, writes that there were four Townshend Acts, and does not mention the New York Restraining Act, which Chaffin says was "officially a part of the Townshend Acts" ("Townshend Acts", 128). 
The purpose of the Townshend Acts was to raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain, to create a more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations, to punish the province of New York for failing to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act, and to establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies.Chaffin, "Townshend Acts", 126. The Townshend Acts were met with resistance in the colonies, prompting the occupation of Boston by British troops in 1768, which eventually resulted in the Boston Massacre of 1770.
As a result of widespread protest in the American colonies, Parliament began to consider a motion to partially repeal the Townshend duties.Chaffin, "Townshend Acts", 143. Most of the new taxes were repealed, but the tax on tea was retained. The British government continued in its attempt to tax the colonists without their consent and the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution followed.

Computer-mediated reality refers to the ability to add to, subtract information from, or otherwise manipulate one's perception of reality through the use of a wearable computer or hand-held device"Wearable,Tetherless, Computer-Mediated Reality", Technical Report #260, M.I.T. Medial Lab Perceptual Computing Section, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1994 such as a smart phone.
Typically, it is the user's visual perception of the environment that is mediated.  This is done through the use of some kind of electronic device, such as an EyeTap device or smart phone, which can act as a visual filter between the real world and what the user perceives.
Computer-mediated reality has been used to enhance visual perception as an aid to the visually impaired.  This example achieves a mediated reality by altering a video input stream light that would have normally reached the user's eyes, and computationally altering it to filter it into a more useful form.
It has also been used for interactive computer interfaces.Interactive Mediated Reality, Raphael Grasset, Jean-Dominique Gascuel, and Dieter Schmalstieg, Proc. ISMAR 2003, IEEE
The use of computer-mediated reality to diminish perception, by the removal or masking of visual data, has been used for architectural applications, and is an area of ongoing research (see for instance, here and here)

[[Shamash-shum-ukin]]
CATEGORIES: 648 BC deaths, Babylonian kings, Year of birth unknown

Shamash-shum-ukin was the Assyrian king of Babylon from 668-648 BC.
He was the second son of the Assyrian King Esarhaddon. His elder brother, crown prince Sin-iddina-apla had died in 672, and in his stead the third son Ashurbanipal was invested as crown prince and later king of Assyria, while Shamash-shum-ukin remained crown prince of Babylonia. Provincial governors and vassals had to take an oath to accept this and to help the brothers gain their respective thrones in the event of Esarhaddon's death.
When Esarhaddon unexpectedly died on a campaign against rebellious Egypt in 669, it was only the decisive action of his grandmother Naqi'a-Zakutu, widow of his grandfather Sennacherib and mother of his late father, that got Ashurbanipal on the throne, in the face of opposition by court officials and parts of the priesthood.  Shamash-shum-ukin, the older brother, became viceroy of Babylonia. The arrangement was evidently intended to flatter the Babylonians by giving them once more the semblance of independence. For some time this worked well, however Shamash-shum-ukin became infused with Babylonian nationalism, and claimed that it was he rather than his younger brother that was the successor of the Mesopotamian monarchs whose empire stretched from Iran to the Mediterranean and from the Caucasus to Arabia and north Africa.
The Babylonian territory consisted of Babylon, Borsippa, Kutha and Sippar. While Shamash-shum-ukin was the sovereign ruler of the south in theory, Assyria maintained a garrison in Nippur, and some of the provincial governors tried to get into Assyrian favour. Letters by Sin-balassu-iqbi, governor of Ur show how he tried to ingratiate himself with Ashurbanipal.
Ashurbanipal took an active part in the restoration of sanctuaries in the south. A stela now in London commemorates his help in restoring the temple Esagila; another tells of how he restored the Nabu-temple in Borsippa. Even the Sumerian language was revived as the official tongue.
In May 652, Shamash-shum-ukin rose in rebellion. The reasons for this are completely unknown, as no Babylonian sources have been preserved. He formed a powerful coalition including Nabu-bel-shumate, king of the Mesopotamian Sealands, the Elamites, the Chaldean tribes of the South, the kings of Guti, Amurru and Meluhha and the Arabs from Arabia.
After two years Babylon and Borsippa were besieged, and Elam was defeated and destroyed.
Babylon yielded in June 648 after a siege. The sources describe cases of cannibalism. Shamash-shum-ukin threw himself into his burning palace as Babylon fell to Assyrian troops, to be remembered by the Greeks in the story of Sardanapalus(or Sardanapalos, his Greek name) (Ashurbanipal).
His successor on the throne of Babylon was Kandalanu (647-627). Kandalanu, however, may have been either a throne name taken by Ashurbanipal himself or an Assyrian puppet ruler.

[[Masayuki Uemura]]
CATEGORIES: Nintendo people, Living people, 1943 births

[tpl]Nihongo|Masayuki Uemura|上村 雅之|Uemura Masayuki|extra=born June 20, 1943[/tpl] is a Japanese game hardware designer. Due to the bombing of Japan during World War II, his family was forced to move to Kyoto. Having little money, he was forced to make his own toys. His toys became more and more complex and he wanted to learn more, so he went to industrial college. Once he graduated, Sharp Corporation hired him immediately.
One day, Sharp sent him on a sales call to Nintendo to see if they wanted solar cells,http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0408/interv/index.html which caught the eyes of Gunpei Yokoi because these cells can be used in their entertainment products. Yokoi kept in touch with Uemura, and eventually hired him away from Sharp.
These solar cells were used in the Nintendo beam gun games. They put these games on the market to the consumer, which turned out to be a success for Nintendo.
When Hiroshi Yamauchi split Nintendo's Research and Development into three groups (which later became four), Uemura became the head of Nintendo's Research and Development 2 team.http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/gr/gsce/s/um01/index.htm This team focused exclusively on hardware. It is better known for designing the NES and SNES consoles, but it also was responsible for a varierty of peripheralshttp://japan.cnet.com/news/tech/story/0,2000056025,20357581,00.htm such as the NES Zapper, the Famicom Disk System, and the Satellaview (for which Uemura served as the division chief). The R&D2 also made a few games, but were not as prominent as the other development teams. Uemura retired from Nintendo in 2004.

CATEGORIES: 1842 novels, Novels by Nikolai Gogol, Picaresque novels, Novels set in the Russian Empire

Dead Souls ([tpl]lang-ru|Мёртвыe души, Myortvyjye dushi[/tpl]) is a novel by Nikolai Gogol, first published in 1842, and widely regarded as an exemplar of 19th-century Russian literature. The purpose of the novel was to demonstrate the flaws and faults of the Russian mentality and character. Gogol masterfully portrayed those defects through Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov (the main character) and the people whom he encounters in his endeavours. These people are typical of the Russian middle-class of the time. Gogol himself saw it as an "epic poem in prose", and within the book as a "novel in verse". Despite supposedly completing the trilogy's second part, Gogol destroyed it shortly before his death. Although the novel ends in mid-sentence (like Sterne's Sentimental Journey), it is usually regarded as complete in the extant form.Christopher English writes that "Susanne Fusso compellingly argues in her book Designing Dead Souls that Dead Souls is complete in Part One, that there was never meant to be a Part Two or Part Three, and that it is entirely consistent with Gogol's method to create the expectation of sequels, and even to break off his narrative in mid-story, or mid-sentence, and that he was only persuaded to embark on composition of the second part by the expectation of the Russian reading public" (1998, 435).

A brain–computer interface (BCI), often called a mind-machine interface (MMI), or sometimes called a direct neural interface (DNI), synthetic telepathy interface (STI) or a brain–machine interface (BMI), is a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. BCIs are often directed at assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions.
Research on BCIs began in the 1970s at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) under a grant from the National Science Foundation, followed by a contract from DARPA.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=4583653|doi=10.1146/annurev.bb.02.060173.001105|year=1973|last1=Vidal|first1=JJ|title=Toward direct brain-computer communication|volume=2|pages=157–80|journal=Annual review of biophysics and bioengineering[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=J.

The field of BCI research and development has since focused primarily on neuroprosthetics applications that aim at restoring damaged hearing, sight and movement. Thanks to the remarkable cortical plasticity of the brain, signals from implanted prostheses can, after adaptation, be handled by the brain like natural sensor or effector channels.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=10896180|year=2000|last1=Levine|first1=SP|last2=Huggins|first2=JE|last3=Bement|first3=SL|last4=Kushwaha|first4=RK|last5=Schuh|first5=LA|last6=Rohde|first6=MM|last7=Passaro|first7=EA|last8=Ross|first8=DA|last9=Elisevich|first9=KV|title=A direct brain interface based on event-related potentials|volume=8|issue=2|pages=180–5|journal=IEEE transactions on rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society|doi=10.1109/86.847809|display-authors=9[/tpl]

Dytiscus species are large water beetles with a robust, rounded shape and are usually around two inches long. The tarsi of the males are modified into suckers which are used to grip the female in mating. Females are usually larger than the males and come in two forms, with grooved (sulcate) or smooth elytra.  Males only ever have smooth elytra. The adults of most species can fly.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) is the only major daily newspaper in the metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It is the flagship publication of Cox Enterprises. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is the result of the merger between The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. The staff was combined in 1982.  Separate publication of the morning Constitution and afternoon Journal ended in 2001.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.writenews.com/2001/101701_atlanta_journal_constitution.html |date=October 17, 2001 |title=Atlanta Journal, Atlanta Constitution to Combine |deadurl=no |accessdate=January 26, 2014[/tpl] The AJC has its headquarters in the Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody, Georgia.  It is also co-owned with television flagship WSB-TV and six radio stations, which are located separately in midtown Atlanta.
Subsequent to the staff consolidation of 1982, the afternoon Journal maintained a center-right editorial stance, while the editorials and op-eds in the morning Constitution were liberal. When the editions combined in 2001, the editorial page staffs also merged.  The editorials and op-eds have attempted to strike a more "balanced" tone. Most of the paper's editorial stances have been closer to those of the old Constitution liberal viewpoint.

[[Day sailer]]

CATEGORIES: Sailboat types

A daysailer, day sailer,  or dayboat is a small sailboat with or without sleeping accommodations but which is larger than a dinghy. Dayboats can be monohull or multihull, and are typically trailer-able.  Many dayboats have a small cabin or "cuddy" for storage and to provide shelter, or for sleeping in, but which is not always large enough to stand erect in. Dayboats' greater stability also distinguishes them from dinghies, and are generally sailed more like a small yacht than a dinghy. For example, although crew weight may well be shifted to increase performance, this is not crucial to stability, as it is in a dinghy. The distinction between keelboats and day sailers is not always clear; generally the former term indicates a large boat (over 27 feet (8.2m) and usually, though not always, not trailer-able) used for longer trips, whereas daysailers, as the name implies, are used for trips less than 48 hours, and often only a single day.

Ronaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha, where he played for two years, before moving to C.D. Nacional. In 1997, he made a move to Portuguese giants Sporting Clube de Portugal.

[[Ramathaim-Zophim]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible places

Ramathaim-Zophim ([tpl]lang-he|רמתיים־צופים[/tpl]), also called Ramah ([tpl]lang-he|רָמָה[/tpl]) and Ramatha in the Douay-Rheims, is a town that has been identified with the modern Neby Samwil ("the prophet Samuel"), about 4 or 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem. But there is no certainty as to its precise locality. 
The home of Elkanah, Samuel’s father (1 Samuel 1:19 ; 2:11 ), the birthplace of Samuel and the seat of his authority (1 Sam. 2:11; 7:17), the town is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet and of David (15:34; 16:13; 19:18-23). Here Samuel died and was buried (25:1).
Benjamin of Tudela visited the site when he traveled the land in 1173, noting that the Crusaders had found the bones of Samuel in a Jewish cemetery in Ramla on the coastal plain and reburied here, overlooking the Holy City.  
The traditional tomb site, which became known as Neby Samwil (“the prophet Samuel”), may have been Mizpah in Benjamin, where Samuel was appointed leader of the Israelites (1 Sam. 7:5-6). 
However, if Mizpah in Benjamin  was Tell en-Nasbeh on the Nablus road, Ishmael who had assassinated Gedaliah would not have fled to Ammon via Gibeon Jeremiah Chapter 41 Verse 10-12 Mechon Mamre which is located to the West near Neby Samwil which overlooks Jerusalem. Furthermore, Judas Machabeus, preparing for war with the Syrians, gathered his men "to Maspha, over against Jerusalem: for in Maspha was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel".I Mach., iii, 46, cited in [tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Maspha[/tpl]
Some, e.g. Petrus Comestor (ca. 1100-1179) in his Historia Scholastica, Cap. CLXXX: De sepultura Domini, have identified Ramathaim Zofim as Arimathea of the New Testament.

William Warren Allmand, [tpl]Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|OC|QC[/tpl] (born September 19, 1932) is a former Canadian Liberal Party Member of Parliament and was a Cabinet member from 1972 to 1979.
Allmand was born in Montreal and studied civil law at McGill University and comparative law  at the University of Paris. He was admitted to the Quebec bar in 1958. In 1965, he was elected to the Parliament of Canada. He was sworn into the Privy Council on November 27, 1972, and has held the three Cabinet posts: Solicitor General (November 27, 1972 - September 14, 1976), Indian Affairs and Northern Development (September 14, 1976 - September 16, 1977), and finally Consumer and Corporate Affairs (September 16, 1977 - June 4, 1979). As Solicitor General, he tabled in 1976 the bill that abolished the death penalty in Canada.
In 1995, he gained notoriety for voting against Paul Martin's budget, as he was opposed to the fact the cuts that Martin was proposing were too drastic and that it did not cancel the Goods and Services Tax. As a result, Jean Chrétien removed him from his position as Chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice, although he remained in the Liberal caucus. He retired before the 1997 election.  Mr. Allmand was also Chair of the Justice Committee when Canada's controversial gun control legislation was reviewed by the Committee and adopted.
He also has served as the president of the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development from 1997 to 2002 and the international president of Parliamentarians for Global Action. In 2004, Allmand was elected President of the World Federalist Movement–Canada.
In 1990, the World Federalist Movement–Canada honoured Allmand with its World Peace Award. In 2000, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for being "committed to democracy and the pursuit of justice and fundamental freedoms." 
As an MP, Allmand presented three Private Members' bills to have the Citizenship Oath revised to delete reference to the Queen.www.parl.gc.ca Hansard Tuesday, October 29, 1996.
Allmand is [tpl]As of|2004|alt=currently[/tpl] teaching International Human Rights at McGill University as a visiting scholar at the Institute of Canadian Studies.
In November 2005 Allmand was elected to the Montreal city council seat of Loyola in Western NDG as a member of the Union Montréal party and once again showed an independent streak by voting against his party's motion to change the name of Park Avenue to Avenue Robert Bourassa.
He did not choose to run again in the 2009 Montreal municipal election, but his seat was retained for Union Montréal by Susan Clarke.
In 2011, Allmand endorsed the Canadian Boat to Gaza,http://canadaboatgaza.org/cms/sites/cbg/en/endorsers.aspx part of the Freedom Flotilla 2 http://www.freedomflotilla.eu/ which aims to end the Israeli blockade imposed on the 1.6 million Palestinian civilians living in the Gaza Strip.

[[Arimathea]]
CATEGORIES: New Testament places

Arimathea ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἁριμαθαία[/tpl]), according to the Gospel of Luke (xxiii. 51), was "a city of Judea". It was reportedly the home town of Joseph of Arimathea, who appears in all four Gospel accounts of the Passion for having donated his new tomb outside Jerusalem to receive the body of Jesus.  Apart from the Bible, there is no record of a place called Arimathea existing.
In the Koine Greek New Testament texts, the Greek word for Arimathea has a rough breathing mark ( ῾ ) and this indicates aspiration (the presence of an /h/ sound) on the first alpha of Arimathea. Consequently, the place of Joseph's origin should be pronounced "Harimathea". That would correspond to Hebrew ha-ramathaim, with the initial he (ה) forming the definite Hebrew article ha-.  The Aramaic Syriac translation of John 19:38 literally reads, "Ramtha" which when anglicized comes to "Ramath."
Some have hypothesized that it was another name for Ramathaim-Zophim in Ephraim, the birthplace of Samuel, where David came to him (1 Samuel 1:1, 19).  Others identify it with Ramlah in Dan, or Ramah in Benjamin (Matt. 2:18).
Joseph is given more extensive attention in the Acts of Pilate, but that work is considered late fiction. The Catholic Encyclopedia, for example, asserts that "the additional details which are found concerning Joseph in the apocryphal Acta Pilati, are unworthy of credence."
Some writers [tpl]Who|date=July 2011[/tpl] say that Joseph was a tin merchant and that the young Jesus accompanied him to Britain to obtain the metal. As the poem And did those feet in ancient time, which is sung to the tune "Jerusalem," goes, "And did those feet in ancient time walk upon England's mountains green? And was the holy Lamb of God on England's pleasant pastures seen?" William Blake penned these lines in Milton a Poem which was published in 1804. Since then the poem, later put to music in 1916 by  Sir Hubert Parry, has proved an enduring alternative national anthem for England. Its melody has been immensely popular and contributed much to its longstanding appeal.  
The poem has also become an unofficial anthem of those British who believe Joseph raised the first above-ground church edifice in Christendom when Roman Christians were still meeting in catacombs. In fact, the first building erected for the purposes of worship is unknown. While there is no archaeological evidence of a first-century church building in England, some legends place a wattle church in Glastonbury dedicated to Mary the Mother of Jesus. The legends also say that Joseph planted his staff in the ground at Glastonbury and that it flowered every Christmas.  The Glastonbury Thorn, destroyed during the English Civil War, was replaced by a cutting that still stands today. According to some legends, Joseph returned to Glastonbury after the Resurrection of Jesus to spread the Gospel.

[[Association of American Law Schools]]

CATEGORIES: Legal organizations based in the United States, College and university associations and consortia in the United States, Law schools in the United States, Organizations established in 1900

The Association of American Law Schools (AALS) is a non-profit organization of 170 law schools in the United States. Another 25 schools are "non-member fee paid" schools, which are not members but choose to pay AALS dues. Its purpose is to improve the legal profession through the improvement of legal education. It also represents the interests of law schools towards the U.S. federal government and other national associations of institutes of higher education. It was formed in 1900.
The AALS requires its members to follow a nondiscrimination policy regarding "race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, or sexual orientation," and for member law schools to require this of any employer to which it gives access for recruitment. Some schools with particularly strong religious objections to homosexuality choose not to become AALS members for this reason.
The United States Armed Forces "don't ask, don't tell" (DADT) policy was seen by the AALS as impermissible discrimination. However, the AALS has excused its members from blocking access to the military since the passage of the Solomon Amendments, which denies federal funding to the parent university of a law school as well as the school itself if military recruiters are not given full campus access.  However, the AALS requires schools to take "ameliorative" measures when allowing military recruiters on campus, including placing "warning" signs on campus when military recruiting takes place, scheduling interviews off campus away from "core" areas, "prohibiting entirely the delivery of discretionary support services" to military recruiters, charging military employers who use law school resources "reasonable fees for use of law school staff, facilities and services," etc.On-Campus Military Recruiting – Balancing AALS Rules, Other Nondiscrimination Policies and the Solomon II Amendment, December 15, 1998, http://home.pacbell.net/pkykwan/AALS/documents/Dec15Supp.htm The AALS has encouraged law schools to deny benefits to military recruiters that they would ordinarily provide employers, such as coffee and free parking. Specifically, the AALS wrote in a memo to all law school deans in the United States:
The AALS has engaged in litigation challenging the Solomon Amendments as violative of the First Amendment (see e.g., Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.). In an interesting conicidence, The Judge Advocate General's School of the United States Army is a fee-paying nonmember of AALS.
Although DADT has been ended, and although President Barack Obama called upon college campuses to welcome military recruiters during his State of the Union Speech (1/25/11), some law professors have questioned why the AALS has issued no statement declaring an end to its recommendations.DADT Repeal and On-Campus Military Recruiters, PrawfsBlawg, December 24, 2010, http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2010/12/dadt-repeal-and-on-campus-military-recruiters.html
The Association holds an annual conference, rotating its location among several large U.S. cities, among them San Francisco, New Orleans and Washington, D.C. Its January 2006 conference was originally scheduled to be held in New Orleans, but in the intervening months the devastation of Hurricane Katrina forced AALS to relocate the conference to Washington, D.C.

The Isthmus of Corinth is the narrow land bridge which connects the Peloponnese peninsula with the rest of the mainland of Greece, near the city of Corinth. The word "isthmus" comes from the Ancient Greek word for "neck" and refers to the narrowness of the land.LSJ entry ισθμός The Isthmus was known in the ancient world as the landmark separating Peloponnese from mainland of Greece. In the first century CE the geographer StraboStrabo, Geography. 9.1.6. noted a pillar on the Isthmus of Corinth, which bore two inscriptions. One towards the East, i.e. towards Megara in Attica reading: "Here is not Peloponnesus, but Ionia" ([tpl]lang|grc|τάδ᾽ οὐχὶ Πελοπόννησος, ἀλλ᾽ Ἰωνία[/tpl]) and the one towards the West, i.e. towards the Peloponnese: "Here is Peloponnesus, not Ionia" ([tpl]lang|grc|τάδ᾽ ἐστὶ Πελοπόννησος, οὐκ Ἰωνία[/tpl]); Plutarch ascribed the erection of the stele to the Attic hero Theseus, on his way to Athens. Plutarch, Parallel Lives , Theseus Plut. Thes. 25
To the west of the Isthmus is the Gulf of Corinth, to the east the Saronic Gulf. Since 1893 the Corinth Canal has run through the 6.3 km wide isthmus, effectively making the Peloponnese an island. Today, two road bridges, two railway bridges and two submersible bridges at both ends of the canal connect the mainland side of the isthmus with the Peloponnese side. Also a military emergency bridge is located at the west end of the canal.

Bainbridge Colby (December 22, 1869 – April 11, 1950) was an American lawyer, a co-founder of the United States Progressive Party and Woodrow Wilson's last Secretary of State. Colby was a Republican until he helped co-found the National Progressive Party in 1912; he ran for multiple offices as a member of that party, but always lost.http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Bainbridge_Colby
Wilson's appointment of Colby was "bizarre" says historian John Milton Cooper, for Colby had no diplomatic experience or skills.  Editorial responses from leading newspapers ranged "from puzzlement to outrage."John Milton Cooper, Woodrow Wilson: A Biography (2009) p 556  Colby was chosen because he was totally loyal to Wilson; he left no notable achievements in the office.

Dark Skies is an American UFO conspiracy theory-based sci-fi television series that aired from the 1996 to 1997 season for 18 episodes, plus a two-hour pilot episode. The success of The X-Files on Fox proved there was an audience for science fiction shows, resulting in NBC commissioning this proposed competitor following a pitch from producers Bryce Zabel and Brent Friedman. The series debuted September 21, 1996 on NBC, and was later rerun by the Sci-Fi Channel. Its tagline was "History as we know it is a lie."

[[Privilege of peerage]]
CATEGORIES: Peerage

The privilege of peerage is the body of special privileges belonging to members of the British peerage. It is distinct from Parliamentary privilege, which applies only to those peers serving in the House of Lords and the members of the House of Commons, while Parliament is in session and forty days before and after a Parliamentary session.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso15.htm|title=Chapter 12 Parliamentary Privilege and related matters §12.06|work=Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords|publisher=United Kingdom Parliament|year=2010|accessdate=13 June 2010[/tpl]
The privileges have been lost and eroded over time. Only three survived into the 20th century: the right to be tried by other peers of the realm instead of juries of commoners, freedom from arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, and access to the Sovereign to advise him or her on matters of state. The right to be tried by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, if at all. The remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked.
Peers also have several other rights not formally part of the privilege of peerage. For example, they are entitled to use coronets and supporters on their achievements of arms.

[[Ramakien]]

CATEGORIES: Thai literature, Works based on the Ramayana

The Ramakien (รามเกียรติ์, "Glory of Rama", sometimes also spelled Ramakien) is Thailand's national epic, derived from the Hindu epic Ramayana. The word is derived from Sanskrit word Ramakhyan (Ram + Akhyan) where Akhyan means a long story or epic.
A number of versions of the epic were lost in the destruction of Ayutthaya in 1767.   Three versions currently exist, one of which was prepared in 1797 under the supervision of (and partly written by) King Rama I.   His son, Rama II, rewrote some parts of his father's version for khon drama.  The work has had an important influence on Thai literature, art and drama (both the khon and nang dramas being derived from it).
While the main story is identical to that of the Ramayana, many other aspects were transposed into a Thai context, such as the clothes, weapons, topography, and elements of nature, which are described as being Thai in style. Although Thailand is considered a Theravada Buddhist society, the  Hindu  mythology latent in the Ramakien serves to provide Thai legends with a creation myth, as well as representations of various spirits which complement beliefs derived from Thai animism.
A painted representation of the Ramakian is displayed at Bangkok's Wat Phra Kaew, and many of the statues there depict characters from it.

[[Reamker]]

CATEGORIES: Cambodian culture, Cambodian literature, Performing arts in Cambodia, Works based on the Ramayana

Reamker ([tpl]lang-km|រាមកេរ្តិ៍[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-km|riːəmkeː|[/tpl], also romanized as Ramakerti) is a Cambodian epic poem, based on the Sanskrit's Ramayana epic. The name means "Glory of Rama". It adapts the Hindu ideas to Buddhist themes and shows the balance of good and evil in the world. More than just a reordering of the epic tale, the Reamker is a mainstay of the royal ballet's repertoire. Like the Ramayana, it is a philosophical allegory, exploring the ideals of justice and fidelity as embodied by the protagonists, Prince Rama and Queen Sita. The epic is well known among the Khmer people for its portrayal in Khmer dance theatre, called the Lkhaon, in various festivals across Cambodia. Scenes from the Reamker are painted on the walls of the Royal Palace in Khmer style, and its predecessor is carved into the walls of the Angkor Wat and Banteay Srei temples. It is considered an integral part of Cambodian culture.
The Reamker differs from the original Ramayana in some ways, featuring additional scenes and emphasis on Hanuman and Sovanna Maccha.
In the Reamker, issues of trust, loyalty, love, and revenge play out in dramatic encounters among princes and giants, monkeys and mermaids, and a forlorn princess. Though it is understood that Preah Ream is an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, his characteristics and those of the others in the story are interpreted in Cambodia as those of mere mortals, not of the gods as is the case in India. The complex interplay of strengths and weaknesses, though couched in episodes lined with magic, nonetheless represents a decidedly human social behavior. 
As in other Southeast Asian countries, the Rama story in Cambodia is not confined to the realm of literature but extends to all Cambodian art forms, from sculpture to dance drama, painting and art. Another epic, Lpoek Angkor Vat (“The Story of Angkor Wat”), which dates from the beginning of the 17th century, celebrates the magnificent temple complex at Angkor and describes the bas-reliefs in the temple galleries that portray the Rama story.

The village area, dating from at least the 17th century, held one of the earliest settlements known in the southern part of the island, and one of medieval Ireland's more important monastic centres.History and Antiquities of Tallaght in the County of Dublin, 2nd edition, 1889; Handcock, William Domville
Up to the 1960s Tallaght was little more than a small village in County Dublin, linked to several nearby rural areas which were part of the large civil parish of the same name - the local council estimates the then population at 2,500.Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland: County Development Plan 2004-2010, p. 78 Suburban development began in the 1970s and a town centre area has been developing since the late 1980s. There is no legal definition of the boundaries of Tallaght, but the electoral divisions known as "Tallaght" followed by the name of a locality have, according to the 2011 census, a population of 71,504. There are currently calls for Tallaght to be declared a city.http://www.tallaghtcity.ie/
The village core of the district is located north of, and near to, the River Dodder, and parts of the broader area within South Dublin are close to the borders of Dublin City, Kildare, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown and County Wicklow. Several streams flow in the area, notably the Jobstown or Tallaght Stream (a tributary of the Dodder River), and the Fettercairn Stream (a tributary of the River Camac), while the Tymon River, the main component of the River Poddle (Liffey tributary), rises in Cookstown, near Fettercairn.

The Grantham Canal is a canal that runs for 33 miles (53 km) from Grantham, falling through 18 locks to West Bridgford where it joins the River Trent. It was built primarily to allow for the transportation of coal to Grantham. It opened in 1797, and its profitability steadily increased until 1841. It was then sold to a railway company, after which it declined, and was finally closed in 1936. 
Because it was used as a water supply for agriculture, most of the channel remained in water, although bridges were lowered. Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working towards its restoration, and two stretches are navigable to small vessels. Full restoration will require a new route where the canal joins the Trent, as road building has effectively severed the original route.

[[Naming rights]]
CATEGORIES: Brand management, Place names, Sponsorships

In the private sector, naming rights are a financial transaction and form of advertising whereby a corporation or other entity purchases the right to name a facility or event, typically for a defined period of time.  For properties like a multi-purpose arena, performing arts venue or an athletic field, the term ranges from three to 20 years.  Longer terms are more common for higher profile venues such as a professional sports facility.Kamiya, Setsuko, "You name it: Rights for more municipal sites go on sale", Japan Times, 20 September 2011, p. 3.
The distinctive characteristic for this type of naming rights is that the buyer gets a marketing property to promote products and services, promote customer retention and or increase market share.
There are several forms of corporate sponsored names. A presenting sponsor attaches the name of the corporation or brand at the end (or, sometimes, beginning) of a generic, usually traditional, name (e.g. Mall of America Field at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome). A title sponsor replaces the original name of the property with a corporate-sponsored one, with no reference to the previous name.
In a few cases, naming rights contracts have been terminated prematurely. Such terminations may be the result of contractual options, sponsor bankruptcy, or scandals.

The Requiem Mass in D minor (K. 626) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was composed in Vienna in 1791 and left unfinished at the composer's death on December 5. A completion dated 1792 by Franz Xaver Süssmayr was delivered to Count Franz von Walsegg, who had anonymously commissioned the piece for a requiem mass to commemorate the February 14 anniversary of his wife's death.
The autograph manuscript shows the finished and orchestrated introit in Mozart's hand, as well as detailed drafts of the Kyrie and the sequence Dies Irae as far as the first nine bars of "Lacrimosa", and the offertory. It cannot be shown to what extent Süssmayr may have depended on now lost "scraps of paper" for the remainder; he later claimed the Sanctus and Agnus Dei as his own. Walsegg probably intended to pass the Requiem off as his own composition, as he is known to have done with other works. This plan was frustrated by a public benefit performance for Mozart's widow Constanze. A modern contribution to the mythology is Peter Shaffer's 1979 play Amadeus, in which a mysterious messenger orders Mozart to write a requiem mass, giving no explanation for the order; Mozart (in the play) then comes to believe that the piece is meant to be the requiem mass for his own funeral.
The Requiem is scored for 2 basset horns in F, 2 bassoons, 2 trumpets in D, 3 trombones (alto, tenor & bass), timpani (2 drums), violins, viola and basso continuo (cello, double bass, and organ). The vocal forces include soprano, contralto, tenor, and bass soloists and an SATB mixed choir.

Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are stretches of DNA containing or linked to the genes that underlie a quantitative trait. Mapping regions of the genome that contain genes involved in specifying a quantitative trait is done using molecular tags such as AFLP or, more commonly SNPs. This is an early step in identifying and sequencing the actual genes underlying trait variation. Quantitative traits refer to phenotypes (characteristics) that vary in degree and can be attributed to polygenic effects, i.e., product of two or more genes, and their environment.

A small fraction of the scattered photons (approximately 1 in 10 million) are scattered by an excitation, with the scattered photons having a frequency different from, and usually lower than, that of the incident photons.[tpl]cite book|author= Harris and Bertolucci|title=Symmetry and Spectroscopy|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1989|isbn= 0-486-66144-X[/tpl] In a gas, Raman scattering can occur with a change in energy of a molecule due to a transition (see energy level).

However, in contemporary terminology, the word Austronesia pertains to the regions where Austronesian languages are spoken. Austronesia then covers almost half of the globe, although mostly ocean and oceanic islands, starting from Madagascar to the west until Easter Island, to the east.

[[Aristarchus (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Aristarchus, named after the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos, is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the northwest part of the Moon's near side. It is considered the brightest of the large formations on the lunar surface, with an albedo nearly double that of most lunar features. The feature is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, and is dazzling in a large telescope. It is also readily identified when most of the lunar surface is illuminated by earthshine.
The crater is located at the southeastern edge of the Aristarchus plateau, an elevated area that contains a number of volcanic features, such as sinuous rilles. This area is also noted for the large number of reported transient lunar phenomena, as well as recent emissions of radon gas as measured by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft.

[[County palatine]]

CATEGORIES: Counties of England, English law, Norman conquest of England

A county palatine or palatinate"Palatine" is an adjective used in conjunction with the noun county; "Palatinate" is a noun used alone (Collins English Dictionary). was an area ruled by an hereditary nobleman possessing special authority and autonomy from the rest of a kingdom or empire. The name derives from the Latin adjective palatinus, "relating to the palace", from the noun palatium, "palace".Collins Dictionary of the English Language, London, 1986; Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant & Charles It thus implies the exercise of a quasi-royal prerogative within a county, that is to say a jurisdiction ruled by an earl, the English equivalent of a count. A duchy palatinate is similar but is ruled over by a duke, a nobleman of higher precedence than an earl or count. The nobleman swore allegiance to the king yet had the power to rule the county largely independently of the king. It should therefore be distinguished from the Feudal barony, held from the king, which possessed no such independent authority. Rulers of counties palatine did however create their own feudal baronies, to be held directly from them in capite, such as the Barony of Halton.Sanders, I.J., English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960; Sanders excludes "Lordships" such as the Barony of Halton which are situated within Counties Palatine from his lists of feudal baronies County palatine jurisdictions were created in England under the rule of the Norman dynasty. On continental Europe, they have an earlier date. In general, when a palatine-type autonomy was granted to a lord by the sovereign, it was in a district on the periphery of the kingdom, at a time when the district was at risk from disloyal armed insurgents who could retreat beyond the borders and re-enter. For the English sovereign in Norman times this applied to northern England, Wales and Ireland. As the authority granted was hereditary, some counties palatine legally survived well past the end of the feudal period.

[[Train surfing]]
CATEGORIES: Passenger rail transport, Types of travel, Outdoor recreation

Train surfing (also known as train hopping or train hitching) is the act of hitching a ride on the outside of a moving train, tram or another rail transport. In a number of countries, the term train hopping is often confused with the term freight hopping, which means riding on the outside of a freight train, while train surfing can be practiced on any type of a train. This type of travelling can be dangerous and even life-threatening, because there is a risk of death or serious injury from falling off a moving train, electrocution from power supply (overhead catenary wire, current collectors, resistors, etc.), colliding with a railway infrastructure (bridges, tunnels, platforms, traffic lights or other trains) while riding outside off structure gauge on the side or on the roof of a train, or unsuccessful attempts to jump on a moving train or off it. Today, the practice is forbidden by statutes on many railroads in the world. Despite this, it is still practiced, especially on those railroads where the trains are overcrowded.

Eldfell is a composite volcanic cone just over [tpl]convert|200|m|ft|-1[/tpl] high on the Icelandic island of Heimaey. It formed in a volcanic eruption which began on the eastern side of Heimaey in the Westman Island on 23 January 1973. This came without any sign of warning. The name of Eldfell means Mountain of Fire in Icelandic.
The eruption caused a major crisis for the island and nearly led to its permanent evacuation. Volcanic ash fell over most of the island, destroying around 400 homes, and a lava flow threatened to close off the harbour, the island's main income source via its fishing fleet. An operation was mounted to cool the advancing lava flow by pumping sea water onto it, which was successful in preventing the loss of the harbour.
After the eruption, the islanders used heat from the cooling lava flows to provide hot water and to generate electricity. They also used some of the extensive tephra, fall-out of airborne volcanic material, to extend the runway at the island's small airport, and as landfill, on which 200 new houses were built.

[[Giant danio]]

CATEGORIES: Devario, Fish of Bangladesh

The giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus) is a tropical fish belonging to the minnow family Cyprinidae.  Originating in Sri Lanka, Nepal, and the west coast of India, this species grows to a maximum length of 4 inches (10 cm), making it one of the largest of the danionins.  It is characterized by a blue and yellow, torpedo-shaped body with gray and clear fins.
In the wild, giant danios live in clear streams and rivers among hills at elevations up to 1000 ft (300 m) above sea level.  Their native substrate is small gravel.  They are native to a tropical climate and prefer water with a 6-8 pH, a water hardness of 5.0-19.0 dGH, and a temperature range of 72-81°F (22-27°C).  As surface dwellers, their diets consist predominantly of exogenous insects, but is also supplemented by worms and crustaceans.  
In captivity, giant danios will usually accept most foods.  They are a somewhat aggressive fish, and may bully other fish in community tanks.  Giant danios appreciate water movement to simulate the motion of the rivers and fast-moving streams of their origins, and prefer to school.  
Giant danios are also used as dither fish in South and Central American cichlid aquariums. The larger cichlids chase and defend their territories against the giant danios, which allows the cichlids to exhibit more natural behavior.
As egg-scatterers, danios produce around 300 eggs in a single spawning.  They spawn in clumps of plants.
A so-called "golden giant danio", sometimes seen, is in reality a partial albino fish. Devario affinis, Devario browni, Devario malabaricus, and Devario strigillifer were originally deemed synonyms, but are now valid species.

Ode to the West Wind is an ode written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1819 near Florence, Italy. It was published in 1820 by Charles and James Ollier in London as part of the collection Prometheus Unbound, A Lyrical Drama in Four Acts, With Other Poems. Some have interpreted the poem as the speaker lamenting his inability to directly help those in England owing to his being in Italy. At the same time, the poem expresses the hope that its words will inspire and influence those who read or hear it.MacEachen, Dougald B. CliffsNotes on Shelley's Poems. 29 July 2011. Perhaps more than anything else, Shelley wanted his message of reform and revolution spread, and the wind becomes the trope for spreading the word of change through the poet-prophet figure. Some also believe that the poem is due to the loss of his son, William (to Mary Shelley) in 1819. His son Charles (to Harriet Shelley) died in 1826, after "Ode to the West Wind" was written and published. The ensuing pain influenced Shelley. The poem allegorises the role of the poet as the voice of change and revolution. At the time of composing this poem, Shelley without doubt had the Peterloo Massacre of August 1819 in mind. His other poems written at the same time—"The Masque of Anarchy," "Prometheus Unbound," and "England in 1819"—take up these same problems of political change, revolution, and role of the poet.SparkNotes Editors. “SparkNote on Shelley’s Poetry.” SparkNotes LLC. 2002.

The Ride of the Valkyries ([tpl]lang-de|Walkürenritt[/tpl] or Ritt der Walküren) is the popular term for the beginning of Act III of Die Walküre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen. The main theme of the Ride, the leitmotif labelled Walkürenritt, was first written down by the composer on 23 July 1851. The preliminary draft for the Ride was composed in 1854 as part of the composition of the entire opera, which was fully orchestrated by the end of the first quarter of 1856. Together with the Bridal Chorus from Lohengrin, the Ride of the Valkyries is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.
In the opera house, the Ride, which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the Act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle. Outside the opera house, it is usually heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes.

[[Demilitarisation]]

CATEGORIES: Arms control, Military disbanding and disarmament

Demilitarisation or demilitarization is the reduction of a nation's army, weapons, or military vehicles to an agreed minimum. Demilitarisation is usually the result of a peace treaty ending a war or a major conflict. A drastic voluntary reduction in size of a victorious army is called demobilization. 
Demilitarisation was a policy in a number of countries after both world wars. In the aftermath of World War I the United Kingdom greatly reduced its military strength. The resulting position of weakness during the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany was among the causes that led to the policy of appeasement.   
The conversion of a military or paramilitary force into a civilian one is also called demilitarisation. For example the Italian Polizia di Stato demilitarised in 1981, and the Austrian Gendarmerie merged with the national police, making up a new civilian body.
Demilitarisation can also refer to the policies employed by Allied forces during the occupation of Japan and Germany after World War II.Haller, Oliver, Destroying Weapons of Coal, Air and Water: A Critical Evaluation of the American Policy of German Industrial Demilitarization 1945 - 1952 (Philipps-Universität Marburg: Marburg, 2006). The Japanese and German militaries were re-badged to disassociate them from their recent war history, but were kept active and reinforced to help the allies face the new Soviet threat that had become evident as World War 2 ended, and the Cold War began.
Demilitarisation can also refer to the reduction of one or more types of weapons or weapons systems (See Arms Control) or the removal of combat equipment from a warship (See Japanese battleship Hiei). 
A demilitarised zone is a specific area, such as a buffer zone between nations previously engaged in armed conflict, where military persons, equipment or activities are forbidden. 
Examples of demilitarisation include:

CATEGORIES: Ranger program, Spacecraft launched in 1964, Spacecraft that impacted the Moon

Ranger 7 was the first US space probe to successfully transmit close images of the lunar surface back to Earth.  It was also the first completely successful flight of the Ranger program.  Launched on 28 July 1964, Ranger 7 was designed to achieve a lunar impact trajectory and to transmit high-resolution photographs of the lunar surface during the final minutes of flight up to impact. The spacecraft carried six television vidicon cameras, 2 wide angle (channel F, cameras A and B) and 4 narrow angle (channel P) to accomplish these objectives. The cameras were arranged in two separate chains, or channels, each self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters so as to afford the greatest reliability and probability of obtaining high-quality video pictures. Ranger 7 transmitted over 4,300 photographs during the final 17 minutes of it flight. After 68.6 hours of flight, the spacecraft landed between Mare Nubium and Oceanus Procellarum.  This landing site was later named Mare Cognitum.  The velocity at impact was 1.62 miles per second, and the performance of the spacecraft exceeded hopes.http://www.solarviews.com/eng/ranger7.htm  No other experiments were carried on the spacecraft.National Space Science Data Center, Ranger 7, NSSDC ID: 1964-041A

[[Farewell Dossier]]

The Farewell dossier was the collection of documents that Colonel Vladimir Vetrov, a KGB defector (code-named "Farewell"), gathered and gave to the French DST in 1981–82, during the Cold War.
Vetrov was an engineer who had been assigned to evaluate information on Western hardware and software gathered by the "Line X" technical intelligence operation for Directorate T, the Soviet directorate for scientific and technical intelligence collection from the West.  He became increasingly disillusioned with the Communist(Bolshivist) system and decided to work with the French at the end of 1980. Between the spring of 1981 and early 1982, Vetrov gave almost 4,000 secret documents to the DST, including the complete list of 250 Line X officers stationed under legal cover in embassies around the world.
As a consequence, Western nations undertook a mass expulsion of Soviet technology spies.  The CIA also mounted a counter-intelligence operation that transferred modified hardware and software designs to the Soviets.  Thomas Reed alleged this was the cause of a spectacular trans-Siberian pipeline disaster in 1982.
Vetrov's story inspired the 1997 book Bonjour Farewell: La Vérité sur la Taupe Française du KGB by Serguei Kostine.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zMtQHQAACAAJ|title=Bonjour, Farewell: La Vérité sur la Taupe Française du KGB|isbn=2221079086|first=Sergueï|last=Kostine|publisher=R.

The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations  (or RANS equations) are time-averaged[ref]
equations of motion for fluid flow. The idea behind the equations is Reynolds decomposition, whereby an instantaneous quantity is decomposed into its time-averaged and fluctuating quantities, an idea first proposed by Osborne Reynolds.[ref]

A, v. 186, pp. 123-164. Available online from JSTOR.[/ref]  The RANS equations are primarily used to describe turbulent flows. These equations can be used with approximations based on knowledge of the properties of flow turbulence to give approximate time-averaged solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations.
For a stationary, incompressible Newtonian fluid, these equations can be written in Einstein notation as:

Gerard (died 21 May 1108) was Archbishop of York between 1100 and 1108 and Lord Chancellor of England from 1085 until 1092. A Norman, he was a member of the cathedral clergy at Rouen before becoming a royal clerk under King William I of England and subsequently his son King William II Rufus. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the Bishopric of Hereford in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, Henry I of England, within days of William's death.
Soon after Henry's coronation Gerard was appointed to the recently vacant see of York, and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the see of Canterbury concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure papal recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland, but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, Anselm, over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the Investiture Controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.
Gerard was a patron of learning, to the extent that he urged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a language not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.

[[Lead vocalist]]
CATEGORIES: Musical groups, Occupations in music

The lead vocalist or lead vocal (or lead singer) is the member of a band who sings the main solo vocal portions of a song.  The lead vocalist may also play one or more instruments, and is usually the "leader" of their group, often the spokesman in interviews and before the public.  The lead vocalist is sometimes referred to as the frontman.
In certain types of music, notably soul and Motown, there is a line-up of a lead vocalist with a named group of backing vocalists (Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, Diana Ross & the Supremes, Gladys Knight & the Pips). Such line-ups can be very fluid, with both the lead vocalist and the backing group pursuing independent careers; and frequent personnel changes are not uncommon. While members of backing bands were often replaceable, the lead singer would be regarded as having a more marketable name and would have to hire or fire backing musicians at will. Cases of backing bands "defecting" to rival vocalists were rarer, but did happen on occasion as seen by Tony Orlando and Dawn.

After leaving Genesis, Phillips studied classical music (especially classical guitar) and made recordings in collaboration with Harry Williamson, Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins, among others. He played the keyboards on the demos for Peter Gabriel in 1976. His first solo album, The Geese and the Ghost, was issued in 1977.
He released his second album, Wise After the Event, in 1978. This was followed the next year by Sides. Both of these albums were produced by Rupert Hine and were intended to reach a mainstream audience, though neither album was successful in that regard.
In its initial release in the UK, Sides was accompanied by a more experimental album entitled Private Parts and Pieces; in the U.S. and Canada the two albums were issued separately. Private Parts and Pieces II: Back to the Pavilion followed the next year, and several further sequels were issued in the 1980s and 1990s.
Phillips began writing material with Andrew Latimer of Camel in 1981, and was a featured performer on that band's album, The Single Factor (released in 1982).
Phillips released a mainstream pop album entitled Invisible Men in 1983. He later claimed that this project went "horribly wrong" as a result of commercial pressures, and would subsequently eschew mainstream success in favour of more specialised material.
Since leaving Genesis, Phillips has remained continuously involved in a variety of musical projects, including extensive soundtrack work in England often for the label Atmosphere part the Universal Music Group.  In the mid-1990s, he released an album entitled The Living Room Concert, which featured solo acoustic versions of his earlier material. He also provided archival material for the first Genesis box set, Genesis Archive 1967-75, released in 1998.
Several of his albums feature artwork by Peter Cross.
In 2008, the first Anthony Phillips biography, The Exile, by journalist Mario Giammetti, was published in Italy (Edizioni Segno)

[[Player versus player]]
CATEGORIES: Competitive video gaming, MUD terminology, Role-playing game terminology, Video game gameplay, Video game terminology, Video game culture

Player(s) versus player(s), or PvP, is a type of multiplayer interactive conflict within a game between two or more live participants.  This is in contrast to games where players compete against computer controlled opponents, which is correspondingly referred to as player versus environment (PvE).  The terms are most often used in games where both activities exist, particularly MMORPGs, MUDs, and other role-playing video games.
PvP can be broadly used to describe any game, or aspect of a game, where players compete against each other.  In computer role-playing games, PvP is sometimes called player killing or PKing.

[[A Conflict of Visions]]

CATEGORIES: Books in political philosophy

A Conflict of Visions is a book by Thomas Sowell. It was originally published in 1987; a revised edition appeared in 2007.
Sowell's opening chapter attempts to answer the question of why the same people tend to be political adversaries in issue after issue, when the issues vary enormously in subject matter and sometimes hardly seem connected to one another. The root of these conflicts, Sowell claims, are the "visions", or the intuitive feelings that people have about human nature; different visions imply radically different consequences for how they think about everything from war to justice.
The rest of the book describes two basic visions, the "constrained" and "unconstrained" visions, which are thought to capture opposite ends of a continuum of political thought on which one can place many contemporary Westerners, in addition to their intellectual ancestors of the past few centuries.
The book has been published both with and without the subtitle "Ideological Origins of Political Struggles".
Steven Pinker's book The Blank Slate calls Sowell's explanation the best theory given to date.  In this book, Pinker refers to the "constrained vision" as the "tragic vision" and the "unconstrained vision" as the "utopian vision".[tpl]cite web|url=http://ben.casnocha.com/2009/10/tragic-vs-utopian-view-of-human-nature.html |title=The Blog: Tragic vs. Utopian View of Human Nature |publisher=Ben Casnocha |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2010-03-17[/tpl]

It is one of the three pillars of the Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development (ALTID) project, endorsed by the ESCAP commission at its 48th session in 1992, comprising Asian Highway, Trans-Asian Railway (TAR) and facilitation of land transport projects.
Agreements have been signed by 32 countries to allow the highway to cross the continent and also reach to Europe. Some of the countries taking part in the highway project are India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, China, Japan, South Korea and Bangladesh. Most of the funding comes from the larger, more advanced Asian nations like Japan, India and China as well as international agencies such as the Asian Development Bank.
The project aims to make maximum use of the continent's existing highways to avoid the construction of newer ones, except in cases where missing routes necessitate their construction. Project Monitor, an Asian infrastructure news website, has commented that the:

Ľudmila Pajdušáková (29 June 1916 – 6 October 1979) was a Slovak astronomer.
She specialized in solar astronomy, and also discovered a number of comets, including periodic comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdušáková,[tpl]cite news|url=http://hnonline.sk/svet/c1-52585220-zem-tesne-minula-slovenska-kometa|title=Zem tesne minula slovenská kométa|date=15 August 2011|publisher=hnonline.sk.|language=Slovak|accessdate=9 December 2011[/tpl] and the non-periodic C/1946 K1 (Pajdušáková-Rotbart-Weber), C/1948 E1 (Pajdušáková-Mrkos), C/1951 C1 (Pajdušáková) and C/1953 X1 (Pajdušáková).
She observed at Skalnaté Pleso Observatory and became its third director from 1958 to 1979.
The asteroid 3636 Pajdušáková is named after her.
She may have been married to Antonín Mrkos. In a 1951 "Comet Notes" article in Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific 63 (1951) 209, Leland E. Cunningham in discussing comet C/1951 C1 refers to her as "Miss Pajdušáková (Mrs. Mrkos)", and there was an astronomy book published in 1956 by Ľudmila Mrkosová-Pajdušáková, as well as various scientific papers under this name from approximately 1952–1958.

Fine Music 102.5 (previously 2MBS FM) is a Sydney music radio station operated by the Music Broadcasting Society of New South Wales Co-Operative Limited.
Launched in 15 December 1974, it is Australia's first fully licensed FM radio station.[tpl]cite web | title = The History of Radio Adelaide | work = Radio Adelaide | publisher = Adelaide University | url = http://radio.adelaide.edu.au/history/ | accessdate = 14 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Lee | first = Dr Robert | title = Linking a Nation: Australia's Transport and Communications 1788 - 1970 | work = University of Western Sydney | publisher = Australian Heritage Council | year = 2003 | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/ahc/publications/commission/books/linking-a-nation/chapter-9.html | accessdate = 14 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Lines of Communication | work = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | year = 1999 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/comms/lines/programs/prog08.htm | accessdate = 14 March 2009[/tpl]
The station broadcasts from studios located at Chandos Street, St Leonards, to the greater Sydney region at a frequency of 102.5 MHz from a 50 kilowatt (ERP) transmitter located atop Governor Philip Tower, in Sydney's central business district. Its operations are conducted by volunteers and a small number of paid staff. Operational funding is principally derived from corporate sponsorship, arts partnerships, philanthropic donations, listener subscriptions, and the secondhand Book and CD Fairs held around the Sydney area. 
Approximately 80 percent of Fine Music 102.5's on-air music content is from the Western classical and related traditions, and the remainder is made up of jazz, blues, and non-mainstream and experimental contemporary music. 
One of the station's most popular programmes for several decades was Evensong, a weekly programme of English sacred music in the Anglican tradition. Its regular presenter Mrs Ann Ramsay died at the age of 91 on 1 April 2006, prior to which she was thought to be Australia's oldest on-air radio presenter[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]. Evensong has been replaced by another popular Sunday program, Hosanna. 
Popular non-classical programmes broadcast by the station include the blues show Stormy Monday, which has aired on Monday evenings for three decades, and for many years was rebroadcast nationally by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA) satellite service. Ultima Thule, the station's Sunday evening ambient music programme has been on air for nearly twenty years and in 2005 became the first programme to be podcast on Australian community radio[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl].
Fine Music 102.5 is a member of the Australian Fine Music network which is a loose affiliation with a number of similar independently owned and operated stations in other parts of Australia, including 3MBS FM Melbourne, 4MBS FM Brisbane, 5MBS FM Adelaide and ArtSound FM Canberra.

[[Induction heating]]

CATEGORIES: Heating, Electrodynamics, Induction heating

Induction heating is the process of heating an electrically conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, where eddy currents (also called Foucault currents) are generated within the metal and resistance leads to Joule heating of the metal. An induction heater (for any process) consists of an electromagnet, through which a high-frequency alternating current (AC) is passed. Heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses in materials that have significant relative permeability.  The frequency of AC used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth.

[[Getter]]

CATEGORIES: Vacuum tubes

A getter is a deposit of reactive material that is placed inside a vacuum system, for the purpose of completing and maintaining the vacuum. When gas molecules strike the getter material, they combine with it chemically or by adsorption. Thus the getter removes small amounts of gas from the evacuated space.
The getter is usually a coating applied to a surface within the evacuated chamber.
A vacuum is initially created by connecting a closed container to a vacuum pump. After achieving a vacuum, the container can be sealed, or the vacuum pump can be left running.   Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as vacuum tubes, including cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and vacuum insulated panels, which must maintain a vacuum for a long time.  This is because the inner surfaces of the container release adsorbed gases for a long time after the vacuum is established.  The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced.   Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a vacuum pump, getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher vacuum than the pump could achieve alone.  Although it weighs almost nothing and has no moving parts, a getter is itself a vacuum pump.
Getters cannot react permanently with inert gases, though some getters will adsorb them in a reversible fashion. Also, hydrogen is usually handled by adsorption rather than reaction.
Small amounts of gas within a vacuum tube will ionize, causing undesired conduction leading to major malfunction.  Small amounts of gas within a vacuum insulated panel can greatly compromise its insulation value. Getters help to maintain the vacuum.

[[M.I.M.E.O.]]

CATEGORIES: Experimental musical groups, Free improvisation ensembles, Electroacoustic improvisation

M.I.M.E.O. (or MIMEO) is an experimental electroacoustic free improvisation group formed in 1997 on the initiative of several independent concert promoters in Europe. The abbreviation stands for "Music In Movement Electronic Orchestra". They have issued recordings on Erstwhile Records, Cathnor, Perdition Plastics, Grob  and other labels.
Their latest album is Sight (2007), inspired by painter Cy Twombly. Each of the eleven members of M.I.M.E.O. (spread across Europe) placed approximately five minutes of sound anywhere they chose onto a blank sixty minute CDR. This was done independently of one another, with no communication between the musicians about how or where the music should be distributed on the disc. The CDRs were then compiled onto one CD, and sent to a pressing plant.
Pianist John Tilbury joined the group to record the album The Hands of Caravaggio (2001, Erstwhile). Critic Brian Olewnick describes the album as "A staggering achievement, one is tempted to call The Hands of Caravaggio the first great piano concerto of the 21st century."

thumb|right|A popular three pin +12 V DC voltage regulator IC.A voltage regulator is designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage level. A voltage regulator may be a simple "feed-forward" design or may include  negative feedback control loops. It may use an electromechanical mechanism, or electronic components. Depending on the design, it may be used to regulate one or more AC or DC voltages.
Electronic voltage regulators are found in devices such as computer power supplies where they stabilize the DC voltages used by the processor and other elements. In automobile alternators and central power station generator plants, voltage regulators control the output of the plant. In an electric power distribution system, voltage regulators may be installed at a substation or along distribution lines so that all customers receive steady voltage independent of how much power is drawn from the line.

B., & Schmitz, T. J. (2007). Physical Rehabilitation (5th Edition ed.). Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company.
The name comes from the two structures that the sensation travels up: the posterior (or dorsal) columns of the spinal cord, and the medial lemniscus in the brainstem. Because the posterior columns are also called dorsal columns, the pathway is often called the dorsal column-medial lemniscus system, or DCML for short.
The PCML pathway is composed of rapidly conducting, large, myelinated fibers.

[[Malay trade and creole languages]]

CATEGORIES: Malay-based pidgins and creoles, Languages of Indonesia, Pidgins and creoles

In addition to its classical and literary form, Malay has various regional dialects established before the rise of the Malaccan Sultanate. But beyond these, Malay spread through interethnic contact and trade across the Malay archipelago as far as the Philippines. This contact resulted in a lingua franca that was called Bazaar Malay or low Malay. It is generally believed that Bazaar Malay was a pidgin, influenced by contact among Malay, Chinese, Portuguese, and Dutch traders.
Besides the general simplification that occurs with pidgins, the Malay lingua franca had several distinctive characteristics. One that possessives were formed with punya 'its owner'; another that plural pronouns were formed with orang 'person'. The only Malayic affixes that remained productive were tər- and bər-.
Other features:
For example,MALAY DIALECT RESEARCH IN MALAYSIA: THE ISSUE OF PERSPECTIVE1.
Bazaar Malay is still used to a limited extent in Singapore and Malaysia. The most important consequence, however, has been that pidgin Malay creolized, creating several new languages.[tpl]glotto|vehi1234|Vehicular Malay[/tpl]

[[Rockaway River]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Morris County, New Jersey, Passaic River, Rivers of New Jersey

The Rockaway River is a tributary of the Passaic River, approximately 35 mi (56 km) long, in northern New Jersey in the United States. The upper course of the river flows through a wooded mountainous valley, whereas the lower course flows through the populated New Jersey suburbs and former industrial area west of New York City. It drains an area of approximately 130 sq mi (340 km²).
It rises at the eastern edge of Sussex County and within a few hundred yards enters Morris County, in the Highlands, along the northwestern slope of Green Pond Mountain south of Oak Ridge. It flows SSW, in a direct course between in the valley between the mountain ridges. Northeast of Wharton it emerges from the mountains and flows generally east in a meandering course, past Wharton, Dover (where it enters a concrete channel), Rockaway, Denville and Boonton, where it passes through the Boonton Gorge.  The gorge begins with the impressive 25 foot Boonton Falls. It continues for a little over 1 mile (1.6 km) dropping around [tpl]convert|120|ft/mi[/tpl] through nearly continuous class 3 and 4 whitewater. On the south side of Boonton it is impounded to form the Boonton Reservoir. Downstream from the reservoir dam it flows south, through Lake Hiawatha, where the river splits and joins again.  It then flows through  Parsippany and into Hatfield Swamp, where it is joined by the Whippany River and then merges with the Passaic River.
Beaver brook is a stream that flows through a swamp and enters the Rockaway River in Denville.
In the 19th century the river connected to the Morris Canal near Wharton and served as an industrial transportation link for shipping coal and iron ore between Pennsylvania and New York City. The communities of Wharton, Dover, and Boonton were important iron processing towns in the early 19th century, with a large concentration of forges and mills. The significant pollution problem in the lower course of the river has been somewhat alleviated by legislation and by the nearly complete abandonment of heavy industry in the area.
The isolated upper course of the river is a popular region site for smallmouth bass fishing.
The New Jersey Fish and Game stocks the river in many sections with rainbow and brown trout.  Many fisherman find enjoyment in fishing the river.
The river is shown in the movie, The Station Agent, and also appears in one episode of The Sopranos.

The  Black-crested Bulbul, (Pycnonotus flaviventris), is a member of the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is found from the Indian Subcontinent to southeast Asia.
The Black-crested Bulbul is generally about 19 cm in length. As the name suggests, the head of this bulbul is black while the rest of its body is different shades of yellow. Both the male and female are similar in plumage. One can make out a younger bird by its slightly duller coloring.
This is a bird of forest and dense scrub. It builds its nest in a bush; two to four eggs is a typical clutch. The Black-crested Bulbul feeds on fruit and insects.

The name Esthero refers both to the singer and formerly to the two-person team of herself and producer Doc McKinney.  Esthero is a portmanteau of "Esther the hero".  She claims to have gotten the name by combining the name of the heroine (Esther) and last line ("If I am to be the hero, then I cannot fly from darkness.") of the movie from Sylvia Plath's novel, 'The Bell Jar'.
Esthero's sound characteristically features her voice over a mix of mellow bass lines, jazzy trumpets, Spanish guitar and hip-hop. She is sometimes compared to  artists Björk, Portishead and Sade. Later female artists who count Esthero among their influences include Res, Fergie and fellow Canadian Nelly Furtado.

[[Autophagy]]

Autophagy (or autophagocytosis) (from the Greek auto-, "self" and phagein, "to eat"), is the basic catabolic mechanism that involves cell degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components through the actions of lysosomes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lin NY, Beyer C, Gießl A, et al. |title=Autophagy regulates TNFα-mediated joint destruction in experimental arthritis |journal=Ann.

Autophagy, if regulated, ensures the synthesis, degradation and recycling of cellular components. During this process, targeted cytoplasmic constituents are isolated from the rest of the cell within the autophagosome, which are then fused with lysosomes and degraded or recycled.[tpl]cite journal |author=Patel AS, Lin L, Geyer A, et al. |title=Autophagy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=e41394 |year=2012 |pmid=22815997 |pmc=3399849 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0041394 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041394 |editor1-last=Eickelberg |editor1-first=Oliver[/tpl]

Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Vasilevsky ([tpl]lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Миха́йлович Василе́вский[/tpl], [tpl]OldStyleDate|September 30|1895|September 18[/tpl], Vichuga – December 5, 1977) was a Russian career officer in the Red Army who was promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1943. He was the Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces and Deputy Minister of Defense during World War II, as well as Minister of Defense from 1949 to 1953. As the Chief of the General Staff, Vasilevsky was responsible for planning and coordinating almost all decisive Soviet offensives in World War II, from the Stalingrad counteroffensive to the assault on East Prussia and Königsberg.
Vasilevsky began his military career during World War I, earning the rank of captain by 1917. At the start of the October Revolution and the Civil War he was conscripted into the Red Army, taking part in the Polish-Soviet War. After the war, he quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a regimental commander by 1930. In this position, he showed great skill in organizing and training his troops. Vasilevsky's talent was noticed, and in 1931 he was appointed a member of the Directorate of Military Training. In 1937, following Stalin's Great Purge, he was promoted to General Staff officer.
At the start of the 1943 Soviet counteroffensive of World War II, Vasilevsky coordinated and executed the Red Army's offensive on the upper Don, in the Donbass, Crimea, Belarus and Baltic states, ending the war with the capture of Königsberg in April 1945. In July 1945, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of Soviet forces in the Far East, executing the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation and subsequently accepting Japan's surrender. After the war, he became the Soviet Defense Minister, a position he held until Stalin's death in 1953. With Nikita Khrushchev's rise, Vasilevsky began losing power and was eventually pensioned off. After his death, he was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in recognition of his past service and contributions to his nation.

The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 tributary of the Delaware River in northwestern New Jersey in the United States. It flows through the rural mountainous country of northwestern New Jersey. Part of it is a National Wild and Scenic River.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.rivers.gov/wsr-musconetcong.html |title= Musconetcong Wild and Scenic River, New Jersey |publisher= The Wild & Scenic Rivers Council  |accessdate= 22 October 2011[/tpl]
It rises out of Lake Hopatcong, on the border between Sussex and Morris counties. It flows through Lake Musconetcong, then flows southwest, past Stephensburg and New Hampton, passing south of Washington then along the southeastern side of the Pohatcong Mountain ridge. It joins the Delaware across from Riegelsville, Pennsylvania, approximately 10 mi (16 km) south of Phillipsburg. 
The river does not flow through any large population center and has been the site of relatively little industrial development throughout its history. In the 18th century, the surrounding hills were largely deforested as a source of charcoal for the iron industry in the surrounding region. The local industry declined by the middle of the 19th century after the building of the former Morris Canal, the course of which ran along the upper river, to bring coal from Pennsylvania to northern New Jersey. After the demise of the canal from the introduction of railroads in the late 19th century, the dam pools along the river that supplied the canal became the site of a popular summer cottage industry. Silted remnants of the pools, as well as the remnants of the canal itself, can still be seen along the river.
Human habitation in the Musconetcong Valley can be traced back approximately 12,000 years to the end of the last ice age. The Plenge Site along the lower river in Warren County was the first of only two major Paleo-Indian archaeological site excavations in New Jersey, and is considered one of the most significant in the northeastern United States.
Record flows of the river were recorded in 2011 as result of Hurricane Irene.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2011/09/hurricane_irene_causes_record.html |title=Hurricane Irene causes record flows in Musconetcong River at Bloomsbury |publisher=NJ.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21[/tpl]

[[Amagat's law]]
CATEGORIES: Gas laws, Gases

Amagat's law  or the Law of Partial Volumes of 1880 describes the behaviour and properties of mixtures of ideal (as well as some cases of non-ideal) gases. Of use in chemistry and thermodynamics, Amagat's law states that the extensive volume V = N·v of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of volumes Vi of the K component gases, if the temperature T and the pressure p remain the same:Amagat's law of additive volumes[tpl]cite book |first=A. |last=Bejan |title=Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2006 |isbn=0471677639 [/tpl]
This is the experimental expression of volume as an extensive quantity.  It is named after Emile Amagat.
Both Amagat's and Dalton's Laws predict the properties of gas mixtures.  Their predictions are the same for ideal gases.  However, for real (non-ideal) gases, the results differ.[tpl]cite book |first=J. H. |last=Noggle |title=Physical Chemistry |edition=3rd |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=0673523411 [/tpl]  Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures assumes that the gases in the mixture are non-interacting (with each other) and each gas independently applies its own pressure, the sum of which is the total pressure.  Amagat's Law assumes that the volumes of the component gases (again at the same temperature and pressure) are additive; the interactions of the different gases are the same as the average interactions of the components.
The interactions can be interpreted in terms of a second virial coefficient, B(T), for the mixture.  For two components, the second virial coefficient for the mixture can be expressed as:
where the subscripts refer to components 1 and 2, the X's are the mole fractions, and the B's are the second virial coefficients.  The cross term, B1,2, of the mixture is given by:
and
When the volumes of each component gas (same temperature and pressure) are very similar, then Amagat's law becomes mathematically equivalent to Vegard's law for solid mixtures.

Geranium robertianum, (syn. Robertiella robertiana) commonly known as Herb Robert, Red Robin, Death come quickly, Storksbill, Dove's Foot, Crow's Foot, or (in North America) Robert Geranium, is a common species of cranesbill in Europe, Asia, North America, and North Africa.
Geranium robertianum can grow at altitudes of up to [tpl]convert|1500|m|ft|0[/tpl]. It grows as an annual or biennial plant, producing small, pink, five-petalled flowers (about 1 cm in diameter) from April until the autumn. The leaves are fern-like, and the stems often reddish; the leaves too turn red at the end of the flowering season. The plant has little root structure.
In Great Britain is commonly found in hedgerows. It has been introduced into other temperate parts of the world, probably through its use as an ornamental plant, such as in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. In the state of Washington, it is known as Stinky Bob and classified as a noxious weed.[tpl]harv|WSNWCB|2005|p=8[/tpl][tpl]harv|WSNWCB|2007[/tpl]

Francisca Edwiges Neves Gonzaga ([tpl]IPA-pt|ʃiˈkiɲɐ ɡõˈzaɡɐ[/tpl]; October 17, 1847 Rio de Janeiro - February 28, 1935 Rio de Janeiro) was a Brazilian composer, pianist and conductor.
Chiquinha Gonzaga was born in Rio de Janeiro, from a mulatto mother and a wealthy white father – after she was born her father became a marshal. Her godfather was Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias and one of her best friends was the first lady of Brazil, Nair de Tefé.
She fought for the end of slavery in Brazil. Gonzaga received an education that would ordinarily have led her to be a “sinhazinha”, a respectful officer's daughter. She learned how to read, write, and do math, but also music, especially how to play the piano, a distinctive mark of a real lady.
In 1863, at age 16, Francisca married Jacinto do Amaral, a navy official, 8 years older than she was, who would not agree to allow Chiquinha to pursue a musical career. With the marriage not doing well, Chiquinha, after having her third baby, fled her husband and was “declared dead and of unpronounceable name”  by her father. She became the first woman in Brazil to obtain a legal divorce.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Chiquinha began to participate in balls and “chorões” reunions, normally reserved for men, where she met the flautist Joaquim Callado and started to play in his group, O Choro do Calado, being the first woman to play in this group. During this time she composed her first success, the polka Atraente, in 1877, “composed by the piano, as an improvisation, during a ‘choro’ meeting”. At that time, she was famous but highly criticized by the masculine society of her time.
Chiquinha was an active citizen, involved in all kinds of social movements that took place during her age in Brazil, such as the Abolition of Slavery and even the Republican movement. 
Chiquinha is most known for her works for the Carnival in Brazil, such as Ó Abre Alas, and theatrical works, as for example, the operettas Forrobodó and "Jurití".

[[Clasper]]

CATEGORIES: Fish anatomy, Insect anatomy, Reproduction in animals

In biology, a clasper is a male anatomical structure found in some groups of animals, used in mating.
Male cartilaginous fish have claspers formed from the posterior portion of their pelvic fin which serve as intromittent organs used to channel semen into the female's cloaca during mating. The act of mating in some fish including sharks usually includes one of the claspers raised to allow water into the siphon through a specific orifice.  The clasper is then inserted into the cloaca, where it opens like an umbrella to anchor its position. The siphon then begins to contract expelling water and sperm.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=clasper&language=english&sc=is |title=System glossary |work=FishBase |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Timetree of Life: Cartilaginous Fishes (Chondrichthyes) |last=Heinicke |first=Matthew P. |last2=Naylor |first2=Gavin J.

[[Fallen Angels (science fiction novel)]]

CATEGORIES: 1991 novels, Environmental fiction books, Novels by Larry Niven, Novels by Jerry Pournelle, Novels by Michael Flynn, Prometheus Award winning works, Literary collaborations, 1990s science fiction novels

Fallen Angels (1991) (ISBN 0-7434-3582-6) is a Prometheus Award-winning novel by science fiction authors Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and Michael Flynn published by Jim Baen. The novel was written as a tribute to science fiction fandom, and includes many of its well-known figures, legends, and practices.  It also champions modern technology and heaps scorn upon its critics - budget cutting politicians, fringe environmentalists and the forces of ignorance. An ebook of this text was among the first released by the Baen Free Library.
The novel takes aim at several targets of ridicule: Senator William Proxmire, radical environmentalists and mystics, such as one character who believes that one cannot freeze to death in the snow because ice is a crystal and "crystals are healing."  It also mocks ignorance in journalism, which greatly helps the main characters (for example, one "expert" cited in a news article believes that the astronauts must have superhuman strength, based on a photograph of a weightless astronaut easily handling heavy construction equipment) and the non-scientific world in general. Several real people are tuckerized into the book in a more positive light, including many fans who made donations to charity for that express purpose and a character called "RMS" (presumably Richard M. Stallman) who leads a network of hackers called the Legion of Doom, connected by a series of BBS systems.

[[Block party]]

CATEGORIES: Parties, Social phenomena

A block party or street party is a large public party in which many members of a single neighborhood congregate, either to observe an event of some importance or simply for mutual enjoyment.  The name comes from the form of the party, which often involves closing an entire city block to vehicle traffic.  Many times, there will be a celebration in the form of playing music and dance and activities like pony rides, inflatable slides, pop corn machines and BBQs. Block parties gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s. Block parties were often held outdoors and power for the DJ's sound system was taken illegally from street lights, as referenced in the song "South Bronx" by KRS-One.
Block parties are reported as a World War I innovation originating from the East Side of New York City, where an entire block was roped off and patriotic songs sung and a parade held to honor the members of that block who had gone off to war."Block Parties", The Outlook, 16 October 1918; reviewed 2008-09-20.Fiocco v. Carver, 234 NY 219 (1922) Traditionally, many inner city block parties were actually held illegally, because they did not file for an event permit from the local authorities. However, police turned a blind eye to them.
In the United States, block parties are commonly held on holidays such as Fourth of July or Labor Day. Some streets may have an annual block party.
Sometimes the occasion may be a theme such a "Welcome to the Neighborhood" for a new family or a recent popular movie. Often block parties involve barbecuing, lawn games such as Simon Says, karaoke, and group dancing such as the Electric Slide, the Macarena or line dancing. In many small towns, the local fire department may also participate in the party, bringing out trucks that they display for show.
In the United Kingdom, a street party is mainly a small private neighbours' event historically held to commemorate national events.

[[Nickel deposits of Finland]]

CATEGORIES: Geology of Finland, Economy of Finland, Mining in Finland, Nickel mines in Finland

The Finnish nickel deposits were found in the Petsamo area near the Barents Sea. Until the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947, this was the northernmost part of Finland. In 1934 it was estimated that the deposits contained over five million tons of nickel. In 1935, Canadian and French corporations began mining operations there.
The nickel deposits were a lesser known reason for Allied and German interest in the area during World War II, as potentially of great importance for production of arms and munitions. Both the planned Franco-British support of Finland in the Winter War, and German occupation of Denmark and Norway (Operation Weserübung) were partly motivated by control of the nickel mines.
During the period between the Winter War and the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, there were disputes between Finland and the Soviet Union over mining rights in Petsamo. Finland refused to allow the Soviet Union to mine nickel in Petsamo. This was one of the causes of hostility between the Soviet Union and Finland, which led to the Continuation War. As part of the German invasion, troops from Norway occupied the Petsamo region in 1941, securing the nickel supply.
The Continuation War ended in September 1944, with Finland's capitulation. Finland ceded Petsamo to the Soviet Union. All subsequent nickel production there has been under Soviet or Russian authority.

After New Zealand abolished its provinces in 1876, a system of counties similar to other countries' systems was instituted, lasting with little change (except mergers and other localised boundary adjustments) until 1989 when they were reorganised into District Councils within a system of larger Regions.
The "Counties Bill of 1876" was initiated to merge 314 road boards into 39 counties.  However as a result of lobbying the number of counties had grown to 63 by the time the bill was enacted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/provinces-and-provincial-districts/4|title=Abolition of the Provinces|work=An Encyclopedia of New Zealand|year=1966|accessdate= 18 Feb 2011[/tpl]

During the second half of the 20th century, many counties received overflow population from nearby cities. The result was often a merger of the two into a "district"  (e.g., Rotorua) or a change of name to "district'  (e.g., Waimairi) or "city"  (e.g.,  Manukau).
The Local Government Act 1974 began the process of bringing urban, mixed, and rural councils into the same legislative framework. Substantial reorganisations under that Act resulted in the 1989 shake-up, which covered the country in (non-overlapping) cities and districts and abolished all the counties except for the Chatham Islands County, which survived under that name for a further 6 years but then became a "Territory" under the "Chatham Islands Council".
The term is perpetuated in the name "Counties-Manukau", which refers to areas of South Auckland and the Franklin District and adjoining districts and is applied to bodies as diverse as football clubs and health providers.

The Bridges at Toko-Ri is a film from 1954 that was directed by Mark Robson and was based on the novel by James Michener about a U.S. Navy pilot assigned to bomb a group of heavily defended bridges during the Korean War. The story was made into a motion picture by Paramount Pictures.  [tpl]#tag:ref|Robson had earlier directed I Want You  (1951), also dealing with the Korean War.Crowther, Bosley. "The Screen in Review: Samuel Goldwyn's 'I Want You' opens run at Criterion; Script by Irwin Shaw." The New York Times,  December 24, 1951. Retrieved: August 30, 2013.|group=N[/tpl]
The Bridges at Toko-Ri closely follows the novel, emphasizing the lives of the pilots and crew in the context of a war that seems remote to all except those who fight in it. The film stars William Holden, Grace Kelly, Fredric March, Mickey Rooney, and  Robert Strauss, and it also contains early film roles by Dennis Weaver and Earl Holliman.
Michener based his novel on actual missions flown against the railroad bridges at Majon-niHarribine, YNCS Don. "The Bridges at Toko-Ri: The Real Story by Capt Paul N. Gray, USN, Ret,USNA '41, former CO of VF-54." uss-bennington.org.

"Articles: The Bridges at Toko-Ri." Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: August 30, 2013.
The pilot's rescue attempt at the climax of the novel and film was a composite of a pair of unrelated rescue attempts on February 8, 1952, both in the area of Wonsan, North Korea, with the second one involving a propeller-driven Douglas A-1 Skyraider from the Valley Forge that had been shot down while bombing the railroad bridges at Samdong-ni. However, though the shot-down aviators in the second attempt were initially listed as missing in action, they survived their ordeal, and they were captured by North Korean soldiers.Sears 2010, pp. 225–248.
In the attacks against the historical bridges, the McDonnell F2H Banshee  fighter-bombers (represented by Grumman F9F Panther) that are at the heart of the story did not bomb the bridges themselves, since they did not have the capability of carrying the heavy aerial bombs that were needed. Instead, they carried out the perilous mission of suppressing enemy anti-aircraft fire.Sisk, Richard. "Hollywood Captured Armstrong's Korean War Missions." Military.com News, 2012.

Tical is the debut solo album of American rapper, and Wu-Tang Clan member Method Man, released November 15, 1994, on Def Jam Records. It was the first Wu-Tang solo album released after the group's debut, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). Similar to all first generation solo Wu-Tang projects, Tical was mainly produced by group member RZA, who provided a dark, murky and rugged sound. The album features guest appearances from RZA, Raekwon, Inspectah Deck, as well as several affiliates who would later appear on future group projects. The album's title "Tical" is a slang term for a blunt that has been laced with an adulterant, typically a sweetener or another psychoactive substance. The album title is also a play on the word "methodical".
Tical was a commercial success, reaching number four on the Billboard 200, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. On January 18, 1995, the album was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and on July 13, 1995, it was certified platinum after sales of one million copies.[ref]
</ref> This success was driven by its two singles, "[[Bring the Pain]]" and "[[I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By]]". The album has since been hailed by several music critics as a classic hip hop album. Its success is matched by its influence as a major piece in the [[East Coast hip hop#The East Coast Renaissance .28early to mid.E2.80.931990s.29|East coast hip hop renaissance]].

At the death of her husband, she is about to be sacrificed by Hindu monks as a suttee at her husband's funeral pyre.Around the world in 80 days - Chapter XIII
At first, Fogg attempts simply to deliver her to relatives along the way on his trip.  However, when that proves impossible, she is their permanent companion who becomes more and more attracted to the intriguing and noble Fogg as she shares in the adventures.  When they finally reach Britain and appear to have arrived too late to meet the deadline, Aouda fears that she ruined Fogg by causing him delays in his journey, although he firmly denies she was a problem.  Now in love with the gentleman and also wishing to help him in his impoverishment, Aouda proposes to Fogg, and he joyously accepts. 
As it turns out, this gesture by Aouda saves the day for them all for it prompts Passeportout to discover that by traveling east, they inadvertently arrived in London a day early and now have just enough time to sprint to the Reform Club to win the wager.  The company sets off for the club and arrives just in time.
Afterward, Aouda offers to end the engagement since the original motivation has been removed.    However, Fogg, deeply in love and grateful for all Aouda is and has done for him, will not hear of it and they are happily married with Passepartout given the honor of giving her away at the wedding.

[[Songhai people]]

CATEGORIES: Songhai people

The Songhai (also Songhay or Sonrai) are west Africans who speak Songhai languages, the lingua franca of the Songhai Empire which dominated the western Sahel in the 15th and 16th century. The Songhai are found primarily throughout Mali in the Western sudanic region (not the country). The name Songhai is historically neither an ethnic nor a linguistic designation, but a name for the ruling caste of the Songhay Empire. Speakers in Mali have adopted it as an ethnic self-designationHeath, Jeffrey. 1999. A grammar of Koyraboro (Koroboro) Senni: the Songhay of Gao. Köln: Köppe. 402 pp but other Songhay-speaking groups identify themselves by other ethnic terms such as Zarma (or Djerma, the largest subgroup of the Songhai) or Isawaghen. The dialect of Koyraboro Senni spoken in Gao is unintelligible to speakers of the Zarma dialect of Niger, according to at least one report.Ethnologue report for Niger The Songhay languages are commonly taken to be Nilo-Saharan but this classification remains controversial: Dimmendaal (2008) believes that for now it is best considered an independent language family.Dimmendaal, Gerrit. 2008. Language Ecology and Linguistic Diversity on the African Continent. Language and Linguistics Compass 2(5): 843ff.
It was from one of Mali's former conquests, the kingdom of Gao, that the last major empire of the western Sudan emerged. Although the city of Gao had been occupied by a Songhai dynasty prior to being conquered by Mansa Musa's forces in 1325, it was not until much later that the Songhai empire emerged. The empire saw its pre-eminent rise under the military strategist and influential Songhai king, Sonni Ali Ber. It began its rise in 1468 when Sonni Ali conquered much of the weakening Mali empire's territory as well as Timbuktu, famous for its Islamic universities, and the pivotal trading city of Djenné. Among the country's most noted scholars was Ahmed Baba—a highly distinguished historian frequently quoted in the Tarikh al-Sudan and other works. The people consisted of mostly fishermen and traders. Following Sonni Ali's death, Muslim factions rebelled against his successor and installed Soninke general, Askia Muhammad (formerly Muhammad Toure) who was to be the first and most important ruler of the Askia dynasty (1492–1592). Under the Askias, the Songhai empire reached its zenith.BBC World Service - Songhay
Following Askia Muhammad, the empire began to collapse. It was enormous and could not be kept under control. The kingdom of Morocco saw Songhay's still flourishing salt and gold trade and decided that it would be a good asset. 
The Dendi people are a subgroup of the Songhai.

[[Wey and Arun Canal]]

CATEGORIES: Canals in West Sussex, Canals in Surrey, Visitor attractions in Surrey

The Wey and Arun Canal is a partially restored, 23-mile-long (37 km) canal in the south east of England.  It runs southwards from the River Wey at Shalford, Surrey to the River Arun at Pallingham, in West Sussex.  The canal comprises parts of two separate undertakings – the northern part of the Arun Navigation, between Pallingham and Newbridge Wharf, which opened in 1787, and the Wey and Arun Junction Canal, which connected the Arun at Newbridge to the Godalming Navigation near Shalford, south of Guildford, opened in 1816. The canal was built with 26 locks.
Passing through a rural landscape, there was little freight traffic to justify its continued existence, and the canal was officially abandoned in 1871.
Without maintenance, the canal gradually became derelict over much of its length.  However, since 1970, active restoration by The Wey & Arun Canal Trust has resulted in several miles of the waterway being restored to navigable standard.  Work is continuing, with the ultimate aim of re-opening the entire canal to navigation.

[[Pole star]]
CATEGORIES: Navigation, Stars, Pole stars

A pole star is a visible star, preferably a prominent one, that is approximately aligned with the Earth's axis of rotation; that is, a star whose apparent position is close to one of the celestial poles, and which lies approximately directly overhead when viewed from the Earth's North Pole or South Pole. A similar concept also applies to other planets than the Earth. In practice, the term pole star usually refers to Polaris, which is the current northern pole star, also known as the North Star.
The south celestial pole currently lacks a bright star like Polaris to mark its position. At present, the naked-eye star nearest to this imaginary point is the faint Sigma Octantis, which is sometimes known as the South Star.
While other stars' apparent positions in the sky change throughout the night, as they appear to rotate around the celestial poles, pole stars' apparent positions remain virtually fixed. This makes them especially useful in celestial navigation: they are a dependable indicator of the direction toward the respective geographic pole although not exact; they are virtually fixed, and their angle of elevation can also be used to determine latitude.
The identity of the pole stars gradually changes over time because the celestial poles exhibit a slow continuous drift through the star field. The primary reason for this is the precession of the Earth's rotational axis, which causes its orientation to change over time. If the stars were fixed in space, precession would cause the celestial poles to trace out imaginary circles on the celestial sphere approximately once every 26,000 years, passing close to different stars at different times. However, the stars themselves also exhibit proper motion, and this motion is another cause of the apparent drift of pole stars.

[[Persistence of a number]]
CATEGORIES: Number theory

In mathematics, the persistence of a number is the number of times one must apply a given operation to an integer before reaching a fixed point at which the operation no longer alters the number.
Usually, this involves additive or multiplicative persistence of an integer, which is how often one has to replace the number by the sum or product of its digits until one reaches a single digit. Because the numbers are broken down into their digits, the additive or multiplicative persistence depends on the radix. In the remaining article, base ten is assumed.
The single-digit final state reached in the process of calculating an integer's additive persistence is its digital root. Put another way, a number's additive persistence is the measure of how many times we must sum the digits it takes us to arrive at its digital root.

The Galton Laboratory, was a laboratory for research into eugenics and then into human genetics based at University College London in London, England. It was originally established in 1904, and became part of UCL's biology department in 1996.
The ancestor of the Galton Laboratory was the Eugenics Record Office founded by Francis Galton in 1904. In 1907 the Office was reconstituted as the Galton Eugenics Laboratory as part of UCL and under the direction of Karl Pearson the Professor of Applied Mathematics.[tpl]cite journal|author=Magnello, M. E.|title=The Non-correlation of Biometrics and Eugenics: Rival Forms of Laboratory Work in Karl Pearson’s Career at University College London, (In two Parts)|journal=History of Science|volume=37|pages=79–106; 125–150|year=1999[/tpl] Galton financed the Laboratory and on his death left UCL enough money to create a chair in National Eugenics which Pearson filled. The Laboratory published a series of memoirs and in 1925 Pearson created the Annals of Eugenics, which continues as the Annals of Human Genetics. The journal has always been edited at the Galton. Pearson was succeeded as Galton Professor by R. A. Fisher in 1934. The post-war Galton Professors were Lionel Penrose up to 1965, Harry Harris to 1976 and Bette Robson until 1994. J.B.S. Haldane held the Chair of Biometry here and was succeeded by C.A.B. Smith. The Galton Laboratory became part of the Department of Biology in UCL in 1996. MRC Human Biochemical Genetics Unit was established by Harris in 1962. He was Hon. Director until he went to Philadelphia in 1976, and the Unit continued under the direction of David Hopkinson until its closure in October 2000.

[[Catenation]]

CATEGORIES: Organic chemistry, Inorganic chemistry

Catenation is the linkage of atoms of the same element into longer chains. Catenation occurs most readily in carbon, which forms covalent bonds with other carbon atoms to form longer chains and structures. This is the reason for the presence of the vast number of organic compounds in nature. Carbon is most well known for its properties of catenation, with organic chemistry essentially being the study of catenated carbon structures (otherwise known as catenae). However, carbon is by no means the only element capable of forming such catenae, and several other main group elements are capable of forming an expansive range of catenae, including silicon, sulfur and boron.
The ability of an element to catenate is primarily based on the bond energy of the element to itself, which decreases with more diffuse orbitals (those with higher azimuthal quantum number) overlapping to form the bond.  Hence, carbon, with the least diffuse valence shell p orbital is capable of forming longer p-p sigma bonded chains of atoms than heavier elements which bond via higher valence shell orbitals.  Catenation ability is also influenced by a range of steric and electronic factors, including the electronegativity of the element in question, the molecular orbital hybridization and the ability to form different kinds of covalent bonds. For carbon, the sigma overlap between adjacent atoms is sufficiently strong that perfectly stable chains can be formed. With other elements this was once thought to be extremely difficult in spite of plenty of evidence to the contrary. 
The versatile chemistry of elemental sulfur is largely due to catenation. In the native state, sulfur exists as S8 molecules. On heating these rings open and link together giving rise to increasingly long chains, as evidenced by the progressive increase in viscosity as the chains lengthen. Selenium and tellurium also show variants of these structural motifs.
Silicon can form sigma bonds to other silicon atoms and (disilane is the parent of this class of compounds). However, it is difficult to prepare and isolate SinH2n+2 (analogous to the saturated alkane hydrocarbons) with n greater than about 8, as their thermal stability decreases with increases in the number of silicon atoms.  Silanes higher in molecular weight than disilane decompose to polymeric polysilicon hydride and hydrogen.W. W. Porterfield, Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach, 2nd Ed.", Academic Press (1993), p. 219.Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, John Wiley & Sons (2001) p. 844.  But with a suitable pair of organic substituents in place of hydrogen on each silicon it is possible to prepare polysilanes (sometimes, erroneously called polysilenes) that are analogues of alkanes. These long chain compounds have surprising electronic properties - high electrical conductivity, for example - arising from sigma delocalization of the electrons in the chain.[tpl]cite doi|10.1021/cr00096a006[/tpl]
Phosphorus chains (with organic substituents) have been prepared, although these tend to be quite fragile. Small rings or clusters are more common.
Even silicon–silicon pi bonds are possible. However, these bonds are less stable than the carbon analogues. Disilane is quite reactive compared to ethane. Disilylenes are quite rare, unlike alkenes. Examples of disilynes, long thought to be too unstable to be isolated[tpl]cite journal| journal= Silicon Chemistry |volume= 1 |issue= 1|date=January 2002 |pages= 59–65 |author= Karni, M.; Apeloig, Y. |title= The quest for a stable silyne, RSi≡CR′.

http://people.ok.ubc.ca/wsmcneil/339/Sci2004.pdf[/ref]
In recent years a variety of double and triple bonds between the semi-metallic elements have been reported, including silicon, germanium, arsenic, bismuth and so on. The ability of certain main group elements to catenate is currently the subject of research into inorganic polymers.

Loch Leven extends [tpl]convert|8+3/4|mi|km[/tpl], varying in width between [tpl]convert|220|yd|m[/tpl] and just over a [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl]. It opens onto Camus a' Chois at North Ballachulish, part of Loch Linnhe at its western end.

The burial place of the MacDonald clan of Glencoe lies on an island - Eilean Munde, St.Munda's or St Munn's or Saint Fintan Munnu's Island, opposite the village. The island burial place was also shared by the Camerons of Callart, on the north shore of the loch, the Stewarts of Ballachulish and Appin and other local families.Tombstone Inscriptions on the Burial Isle of St. Munda (Eilean Munde) on Loch Leven recorded by Alexander MacDonald, 2002 and 2003, for the Glencoe Heritage Trust Ltd.
The village of Kinlochleven at the head of the loch was established when the aluminium smelter was built there during the first decade of the twentieth century. It was originally the hamlets of Kinlochmore (Inverness-shire) and Kinlochbeg (Argyll) either side of the River Leven.

Under the Ballachulish Bridge, at the entrance to the loch, is the narrows Caolas Mhic Phàdraig. The settlements either side are North and South Ballachulish - Baile a' Chaolais (the settlement on the narrows). There is a fast tidal stream through the narrows, running at up to seven knots at springs; it is wise, therefore, to time any passage through the narrows with the tides. Further up the loch, there are several other narrows - principally Caolas na Con - with significant, but diminishing tidal streams. The loch is navigable as far as Kinlochleven, and was used by ships bringing alumina to the smelter there until its closure.

Uppingham School is a co-educational independent school situated in the small market town of Uppingham in Rutland, England. The school was founded in 1584 by Robert Johnson, the Archdeacon of Leicester who also established Oakham School.
The school's current Headmaster, Richard Harman M.A., is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the school is a member of the Rugby Group of independent schools in the United Kingdom.
The Reverend Edward Thring (headmaster 1853–1887) was perhaps the school's best-known headmaster. His changes to the school's curriculum were later adopted in other English public schools. During his headship the school moved temporarily to Borth in Wales after an outbreak of typhoid ravaged the town. The move to Borth is commemorated in an annual service, held in the school chapel.
John Wolfenden, headmaster from 1934–1944, was notable for later chairing the Wolfenden Committee whose report recommending the decriminalisation of homosexuality, was published in 1957.
Uppingham has a tradition of high musical standards, based on the work of Paul David and Robert Sterndale Bennett and has opened a new music school, a fusion of new and old buildings named after the first Director of Music, Paul David. The current Director of Music is Stephen Williams.
Uppingham has the greatest area of playing fields of any school in England, in three separate areas on different sides of the town: the Leicester to the West, the Middle to the South, and the Upper to the East.I Never Knew That About England, by Christopher Winn, Ebury Press, 2005

The Quintinshill rail disaster occurred on 22 May 1915 in Scotland near Gretna Green at Quintinshill, an intermediate signal box with loops on each side on the Caledonian Railway Main Line linking Glasgow and Carlisle (now part of the West Coast Main Line).
The crash, which involved five trains, killed a probable 226[tpl]#tag:ref|This total comprises 214 soldiers on the troop train, 9 passengers from the two passenger trains and three railway employees.

The precise number of dead was never established with confidence as the roll list of the regiment was destroyed by the fire.[tpl]sfn|Druitt|1915|p=26[/tpl]
The crash occurred when a troop train travelling from [tpl]stnlnk|Larbert[/tpl] to Liverpool[tpl]sfn|Rolt|1982|p=208[/tpl] collided with a local passenger train that had been shunted on to the main line, to then be hit by an express train to Glasgow which crashed into the wreckage a minute later. Gas from the lighting system of the old wooden carriages of the troop train ignited, starting a fire which soon engulfed the three passenger trains and also two goods trains standing on nearby passing loops. A number of bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and the bodies that were recovered were buried together in a mass grave in Edinburgh's Rosebank Cemetery. Four bodies, believed to be of children, were never identified or claimed and are buried in the Western Necropolis, Glasgow.
The cause of the accident was poor working practices on the part of the two signalmen involved, which resulted in their imprisonment for culpable homicide after legal proceedings in both Scotland and England.
A memorial to the dead soldiers was erected soon after the accident and there are a number of more recent memorials at various locations. An annual remembrance service is held at Rosebank Cemetery.

[[Botswana National Front]]
CATEGORIES: Political parties in Botswana, Socialist International

The Botswana National Front (or BNF) has been the main opposition party in Botswana since the 1969 elections. 
It achieved its greatest electoral success in the 1994 elections, when it won 37.1% of the vote and 13 of 40 parliamentary seats. A factional conflict in 1998 led to the departure of 11 of these MPs, who then founded the Botswana Congress Party (BCP). In the 1999 elections, the BNF's vote share declined to 26% and it won 6 parliamentary seats. In the 2004 general election the party won 26.1% of the popular vote and 12 out of 57 seats. Its representation was sharply reduced in the 2009 elections, with the party reduced to only six seats in the National Assembly of Botswana. The BNF's parliamentary representation fell to 5 seats following the defection of the party's former Vice President, Olebile Gaborone, to the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) in July 2010. 
The BNF was founded in 1965, shortly after the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP)'s landslide victory in the self-government elections and just before Botswana gained independence. The initial goal of the BNF was to reunite the various strands of the Botswana People's Party, which had experienced a split in 1963–1964, and others opposed to the BDP. In 1969, Bathoen Gaseitsiwe resigned from his state-recognized position as chief of the Bangwaketse (a group in Southern Botswana) and joined the BNF. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the BNF was a loose alliance between conservative tribal leaders concerned with the preservation of traditional authority, led by Bathoen Gaseitsiwe, and socialists, led by Kenneth Koma, concerned over the bourgeois policies of the government. The first time that the party had been represented nationally was in 1969 when they won three seats in the Ngwaketse region. 
The BNF was largely a regional party associated with the Ngwaketse region in the 1970s, but it gradually gained support in other parts of the country. In the 1984 general elections, the BNF gained control of the Gaborone City Council and other urban councils; it also won five of 34 parliamentary seats. In 1994, 13 BNF candidates were elected as members of the National Assembly (out of 40 total). Prior to the elections, the party redefined itself in terms of the ideology of social democracy. It is an observer member of the Socialist International. By 1994 the party had adopted the motto "Time for change". The electoral success and change of motto largely reflected decreased standard of living, civil unrest and rising levels of AIDS in the country. 
There have been a number of internal squabbles in the party due largely to factionalism. This has led to the splitting of the party a number of times and the formation of splinter parties whose political ideologies are not appreciably different from that of the BNF. Several splinter parties formed in 1989 and 1994, but the most serious split occurred in 1998 when a dispute over Kenneth Koma's leadership resulted in the departure of the majority of the party's parliamentary wing (11 of 13 MPs) and the formation of the Botswana Congress Party (BCP). The split followed an aborted BNF party congress, dissolution of the central committee by Koma, and a bitter court case. In 2003, ongoing factional conflict prompted the BNF's founder, Kenneth Koma, to form the New Democratic Front. Of these splinter parties, the BCP has gained the most popular support. 
In elections in 1999 and 2004, vote-splitting between the BNF and the BCP reduced the parliamentary representation of both the BNF and the opposition as a whole. The BNF retained only 6 of its 13 parliamentary seats in 1999 and the BCP won only one seat. An increase in the number of constituencies from 40 to 57 allowed the BNF to win 12 seats in 2009 despite no meaningful change in its vote share. The BCP did not benefit from the expansion of seats and again won only one seat. 
Until July 2010, the party was led by Otsweletse Moupo. Moupo himself has emphasized the need to help the poor escape from poverty. Moupo experienced a number of public embarrassments in 2006 that led to serious and mounting challenges from within the party.http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20060615&i=Moupo_dismisses_allegationshttp://www.mmegi.bw/2006/October/Thursday12/81357110320.htmlhttp://www.mmegi.bw/2006/June/Friday2/4133655491.html http://www.mmegi.bw/2006/October/Thursday12/813571101991.html Moupo's leadership was reaffirmed at a special party congress in 2007, but his opponents continued to challenge his leadership. In 2008 and 2009, the BNF suspended or expelled several prominent members, including several of its parliamentary representatives, and fought several court battles related to primary elections. 
In the 2009 elections, several former members of the BNF ran as independent candidates, referring to themselves as the Temporary Platform. The BNF suffered significant losses; it won six seats. The BCP formed an electoral pact with the Botswana Alliance Movement and the NDF and increased its representation from one seat to five. Vote-splitting continues to be a problem in that the BDP often wins seats when all three parties are competitive. This occurs most often in urban areas. But the BDP also took seats from the BNF in rural constituencies where the BCP did not have a candidate.
Otsweletse Moupo decided that he would not defend his position as party president and Duma Boko was elected as the new party president in July 2010. In 2013 congress that will be held in Gantsi, Comrade Monang will challenge Comrade Boko in what seems to be a David vs Goliath war.

[[Wizard (software)]]
CATEGORIES: Computer configuration, User interface techniques

Originally derived from the term "Windowed Interactive Setup Assistance Dialog" (WISAD), a software wizard or setup assistant is a user interface type that presents a user with a sequence of dialog boxes that lead the user through a series of well-defined steps. Tasks that are complex, infrequently performed, or unfamiliar may be easier to perform using a wizard. In contrast, an expert system guides a user through a series of (usually yes/no) questions to solve a problem.
By 2001, wizards had become commonplace in most consumer-oriented operating systems, although not always under the name "wizard". In Mac OS X, for example, they are called "assistants"; some examples include the "Setup Assistant", which is run at initial bootup of the Macintosh, and the "Network Setup Assistant", which has a similar function to the MS-Windows "New Connection Wizard". GNOME refers to its wizards as "assistants".
Many web applications, for instance online booking sites, make use of the wizard paradigm to complete lengthy interactive processes, sometimes becoming similar to automated online assistants. Oracle Designer also uses wizards extensively. 
The use of wizards is controversial among user interface designers[tpl]who|date=October 2011[/tpl] because wizards encourage modal windows, which their opponents consider antithetical to proper human interface design.[tpl]why|date=January 2014[/tpl] [tpl]fact|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications (Version 3.0) urges technical writers to refer to these assistants as "wizards" and to use lowercase letters. In countries where the concept of wizard does not convey the idea of helpfulness or is offensive (via the suggestion that actual magic is being used),[tpl]cite web|url=http://notalwaysright.com/likely-not-a-fan-of-spell-checking/8474|title=Likely Not A Fan Of Spell Checking|date=November 15, 2010|work=Not Always Right|publisher=NotAlwaysRight.com|accessdate=31 December 2010|location=Brisbane, Australia|quote=When I tried to install a program on it, it said it was starting a wizard.

[[Monte Carlo algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Randomized algorithms

In computing, a Monte Carlo algorithm is a randomized algorithm whose running time is deterministic, but whose output may be incorrect with a certain (typically small) probability.
The related class of Las Vegas algorithms is also randomized, but in a different way: they take an amount of time that varies randomly, but always produce the correct answer. A Monte Carlo algorithm can be converted into a Las Vegas algorithm whenever there exists a procedure to verify that the output produced by the algorithm is indeed correct. If so, then the resulting Las Vegas algorithm is merely to repeatedly run the Monte Carlo algorithm until one of the runs produces an output that can be verified to be correct.
The name refers to the grand casino in the Principality of Monaco at Monte Carlo, which is well-known around the world as an icon of gambling.

[[Kate Greenaway Medal]]

CATEGORIES: Kate Greenaway Medal, Awards established in 1955, 1955 establishments in the United Kingdom

The Kate Greenaway Medal is a British literary award that annually recognises "distinguished illustration in a book for children". It is conferred upon the illustrator by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) which inherited it from the Library Association.
The Medal is named after the 19th-century English illustrator of children's books Kate Greenaway (1846–1901). It was established in 1955 and inaugurated next year for 1955 publications, but no work was considered suitable. The first Medal was awarded in 1957 to Edward Ardizzone for Tim All Alone (Oxford, 1956), which he also wrote. That first Medal was dated 1956. Only since 2007 the Medal is dated by its presentation during the year following publication. The Greenaway is a companion to the Carnegie Medal which recognises one outstanding work of writing for children and young adults (conferred upon the author).
Nominated books must be first published in the U.K. during the preceding school year (September to August), with English-language text if any.
The award by CILIP is a gold Medal and £500 worth of books donated to the illustrator's chosen library. Since 2000 there is also a £5000 cash prize from a bequest by the children's book collector Colin Mears.

The Associação Académica de Coimbra – Organismo Autónomo de Futebol (A.A.C. – O.A.F.), also referred to as Académica de Coimbra ([tpl]IPA-pt|ɐkɐˈðɛmikɐ ðɨ kuˈĩbɾɐ[/tpl]) or simply Académica, is an autonomous and professional football organization based in Coimbra, Portugal.
The team was created inside of the students' union of the University of Coimbra – the Associação Académica de Coimbra, during a period of changing in the 1970s and 1980s, when football was professionalized in Portugal. But its foundation as a students amateur sports association backs to 1876, so it is effectively one of the oldest sports institutions in Portugal. The club is claimed by its fans to be the fourth in number of supporters (after Benfica, Sporting Clube de Portugal and FC Porto). It is a sports club emotionally and historically related to the university life, so through generations, many students, even those born in farther regions, became lifelong supporters of the team. In general, much of the city's population identifies itself as Académicas' fans or sympathisers. The main football team uses the Estádio Cidade de Coimbra (specially rebuilt and modernized for the UEFA Euro 2004) with 30,000 seats. The Associação Académica de Coimbra, the mother institution of the professionalized A.A.C. – O.A.F. autonomous football organisation, has several sports branches performing under the same AAC logo and using the same black colors, being effectively one of the largest sports clubs of Portugal. The Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F. has also a futsal department (Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F. (futsal)). In 1938–39, the football team won their first Portuguese Football Cup, the first under the tournament's current name and a feat they would repeat in 2011–12. In 1966–67, they achieved their highest position of runner-up in the Primeira Liga table. In the 2012–2013 season, Académica qualified for the group stage of the Europa League for the first time.

Myrmica rubra, also known as the European fire ant or common red ant, is a species of ant of the genus Myrmica, found all over Europe and in some parts of North America and Asia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/ants/Myrmica_ruba.htm|title=European fire ant|publisher=University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences |work=Featured Creatures |accessdate=2008-06-25[/tpl] They are mainly red in colour, with slightly darker pigmentation on the head. The ants live under stones, fallen trees, and in  soil. They are aggressive ants, often attacking rather than running away, and are equipped with a stinger, though lack the ability to spray formic acid like the genus Formica.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=1014&fr=1&sts=|title=Myrmica rubra (insect)|publisher=issg.org|accessdate=2008-06-25[/tpl]

Their colonies have a polygyne form, and can have up to one hundred queens per nest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://antnest.co.uk/species2.html|title=Species of ant|publisher=antnest.co.uk| accessdate=2008-06-25[/tpl] They are also polydomous, with many nest sites per individual colony. These queens will have gathered together after their nuptial flight and will have formed a nest and laid their eggs in it. The queens can live up to fifteen years. Nuptial flights take place normally in late July to mid-August in Europe. Hundreds of young queens and males take to the air to mate together. Afterwards, the males die and the queens shed their wings to make a new colony. No nuptial flights have  been witnessed yet from this species where it is living in North America.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] 
They are very common in Europe and live in meadows and gardens. They live on a diet of honeydew excreted by aphids, and, being very aggressive like to eat many types of insect and other invertebrates. They will attack any creature that disturbs their nest, but are not as aggressive as the red imported fire ant.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] They also consume pollen, a phenomenon rarely documented in ants of the temperal zone.[tpl]cite journal|title= Rubbish dumps reveal the diet of ant colonies: Myrmica schencki Em. and Myrmica rubra (L.)

Cyril Jackson (5 December 1903 – February 1988) was a South African astronomer.
He was born in Ossett, Yorkshire in England, but his father emigrated to South Africa in 1911.
He worked at Union Observatory in Johannesburg from 1928 to 1947 (IAU code 078, previously known as Transvaal Observatory and later known as Republic Observatory). He served with South African forces in the second world war, and was mentioned in despatches. After the war he was director of the Yale-Columbia Southern Observatory (YCSO) station in Johannesburg (IAU code 077), which had been established by Yale University in the 1920s.The Yale Southern Observatory, Inc Columbia University subsequently collaborated in that venture and the operation became known as the Yale-Columbia Southern Observatory (YCSO, Inc. was formally created in 1962). Due to light pollution that observatory had to be shut down in 1951 and he supervised the move of its instrument, a 26-inch refracting telescope, to Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia (IAU code 414). This Yale-Columbia telescope was given to the Australian National University in July 1963, and was destroyed in the 18 January 2003 firestorm that devastated Mount Stromlo.
Jackson worked at Mount Stromlo from 1957 to 1963. In 1963, Yale reopened its Columbia Southern Observatory at El Leoncito, Argentina (IAU code 808), and he served as its director there until 1966, when he retired.
He discovered a number of comets, including the periodic comets 47P/Ashbrook-Jackson and 58P/Jackson-Neujmin.
He also discovered a number of asteroids and minor planets in the earlier part of his career at Union Observatory.

Gordon Richard Coventry (25 September 1901 – 7 November 1968) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Collingwood Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Accorded "Legend" status in the Australian Football Hall of Fame, Coventry was the first player to kick 100 goals in a season and over 1000 goals overall, with his career total of 1299 goals serving as a league record for over 60 seasons.
Originally from Diamond Creek, Victoria, Coventry played his early football for the Diamond Creek Football Club in the Heidelberg District Football League (HDFL). He debuted for Collingwood in 1920, and was joined by his brother, Syd Coventry, at the club two years later. Playing almost exclusively at full-forward, Coventry first led Collingwood's goalkicking in 1922, and would go on to lead the club's goalkicking for 16 consecutive seasons, until his retirement in 1937. He also led the VFL's goalkicking on a record six occasions, from 1926 to 1930, and again in his final season. In 1929, Coventry kicked 124 goals for the season, becoming the first player in the league to kick over 100 goals in a season, a feat which he would replicate in 1930, 1933, and 1934. Considered the leading forward in the competition in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Coventry played a key part in Collingwood's four consecutive premierships from 1927 to 1930, each captained by his brother. He also went on to win the Copeland Trophy as Collingwood's best and fairest player in 1933. At his retirement at the end of the 1937 season, Coventry held the records for the most career games played and the most career goals kicked, finishing with 1299 goals from 306 games, and thus also becoming the first player to play 300 games. An inaugural inductee into the Australian Football Hall of Fame, and a member of Collingwood's Team of the Century, his career goalkicking record was not broken until 1999, when it was surpassed by Tony Lockett.

Corn Pops is a breakfast cereal made by Kellogg's, described by the company as "crunchy sweetened popped-up corn cereal." Originally called Sugar Pops, it was introduced in 1951 as the sponsor for "The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok" radio show.  The name was changed to Sugar Corn Pops in 1978, and finally to Corn Pops in 1984, a time when many cereals dropped the word "Sugar" from their titles. In January 2006, the name of the cereal was changed to Pops, but after a few months of poor reception, was changed back to Corn Pops. Sometimes, this cereal is just referred to as Pops.
In mid-2007, Corn Pops launched its first line extension in many years called "Chocolate Peanut Butter Pops."  In 2012, "Cinnamon Corn Pops" were introduced.

The Titfield Thunderbolt is a 1953 British comedy film about a group of villagers trying to keep their branch line operating after British Railways decided to close it. The film was written by T.E.B. Clarke and was inspired by the restoration of the narrow gauge Talyllyn Railway in Wales, the world's first heritage railway run by volunteers.
It starred Stanley Holloway, George Relph and John Gregson, and was directed by Charles Crichton. Michael Truman was the producer. The film was produced by Ealing Studios. It was the first Ealing comedy shot in Technicolor and one of the first colour comedies made in the UK.
There was considerable inspiration from the book Railway Adventure by established railway book author L. T. C. Rolt, published in 1952. Rolt had acted as honorary manager for the volunteer enthusiasts running the Talyllyn Railway for the two years 1951-52. A number of scenes in the film, such as the emergency re-supply of water to the locomotive by buckets from an adjacent stream, or passengers being asked to assist in pushing the carriages, were taken from this book.

HMS ''Hogue'' (D74) was a Battle-class destroyer of the Royal Navy that was commissioned during the Second World War. She was named after the Battle of La Hogue, fought between the British and French in 1692. 
Hogue was built at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead during the Second World and launched on 21 April 1944. After being commissioned on 24 July 1945, Hogue joined the 19th Destroyer Flotilla of the British Pacific Fleet.Mason, Geoffrey B. (2004), Service History of Royal Navy warships in World War 2: HMS HOGUE (H.74) - Battle-class Destroyer, naval-history.net. Retrieved 31 August 2010. She remained on station until withdrawn from service in 1947 and placed in reserve.
Selected for modernisation and refitted, Hogue returned to service in 1957 with the 1st Destroyer Squadron in  the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. With sister-ships Lagos and Solebay, Hogue patrolled the waters around Iceland.Yuletide Fare in "Drop" by Shackletons, The Glasgow Herald, 22 December 1958, p. 2 She operated against the Icelandic Coast Guard during the First Cod War.

[[Denbigh]]

CATEGORIES: Denbigh

Denbigh ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|n|b|i[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-cy|Dinbych[/tpl]) is a market town and community in Denbighshire, Wales. Before 1888, it was the county town of Denbighshire. Denbigh lies 8 miles to the north west of Ruthin and to the south of St Asaph. It is about 13 miles (20 km) from the seaside resort of Rhyl. The town grew around the glove-making industry. Its population at the 2001 Census was 8,783.[tpl]cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=801617&c=denbigh&d=16&e=15&g=414019&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1196446936343&enc=1&dsFamilyId=779|title=2001 Census: Denbigh (Parish)|work=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=30 November 2007[/tpl]
The first borough charter was granted to Denbigh in 1290, when the town was still contained within the old town walls. It was the centre of the Marcher Lordship of Denbigh. The town was involved in the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294-95; the castle was captured in the autumn, and on 11 November 1294 a relieving force was defeated by the Welsh rebels. The town was recaptured by Edward I in December.  Denbigh was also burnt in 1400 during the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr.
During the Wars of the Roses, the town was largely destroyed, subsequently moving from the hilltop to the area of the present town market.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/projects/denbigh/town.htm|title=Denbigh, Clwyd, Wales|accessdate=30 November 2007[/tpl]
In 1643, Denbigh became a refuge for a Royalist garrison during the English Civil War. Surrendering in 1646, the castle and town walls eventually fell into ruin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denbigh.com/|title=Welcome to Denbigh|accessdate=30 November 2007[/tpl]
Notable buildings in Denbigh include Denbigh Castle, the town walls begun in 1282 including the Burgess Gate and Leicester's Church. This is an unfinished church begun in 1579 by Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, who was also Baron of Denbigh. It was planned as a cathedral with the title of city to be transferred from neighbouring St. Asaph. The project ran out of money and the grounds now lie derelict.
Other attractions in the town include a library and museum. Denbigh Boxing Club is located on Middle Lane.
Denbigh was once served by a railway station on the former London and North Western Railway, later part of the LMS. The "Vale of Clwyd" line leading north to St. Asaph and Rhyl closed in 1955, leaving Denbigh on a lengthy branch running from Chester via Mold and Denbigh to Ruthin, which closed in 1962. A southern continuation beyond Ruthin linking up with the Great Western Railway at Corwen had closed in 1952. The platform of Denbigh station can still be seen beside the road leading to the Kwik Save store.
Denbigh hosted the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1882, 1939, 2001 and 2013.
At one time the majority of the population sought employment at the North Wales Hospital, which cared for people with psychiatric illnesses. The hospital closed in the late 1990s.
Denbigh Cricket Club is one of the oldest cricket clubs in Wales having been established in 1844. The club plays at the Ystrad Road ground and plays in the North Wales Cricket League. The 1st XI play in the Premier Division having won the Division 1 championship in 2010 with the 2nd XI in Division 3.
For over 50 years, a barrel rolling competition is held on Boxing Day in the town square.
Just outside Denbigh to the north west, adjoining Denbigh Golf Club and the Tarmac Quarry, is the historic and ancient deciduous woodland of Crêst. This woodland is endangered due to environmental pressure and competing land use in the area.

Fitch was born in Utica, New York. When he was a year old, the family moved to Medford in the Rogue Valley in Oregon. Growing up, he had a keen interest in all the reptiles he could find on his father's 116 acre (0.5 km²) ranch. He recounts that he especially liked snakes, because "the real bonus was in seeing horrified adults scatter."
In 1926, he enrolled at the University of Oregon, but switched to UC Berkeley for his graduate work. He obtained his M.A. in 1933 and a Ph.D. in zoology in 1937. From 1938 to 1947, he worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as a field biologist in the department of pest control, studying rodents such as squirrels, gophers, and kangaroo rats.
He served from 1941 to 1945 in the Medical Corps as an army pharmacist, stationed initially in the United Kingdom, then France, and finally in Germany. In 1946, he married Virginia Ruby Preston, with whom he had three children. In 1948, Fitch accepted a position as Superintendent of the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation and instructor of zoology, where he could again pursue his studies of snakes and lizards. He became assistant professor in 1949 and full professor in 1958.
From 1965 on, he did extensive field work in Costa Rica, Mexico, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic. In 1976, he took up field work in Nicaragua and succeeded in getting a five-year-plan for Ctenosaura conservation, which was instituted in the 1980s. He retired in 1980, but was still an active herpetologist as of 2006, collecting snakes and publishing papers.
On September 8, 2009 he died in the home of his daughter and son-in-law in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

[[Kendray]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in South Yorkshire, Geography of Barnsley

Kendray is a village in the S70 postal district of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England that lies between Sheffield Road and Doncaster Road, both of which lead out of/ into Barnsley town centre.
Kendray is one of the economically poorer areas of Barnsley, with problems similar to those of Grimethorpe.  Just under half of the old housing in Kendray has been demolished and replaced with fields, large recreational areas and modern housing.  An amphitheatre and playground has been built on one of the old sites, and new housing is being constructed on the other remaining sites. There are also plans to build a leisure centre nearby.
Recent regeneration has seen new housing replacing old and unusable housing, turning it into a more modern estate. Continued building is ongoing (2007/08). Current amenities and services available include a play area in the centre, local shopping, a post office, medical centre, schooling for juniors and a football ground with numerous artificial pitches available.
Lying within two miles of Barnsley town centre and with easy access to the Trans Pennine Trail and M1 motorway, Kendray is becoming a popular location for the average family.

[[Learning economy]]
CATEGORIES: Business terms, Economies, Information, knowledge, and uncertainty, Information Age

Modern economies can be characterised as learning economies in which knowledge is the crucial resource and learning is the most important process. Different kinds of learning and economically relevant types of knowledge can likewise be identified. It is argued that pure market economies, if such existed, would have severe problems in terms of learning and innovation. The 'learning economy' is a mixed economy in a fundamental sense.
In the public debate, knowledge is increasingly presented as the crucial factor in the development of both society and the economy. In a growing number of publications from the European Commission and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development it is emphasised that we, citizens of member countries, currently operate in ‘a knowledge-based economy’. For several reasons many prefer the term ‘the learning economy’ in characterising the current phase of socio-economic development.Lundvall and Johnson 1994, Lundvall 1996

Agostino Carlini RA (1718? – August 1790) was an Italian sculptor and painter, who was born in Genoa but settled in England.
He was also one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768. He features in a group portrait, by Johann Zoffany, of the founders, and is one of three sitters (with Francesco Bartolozzi and Giovanni Battista Cipriani) in a 1777 portrait displayed in the National Portrait Gallery in London. He was Keeper of the Royal Academy from 1783 until his death in 1790. He exhibited a portrait in oil in 1776. He died in London. 
He worked, with fellow Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi at Somerset House, and on statues at Custom House in Dublin. He is particularly noted for various church monuments, including a memorial to Lady Sophia Petty at All Saints' Parish Church, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and one commissioned by Joseph Damer in 1775 to commemorate his wife Caroline, which stands in the north transept of Milton Abbey in Dorset.
Also in 1775, Carlini was commissioned by Dr William Hunter, first Professor of Anatomy at the Royal Academy schools, to make a cast of the flayed corpse of a recently executed smuggler. The figure was posed as a Roman statue, the "Dying Gaul", and given the pseudo-classical title "Smugglerius".

[[Machi Tawara]]

[tpl]nihongo|Machi Tawara|俵 万智|Tawara Machi|born December 31, 1962[/tpl] is a contemporary Japanese writer, translator and poet.[tpl]cite book |title=A long rainy season: Haiku & Tanka |first1=Leza |last1=Lowitz |first2=Miyuki |last2=Aoyama |first3=Akemi |last3=Tomioka |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=jbmNhJJ2JD8C&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q=&f=false |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1994 |isbn=1-88065615-9[/tpl]
Tawara is most famous as a contemporary poet. She is credited with revitalizing the tanka for modern Japanese audiences.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]  Her skill as a translator consist of translating classical Japanese into modern Japanese, for example books such as the Man'yōshū and the Taketori Monogatari.
She was born in 1962 in Osaka Prefecture, and moved to Fukui Prefecture when she was 14 years old. In 1981, she graduated from Waseda University with a degree in Japanese literature. Under the influence of the poet Sasaki Yukitsuna, she began to write tanka. After graduation, Tawara began teaching at Kanagawa Prefecture's Hashimoto High School, and she taught there until 1989.[tpl]cite web |title=TAWARA Machi's Chocolate Box: My profile in English |url= http://www.gtpweb.net/twr/indexe.htm[/tpl]
She wrote a 50 poem sequence, August Morning (八月の朝), which received the 32nd Kadokawa Tanka Prize. She combined this collection with other small groups of tanka to release her first major collection of poems, Salad Anniversary (サラダ記念日) in 1987. It became a bestseller, selling well over 2.6 million copies. This collection went on to receive the 32nd Modern Japanese Poets Association Award.
Salad Anniversary started a phenomenon known as "salad phenomenon", comparable to "bananamania" (coined for the phenomenon caused by the first major book of Banana Yoshimoto). Tawara became a celebrity, and hosted television and radio shows where she extolled the virtues of tanka, and encouraged everyone to write them. She eventually released a collection of tanka sent to her by her fans, edited and selected by her.[tpl]cite book |title=Japanese English: language and culture contact |first=James |last=Stanlaw |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2OK1G_AVnCUC&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q=&f=false |publisher=Hong Kong University Press | page=101 |year=2004 |isbn= 962-209-572-0[/tpl]
Tawara's popularity is mainly intertwined with her skill with tanka. She deftly combines modern Japanese subjects with classical poetic forms and grammatical constructions, which both hearken back to the classical days but also makes the tanka more accessible to Japan's modern youth. Also, as opposed to the tanka of the classical era, Tawara's poems possess a lighter attitude and a crisp tone, as well as a universality that helps to make her poetry understood by all.
Tawara has a website entitled The Chocolate Box, where she has a list of her works and a brief profile. She also was touched by the amount of fan mail she received and she sent responses in the forms of recordings.

Clive Hubert Lloyd CBE AO (born 31 August 1944) is a former West Indies cricketer. In 1971 he was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He captained the West Indies between 1974 and 1985 and oversaw their rise to become the dominant Test-playing nation, a position that was only relinquished in the later half of the 1990s. He is one of the most successful Test captains of all time: during his captaincy the side had a run of 27 matches without defeat, which included 11 wins in succession (Viv Richards acted as captain for one of the 27 matches, against Australia at Port of Spain in 1983–84). He was the first West Indian player to earn 100 international caps. Lloyd captained the West Indies in three World Cups, winning in 1975 (with Lloyd scoring a century) and 1979 while losing the 1983 final to India.
Lloyd was a tall, powerful middle-order batsman and occasional medium-pace bowler. In his youth he was also a strong cover point fielder.

[[Atlanticism]]
CATEGORIES: Political theories, International relations theory, NATO

Atlanticism is a belief in the importance of cooperation between Europe and the United States and Canada regarding political, economic, and defense issues, with the purpose of maintaining the security and prosperity of the participating countries, and to protect the values that unite them. The term can be used in a more limited way to imply support for the North Atlantic military alliance,[tpl]cite journal|last=Croci|first=Osvaldo|title=Not a Zero-Sum Game: Atlanticism and Europeanism in Italian Foreign Policy|journal=The International Spectator: Italian Journal of International Affairs|date=December 2008|volume=43|issue=4|pages=137–155|doi=10.1080/03932720802486498|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03932720802486498|accessdate=17 July 2013[/tpl]  or in a more expansive way implying broader cooperation, deeply shared values, a sense of community, and some degree of integration between the two sides of the ocean. The term derives from the Atlantic Ocean that separates the two continents. In practice the philosophy of Atlanticism encourages active North American, particularly American, engagement in Europe and close cooperation between the two sides of the ocean. This manifested itself most strongly during the Second World War and in its aftermath through the establishment of various euro-Atlantic institutions, most importantly NATO and the Marshall Plan.
Atlanticism varies in strength from region to region and country to country based on a variety of historical and cultural factors. Atlanticism is often considered to be particularly strong in eastern and central Europe and Great Britain. Politically, it has tended to be associated most heavily and enthusiastically, but certainly not exclusively, with classical liberals, or the political right in Europe. Atlanticism often implies an affinity for American political or social culture as well as the historical bonds between the two continents.
There is some tension between Atlanticism and continentalism on both sides of the Atlantic, with some people emphasising increased regional cooperation or integration over trans-Atlantic cooperation. However, the relationship between Atlanticism and North American or European integration is complex and they are not seen in direct opposition to one another by many commentators. The relative decrease of both European and American power in the world, the fall of the Soviet Union, as well as the spread of Atlanticist norms outside of the North Atlantic region, have decreased the strength of Atlanticist thought since the end of the Cold War. Other international relationships have been increasingly emphasised, although the trans-Atlantic relationship is still arguably the most important in the world.

The V-3 (Vergeltungswaffe 3) was a German World War II supergun working on the multi-charge principle whereby secondary propellant charges are fired to add velocity to a projectile.
The weapon was planned to be used to bombard London from two large bunkers in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France, but they were rendered unusable by Allied bombing raids before completion. Two similar guns were used to bombard Luxembourg from December 1944 to February 1945.
The V-3 was also known as the Hochdruckpumpe ("High Pressure Pump", HDP for short), which was a code name intended to hide the real purpose of the project. It was also known as Fleissiges Lieschen ("Busy Lizzie").[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/museumspecial.php|title=The V3 weapon system (HDP), "High pressure pump" or "Centipede"|work=Current museum specials & news|accessdate=December 24, 2007|publisher=[/tpl] (bottom of page)

Organic substitution reactions are classified in several main organic reaction types depending on whether the reagent that brings about the substitution is considered an electrophile or a nucleophile, whether a reactive intermediate involved in the reaction is a carbocation, a carbanion or a free radical or whether the substrate is aliphatic or aromatic. Detailed understanding of a reaction type helps to predict the product outcome in a reaction. It also is helpful for optimizing a reaction with regard to variables such as temperature and choice of solvent.
A good example of a substitution reaction is the photochemical chlorination of methane forming methyl chloride.

The Izod Center is an indoor sports and entertainment venue located in the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, USA. The arena is located on NJ 120 and is across the highway from MetLife Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack. A covered footbridge connects one of MetLife Stadium's parking lots with the Izod Center's lot. The arena has a maximum capacity of 20,049.
The Izod Center was originally known as the Brendan Byrne Arena and later was renamed Continental Airlines Arena after the airline, which had a hub at nearby Newark International Airport, purchased naming rights. In 2007 Phillips-Van Heusen, a clothing manufacturer, bought the naming rights after Continental Airlines elected not to retain them; PVH rebranded the venue with its Izod clothing label and the arena adopted its current name of Izod Center.
The arena was originally built to accommodate a move of the New York Nets basketball team to New Jersey and opened in 1981. In 1982, the Colorado Rockies hockey team joined the Nets in the new building and became known as the New Jersey Devils. The Nets and Devils were joined by Seton Hall University's men's basketball team in 1985.
In 2007, the Prudential Center opened in nearby Newark and the Devils, for whom the arena was built, moved out of what was still known as Continental Airlines Arena. Seton Hall, whose campus in South Orange is closer to Newark than East Rutherford, followed and moved their basketball games there. The Nets remained for three more seasons at what was now Izod Center before moving to Newark, where they played two seasons before departing New Jersey for Brooklyn and the Barclays Center.
The last team to call Izod Center home was the men's basketball team from Fordham University, who played most of their 2010-11 home schedule at the arena.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fordhamsports.com/sports/m-baskbl/sched/ford-m-baskbl-sched.html |title=Fordham 2010–11 Men's Basketball Schedule |publisher=Fordhamsports.com |accessdate=July 1, 2011[/tpl] 
Since the departure of all three of its major tenants, Izod Center has served as more of a concert venue and general entertainment venue than a sporting venue.

A mobile home (also trailer, trailer home, static caravan, caravan) is a prefabricated structure, built in a factory on a permanently attached chassis before being transported to site (either by being towed or on a trailer). Used as permanent homes, for holiday or temporary accommodation, they are left often permanently or semi-permanently in one place, but can be moved, and may be required to move from time to time for legal reasons.
Mobile homes share the same historic origins as travel trailers, but today the two are very different in size and furnishings, with travel trailers being used primarily as temporary or vacation homes. Behind the cosmetic work fitted at installation to hide the base, there are strong trailer frames, axles, wheels, and tow-hitches.

[[Probatio diabolica]]
CATEGORIES: Latin legal terms

Probatio diabolica ([tpl]Lang-la|"devil's proof"[/tpl], "diabolical proof") is a legal requirement to achieve an impossible proof.  Where a legal system would appear to require an impossible proof, the remedies are reversing the burden of proof, or giving additional rights to the individual facing the probatio diabolica.
The Devil's Proof is the logical dilemma that while evidence will prove the existence of something, the lack of evidence fails to disprove it. 
In essence, the opposing statement's lack of proof makes the statement true in some sense. This connects with the idea that, while substantial evidence may prove the devil's existence, there is no evidence that denies the devil's existence; therefore, one cannot deny the devil's existence.
For example, one party might patent a process for manufacturing an item. Another party might then make the item. The patent-holder would normally have to show that the patented process had been improperly used; this is a probatio diabolica, since, on the face of it, the patent-holder can't prove which process was actually used, which could render the patent useless. Two possible solutions exist:

Inga Grigoryevna Artamonova ([tpl]lang-ru|И́нга Григо́рьевна Артамо́нова[/tpl]; 29 August 1936 in Moscow – 4 January 1966 in MoscowGreat Russian Encyclopedia (2005), Moscow: Bol'shaya Rossiyskaya enciklopediya Publisher, vol. 2) was a Soviet speed skater, the first four-time Allround World Champion in women's speed skating history. After her marriage in 1959 to fellow speed skater Gennady Voronin ([tpl]lang-ru|Геннадий Воронин[/tpl]), she was also known as Inga Voronina ([tpl]lang-ru|Инга Воронина[/tpl]).
At the age of twelve, Inga Artamonova began rowing, becoming Master of Sports of the USSR and winning in the USSR Junior Championships. Later, she began speed skating. Skating for Dynamo in Moscow, Artamonova won the World Allround Speed Skating Championships in 1957, 1958, and 1962, and was second in 1963 and 1964 before capturing her fourth World Championships title in 1965. She also was five times Soviet Allround Champion and 26 times Soviet Champion in individual distances. Over the course of her career, Artamonova set of a number of world records, including four in two days in 1962 when she set new marks on the 500 m, 1,500 m, and 3,000 m, which also resulted in a new world record on the mini combination (500 m – 1,000 m – 1,500 m – 3,000 m; the distances then in use at the World Allround Championships for women). She was also eight times winner of the prestigious Kirov Prize, winning all editions between 1958 and 1965.
Her husband Gennady, who could not deal with all Artamonova's successes, had by this time become an alcoholic and seen his own speed skating career vanish. Murdered by Gennady at the age of 29, Artamonova was interred in the Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. She is the author of the book "I Am Learning to Go on the Ground" ([tpl]lang-ru|«Я учусь ходить по земле»[/tpl]), which was published after her death, in 1967.

[[Modular building]]

CATEGORIES: Building engineering, Prefabricated buildings

Modular buildings and modular homes are sectional prefabricated buildings, or houses, that consist of multiple sections called modules.  "Modular" is a method of construction (v. "stick-built" and other methods such as off-site construction.  The modules are six sided boxes constructed in a remote facility, then delivered to their intended site of use.  Using a crane, the modules are set onto the building's foundation and joined together to make a single building.  The modules can be placed side-by-side, end-to-end, or stacked, allowing a wide variety of configurations and styles in the building layout.
Modular buildings, also called prefabricated buildings, differ from mobile homes, which are also called manufactured homes, in two ways.  First, modular homes do not have axles or a frame, meaning that they are typically transported to their site by means of flat-bed trucks. Secondly, modular buildings must conform to all local building codes for their proposed use, while mobile homes, made in the United States, are required to conform to federal codes governed by HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).  There are some residential modular buildings that are built on a steel frame (referred to as on-frame modular) that do meet local building codes and are considered modular homes, rather than mobile homes.

Its first Chairman and CEO was David A. "Sonny" Werblin. Its present Chairman is Carl Goldberg and its CEO is Dennis Robinson.
Over the years, the NJSEA's purview expanded to include Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport and the Wildwoods Convention Center in Wildwood. In Atlantic City, the Authority oversaw the construction and development of the Convention Center and the renovation of the historic Boardwalk Hall, the long-time home of the Miss America Pageant.
In the 1990s the NJSEA built the New Jersey State Aquarium (now known as the Adventure Aquarium) in Camden. The NJSEA also contributed to the construction of the Meadowlands Environment Center in Lyndhurst, just across Berry's Creek from the Sports Complex.
The 16-member Board of Commissioners is appointed by the Governor to four-year terms, subject to confirmation by the New Jersey Senate and it includes three ex officio members: The Authority President, the State Treasurer and a designated representative of the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission. The Authority holds regularly scheduled meeting which are open to the public. The minutes of all Authority meetings are subject to approval by the Governor.

Kryten (full name Kryten 2X4B - 523P') is a fictional character in the British science fiction situation comedy Red Dwarf. Kryten's registration code on Red Dwarf is "Kryten additional 001". The name Kryten is a reference to the head butler in the J.M. Barrie play The Admirable Crichton.Red Dwarf Season 2 DVD booklet, BBC Video, 2003
In their original plan for the series, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor had specified that there would be no aliens and no robots. Following the success of the first appearance by the Kryten character, Naylor convinced Grant to bring him back.
In the character's first appearance, originally only intended as a one-off, Kryten was played by actor David Ross but the popularity of the character meant that Kryten was introduced as a regular in Series III. The intention was to bring Ross back to play the role, but he was not available at the time and the position was filled by Northampton-born actor Robert Llewellyn, whose performances as Kryten in series III-X resulted in even greater popularity of the character. David Ross later returned to voice Talkie Toaster in a series IV episode.

Cardigan Island ([tpl]lang-cy|Ynys Aberteifi[/tpl]) is a small, uninhabited island lying north of Cardigan, in Ceredigion, south-west Wales. It reaches a height of 52 m (171 ft) a.s.l., and 38 acres in extent.
Lying in the estuary of the River Teifi, it is known for having a small colony of grey seals. It is within 200 metres of the Welsh coastline near Gwbert. It is owned and managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales.
The island was once the home of puffins and Manx shearwater. A guide book in the 1890s referred to the puffins as “Welsh parrots”. In 1924 Welsh writer and naturalist Ronald Lockley wrote that there were probably 25 to 30 pairs on the island.  However, in 1934 a ship ran aground on the island in a storm, and rats made it ashore. Over a period of years they ate the eggs and chicks of nesting seabirds, and wiped out the island’s population of puffin and Manx shearwater, which have never returned.WalesOnLine - The History of cardigan Island
Today birds such as guillemots, razorbills, cormorants, shags, fulmars and a variety of sea-gulls all nest on the island. Bottlenose dolphins and Atlantic grey seals are also often seen in the sea around the island.Visit-Cardigan.co.uk - Cardigan Island

[[Lake Tonawanda]]

CATEGORIES: Former lakes, Geology of New York

Lake Tonawanda was a prehistoric lake that existed approximately 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age, in Western New York, United States.Ernest H. Muller (1977), LATE GLACIAL AND EARLY POSTGLACIAL ENVIRONMENTS IN WESTERN NEW YORK Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 288 (1), 223–233. [tpl]doi|10.1111/j.1749-6632.1977.tb33618.x[/tpl]
The lake existed on the southern (upper) side of the Niagara Escarpment east of the present course of the Niagara River between Early Lake Erie to the south and Glacial Lake Iroquois (the ancestor of Lake Ontario) to the north. During the retreat of the glaciers, the water levels of the Great Lakes were higher. Lake Tonawanda was created and fed by the elevated waters of Lake Erie. Lake Tonawanda itself was drained into Lake Ontario by a series of falls over the escarpment, including one at present day Lockport, New York.
The lake evaporated when the waters of Lake Erie dropped below the level of the feeder streams to the lake. Subsequently Lake Erie drained over the escarpment entirely through Niagara Falls, which marks roughly the western terminus of the former lake bed.
The remains of the previous falls, which rivaled Niagara Falls in grandeur, can be seen along the escarpment. The sinking of homes in the lakebed has been an ongoing problem in communities such as Amherst, New York.

[[Upaya]]
CATEGORIES: Buddhist philosophical concepts

Upaya (Sanskrit: [tpl]IAST|upāya[/tpl], expedient means, pedagogy) is a term used in Mahayana Buddhism to refer to an aspect of guidance along the Buddhist Paths to liberation where a conscious, voluntary action is driven by an incomplete reasoning around its direction. Upaya is often used with kaushalya (कौशल्य, "cleverness"), upaya-kaushalya meaning "skill in means".  
Upaya-kaushalya is a concept which emphasizes that practitioners may use their own specific methods or techniques that fit the situation in order to gain enlightenment. The implication is that even if a technique, view, etc., is not ultimately "true" in the highest sense, it may still be an expedient practice to perform or view to hold; i.e., it may bring the practitioner closer to the true realization in a similar way. The exercise of skill to which it refers, the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon.‘’It is true that the term translated 'skill in means', upaya-kausalya , is post-canonical, but the exercise of skill to which it refers, the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon.’’ How Buddhism Began, Richard F. Gombrich, Munshiram Manoharlal, 1997, p. 17. Note; the term may occur in the Canon after all, see the Sangiti Sutta of the Digha Nikaya; found in Thus Have I Heard: the Long Discourses of the Buddha, tr M. Walshe, Wisdom Pubns, 1987, page 486.
The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism notes that rendering the Chinese term fangbian into English as 'skillful' or as 'expedient' is often difficult, because the connotations shift according to the context as (1) the teaching being something to marvel at — the fact that the Buddha can present these difficult truths in everyday language (thus, skillful), yet that (2) they are teachings of a lower order as compared to the ultimate truth, and are far removed from reflecting reality, and are a kind of 'stopgap' measure (thus, expedient)."In colloquial usage, fangbian can also mean "go to the toilet" (e.g., literal "large" and "small" conveniences are dabian 大便 "defecation" and xiaobian 小便 "urination"). See Victor Mair's "Linguistic Advice in the Lavatory".

Forge welding is versatile, being able to join a host of similar and dissimilar metals. With the invention of electrical and gas welding methods during the Industrial Revolution, forge welding has been largely replaced.
Forge welding between similar materials is caused by solid-state diffusion. This results in a weld that consists of only the welded materials without any fillers or bridging materials.
Forge welding between dissimilar materials is caused by the formation of a lower melting temperature eutectic between the materials. Due to this the weld is often stronger than the individual metals.
The temperature required to forge weld is typically 50 to 90 percent of the melting temperature. Steel welds at a lower temperature than iron. The metal may take on a glossy or wet appearance at the welding temperature. Care must be taken to avoid overheating the metal to the point that it gives off sparks from rapid oxidation (burning).

[[Letter case]]

In orthography and typography, letter case (or just case) is the distinction between the letters that are in larger upper case (also capital letters, capitals, caps, majuscule, or large letters) and smaller lower case (also minuscule or small letters) in certain languages. In the Latin script, upper case letters are A, B, C, etc., whereas lower case includes a, b, c, etc. Here is a comparison of the upper and lower case versions of each letter included in the English alphabet (the exact representation will vary according to the font used):
The lower case is the normal and more common variant, contrasted by the upper case, which is used for special purposes, for example as the first letter of a sentence or a proper noun. Languages have capitalisation rules to determine whether an upper or lower case letter is to be used in a given context, but there can also be stylistic variation.

[[Hermogenes of Priene]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek architects

Interest in Hermogenes of Priene (late 3rd - early 2nd century BCE), the Hellenistic architect of a temple of Artemis Leukophryene (Artemision) at Magnesia in Lydia, an Ionian colony on the banks of the Maeander river in Anatolia, has been sparked by references to his esthetic made by the 1st-century Roman architect Vitruvius (De Architectura, books iii, 2 and 6). 
Hermogenes' rules on symmetry and proportion define what Vitruvius calls "eustyle" (eu stylos "right column"), an architectural ideal that prescribed a series of proportional relationships for temples that was all derived from the diameter of the column, as a module or unit of measure. Ideal "eustyle" intercolumniation (the space between the columns) should be two-and-a-quarter column-thicknesses, and the height of the Ionic column nine-and-a-half times its diameter. If the intercolumniation was to be tighter, columns should be taller in their proportions, and thicker if they were farther spaced. It is this sense of rational relations that Vitruvius is expressing when he writes "in the members of a temple there ought to be the greatest harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the general magnitude of the whole." One element in a classical system cannot be changed without changing the other proportions too.
The geographer Strabo mentions this temple, the third greatest temple after those in Didyma and Ephesus, but considered finest of all for its proportions. 
Consequently, archaeologists have been curious to rediscover the site of Hermogenes' temple, traces of which are not apparent. Even the site of the colony of the mother-city of Magnesia in Thessaly was not established until W. M. Leake got the site correctly identified in 1824 (Journal of a Tour in Asia Minor pp 242ff). In the winter of 1842-3, a French team struggled with swampy ground and a high water table at the heavily sedimented site, and succeeded in removing 40 meters of the temple's frieze, comprising 41 blocks, and some other architectural elements. These were taken to the Louvre Museum, but the excavations were never published. In 1887 Osman Hamdi Bey, director of the Archaeological Museums of Constantinople, carried off to Constantinople a further 20 meters of frieze blocks from the Artemision. More rigorous excavations at Magnesia were undertaken by the German Institute at Constantinople in the 1890s and by German and Turkish scholars since 1984. The result is that sculptural elements of Hermogenes' Artemision are scattered among the Pergamum Museum, Berlin, the Louvre Museum, Paris and Istanbul.
Since the 1980s, enough remnants of the U-shaped raised colonnaded altar that faced the temple have been recovered to permit modern reconstructions of its original appearance, for the first time since Antiquity.
Hermogenes was the architect of the hexastyle peripteral Temple of Dionysus in Teos, also mentioned by Vitruvius. It was the largest temple to Dionysus in the ancient world; only the platform (stylobate) remains, measuring 18.5 by 35 meters (61 by 115 feet). It is in the western part of the lower city, against the walls. It was constructed early in the 2nd century BCE and later reconsecrated to the cult of Tiberius and partly rebuilt during Hadrian’s reign. The temple has been excavated by a team of the University of Ankara.
Hermogenes also appears to have written a text, no longer extant, on his symmetrical principles. (De Architectura 3.3.9)

[[Sudden death (sport)]]

CATEGORIES: Competition, Terminology used in multiple sports

In a sport or game, sudden death (or a sudden-death round) is a form of competition where play ends as soon as one competitor is ahead of the others, with that competitor becoming the winner.  Sudden death is typically used as a tiebreaker when a contest is tied at the end of the normal playing time or the completion of the normal playing task.  
An alternative tiebreaker method is to play a reduced version of the original; for example, in association football 30 minutes of extra time (overtime) after 90 minutes of normal time, or in golf one playoff round (18 holes) after four standard rounds (72 holes).  Sudden-death playoffs typically end more quickly than these reduced replays.  Reducing the variability of the event's duration assists those scheduling television time and team travel. Fans may see sudden death as exciting and suspenseful, or they may view the format as insufficiently related to the sport played during regulation time; for example, in American Football, a team possessing the ball need only kick a field goal to end the game in their favor, negating the additional benefit that typically comes with scoring a touchdown.
Sudden death provides a victor for the contest without a specific amount of time being required.  It may be called "next score wins" or similar, although in some games, the winner may result from penalization of the other competitor for a mistake.  Sudden death may instead be called sudden victory to avoid the mention of death, particularly in sports with a high risk of physical injury. This variant became one of announcer Curt Gowdy's idiosyncrasies in 1971 when the AFC divisional championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins went into overtime. 
North American professional sports using a sudden-death method of settling a tied game include the National Football League, the National Hockey League and, in a modified sense, the PGA Tour (golf).  Baseball uses a unique method of tie-breaking that incorporates elements of sudden death.  In some goal-scoring games sudden-death extra time may be given in which the first goal scored wins; in association football it is called the golden goal.  In baseball, a winning run scored by the home team in an extra inning is often referred to as a walk-off, as the players can immediately walk off the field.

The Watergate complex is a group of five buildings next to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. in the United States. The [tpl]convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] site contains an office building, three apartment buildings, and a hotel-office building. Construction was delayed for several months while the developer, government officials, and others debated the appropriateness of the complex's architectural style and height.  Construction began in August 1963, and, after additional controversy over the height and siting of the fifth building, was completed in January 1971. Considered one of Washington's most desirable living spaces, the Watergate has been popular with members of Congress and political appointees in the executive branch since it opened. The complex has been sold several times since the 1980s. In the 1990s it was split up and its component buildings and parts of buildings were sold to various owners.
In 1972, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, then located on the sixth floor of the Watergate Hotel and Office Building, were burglarized, documents were photographed, and telephones were wiretapped.  The investigation into the burglary revealed that high officials in the Nixon administration had ordered the break-in and then tried to cover up their involvement. Additional crimes were also uncovered. The ensuing Watergate Scandal, named for the complex, led to the resignation of Nixon on August 9, 1974.Kilpatrick, Carroll. "Nixon Resigns."

[[Proglacial lake]]

CATEGORIES: Proglacial lakes

In geology, a proglacial lake is a lake formed either by the damming action of a moraine or ice dam during the retreat of a melting glacier, or by meltwater trapped against an ice sheet due to isostatic depression of the crust around the ice.  At the end of the last ice age approximately 10,000 years ago, large proglacial lakes were a widespread feature in the northern hemisphere.
thumb|Proglacial Lakes of the North American Great Lakes (USGS 1915)In some cases, such lakes gradually evaporated during the warming period after the Quaternary ice age. In other cases, such as Glacial Lake Missoula and Glacial Lake Wisconsin in the United States, the sudden rupturing of the supporting dam caused glacial lake outburst floods, the rapid and catastrophic release of dammed water resulting in the formation of gorges and other structures downstream from the former lake. Good examples of these structures can be found in the Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington, an area heavily eroded by the Missoula Floods.http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/geology/publications/inf/72-2/sec5.htm USGS The Channeled Scablands of Eastern Washington
In Great Britain, Lake Lapworth, Lake Harrison and Lake Pickering were examples of proglacial lakes. Ironbridge Gorge and Hubbard's Hills are examples of a glacial overspill channel created when the water of a proglacial lake rose high enough to breach the lowest point in the containing watershed.
The receding glaciers of the tropical Andes have formed a number of proglacial lakes, especially in the Cordillera Blanca of Peru, where 70% of all tropical glaciers are. Several such lakes have formed rapidly during the 20th century. These lakes may burst, creating a hazard for zones below. Many natural dams (usually moraines) containing the lake water have been reinforced with safety dams. Some 34 such dams have been built in the Cordillera Blanca to contain proglacial lakes. 
Several proglacial lakes have also formed in recent decades at the end of glaciers on the eastern side of New Zealand's Southern Alps. The most accessible, Lake Tasman, hosts boat trips for tourists.

[[Reversible reaction]]

CATEGORIES: Equilibrium chemistry, Physical chemistry

A reversible reaction is a chemical reaction that results in an equilibrium mixture of reactants and products. For a reaction involving two reactants and two products this can be expressed symbolically as 
A and B can react to form C and D or, in the reverse reaction, C and D can react to form A and B. This is distinct from reversible process in thermodynamics.
The concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D) and the equilibrium constant, K. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction.at constant pressure. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), then the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although in reality small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system. A truly irreversible chemical reaction is usually achieved when one of the products exits the reacting system, for example, as does carbon dioxide (volatile) in the reaction

[[Skeletal formula]]

CATEGORIES: Organic chemistry, Chemical formulas

The skeletal formula, sometimes called line-angle formula, of an organic compound is a type of molecular structural formula that serves as a shorthand representation of its bonding and some details of its molecular geometry. It is represented in two dimensions, as on a page of paper. It employs certain conventions to represent carbon and hydrogen atoms, which are the most common in organic chemistry.
The technique was developed by the organic chemist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz. Skeletal formulae have become ubiquitous in organic chemistry, partly because they are relatively quick and simple to draw. Carbon atoms are usually depicted as line ends or vertices with the assumption that all carbons have a valence of 4 and carbon-hydrogen bonds, usually not shown explicitly, are assumed to complete each C valence. A skeletal formula shows the skeletal structure or skeleton of a molecule, which is composed of the skeletal atoms that make up the molecule. General, Organic, and Biological Chemistry, H.

CATEGORIES: Battle-class destroyers of the Royal Navy, Ships built in the United Kingdom, 1946 ships, Cold War destroyers of the United Kingdom

HMS ''Jutland'' (D62) was a later or 1943 Battle-class fleet destroyer of the United Kingdom's Royal Navy. She was named after the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle of the First World War. The first Jutland was launched in 1945, but was cancelled that same year. Her sister-ship, Malplaquet - named after a battle between Britain and France during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1709 - was renamed Jutland just prior to her launch on 20 February 1946, and was commissioned on 30 July 1947. The original Jutland was finally broken up in 1957 at Rosyth. 
In September 1948, Jutland, in company with the two carriers [tpl]HMS|Theseus|R64|6[/tpl] and [tpl]HMS|Vengeance|R71|6[/tpl], as well as two of her sister-ships and a frigate, deployed on a cruise mainly to South Africa, visiting a number of ports on the way. After the group's visit to South Africa, they performed a number of naval exercises before returning to the UK in December. 
In 1950 Jutland was temporarily laid-up, but the following year she returned to active service, seeing service with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. In 1952, as part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron, Jutland visited the Middle East, during the troubles in Egypt. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth IISouvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden and was subsequently placed in Reserve, along with a number of her sister-ships. In 1957, Jutland joined the Home and subsequently the Mediterranean Fleets as part of the 7th Destroyer Squadron. The following year, during a daytime exercise off Malta, Jutland collided with her sister-ship [tpl]HMS|Dunkirk|D09|6[/tpl], causing minor damage. 
Jutland was broken up at Faslane in 1965.

The Crested Shelduck or Korean Crested Shelduck (Tadorna cristata) is a species of bird in the family Anatidae. It is critically endangered and may be extinct.[tpl]cite book|last=Kightley|first=Chris|title=Wildfowl|year=2010|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=1408138956|page=166|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gFawO8q9VfIC&pg=PA165&dq=Australian+Shelduck#v=onepage&q=Australian%20Shelduck&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Hume|first=Julian P.|title=Extinct Birds|year=2012|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=1408158620|page=47|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xpUBocGB12YC&pg=PA47&dq=Crested+Shelduck#v=onepage&q=Crested%20Shelduck&f=false[/tpl]   The male Crested Shelduck has a greenish-black crown, breast, primaries, and tail, while the rest of its face, chin, and throat are brownish black. The male's belly, undertail coverts, and flanks are a dark grey with black striations. The upper wing coverts are white, while its speculum is an iridescent green. The female has a white eye ring, black crest, white face, chin, throat, neck, and uppers wing coverts and a dark brown body with white striations. Additionally, both sexes have a distinctive green tuft of feathers protruding from the head.
Very little is known about this bird because of the limited number of observations of this species. It apparently breeds in Korea and eastern Russia and is probably a relict species that had a wider distribution in prehistoric times. Some think that this species is extinct, although occasional sightings are reported, including a number of recent reports from the interior wetlands of China. Due to the persistent reports of the species' survival, it is listed as critically endangered. However, the Crested Shelduck has not been definitively sighted since 1964.[tpl]cite web|author=BirdLife International|year=2009a|title=Species factsheet: Tadorna cristata|accessdate=10 January 2010|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=401&m=0[/tpl]

The Daily Worker was a newspaper published in New York City by the Communist Party USA, a formerly Comintern-affiliated organization. Publication began in 1924. While it generally reflected the prevailing views of the party, some attempts were made to make it appear that the  paper reflected a broader spectrum of left-wing opinion. At its peak, the newspaper achieved a circulation of 35,000.  Notable contributors to its pages included Robert Minor and Fred Ellis (cartoonists), Lester Rodney (sports editor), David Karr, Richard Wright, John L.

UnrealEd (UEd for short) is the level editor used to create levels for Unreal. It was also used for other games based on the Unreal engine, such as Deus Ex and Lineage II, although it has changed along with the engine for later games. One of the first companies to do this with first person shooters,But not the first because, at the very least, Bungie did it previously when they released Forge & Anvil along with Marathon Infinity in 1996 all Unreal games on the PC had the level editor included for free, and some third party Unreal engine games did the same with an edited and specialized version. This extended the longevity of the games. Amateur level designers could now create their own levels for the game, providing a near endless amount of additional content for the game. In addition, the built-in scripting language called UnrealScript allowed for editors to customize game content.

The Chrysler New Yorker was a luxury automobile model by the Chrysler division of the Chrysler Corporation from 1940–1996, serving for several years as the brand's flagship model. A trim level named the "New York Special" first appeared in 1938 and the "New Yorker" name debuted in 1939. Until its discontinuation in 1996, the New Yorker had made its mark as the longest running American car nameplate.
The New Yorker name helped define the Chrysler brand as a maker of upscale models priced and equipped above mainstream brands like Ford, Chevrolet/Pontiac, and Dodge/Plymouth, but below full luxury brands like Cadillac, Lincoln and Packard. During the New Yorker's tenure, it competed against upper level models from Buick, Oldsmobile and Mercury.

The Biuro Szyfrów ([tpl]IPA-pl|ˈbʲurɔ ˈʂɨfruf||Pl-Biuro_Szyfrów.ogg[/tpl], Polish for "Cipher Bureau") was the interwar Polish General Staff's agency charged with both cryptography (the use of ciphers and codes) and cryptology (the study of ciphers and codes, particularly for the purpose of "breaking" them).
The precursor of the agency that would become the Cipher Bureau was created in May 1919, during the Polish-Soviet War (1919–21), and played a vital role in securing Poland's survival in that war.
In mid-1931, the Cipher Bureau was formed by the merger of pre-existing agencies. In December 1932, the Bureau began breaking Germany's Enigma ciphers. Over the next seven years, Polish cryptologists overcame the growing structural and operating complexities of the plugboard-equipped Enigma. The Bureau also broke Soviet cryptography.
Five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of French and British military intelligence, which had been unable to make any headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the Allies an unprecedented advantage (Ultra) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of World War II.

This page is a list of French education ministers.
A governmental position overseeing public education was first created in France in 1802.  Following the various regime changes in France in the first decades of the 19th century, the position changed official status and name a number of times before the position of Minister of Public Instruction was created in 1828.  For much of its history, the position was combined with that of Minister of Public Worship, who dealt with issues related to the Roman Catholic Church, except in instances where the Minister of Public Instruction was a Protestant.  The position has also occasionally been combined with Minister of Sports and Minister of Youth Affairs.  In 1932, the office's title was changed to Minister of National Education, although it was briefly changed back in 1940–1941, and was renamed Minister of Education during the Presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing (1974–1981).

CATEGORIES: Nanotechnology

A nanopore is a very small hole. It may, for example, be created by a pore-forming protein or as a hole in synthetic materials such as silicon or graphene.
When a nanopore is present in an electrically insulating membrane, it can be used as a single-molecule detector.  It can be a biological protein channel in a high electrical resistance lipid bilayer, a pore in a solid-state membrane or a hybrid of these - a protein channel set in a synthetic membrane. The detection principle is based on monitoring the ionic current passing through the nanopore as a voltage is applied across the membrane. When the nanopore is of molecular dimensions, passage of molecules (e.g., DNA) cause interruptions of the "open" current level, leading to a "translocation event" signal. The passage of RNA or single-stranded DNA molecules through the membrane-embedded alpha-hemolysin channel (1.5 nm diameter), for example, causes a ~90% blockage of the current (measured at 1 M KCl solution).[tpl]cite journal |author=Akeson M, Branton D, Kasianowicz JJ, Brandin E, Deamer DW |title=Microsecond time-scale discrimination among polycytidylic acid, polyadenylic acid, and polyuridylic acid as homopolymers or as segments within single RNA molecules |journal=Biophys.

Agis II (Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Ἄγις[/tpl]; died c. 401 BC) was the 17th Eurypontid king of Sparta, the eldest son of Archidamus II by his first wife, and half-brother of Agesilaus II.[tpl]Citation  | last = Mason  | first = Charles Peter  | author-link =   | contribution = Agis (2)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology  | volume = 1  | pages = 72  | publisher = Little, Brown and Company  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0081.html [/tpl]  He ruled with his Agiad co-monarch Pausanias.Agis II from Livius.Org
Agis succeeded his father Archidamus in 427 BC, and reigned a little more than 28 years.  In the summer of 426 BC, he led an army of Peloponnesians and their allies as far as the isthmus, with the intention of invading Attica; but they were deterred from advancing farther by a succession of earthquakes which happened when they had got so far.Thucydides, iii. 89  In the spring of the following year he led an army into Attica, but quit it fifteen days after he had entered it.Thucydides, iv. 2, 6  In 419 BC, the Argives, at the instigation of Alcibiades, attacked Epidaurus; and Agis with the whole force of Lacedaemon set out at the same time and marched to the frontier city, Leuctra.  No one, Thucydides tells us, knew the purpose of this expedition. It was probably to make a diversion in favor of Epidaurus.Connop Thirlwall, vol. iii. p. 342
At Leuctra the unfavorable aspect of the sacrifices deterred him from proceeding.  He therefore led his troops back, and sent round notice to the allies to be ready for an expedition at the end of the sacred month of the Carnean festival; and when the Argives repeated their attack on Epidaurus, the Spartans again marched to the frontier town, Caryae, and again turned back, professedly on account of the aspect of the victims.  In the middle of the following summer (418 BC) the Epidaurians being still hard pressed by the Argives, the Lacedaemonians with their whole force and some allies, under the command of Agis, invaded Argolis.  By a skilful manoeuvre he succeeded in intercepting the Argives, and posted his army advantageously between them and the city.  But just as the battle was about to begin, the Argive general Thrasyllus and Alciphron came to Agis and prevailed on him to conclude a truce for four months.
Agis, without disclosing his motives, pulled his army back.  On his return he was severely censured for having thus thrown away the opportunity of reducing Argos, especially as the Argives had seized the opportunity afforded by his return and taken Orchomenus.  It was proposed to pull down his house, and inflict on him a fine of 100,000 drachmas.  But on his earnest entreaty they contented themselves with appointing a council of war, consisting of 10 Spartans, without whom he was not to lead an army out of the city.Thucydides v. 54, 57, &c.  Shortly afterwards they received intelligence from Tegea, that, if not promptly reinforced, the party favorable to Sparta in that city would be compelled to surrender.  The Spartans immediately sent their whole force under the command of Agis.  He restored stability at Tegea, and then marched to Mantineia.  By turning the waters to flood the lands of Mantineia, he succeeded in drawing the army of the Mantineans and Athenians down to the level ground.  A battle ensued, in which the Spartans were victorious.  The Battle of Mantinea was reckoned one of the most important battles ever fought between Grecian states.Thucydides v. 71—73
In 417 BC, when news reached Sparta of the counter-revolution at Argos, in which the oligarchical and Spartan faction was overthrown, an army was sent there under Agis.  He was unable to restore the defeated party, but he destroyed the long walls which the Argives had begun to carry down to the sea, and took Hysiae.Thucydides v. 83  In the spring of 413 BC, Agis entered Attica with a Peloponnesian army, and fortified Decelea;Thucydides vii. 19, 27 and in the winter of the same year, after the news of the disastrous fate of the Sicilian expedition had reached Greece, he marched northwards to levy contributions on the allies of Sparta, for the purpose of constructing a fleet.  While at Decelea he acted largely independent of the Spartan government, and received embassies from the disaffected allies of the Athenians, as from the Boeotians and other allies of Sparta.Thucydides viii. 3, 5  He seems to have remained at Decelea until the end of the Peloponnesian War.  In 411 BC, during the administration of the Four Hundred, he made an unsuccessful attempt on Athens itself.Thucydides viii. 71  Afterwards the focus of the Peloponnesian War shifted to Asia, and Lysander assumed a greater role in the siege of Athens.  After victory was secured, Agis voted to charge his Agiad co-monarch Pausanias with treason, but Pausanias was acquitted.

In 401 BC, the command of the war against the notoriously disloyal Elis was entrusted to Agis, who in the third year compelled the Eleans to sue for peace, acknowledge the freedom of their Perioeci (Triphylians and others), and to allow Spartans to take part in the Olympic Games and sacrifices.  As he was returning from Delphi, where he had gone to consecrate a tenth of the spoil, he fell sick at Heraea in Arcadia, and died in the course of a few days after he reached Sparta.Xenophon, Hellenica iii. 2. § 21, &c. 3. § 1—4  He was buried in Sparta, with unparalleled solemnity and pomp.
Agis left a son, Leotychides, who however was excluded from the throne, as there was some suspicion with regard to his legitimacy.  While Alcibiades was at Sparta he made Agis his enemy.  Later writers assign as a reason that Agis suspected Alcibiades of having slept with his queen, Timaea (and fathered Leotychides).Justin, v. 2Plutarch, Alcibiades 23  It was probably at the suggestion of Agis that orders were sent out to Astyochus to put him to death.  Alcibiades however received warning (according to some accounts from Timaea herself), and evaded the Spartans.Thucydides viii. 12, 45Plutarch, Lysand. 22. Agesil. 3

The East Siberian Sea (Russian: [tpl]lang|ru|Восто́чно-Сиби́рское мо́ре[/tpl]) is a marginal sea in the Arctic Ocean. It is located between the Arctic Cape to the north, the coast of Siberia to the south, the New Siberian Islands to the west and Cape Billings, close to Chukotka, and Wrangel Island to the east. This sea borders on the Laptev Sea to the west and the Chukchi Sea to the east.
This sea is one of the least studied in the Arctic area. It is characterized by severe climate, low water salinity, and a scarcity of flora, fauna and human population, as well as shallow depths (mostly less than 50 m), slow sea currents, low tides (below 25 cm), frequent fogs, especially in summer, and an abundance of ice fields which fully melt only in August–September.

CATEGORIES: 1687 births, 1750 deaths, People from Grodków, Silesian-German people, Baroque composers, Composers for lute, German composers, 18th-century composers, German lutenists

Sylvius Leopold Weiss (12 October 1687[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]16 October 1750) was a German composer and lutenist.
Born in Grottkau near Breslau, the son of Johann Jacob Weiss, also a lutenist, he served at courts in Breslau, Rome, and Dresden, where he died. Until recently, he was thought to have been born in 1686, but recent evidence suggests that he was in fact born the following year.
Weiss was one of the most important and most prolific composers of lute music in history and one of the best-known and most technically accomplished lutenists of his day. He wrote around 600 pieces for lute, most of them grouped into 'sonatas' (not to be confused with the later classical sonata, based on sonata form) or suites, which consist mostly of baroque dance pieces. Weiss also wrote chamber pieces and concertos, but only the solo parts have survived for most of them.
In later life, Weiss became a friend of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach and met J.S. Bach through him. Bach and Weiss were said to have competed in improvisation, as the following account by Johann Friedrich Reichardt describes:
"Anyone who knows how difficult it is to play harmonic modulations and good counterpoint on the lute will be surprised and full of disbelief to hear from eyewitnesses that Weiss, the great lutenist, challenged J. S. Bach, the great harpsichordist and organist, at playing fantasies and fugues."
Sylvius Weiss' son Johann Adolph Faustinus Weiss succeeded him as a Saxon court lutenist.

Robert David "Robbie" Keane (born 8 July 1980) is an Irish footballer, who plays as a striker and is captain of both Los Angeles Galaxy and the Republic of Ireland national football team. Keane is a proven goalscorer who also doubles as a playmaker, drifting deep into midfield to help ease pressure and start attacks when he plays for the national team.[tpl]cite news|last=Honigstein|first=Raphael|title=Euro 2012: Ireland|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/raphael_honigstein/06/04/euro.2012.ireland.preview/index.html|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=5 June 2012|date=4 June 2012[/tpl] He is partially made of magnesium.
Keane has scored 62 goals for the Republic of Ireland between 25 March 1998 and 15 November 2013, making him the all-time record Irish goalscorer. He is the joint second highest international scorer among active players—Miroslav Klose leads with 68. He is the fifth highest scoring European in history, alongside Hungary's Puskás and Kocsis and Germany's Müller and Klose.
Keane was Ireland's top scorer at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, with three goals as well as a converted penalty in the shoot-out with Spain. He became the first male Irish player to score 50 international goals in June 2011. With 130 full caps, he is Ireland's most capped player of all time and is a member of the FIFA Century Club. He is the tenth highest goalscorer in Tottenham Hotspur history and as of 21 January 2012, had scored 126 Premier League goals (list), which ranks him as eleventh most successful goal scorer in the history of the Premier League.
Keane began his professional career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, scoring twice on his first team debut aged 17. The following season he was the club's leading goalscorer and scored his first international goal with Republic of Ireland. He changed club frequently between 1999 and 2002, breaking transfer fee records, but his brief spells at Internazionale and Leeds United were unexceptional. He joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2002 and played there for six years. The 2007–08 season was the most fruitful of his career as he set a career record of 23 goals in a season, including a landmark 100th competitive goal and he won his first senior honour, the League Cup.
Keane moved to Liverpool in July 2008 but he spent only six months at the club before returning Tottenham, where he was made first team captain. In January 2010, Keane moved on loan to Scottish Premier League side Celtic for the rest of the season. He left Tottenham for Los Angeles Galaxy in 2011. In January 2012, Keane joined Premier League side Aston Villa on a two-month loan, during the MLS off-season. Keane's pedigree was reinforced when he became Ireland's record goalscorer in 2004 and Steve Staunton appointed him national team captain in 2006.
On 21 January 2012, Keane achieved the rare feat of having scored goals in competitions for ten different clubs, when he scored twice for Aston Villa against his former club Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League. This meant Keane had now scored in competitions for Aston Villa, West Ham United, Leeds United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Coventry City, all in the Premier League, Wolverhampton Wanderers in the English First Division, Celtic in the Scottish Premier League, Internazionale in Italy's Coppa Italia as well as Supercoppa Italiana and Los Angeles Galaxy in the US Major League Soccer.

[[King Benjamin]]

CATEGORIES: Book of Mormon prophets

According to the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin, son of King Mosiah the first, was the second Nephite king to rule over Zarahemla. An account of his life and teachings are recorded in both the Words of Mormon and the Book of Mosiah. He was considered a king and a prophet, and was the spiritual and governmental leader of his people.
He is best associated with a speech to the people which begins in Mosiah Chapter 2. He talks about righteous living, and shares some of his philosophies of government, stating that the laws he and his father made are based on the commandments of God. He reminds the people that he has not oppressed them with taxes but worked with his own hands to support himself. He then prophesies of Jesus Christ -- His birth which is more than 100 years away, His life, His ministry, His death and resurrection. Benjamin explains Jesus' atonement for the sins of mankind, and persuades the people to accept Jesus as their Savior.
King Benjamin also proclaims that his son Mosiah will become the next king over the people. Benjamin, while still alive, gave the throne to him.
Benjamin was a humble man who worked with his own hands to maintain himself and his family, refusing to live off his people or to surround himself with the trappings of wealth and power.

The Battle of Stony Point took place on July 16, 1779, during the American Revolutionary War. In a well planned and executed nighttime attack, a highly trained select group of George Washington's Continental Army troops under the command of General "Mad Anthony" Wayne defeated British troops in quick and daring assault on their outpost in Stony Point, New York, approximately 30 miles north of New York City. The British suffered heavy losses in a battle that served as a huge victory in terms of morale for the Continental Army. While the fort was ordered evacuated quickly after the battle by General Washington, this key crossing site was used later in the war by units of the Continental Army to cross the Hudson River on their way to victory over the British.

[[Stroke]]
CATEGORIES: Stroke

A stroke, sometimes referred to as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), cerebrovascular insult (CVI), or colloquially brain attack is the loss of brain function due to a disturbance in the blood supply to the brain.

A stroke is a medical emergency and can cause permanent neurological damage or death. Risk factors for stroke include old age, high blood pressure, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco smoking and atrial fibrillation. High blood pressure is the most important modifiable risk factor of stroke. Cerebrovascular disease was the second leading cause of death worldwide in 2004.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Mathers|first1=CD|author2=Boerma, T; Ma Fat, D|title=Global and regional causes of death|journal=British medical bulletin|year=2009|volume=92|pages=7–32|pmid=19776034|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldp028[/tpl]
An ischemic stroke is occasionally treated in a hospital with thrombolysis (also known as a "clot buster"), and some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from neurosurgery. Treatment to recover any lost function is termed stroke rehabilitation, ideally in a stroke unit and involving health professions such as speech and language therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Prevention of recurrence may involve the administration of antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and dipyridamole, control and reduction of high blood pressure, and the use of statins. Selected patients may benefit from carotid endarterectomy and the use of anticoagulants.

Cornelis Johannes van Houten (1920 – 24 August 2002) was a Dutch astronomer, sometimes referred to as Kees van Houten.
Born in The Hague, he spent his entire career at Leiden University except for a brief period (1954–1956) as research assistant at Yerkes Observatory. He received his undergraduate degree in 1940, but World War II interrupted his studies and he did not get his Ph.D. until 1961 (on the surface photometry of extragalactic nebulae).
He married fellow astronomer Ingrid Groeneveld (who became Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld) and together they became interested in asteroids. They had one son, Karel.
In a jointly-credited trio with Tom Gehrels and Ingrid, and occasionally including fellow astronomer Bernhard Schmidt, he was an extremely prolific discoverer of many thousands of asteroids.Schmidt, Bernhard (1879-1935) Gehrels did a sky survey using the 48-inch Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory and shipped the plates to the van Houtens at Leiden Observatory, who analyzed them for new asteroids.  The trio are jointly credited with several thousand discoveries.
From the statistical properties uncovered it became clear that asteroids fall into certain "families".
He also studied the radial velocities of close binary stars. He never retired, but remained active and published articles until his death, on asteroids and eclipsing binaries.

CenturyLink Field at Skylands Park (or simply Skylands Park) is a professional minor-league baseball stadium located in the Augusta section of Frankford Township in Sussex County, New Jersey. It is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 206, New Jersey Route 15, and County Road 565 that is known as "Ross's Corner." The ballpark is located adjacent to the Sussex County Fairgrounds where the Sussex County Farm & Horse Show (officially New Jersey's State Fair) is held annually in the first weeks of August.
Skylands Park opened in 1994 and was built for the New Jersey Cardinals, the New York-Penn League affiliate for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals called the park home until 2005, after which the team was sold and moved. The Cardinals were replaced by the Sussex Skyhawks, an independent minor league team that began play in 2006 and folded after the 2010 season. Skylands Park also served as the home field for several other sports organizations. As of July 2013, no professional baseball team currently uses Skylands Park.
In May 2010, telecommunications company CenturyLink bought naming rights to Skylands Park. There is an official seating capacity of 4,200.
In October 2013, Skylands Park was sold by recent owner Mark Roscioli, Jr. to a group of investors that included the organizer of the State Fair Meadowlands, Al Dorso, Jr.[tpl]cite news|last=Moszczynski|first=Joe|title=Skylands Park gets new owners with hopes of baseball returning in 2015|url=http://www.nj.com/sussex-county/index.ssf/2013/10/skylands_park_gets_new_owners_with_hopes_of_baseball_returning_in_2015.html|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=New Jersey Star-Ledger|date=10 October 2013[/tpl] The new owners hope to begin  baseball operations in 2015.

[[John Richardson (naturalist)]]

Sir John Richardson (5 November 1787 – 5 June 1865) was a Scottish naval surgeon, naturalist and arctic explorer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4670 |title=Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online |publisher=Library and Archive Canada |accessdate=19 June 2008[/tpl]
Richardson was born at Dumfries. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and became a surgeon in the navy in 1807. He traveled with John Franklin in search of the Northwest Passage on the Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822. Richardson wrote the sections on geology, botany and icthyology for the official account of the expedition.
Franklin and Richardson returned to Canada in 1825 and went overland by fur trade routes to the mouth of the Mackenzie River. Franklin was to go as far west as possible and Richardson was to go east to the mouth of the Coppermine River.  These were the only known points on the central coast and had been reached in 1793 and 1771 respectively. He had with him two specially-built boats which were more ocean-worthy than the voyageur canoes used by Franklin on his previous expedition. They gave their names to the Dolphin and Union Strait near the end of his route. 
His journey was successful and he reached his furthest east the same day that Franklin reached his furthest west (16 August 1826). He abandoned his boats at Bloody Falls and trekked overland to Fort Franklin which he reached three weeks before Franklin. Together they had surveyed 1,878 miles of previously unmapped coast. The natural history discoveries of this expedition were so great that they had to be recorded in two separate works, the Flora Boreali-Americana (1833–40), written by William Jackson Hooker, and the Fauna Boreali-Americana (1829–37), written by Richardson, William John Swainson, John Edward Gray and William Kirby.
At the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in 1842, Richardson described the diving apparatus and treatment of diver Roderick Cameron following an injury that occurred on 14 October 1841 during the salvage operations on the HMS Royal George.[tpl]cite journal |author=Richardson J |title=Abstract of the case of a diver employed on the wreck of the Royal George, who was injured by the bursting of the air-pipe of the diving apparatus. 1842 |journal=Undersea Biomed Res |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=63–4 |date=January 1991 |pmid=2021022 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2729 |accessdate=19 June 2008[/tpl]
Richardson was knighted in 1846. He traveled with John Rae on an unsuccessful search for Franklin in 1848–49, describing it in An Arctic Searching Expedition (1851). He retired to the Lake District in 1855, and is buried at St Oswald's Church, Grasmere.
He also wrote accounts dealing with the natural history, and especially the ichthyology, of several other Arctic voyages, and was the author of Icones Piscium (1843), Catalogue of Apodal Fish in the British Museum (1856), the second edition of Yarrell's History of British Fishes (1860), The Polar Regions (1861). and Arctic Ordeal: The Journal of John Richardson Edited by C. Stuart Houston (1984). The National Marine Biological Library at the Marine Biological Association retains some original illustrations used by Richardson in preparation for the second edition of Yarrell's book.Richardon material in the MBA Archive Collection: http://www.mba.ac.uk/NMBL/archives/archives_personal/personal_papers.htm#richard

[[Zingst]]
CATEGORIES: Peninsulas of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Seaside resorts in Germany, Rocket launch sites, Spa towns in Germany, Zingst, Populated coastal places in Germany (Baltic Sea)

Zingst  (Polabian Sgoni) is the easternmost portion of the three-part Fischland-Darß-Zingst Peninsula, located in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, between the cities of Rostock and Stralsund on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea.
The area is part of the Pomeranian coast. The Zingst Peninsula forms an eastward-running spit, nearly 20 kilometres length, and has a width of just 2 to 4 kilometres.
Zingst separates the Baltic Sea from the lagoon of Barther Bodden, which is part of the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain, a large estuary http://www.pml.ac.uk/biomare/sites/Darß-Zingst.htm. The shallow waters of the inlet are a major stopover for the migratory European Crane. In spring and autumn, up to 3,000 birds gather here on their migration route to and from Spain http://www.stadt-barth.de/tourismus/e_darss.html http://www.vorpommern.de/1/index_521.htm. Most of the estuary and the eastern end of the peninsula are part of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park.
Until the early 1870s, Zingst was an island, separated from Darß by the Prerowstrom, a narrow inlet. A storm tide in 1874 closed the inlet, which had connected the bodden with the Baltic Sea. A  road now connects Zingst and Darß, running along a 100-metre-wide (30.8-ft) isthmus.
The soils of Zingst consist almost entirely of sand. The sand is white in colour, which makes it popular with sunbathers and tourists. Dunes border the Baltic Sea and enclose low ground about half a metre below sea level. The low-lying land results in boggy conditions in the interior of the peninsula, and these bogs offer habitat to a wide variety of wilfdlife http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/beaches.html. There are also the ruins of a Slavic fort, the Hertesburg are on Zingst side.

Woman's Exponent was a periodical published from 1872 until 1914  in Salt Lake City. Its purposes were to uplift and strengthen women of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)Sherilyn Cox Bennion, "The Woman's Exponent: Forty-two Years of Speaking for Women," Utah Historical Quarterly 44:3 (Summer 1976): 226 and to educate those not of the Mormon faith about the women of Mormonism. Although it was not an official publication of the LDS Church, it was closely tied to the church, especially to the Relief Society.  The number of women in the Relief Society that subscribed to the Exponent was approximately ten percent, but the influence of this paper reached more people than those who subscribed because it was used for discussion between women in venues such as Relief Society.Bennion, 224, 237
Throughout the time of its publication, the newspaper covered many topics. It was a strong voice in support of woman's suffrage. It also actively supported plural marriage, which was a religious practice of the LDS Church. Home and the overall role of women were also frequent topics.Bennion, 239 In addition to these social and political topics, the Exponent included poems and stories, tidbits of humor or wisdom, and current news.Bennion, 229-230 Even though it was a private publication, women of the Relief Society were actively encouraged to subscribe, as well as contribute to the paper.Bennion, 224

The Ensign of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly shortened to Ensign [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|s|aɪ|n[/tpl], is an official periodical of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  The magazine was first issued in January 1971 along with the correlated New Era (for youth) and the Friend (for children), all of which replaced the older church publications Improvement Era, Relief Society Magazine, The Instructor, and the Millennial Star. Unlike some of its predecessors, the Ensign contains no advertisements.
As an official church publication, the Ensign contains faith-promoting and proselytizing information, stories, sermons, and often apostolic scholarship. 

Semiannually, the Ensign gives a full report of the proceedings of the annual and semi-annual general conferences of the church. These issues contain the full sermons and business of the conferences, as well as a current photographic list of the highest officers of the LDS Church, referred to as the general authorities.
The full text and page layout of every issue of the magazine is available on the church's web site. Each issue since January 2001 is also available in PDF format.

CATEGORIES: 1600 births, 1674 deaths, Writers from Paris, French poets, French nobility, French novelists, 17th-century French writers, 17th-century French novelists, Members of the Académie française

Marin le Roy, sieur du Parc et de Gomberville (1600 – June 14, 1674) was a French poet and novelist.
He was born at Paris, and at fourteen he produced a volume of poetry. At twenty he wrote a Discours sur l'histoire and at twenty-two a pastoral, La Charité, which is really a novel. The characters, though disguised as shepherds and shepherdesses, represent real people for whose identification the author himself provides a key.
This was followed by a more ambitious work, Polexandre (5 vols. 1632–1637). The hero wanders through the world in search of the island home of the princess Alcidiane. It contains much history and geography; the travels of Polexandre extending to such unexpected places as Benin, the Canary Islands, Mexico and the Antilles, and incidentally we learn all that was then known of Mexican history.
Cythérée (4 vols.) appeared in 1630–1642, and in 1651 the Jeune Alcidiane, intended to undo any harm the earlier novels may have done, for Gomberville became a Jansenist and spent the last twenty-five years of his life in pious retirement. He was one of the earliest and most energetic members of the Académie française.

[[Tambogrande]]
CATEGORIES: Populated places in the Piura Region

Tambogrande is a small town in the Piura Province of the Piura Region in northwestern Peru that is most famous for successfully opposing a mining development in the area. With a population of 19,017 (1999 estimate), it is the main town in the Tambo Grande District. The town of Tambogrande is quite poor with high unemployment.  Its main industry is the growing of limes and mangoes on the very good land that surrounds the town.
Manhattan Minerals, a Canadian mining company, owned the mineral rights below the town and had found a large copper and gold deposit and proposed a scheme that would see the townspeople moved elsewhere and a large mine constructed.  In 1996 the Peruvian government agreed to the scheme.
Despite the promise of jobs and improved infrastructure the population balked at the proposal.  They did not want to see the town replaced with a kilometer wide pit and were concerned that the mining operation could generate enough pollution to destroy the region's agriculture and limited water supply.
An unprecedented protest resulted, led by local leaders of the town and the local Roman Catholic Church as well as international NGOs.  The decade long battle became violent at times, company machinery was vandalized and the leader of the protest murdered.  In 2002 the government agreed to a referendum and only 1.3% of the population voted in favour of the mine.  In 2003 the project was officially cancelled by the government of Peru.  In response the president of Manhattan Minerals, Graham Clow who had repeatedly agreed that if the people opposed the mine it wouldn't be built, was fired and the company has continued to try to convince the government of Peru to restart the project.
In 2006 a movie documenting the conflict in Tambogrande was released.

CATEGORIES: French poets, Members of the Académie française, 1594 births, 1661 deaths, 17th-century French writers

Antoine Girard, sieur de Saint-Amant (September 30, 1594 – December 29, 1661), French poet, was born near Rouen.
Saint-Amant's father was a merchant who had, according to his son's account, been a sailor and had commanded for 22 years "une escadre de la reine Elizabeth"—a vague statement that lacks confirmation. The son obtained a patent of nobility, and attached himself to different great noblemen—the duc de Retz and the comte d'Harcourt among others. He saw military service and sojourned at different times in Italy, in England—a sojourn which provoked from him a violent poetical attack on the country, Albion (1643)--in Poland, where he held a court appointment for two years, and elsewhere. Saint-Amant's later years were spent in France; and he died at Paris.
Saint-Amant has left a considerable body of poetry. His Albion and Rome ridicule set the fashion of the burlesque poem. In his later years he devoted himself to serious subjects and produced an epic, Moyse sauvé (1653). His best work consists of Bacchanalian songs, his Débauche being one of the most remarkable convivial poems of its kind.

Ensign [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|s|ən[/tpl] late 14c., via Scottish, from Old French enseigne (12c.) "mark, symbol, signal; flag, standard, pennant," from Latin insignia (plural) is a junior rank of a commissioned officer in the armed forces of some countries, normally in the infantry or navy. As the junior officer in an infantry regiment was traditionally the carrier of the ensign flag, the rank itself acquired the name.  This rank has generally been replaced in army ranks by second lieutenant.[tpl]cite web|title=Subaltern|url=http://rnza.co.nz/artillery_heritage/military_rank/subaltern.htm|work=Ranks|publisher=Southern Gunners|accessdate=31 January 2013[/tpl]  Ensigns were generally the lowest ranking commissioned officer, except where the rank of subaltern itself existed.[tpl]cite web|last=Troy|first=Michael|title=Rank of Ensign in Revolutionary Army|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/U-S-History-672/2011/10/rank-ensign-revolutionary-army.htm|work=All Experts:  U.S. History|publisher=About.com|accessdate=31 January 2013[/tpl]
"Ensign" is enseigne in French, Fähnrich in German, Vaandrig in Dutch (whereby despite the fact that "Fähnrich" and "Vaandrig" have a parallel etymology, they are not a junior officer but only an officer cadet rank), and chorąży in Polish, each of which derives from a term for a flag. The Spanish alférez and Portuguese alferes is a junior officer rank below lieutenant associated with carrying the flag, and so is often translated as "ensign".  Unlike the rank in other languages, its etymology has nothing to do with flags.
The NATO rank code is OF-1 (junior).

François-Xavier-Joseph Droz ([tpl]IPA-fr|dro[/tpl]; 31 December 1773 – 9 November 1850) was a French writer on ethics, political science and political economy.
He was born at Besançon, where his family had supplied many notable members of the legal profession. Droz's own legal studies led him to Paris in 1792; he arrived the day after the dethronement of King Louis XVI of France, and was present during the massacres of September. On the declaration of war he joined the volunteer battalion of the Doubs, and for the next three years served in the Army of the Rhine.
Discharged on health grounds, he obtained a much more congenial post in the newly founded école centrale of Besançon; and in 1799 he made his first appearance as an author by an Essai sur l'art oratoire (Paris, Fructidor, An VII.), in which he acknowledges his indebtedness more especially to Hugh Blair.
Moving to Paris in 1803, he became friendly not only with the like-minded Ducis, but also with the sceptical Cabanis; and it was on this philosopher's advice that, in order to catch the public ear, he produced the romance of Lina, which Sainte-Beuve has characterized as a mingled echo of Florian and Werther.
Like several other literary men of the time, he obtained a post in the revenue office known as the Droits runis; but from 1814 he devoted himself exclusively to literature and became a contributor to various journals. Already favorably known by his Essai sur l'art d'être heureux (Paris, 1806), his Éloge de Montaigne (1812), and his Essai sur le beau dans les arts (1815), he not only gained the Montyon Prize in 1823 by his work De la philosophie morale ou des différents systèmes sur la science de la vie, but also in 1824 obtained admission to the Académie française.
The main doctrine that this treatise seeks to inculcate is that society will never be in a proper state until men have been educated to think of their duties and not of their rights. It was followed in 1825 by Application de la morale à la politique, and in 1829 by L'économie politique ou principes de la science des richesses, a methodical and clearly written treatise, which was edited by Michel Chevalier in 1854. His next and greatest work was a Histoire du règne de Louix XVI in three volumes (Paris, 1839 1842). As he advanced in life, Droz became more and more decidedly religious, and the last work of his prolific pen was Pensées sur le christianisme (1842). In the words of Sainte-Beuve, "he was born and he remained all his life of the race of the good and the just."
He died in Paris.

[[Les Charlots]]

CATEGORIES: Living people, French comedians, French comedy musicians, French musical groups

Les Charlots was a group of French musicians, singers, comedians and film actors, who were very popular in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. 
The group was active first from 1965 to 1966 as "Les Problèmes", the backup band for French singer Antoine. They renamed themselves Les Charlots and remained active from 1966 to 1997, then again briefly from 2008 to 2011 (as a duo). Les Charlots means "the clowns" or "the idiots" rather than being a direct reference to Charlie Chaplin, who was generally called Charlot in France.
Their light-hearted comedy style was influenced by the style of popular Italian group Brutos and by the anarchist humor of the Marx Brothers.
The five members were Gérard Rinaldi (vocals / saxophone / accordion), Jean Sarrus (bass / backing vocals), Gérard Filipelli, a.k.a. "Phil" (guitar / backing vocals), Luis Rego (rhythm guitar / piano / backing vocals) and Jean-Guy Fechner (drums / backing vocals).
Filipelli was nicknamed "Phil" as there were two "Gérard" in the group.
Each member was easily recognizable : Rinaldi was the straight good-looking one with the crooner voice,  Sarrus was the small one with the moustache and funny mimics, Filipelli was the tall blonde one who often found himself accidentally bare-assed in their films, Rego was the sarcastic Portuguese one and Fechner was the tall one a big bushy beard.

[[Land claim]]

CATEGORIES: Geography terminology

Land claims are a legal declaration of desired control over areas of property including bodies of water. The phrase is usually only used with respect to disputed or unresolved land claims. Some types of land claims include aboriginal land claims, Antarctic land claims, and post-colonial land claims.
Land claims is sometimes used as a term when referring to disputed territories like Western Sahara or to refer to the claims of displaced persons. 
In the colonial times of the United States persons could claim a piece of land for themselves and the claim has different level of merit according to the de facto conditions:
Today, claiming land is no longer possible, yet large plots of land with little economical value (e.g., in Alaska) can still be bought for very low prices. Also, in certain parts of the world, land can still be obtained by making productive use of it.

Gabriel-Henri Gaillard (1726 – 13 February 1806), French historian, was born at Ostel, Picardy.
He was educated for the bar, but after finishing his studies adopted a literary career, ultimately devoting his chief attention to history. He was already a member of the Academy of Inscriptions and, Belles-lettres (1760), when, after the publication of the three first volumes of his Histoire de la rivalité de la France et d'Angleterre, he was elected to the Académie française (1771); and when Napoleon created the Institute he was admitted into its third class (Académie française) in 1803. For forty years he was the intimate friend of Malesherbes, whose life (1805) he wrote. He died at St Firmin, near Chantilly, on the 13th of February 1806.
Gaillard is painstaking and impartial in his statement of facts, and his style is correct and elegant, but the unity of his narrative is somewhat destroyed by digressions, and by his method of treating war, politics, civil administration, and ecclesiastical affairs under separate heads.
His most important work is his Histoire de la rivalité de la France et de l'Angleterre (in 11 vols., 1771–1777); and among his other works may be mentioned:

The Third Treaty of San Ildefonso (formally titled the Preliminary and Secret Treaty between the French Republic and His Catholic Majesty the King of Spain, Concerning the Aggrandizement of His Royal Highness the Infant Duke of Parma in Italy and the Retrocession of Louisiana) was a secretly negotiated treaty between France and Spain in which Spain returned the colonial territory of Louisiana to France. The treaty was concluded on October 1, 1800 between Louis Alexandre Berthier representing France and Don Mariano Luis de Urquijo for Spain. The treaty was negotiated under some duress, as Spain was under pressure from Napoleon, although Spain did gain the Tuscany area. The terms of the treaty did not specify the boundaries of the territory being returned, which later became a point of contention between Spain and the United States after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, in which France sold its territory to the United States. This treaty also affirmed the earlier Treaty of Alliance signed at San Ildefonso on August 19, 1796. That treaty is sometimes also referred to as the Treaty of San Ildefonso.

Robert of Ghent or Robert de Gant (c. 1085-after 1154) was Lord Chancellor of England and Dean of York in the 12th-century. The younger son of a nobleman, Robert was probably a member of the cathedral chapter of York before his selection as chancellor by King Stephen of England in the mid-1140s. He is not mentioned often in documents from his time as chancellor, but why this is so is unknown. He became dean at York Minster around 1147. Robert was slightly involved in the disputes over who would be Archbishop of York in the late 1140s and 1150s, but it is likely that his chancellorship prevented his deeper involvement in diocesan affairs. He was no longer chancellor after the death of Stephen, but probably continued to hold the office of dean until his death around 1157 or 1158.

The Curlew is a song cycle by Peter Warlock on poems by W. B. Yeats. It is generally considered one of the composer's finest works.
It was written between 1920 and 1922 for singer and an unusual accompanying group of flute, cor anglais and string quartet (two violins, viola and cello). Warlock completed the work in Cefn Bryntalch, his family home in Llandyssil, near Montgomery in Wales.
There are four songs, with a short instrumental interlude. The poems they are based on (with the first line in parentheses) are:
The first, second and last of these poems were taken from The Wind Among the Reeds (pub. 1899), and "The Withering of the Boughs" from In the Seven Woods (pub. 1904).
There is a lengthy instrumental introduction to the first song, in which the cry of the curlew is represented by the cor anglais and the peewit by the flute. The songs, which concern lost love, are melancholy in mood.
A number of motif elements recur throughout the songs dependent on the point in the text - a structural technique also found in many others of Warlock's songs.
The cycle lasts around twenty-five minutes.

CATEGORIES: Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, Monoamine reuptake inhibitors, Drugs acting on the nervous system

Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are a class of antidepressant drugs used in the treatment of major depression and other mood disorders. They are sometimes also used to treat anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), and for the relief of menopausal symptoms.
SNRIs are potent inhibitors of serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE, noradrenalin) reuptake. These neurotransmitters are known to play an important role in mood. These can be contrasted with the more widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which act upon serotonin alone.
The human serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) are membrane proteins that are responsible for the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Balanced dual inhibition of monoamine reuptake can possibly offer advantages over other antidepressants drugs by treating a wider range of symptoms.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=19740668|year=2009|last1=Cashman|first1=JR|last2=Ghirmai|first2=S|title=Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and inhibition of phosphodiesterase by multi-target inhibitors as potential agents for depression|volume=17|issue=19|pages=6890–7|doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2009.08.025|journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry[/tpl]
SNRIs are second-generation agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs). Over the past two decades, second-generation agents have gradually replaced first-generation agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) as the drugs of choice for the treatment of MDD. This is mainly because of their improved tolerability and safety profile.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=18691982|year=2008|last1=Spina|first1=E|last2=Santoro|first2=V|last3=d'Arrigo|first3=C|title=Clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions with second-generation antidepressants: An update|volume=30|issue=7|pages=1206–27|journal=Clinical therapeutics|doi=10.1016/S0149-2918(08)80047-1[/tpl]

Becket's supporters called Ridel the "archidiabolus",Warren Henry II p. 535 or "our archdevil", a play on the office of archdeacon which Ridel held. Ridel also urged King Henry's son, Henry the Young King, to refuse to see the archbishop in 1170, telling the prince that Becket wished to disinherit the prince.

[[Oblate spheroid]]

CATEGORIES: Planetary science, Quadrics, Surfaces

An oblate spheroid is a rotationally symmetric ellipsoid having a polar axis shorter than the diameter of the equatorial circle whose plane bisects it.[tpl]MathWorld|OblateSpheroid|Oblate Spheroid[/tpl] Oblate spheroids are contracted along a line, whereas prolate spheroids are elongated.
It can be formed by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis, forming an equator with the end points of the major axis.  As with all ellipsoids, it can also be described by the lengths of three mutually perpendicular principal axes, which are in this case two arbitrary equatorial semi-major axes and one semi-minor axis.
An everyday example of an oblate spheroid is the shape of confectionery such as Smarties or M&M's. The shape of the Earth (geoid) is very close to that of an oblate spheroid. Though local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, on a global scale these deviations are very small.

The Contender is a reality television series that follows a group of boxers as they compete with one another in an elimination-style competition, while their lives and relationships with each other and their families  are depicted.  Produced by Mark Burnett, the show is hosted by Sugar Ray Leonard, who shared hosting duties in the first season with actor Sylvester Stallone. Leonard also serves as a trainer on the show, along with Tommy Gallagher.  During the first season, boxing manager Jackie Kallen also served as counsel to the boxers.
The show ran for fifteen weeks through 2005 on NBC in the United States of America.  The show ran in the UK on ITV2 and was repeated later in the week on ITV1, and now airs on ITV4.  It also aired on AXN in India, and on the Spanish language network Telemundo.  The second season, featuring welterweight contenders, premiered in the U.S. on Tuesday, July 18, 2006, at 10 pm ET/PT, on ESPN.  The third season, featuring super middleweight contenders, premiered in the U.S. on Tuesday, September 4, 2007, at 10 pm ET/PT, on ESPN. The fourth season, featuring cruiserweight contenders, premiered in the U.S. on Wednesday, December 3, 2008, at 10 pm ET/PT, on Versus.
The series’ tagline is “The Next Great Human Drama”, and its soundtrack was scored by Hans Zimmer. Before the show premiered, rival US television Fox network rushed to air a competing show The Next Great Champ, hosted by Oscar de la Hoya. The show performed very poorly, with the final episodes being relegated to cable FSN. In an effort to distance itself from the Fox disaster, NBC opted to hold airing its show until spring 2005.
The show takes the format of a gameshow, with the boxers divided into two teams based on their place of residence in the United States: East Coast or West Coast (or simply “East” and “West”). These teams live together in group living quarters, in Pasadena, California in the historic Royal Laundry Building on Raymond Avenue, and compete for the right to choose which of their team members fights that week, and who he fights against. Most of the second half of the hour-long episodes are devoted to that fight: the loser is eliminated.
On February 14, 2005, one of the 16 contestants, Najai Turpin, despondent over personal matters, committed suicide, shooting himself while sitting with his girlfriend in a parked car outside the West Philadelphia gym where he trained. In his memory, the producers set up a trust fund for his daughter Anyae. The show still aired in its entirety, but with a special tribute to Turpin.
On May 16, 2005, the series was cancelled. The first season cost NBC $2,000,000 per episode. Reruns were seen on CNBC. On August 11, 2005, ESPN announced that it was picking up the rights to a second season of the show, which began airing on the network in July 2006, although special editions under the Contender title are currently airing as of March, 2006. ESPN also announced that it has options to renew the series for two additional seasons. However, on April 10, 2008, ESPN announced that it was canceling the series. Executive producer Jeff Wald maintained that the show would continue on another network.The Contender: Boxing Series Cancelled for a Second Time – Will It Return for Round Three? | TV Series Finale It was later announced the show would move to Versus.

Pirate havens are ports or harbors that are a safe place for pirates to repair their vessels, resupply, recruit, spend their plunder, avoid capture, and/or lie in wait for merchant ships to pass by. The areas have governments that are unable or unwilling to enforce maritime laws. This creates favorable conditions for pirates and piracy.
These havens were often near maritime shipping lanes. Although some havens were merely hidden coves, some were established by governments who employed privateers to disrupt the overseas trade of rival nations.
Some historic pirate havens included Barataria Bay, Port Royal, and Tortuga. These provided some autonomy for privateers and buccaneers.

The route is so-named because the influential 20th-century Japanese philosopher and Kyoto University  professor Nishida Kitaro is thought to have used it for daily meditation. It passes a number of temples and shrines such as Hōnen-in, Ōtoyo Shrine, and Eikan-dō Zenrin-ji. It takes about 30 minutes to complete the walk, although many people spend more time visiting the sights along the way. On the northern part of the walk, there are good views of the nearby Daimonji. The walk is a popular destination for tourists and locals, especially during hanami.

Texas Country Reporter is a weekly syndicated television program, hosted and produced by Bob Phillips, which airs in all twenty-two Texas media markets, generally on weekends. Reruns are broadcast nationally on the satellite/cable channel RFD-TV.Texas Country Reporter: Showtimes. Retrieved April 11, 2008. As of April 2008, Phillips had already taped two thousand episodes of the program."If It's in Texas, the Texas Country Reporter Has Seen It", The New York Times, April 10, 2008. Retrieved April 11, 2008. Since that time about two hundred other segments have been aired.
Texas Country Reporter showcases Texas people and places, with an emphasis on rural areas and in a style similar to that of Charles Kuralt's On the Road for CBS News. Originally called 4 Country Reporter, it debuted in 1972 on Dallas television station KDFW, Channel 4 and was first hosted by John Mclean, then Jeff Rosser, and finally Bob Philips. In 1986, Phillips left KDFW and began selling the show in syndication under the name Texas Country Reporter.  In the Dallas market, KDFW did not pick up the syndicated version, but rival station WFAA did and named the show 8 Country Reporter. About this time Dairy Queen became the show's main sponsor, a move which allowed Phillips to be the spokesman for the chain in its advertising for the company's Texas-based restaurants.
The show is independently syndicated with Phillips retaining half of the advertisements for regional sponsors; he appears in many of the regional ads, and the sponsors' logos adorn the back of the his SUV. Each fall the program headlines a "Texas Country Reporter Festival" in Waxahachie south of Dallas, with some of the people who have been highlighted on the show in attendance.Bob Phillips Texas Country Reporter Festival, 2007. Retrieved September 9, 2007.Waxahachie Downtown: Annual Bob Phillips Texas Country Reporter Festival, WaxahachieDowntown.com. Retrieved September 9, 2007.

A three-DVD highlights set, Go! Stay! Eat!, was released September 17, 2005.
A national version of the show, On the Road With Bob Phillips, was planned to debut in 2010; Phillips previously did sixty stories in thirty-five states as part of a "Texas Country Reporter Discovers America" series for the show's 25th anniversary in 1998.

The Newburgh Conspiracy was what appeared to be a threatened uprising in the Continental Army in March 1783, when the American Revolutionary War was at its end.  Possibly instigated by political actors in the Congress of the Confederation, an anonymous letter was circulated in the army camp at Newburgh, New York, on March 10, 1783.  The letter suggested that the army, whose soldiers were discontented over pay that was in arrears and a lack of funding for promised pensions, should take unspecified action against Congress to resolve the issue.  The letter was written by Major John Armstrong, aide to General Horatio Gates, although the authorship of its text and underlying ideas is a subject of historical debate.
Commander-in-Chief George Washington stopped any serious talk by appealing successfully to his officers to support the supremacy of Congress in an emotional address on March 15.  Not long afterward, Congress approved a compromise agreement it had previously rejected: some of the pay arrears were funded, and soldiers were granted five years of full pay instead of a lifetime pension of half pay.
The motivations of numerous actors in these events are the subject of debate.  Some historians allege that serious consideration was given within the army to some sort of coup d'état, while others dispute the notion.  The exact motivations of congressmen involved in communications with army officers implicated in the events are similarly debated.

[[Ol Chiki alphabet]]

CATEGORIES: Alphabets, Santhal, Munda scripts

The Ol Chiki script, also known as Ol Cemetʼ (Santali: ol 'writing', cemet[tpl]'[/tpl] 'learning'), Ol Ciki, Ol, and sometimes as the Santali alphabet, was created in 1925 by Raghunath Murmu for the Santali language. 
Previously, Santali had been written with the Latin alphabet. But because Santali is not an Indo-Aryan language (like most other languages in the south of India), Indic scripts did not have letters for all of Santali's phonemes, especially its stop consonants and vowels, which made writing the language accurately in an unmodified Indic script difficult. The detailed analysis was given by Dr. Byomkes Chakrabarti in his 'Comparative Study of Santali and Bengali'. Missionaries (first of all Paul Olaf Bodding, a Norwegian) brought the Latin script, which is better at representing Santali stops, phonemes and nasal sounds with the use of diacritical marks and accents. Unlike most Indic scripts, which are derived from Brahmi, Ol Chiki is not an abugida, with vowels given equal representation with consonants. Additionally, it was designed specifically for the language, but one letter could not be assigned to each phoneme because the sixth vowel in Ol Chiki is still problematic.
Ol Chiki has 30 letters, the forms of which are intended to evoke natural shapes. Linguist Norman Zide said "The shapes of the letters are not arbitrary, but reflect the names for the letters, which are words, usually the names of objects or actions representing conventionalized form in the pictorial shape of the characters."Ol Chiki script It is written from left to right.

[[Right of first refusal]]

[tpl]About|agreements restricting rights to sell one's own property|restrictions on EU use of NATO assets|European integration#Military[tpl]![/tpl]Military aspects of European integration[/tpl]
Right of first refusal (ROFR or RFR) is a contractual right that gives its holder the option to enter a business transaction with the owner of something, according to specified terms, before the owner is entitled to enter into that transaction with a third party. In brief, the right of first refusal is similar in concept to a call option.
An ROFR can cover almost any sort of asset, including real estate, personal property, a patent license, a screenplay, or an interest in a business. It might also cover business transactions that are not strictly assets, such as the right to enter a joint venture or distribution arrangement. In entertainment, a right of first refusal on a concept or a screenplay would give the holder the right to make that movie first.  Only if the holder turns it down may the owner then shop it around to other parties.
Because an ROFR is a contract right, the holder's remedies for breach are typically limited to recovery of damages. In other words, if the owner sells the asset to a third party without offering the holder the opportunity to purchase it first, the holder can then sue the owner for damages but may have a difficult time obtaining a court order to stop or reverse the sale.  However, in some cases the option becomes a property right that may be used to invalidate an improper sale.
An ROFR differs from a Right of First Offer (ROFO, also known as a Right of First Negotiation) in that the ROFO merely obliges the owner to undergo exclusive good faith negotiations with the rights holder before negotiating with other parties. A ROFR is an option to enter a transaction on exact or approximate transaction terms. A ROFO is merely an agreement to negotiate.

Arte (Association Relative à la Télévision Européenne) is a Franco-German TV network, a European channel, that promotes programming in the areas of culture and the arts. It is made up of three separate companies: the Strasbourg-based European Economic Interest Grouping Arte GEIE plus two member companies acting as editorial and programme production centres, Arte France in Paris (France) and Arte Deutschland in Baden-Baden (Germany). As an international joint venture (an EEIG), its programs cater technically to audiences from both France and Germany. This implies double-titling, opposite-language subtitling, dubbing, hosts who speak both languages alternately, and two separate audio tracks (through DVB-T, satellite television and digital cable).
Three-quarters of ARTE’s programming are provided in equal proportion by the two member companies Arte France and Arte Deutschland while the remainder is being provided by Arte GEIE and the channel’s European partners. 
Arte France was formerly known as La Sept (La Société d'édition des programmes de télévision, but also a play on words, given that the name means the seventh (network) and La Sept existed while the fifth network was still La Cinq; it made satellite television programs at the time) and by ARTE Deutschland GmbH, a subsidiary of the two main public German TV networks ARD and ZDF.
Arte has also an on-line radio web site, called Arte Radio.

[[Titus Tatius]]

CATEGORIES: 8th-century BC Romans, Ancient people

The traditions of ancient Rome held that Titus Tatius (d. 748 BC) was the Sabine king of Cures, who, after the rape of the Sabine women, attacked Rome and captured the Capitol with the treachery of Tarpeia. The Sabine women, however, convinced Tatius and the Roman king, Romulus, to reconcile and subsequently they ruled jointly over the Romans and Sabines. Rome was to retain its name and each citizen was to be called a Roman, but as a community they were to be called Quirites; the Sabines were to be incorporated in the state and admitted into the tribes and curies. After this arrangement had lasted for five years it came to an end by the death of Tatius, who was killed out of revenge by the inhabitants of Lavinium, leaving Romulus to rule alone, and Tatius is thus not counted as one of the traditional "Seven Kings of Rome".
He had one daughter Tatia, who married Numa Pompilius (Romulus's successor), and one son, who was the ancestor of the noble family of Tatii.

The Master is a fictional character on the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003). He is a centuries-old vampire portrayed by Mark Metcalf, determined to open the portal to hell below Sunnydale High School in the fictional town of Sunnydale where the main character Buffy Summers lives. The premise of the series is that Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a Slayer, a teenage girl endowed with superhuman strength and other powers which she uses to kill vampires and other evil beings. Each season of the series Buffy and the small group of family and friends who work with her, nicknamed the Scooby Gang, must defeat an evil force referred to as the Big Bad; the villain is usually trying to bring on an apocalypse. The Master is the first season's Big Bad.
The Master is the head of an ancient order of vampires, a classic Old World villain devoted to ritual and prophecy. He has been entombed beneath Sunnydale for 60 years as the patriarch of a cult posed opposite Buffy, a character who was created to subvert media tropes about frail women falling victim to evil characters. Her youth and insistence on asserting her free will makes her unique in the Master's experience, but he is devoted to fulfilling a prophecy that states he will kill the Slayer and initiate the extermination of all humanity.

[[Haboob]]

CATEGORIES: Arabic words and phrases, Storm, Weather hazards

A haboob ([tpl]lang-ar|هَبوب[/tpl] habūb "blasting/drafting") is a type of intense dust storm carried on an atmospheric gravity current.  Haboobs occur regularly in arid regions throughout the world.
They have been observed in the Sahara desert (typically Sudan, where they were named and described), as well as across the Arabian Peninsula, throughout Kuwait, and in the most arid regions of Iraq.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1002/qj.49705121305|title=Haboobs|year=2007|last1=Sutton|first1=L. J.|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=51|issue=213|pages=25–30[/tpl] African haboobs result from the northward summer shift of the inter-tropical front into North Africa, bringing moisture from the Gulf of Guinea. Haboob winds in the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Kuwait, and North America are frequently created by the collapse of a thunderstorm, while haboobs in Australia may be frequently associated with cold fronts. The deserts of Central Australia, especially near Alice Springs, are particularly prone to haboobs, with sand and debris reaching several kilometers into the sky and leaving up to a foot of sand in the haboob's path.
The arid and semiarid regions of North America—in fact, any dry region—may experience haboobs.    In North America the most common terms for these events is either dust storm or sandstorm.  In the U.S., they frequently occur in the deserts of Arizona, including around the cities of Yuma and Phoenix[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1972)0532.0.CO;2|year=1972|volume=53|issue=10|pages=930–935|title=An American Haboob|last1=Idso|first1=S.

When this downdraft of cold air, or downburst, reaches the ground, it blows dry, loose silt and clay (collectively, dust) up from the desert, creating a wall of sediment that precedes the storm cloud. This wall of dust can be up to [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] wide and several kilometers in elevation. At their strongest, haboob winds often travel at [tpl]convert|35|–|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl], and they may approach with little or no warning. Often rain does not appear at ground level as it evaporates in the hot, dry air (a phenomenon known as virga). The evaporation cools the rushing air even further and accelerates it.  Occasionally, when the rain does persist, it can contain a considerable quantity of dust. Severe cases are called mud storms. Eye and respiratory system protection are advisable for anyone who must be outside during a haboob. Moving to shelter is highly desirable during a strong event.

CATEGORIES: Singing, Italian opera terminology

Passaggio is a term used in classical singing to describe the pitch ranges in which vocal registration events occur. Beneath passaggio is the chest voice where any singer can produce a powerful sound, and above it lies the head voice, where a powerful and resonant sound is accessible, but usually only through training. The historic Italian school of singing describes a primo passaggio and a secondo passaggio connected through a zona di passaggio in both the male and female voice. A major goal of classical voice training in classical styles is to maintain an even timbre throughout the passaggio. Through proper training, it is possible to produce a resonant and powerful sound.

KGB is a video game released for the Commodore Amiga and IBM PC Compatible computers in 1992. Set in the decadent final days of the Soviet Union, KGB is considered to be quite difficult, even for experienced gamers, since it relies on a real time clock and correct/wrong answers which can end the game immediately or after an event needed to be triggered; also, players may make errors which they will notice only hours later in-game. The game engine, graphics and interface have plenty of similarities with Cryo's Dune. 
KGB was also released on CD under the title Conspiracy, which included clips of Rukov's father played by Donald Sutherland giving advice. In the CD version, all references to "KGB" within the game and manual were changed to "Conspiracy".

[[Bed load]]

CATEGORIES: Geomorphology, Sedimentology

The term bed load or bedload describes particles in a flowing fluid (usually water) that are transported along the bed. Bed load is complementary to suspended load and wash load.
Bed load moves by rolling, sliding, and/or saltating (hopping).
Generally, bed load downstream will be smaller and more rounded than bed load upstream (a process known as downstream fining).  This is due in part to attrition and abrasion which results from the stones colliding with each other and against the river channel, thus removing the rough texture (rounding) and reducing the size of the particles. However, selective transport of sediments also plays a role in relation to downstream fining: smaller-than average particles are more easily entrained than larger-than average particles, since the shear stress required to entrain a grain is linearly proportional to the diameter of the grain. However, the degree of size selectivity is restricted by the hiding effect described by Parker and Klingeman (1982), wherein larger particles protrude from the bed whereas small particles are shielded and hidden by larger particles, with the result that nearly all grain sizes become entrained at nearly the same shear stress.

Dead zones are hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas in the world's oceans and large lakes, caused by "excessive nutrient pollution from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete the oxygen required to support most marine life in bottom and near-bottom water. (NOAA)." In the 1970s oceanographers began noting increased instances of dead zones. These occur near inhabited coastlines, where aquatic life is most concentrated. (The vast middle portions of the oceans, which naturally have little life, are not considered "dead zones".)
In March 2004, when the recently established UN Environment Programme published its first Global Environment Outlook Year Book (GEO Year Book 2003), it reported 146 dead zones in the world's oceans where marine life could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels. Some of these were as small as a square kilometre (0.4 mi²), but the largest dead zone covered 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 mi²). A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.

Boundaries were redrawn following the population changes to each district as determined by the 1990, 2000, and 2010 Censuses. Although early projections suggested that Oregon might gain a sixth congressional district as a result of the 2010 Census, the state's population was about 42,000 people short of gaining a new district.

Mario Lanza (born Alfred Arnold Cocozza; January 31, 1921 – October 7, 1959) was an American tenor, actor, and Hollywood movie star of the late 1940s and the 1950s.
Lanza began studying to be a professional singer at the age of 16. After appearing at the Hollywood Bowl in 1947, Lanza signed a seven-year contract with MGM's head, Louis B. Mayer, who saw his performance and was impressed by his singing. Prior to this, the adult Lanza had sung only two performances of an opera. The following year (1948), however, he would sing the role of Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly in New Orleans.Bessette, Roland L. Mario Lanza: Tenor in Exile, Amadeus (1999), p. 65
His movie debut was in That Midnight Kiss (1949) with Kathryn Grayson and Ethel Barrymore. The following year, in The Toast of New Orleans, his featured popular song "Be My Love" became his first million-selling hit. In 1951, he played the role of Enrico Caruso (1873–1921), his tenor idol, in the biopic, The Great Caruso, which produced another million-seller with "The Loveliest Night of the Year" (a song which used the melody of Sobre las Olas). The Great Caruso was the top-grossing film that year.Vogel, Michelle. Children of Hollywood, McFarland (2005), p. 65
The title song of his next film, Because You're Mine, was his final million-selling hit song. The song went on to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. After recording the soundtrack for his next film, The Student Prince, he embarked upon a protracted battle with Studio Head Dore Schary arising from artistic differences with director Curtis Bernhardt, and was eventually dismissed by MGM.Mario Lanza (I) – Biography
Lanza was known to be "rebellious, tough, and ambitious", and during most of his film career, he suffered from addictions to overeating and alcohol which had a serious effect on his health and his relationships with directors, producers and, occasionally, other cast members. Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper writes that "his smile, which was as big as his voice, was matched with the habits of a tiger cub, impossible to housebreak". She adds that he was the "last of the great romantic performers".Hopper, Hedda. The Whole Truth and Nothing But, Pyramid Books (1963) ch. 18 He made three more films before dying of an apparent pulmonary embolism at the age of 38. At the time of his death in 1959 he was still "the most famous tenor in the world". Author Eleonora Kimmel concludes that Lanza "blazed like a meteor whose light lasts a brief moment in time".Kimmel, Eleonora. Altered and Unfinished Lives, A.F.A. (2006) p. 191

[[Equipotential surface]]

CATEGORIES: Multivariable calculus, Fluid mechanics, Surfaces

Equipotential surfaces are surfaces of constant scalar potential.  They are used to visualize an (n)-dimensional scalar potential function in (n-1) dimensional space.  The gradient of the potential, denoting the direction of greatest increase, is perpendicular to the surface.  
In electrostatics, the work done to move a charge from any point on the equipotential surface to any other point on the equipotential surface is zero since they are at the same potential. Furthermore, equipotential surfaces are always perpendicular to the net electric field lines passing through it.
The term is used in electrostatics, fluid mechanics, and geodesy.

[[Equity loan]]

CATEGORIES: Personal finance, Loans, Mortgage

United Kingdom (UK)
In the UK an "Equity Loan" is the term used to describe additional borrowing, normally secured as a subsequent charge, as a top-up to the amount a home owner/purchaser can borrow from a main mortgage provider.
Often used by builders to encourage house sales but now also used by the UK governments to assist purchasers who would otherwise be unable to buy with only a conventional main mortgage.
In England such loans are managed on behalf of the government by the Homes & Communities Agency. Devolved governments have their own separate schemes.
Elsewhere in the world
Elsewhere in the world an equity loan may refer to a mortgage loan in which the borrower receives money. Typically the loan is secured by real estate already owned outright.
For example, if a person owns a home worth $100,000, but does not currently have a mortgage on it, they may take an equity loan at 80% loan to value (LTV) or $80,000 in cash in exchange for a mortgage on the title.
Many lending institutions require the borrower to repay only an interest component of the loan each month (calculated daily, and compounded to the loan once each month). The borrower can apply any surplus funds to the outstanding loan principal at any time, reducing the amount of interest calculated from that day onward. Some loan products also allow the possibility to redraw cash up to the original LTV, potentially perpetuating the life of the loan beyond the original loan term.
The interest rate applied to equity loans is much lower than that applied to unsecured loans, such as credit card debt.  The reasoning behind this is that equity loans involve collateral, and credit card debt does not.

Dalis Car was a musical group formed in 1984 by Peter Murphy (vocalist), Mick Karn (bassist, keyboardist, guitarist, saxophonist) and Paul Vincent Lawford (rhythm construction). The band was formed soon after Murphy and Karn left their former bands (Bauhaus and Japan, respectively). They took their name from a Captain Beefheart song from his album, Trout Mask Replica.[tpl]cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781843531050|edition=3|editor=Peter Buckley|accessdate=4 October 2012|page=264|chapter=Dali's Car|quote=...Mick Karn, ex-bassist with arty New Wave band Japan, and Peter Murphy, ex-vocalist with arty gothic punks Bauhaus. They took their name from a Captain Beefheart...[/tpl] Initially, they recorded one album, The Waking Hour (UK No. 84), and released one single, "The Judgement is the Mirror" (UK No. 66). The cover of the album features a detail from Maxfield Parrish's seminal painting Daybreak.
The recording of the album took place in unusual circumstances, as neither Karn nor Murphy spent much time together in the recording studio, preferring to send tapes back and forth between each other, to work on alone.
In August 2010, Peter Murphy announced on Twitter that he and Karn were planning to head into the studio in September to begin work on the second Dalis Car album.Slicingupeyeballs.com The project was cut short, however, as Karn had recently been diagnosed with cancer. He died on 4 January 2011, thus ending the reunion.Meikle, James (2011) "Former Japan bass player Mick Karn loses battle with cancer", "The Guardian", 5 January 2011, retrieved 5 January 2011 The tracks they did record—including a re-working of Artemis from The Waking Hour with newly added vocals, guitar, and drums, and renamed Artemis Rise—were released on 5 April 2012 as an EP entitled InGladAloneness.Slicingupeyeballs.com The tracks were mixed by Steve Jansen, mastered by Pieter Snaper in Istanbul and the artwork for the EP was created by Murphy with Thomas Bak with a painting by Jaroslaw Kukowski. The Japanese version of the EP contains a memorial photo booklet with photos by Steve Jansen along with comments from fellow artists who have collaborated with Mick.
Artemis Rise was made available as a download through the Burning Shed MK Music store on Sunday 24 July, to commemorate what would have been Karn’s 53rd birthday. The song is an updated version of the song as it appeared on The Waking Hour, with added vocals by Murphy, drums by Jansen, and guitar by Jakszyk.

[[Electromagnetic propulsion]]
CATEGORIES: Propulsion, Electromagnetic components, Magnetic propulsion devices

Electromagnetic propulsion (EMP), is the principle of accelerating an object by the utilization of a flowing electrical current and magnetic fields. The electrical current is used to either create an opposing magnetic field, or to charge a fluid, which can then be repelled. It is well known that when a current flows through a conductor in a magnetic field, an electromagnetic force known as a Lorentz force, pushes the conductor in a direction perpendicular to the conductor and the magnetic field. This repulsing force is what causes propulsion in a system designed to take advantage of the phenomenon. The term electromagnetic propulsion (EMP) can be described by its individual components: electromagnetic- using electricity to create a magnetic field (electromagnetism), and propulsion- the process of propelling something. One key difference between EMP and propulsion achieved by electric motors is that the electrical energy used for EMP is not used to produce rotational energy for motion; though both use magnetic fields and a flowing electrical current.
The science of electromagnetic propulsion does not have origins with any one individual and has applications in many different fields. The thought of using magnets for propulsion continues to this day and has been dreamed of since at least 1897 when John Munro published his fictional story "A Trip to Venus".[tpl]cite book | last = Munro | first = John | title = A Trip to Venus | publisher = Jarrold & Sons | location = London | year = 1897 | pages = 26–28 | edition = 2007 IndyPublish ed. [/tpl], Archive.org: E-book: A Trip to Venus Current applications can be seen in maglev trains and military railguns. Other applications that remain not widely used or still in development include ion thruster for low orbiting satellites and magnetohydrodynamic drive for ships and submarines.

[[Orange-billed Babbler]]
CATEGORIES: Turdoides, Birds of Sri Lanka, Animals described in 1847

The Orange-billed Babbler (Turdoides rufescens) also known as Ceylon Rufous Babbler or Sri Lankan Rufous Babbler is a member of the Leiothrichidae family.
The Orange-billed Babbler is a resident breeding bird endemic to Sri Lanka. In the past, it was considered to be a race of Jungle Babbler, Turdoides striatus.
Its habitat is rainforest, and it is seldom seen away from deep jungle. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight.
Although its habitat is under threat, it occurs in all the forests of the wet zone, and is quite common at prime sites like Kitulgala and Sinharaja. It builds its nest in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is two or three deep greenish blue eggs.
These birds are plain orange brown below, and have a slightly darker shade above. The crown and nape are grey, and the bill is orange.
The Orange-billed Babbler lives in flocks of seven to ten or more. It is a noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. It is usually the first sign that a mixed-species feeding flock, so characteristic of Asian wet forests, is in the vicinity. It feeds mainly on insects, but also eats jungle berries.

[[United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe]]

CATEGORIES: 1944 establishments in the United States, Military units and formations established in 1944

The US Eighth Air Force in World War II, later designated the United States Strategic and Tactical Air Forces (USSTAF) was the first and became the overall command and control authority of the United States Army Air Forces against the European Axis members (and as the Eighth Air Force, responsible in and for the Northern Europe Theater) during World War II, where it had started as a complementary command to that of the smaller theater organized Ninth Air Force, Twelfth Air Force, and Fifteenth Air Forces. As the oldest command, initially beginning the earliest American operations in Europe as VIII Bomber Command, the Eighth had provided British liaison and strategic tasking guidance over each of those younger organizations throughout the war, whereas each had different command and control areas and responsibilities including those of the Mediterranean region air force operations.
With the in-depth Allied contacts and overall responsibility directly affecting the strategic bombing of industrial regions of Germany the Eighth's planning and intelligence staffs were the natural best choice to assert overall coordinated control with the D-Day pre-invasion needs of the Allies, under General Dwight D. Eisenhower as Supreme Allied Commander. Subsequently, the strategic bombing effort's intelligence, targeting and planning, co-ordination, including mission designation command and control were separated—not without controversy and opposition—from actual operations commands in direct control of air forces on 23 February 1944. The new command was organized on the large nucleus of Eighth Air Force planning staff members, thereby creating the USSTAF—at which time the USSTAF was also given mission planning control over other US Air Forces opposing Germany and Italy, and shrinking the man-power assigned to the Eighth Air Force in WWII.
The USSTAF was established with the redesignation of the former VIII Bomber Command as the Eighth Air Force on 22 February 1944. The strategic planning command staff of what had formerly been the Eight AF became a higher echelon command coordinating with the British in the target prioritization of the strategic bombing of the Axis. In this expanded role, USSTAF exercised operational control of the reorganized Eighth Air Force, the Ninth Air Force in the European Theater of Operations, and to an extent, the operations of Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations—all of which had theretofore exercised their own strategic planning.  USSTAF was the functional equivalent in Europe of U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific.

The Yellow-billed Babbler or White-headed Babbler (Turdoides affinis) is a member of the Leiothrichidae family endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. The Yellow-billed Babbler is a common resident breeding bird in Sri Lanka and southern India. Its habitat is scrub, cultivation and garden land. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight and is usually seen calling and foraging in groups. It is often mistaken for the Jungle Babbler, whose range overlaps in parts of southern India, although it has a distinctive call and tends to be found in more vegetated habitats. Its name is also confused with T. leucocephala, which is also known as White-headed Babbler.

[[Blackcap Babbler]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of Africa, Turdoides, Birds of Cameroon

The Blackcap Babbler, (Turdoides reinwardtii), is a member of the Leiothrichidae family. These are birds of tropical areas, with the greatest variety in southeast Asia.
The Blackcap Babbler is a common resident breeding bird in west Africa from Senegal to Cameroon. Its habitat is thick scrub and forest. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight.
It builds its cup-shaped nest in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is two or three eggs.
These birds have dark grey-brown upperparts. The head is brownish black with a white throat and conspicuous white eye ring. The underparts are white, mottled on the breast and with buff flanks.
The Blackcap Babbler lives in flocks of four to twelve or more, which help to raise the young communally. It is a noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. The main call is a  cha-ka-ta. It feeds mainly on insects, but also eats fruit.
The binomial commemorates the botanist Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt.

Though there were other ships of the Navy that had been named Dunkirk, as far back as the 1650s, it held added meaning after the dramatic, and at times, tragic and heroic evacuation from Dunkirk between late May and early June 1940, in which over 300,000 British, as well as French troops, were rescued by a ragtag fleet of ships. 
Dunkirk was built by Alexander Stephen and Sons of Govan. She was launched on 27 August 1945 and commissioned on 27 November 1946.

Before the creation of the college, instruction in veterinary medicine had been part of Cornell's curriculum since the university's founding. In 1868, when Cornell opened, there was little formal study of veterinary medicine in the United States; with the creation of the veterinary school, Cornell became a pioneer in the field.

Hans Herr (September 17, 1639 – October 11, 1725) was born in Zürich, Switzerland, a descendant of the Knight, Hugo Herr.  He joined the Swiss Brethren (later called Mennonites) and became a bishop. He was the first Mennonite bishop to emigrate to America.
When religious persecution became unendurable in Switzerland, many of his congregation emigrated with him to the Electorate of the Palatinate in Germany, which was governed by a ruler who promised them protection and religious freedom.  This was satisfactory until the Palatinate fell into the hands of other rulers, subjecting the Mennonites to severe religious persecution once again.
When this occurred, a number of them visited William Penn in London, in 1707, and arranged terms with him to colonize a portion of what is now Lancaster County, near what was then the western frontier of Pennsylvania. In 1709, Hans Herr, John R. Bundely, Martin Meylin (Mylin), Martin Kendig, Jacob Miller, Hans Funk, Hans Graff (Groff), Martin Oberholtzer, Wendel Bowman and others bought 10,000 acres (40 km²) of land on the south side of Pequea creek.  A warrant was issued for the land October 10, 1710, and it was surveyed October 23, 1710.[ref]
</ref>
The tradition (which has never been disproved) is that these immigrants held a conference as to what steps should be taken to inform their relatives and friends in Europe of their opinions and expectations of their new lands, and it was determined that Hans Herr, their revered minister, should return, explain the situation and the great advantages of emigration, and bring with him those he could induce to come.  He sailed to Europe and returned to America with many more immigrants, despite making the journey at 70 years old.  He had six sons.

The Morris Canal, sometimes called the Morris and Essex Canal, was a 107-mile (172-km) canal across northern New Jersey in the United States. In use from the late 1820s to the 1920s, it stretched from Phillipsburg on the Delaware River eastward to Jersey City on the Hudson River. It was considered a technical marvel for its water-driven inclined planes to cross the northern New Jersey hills.
Completed to Newark in 1831, the canal was extended eastward to Jersey City between 1834 and 1836.  It eased the transportation of anthracite coal from Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley to northern New Jersey's growing iron industry and other developing industries in New Jersey and the New York City area. It also carried iron ore westward to iron furnaces in western New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania until the development of Great Lakes iron ore caused them to decline. By the 1850s, the canal began to be eclipsed by the construction of railroads, although it remained in heavy use through the 1860s. It was leased to the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1871, taken over by the state of New Jersey late in 1922, and formally abandoned in 1924.
Although it was largely dismantled in the following five years, portions of the canal and its accompanying feeders and ponds are preserved. A greenway for cyclists and pedestrians is planned to use the old route through Jersey City.Morric Canal Greenway Plan North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority

Levi Lincoln, Sr. (May 15, 1749 – April 14, 1820) was an American revolutionary, lawyer, and statesman from Massachusetts.  A Democratic-Republican, he most notably served as Thomas Jefferson's first Attorney General, and played a significant role in the events that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison court case.  He served two terms as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, acting as Governor for the remainder of Governor James Sullivan's term after his death in December 1808. Lincoln was unsuccessful in his bid to be elected governor in his own right in 1809.
Born in Hingham, Massachusetts, Lincoln was educated at Harvard, and studied law with Joseph Hawley before establishing a law practice in Worcester, Massachusetts.  He was active in local politics, and participated in the convention that drafted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1779.  He supported Quock Walker, a former slave seeking confirmation of his freedom under that constitution in 1783.  He entered national politics with his election to the United States House of Representatives in 1800, but was immediately tapped by Jefferson to become Attorney General.  Lincoln served Jefferson as a consultant on the politics of New England, and was influential in the distribution of patronage in the region.  He served on a commission that resolved claims emanating from the Yazoo land scandal in Georgia, and advised Jefferson on matters related to the Louisiana Purchase.
He returned to Massachusetts, where he remained politically active in the state.  He established Republican dominance in Worcester, even though the state was dominated by Federalists.  He was elected lieutenant governor under James Sullivan in 1807, but failed to win election in his own right in 1809 in a highly partisan election.  He retired from politics in 1811, declining nomination to the Supreme Court because of his health.  His descendants were a major influence in Worcester for much of the 19th century.

Yentl is a play by Leah Napolin and Isaac Bashevis Singer.
Based on Singer's short story "Yentl the Yeshiva Boy," it centers on a young girl who defies tradition by discussing and debating Jewish law and theology with her rabbi father. When he dies, she cuts her hair, dresses as a man, and sets out to find a yeshiva where she can continue to study Talmud and live secretly as a male named Anshel. When her study partner Avigdor discovers the truth, Yentl's assertions that she is "neither one sex nor the other" and has "the soul of a man in the body of a woman" suggest the character is undergoing a gender identity crisis, especially when she opts to remain living as Anshel for the rest of her life.
After eleven previews, the Broadway production, directed by Robert Kalfin, opened on October 23, 1975 at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre, where it ran for 223 performances. The cast included Tovah Feldshuh, John Shea, and Lynn Ann Leveridge.

The Mercedes-Benz Superdome (originally Louisiana Superdome and commonly The Superdome) is a domed sports and exhibition venue, located in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. Plans were drawn up in 1967, by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of Curtis and Davis. Its steel frame covers a [tpl]Convert|13|acre|adj=on[/tpl] expanse. Its [tpl]Convert|273|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] dome is made of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of [tpl]Convert|680|ft|m[/tpl], making it the largest fixed domed structure in the world.The Superdome in New Orleans It is adjacent to the Smoothie King Center.
Because of the size and location in one of the major tourist destinations in the United States, the Superdome routinely makes the "short list" of candidates being considered for major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl, College Football Championship Game and the Final Four. It is the home stadium of the New Orleans Saints American football team.
In 2005, the Superdome gained international attention of a different type when it housed thousands of people seeking shelter from Hurricane Katrina.  The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm, and was closed for many months afterward.
On October 3, 2011, it was announced that German automaker Mercedes-Benz purchased naming rights to the stadium. The new name took effect on October 23, 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=Woodyard|first=Chris|title=Mercedes-Benz buys naming rights to New Orleans' Superdome|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/10/mercedes-benz-new-orleans-superdome-naming-rights-saints-bcs-super-bowl-2013/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=October 4, 2011|date=October 4, 2011[/tpl] It is the third stadium that has naming rights from Mercedes-Benz (and first in the United States), after the Mercedes-Benz Arena, the stadium of Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart, in Stuttgart, Germany and the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai, China.

CATEGORIES: 1938 births, Living people, 20th-century classical composers, French composers, 21st-century classical composers, French electronic musicians, Electroacoustic music composers

Jean-Claude Risset (18 March 1938, in Le Puy-en-Velay, France) is a French composer, best known for his pioneering contributions to computer music. He is a former student of André Jolivet and former co-worker of Max Mathews at Bell Labs.
Arriving at Bell Labs, New Jersey in 1964, he used Max Mathews' MUSIC IV software to digitally recreate the sounds of brass instruments. He made digital recordings of trumpets and studied their timbral composition using "pitch-synchronous" spectrum analysis tools, revealing that the amplitude and frequency of the harmonics (more correctly, partials) of these instruments would differ depending on frequency, duration and amplitude. He is also credited with performing the first experiments on a range of synthesis techniques including FM Synthesis and waveshaping.
After the discrete Shepard scale Risset created a version of the scale where the steps between each tone are continuous, and it is appropriately called the continuous Risset scale or Shepard-Risset glissando.
He has also created a similar effect with rhythm in which tempo seems to increase or decrease endlessly.

[[Doomsday rule]]

CATEGORIES: Gregorian calendar, Julian calendar, Calendar algorithms

The Doomsday rule or Doomsday algorithm is a way of calculating the day of the week of a given date. It provides a perpetual calendar since the Gregorian calendar moves in cycles of 400 years.
This algorithm for mental calculation was devised by John ConwayJohn Horton Conway, "Tomorrow is the Day After Doomsday", Eureka, volume 36, pages 28-31, October 1973.Richard Guy, John Horton Conway, Elwyn Berlekamp : "Winning Ways: For Your Mathematical Plays, Volume. 2: Games in Particular", pages 795-797, Academic Press, London, 1982, ISBN 0-12-091102-7. after drawing inspiration from Lewis Carroll's work on a perpetual calendar algorithm.Lewis Carroll, "To Find the Day of the Week for Any Given Date", Nature, March 31, 1887.Martin Gardner, "The Universe in a Handkerchief: Lewis Carroll's Mathematical Recreations, Games, Puzzles, and Word Plays", pages 24-26, Springer-Verlag, 1996 It takes advantage of the fact that each year has a certain day of the week (the doomsday) upon which certain easy-to-remember dates fall; for example, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, and the last day of February all occur on the same day of the week in any given year. Applying the Doomsday algorithm involves three steps:
This technique applies to both the Gregorian calendar A.D. and the Julian calendar, although their doomsdays will usually be different days of the week.
Since this algorithm involves treating days of the week like numbers modulo 7, John Conway suggests thinking of the days of the week as "Noneday" or "Sansday" (for Sunday), "Oneday", "Twosday", "Treblesday", "Foursday", "Fiveday", and "Six-a-day".
The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on.Alpert, Mark.

Frederick A. Shannon (May 4, 1921 in Mount Pleasant, Iowa – August 31, 1965 in Los Angeles County, California) was a U.S. herpetologist and medical doctor.
He was born the son of Fred Albert Shannon and Edna M. (Jones) Shannon.
In 1939, Shannon moved to Champaign, Illinois and began studying Zoology at the University of Illinois, where he got a B.A. in Zoology in 1943. He then started studying medicine and got an M.D. in 1947. He practised for one year at the St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona before going back to Illinois for some post-graduate herpetology work. In 1949 he moved to Wickenburg, Arizona.
Between 1951 and 1953, Shannon was sent as a Lieutenant to Korea, where he still found opportunities to collect many reptile specimens. Back in the U.S., he published many articles on poisonous snake bites, venomology, and herpetology. From 1956 on, he collected specimens mainly in Mexico.
He died from the bite of a Mojave Rattlesnake he had attempted to catch.California Death Index

HMS ''Vanguard was a British fast battleship built during World War II and commissioned after the war. She was the only ship of her class and was the biggest, fastest and last of the Royal Navy's battleships,McCart, pp. 1, 10 and the final battleship to be launched in the world. Work on the ship's design commenced before the war because the Royal Navy anticipated being outnumbered by the combined German and Japanese battleships in the early 1940s. The existing [tpl]sclass-|Lion|battleship|2[/tpl] design was modified to suit Vanguard''[tpl]'[/tpl]s main armament. The British had enough guns and gun turrets in storage to allow one battleship to be built relatively quickly, but the work was started and stopped several times during the war. Even after construction had begun, her design was revised several times to reflect war experience, and these changes prevented her from being completed during the war.
Vanguard[tpl]'[/tpl]s first task after completing her sea trial at the end of 1946 was, early the next year, to convey King George VI and his family on the first Royal Tour of South Africa by a reigning monarch.McCart, p. 42 While refitting after her return, she was selected for another Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1948. This was cancelled, however, by King George's declining health, and Vanguard briefly became flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1949. After her return home in mid-1949, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Throughout her career, the battleship usually served as the flagship of whichever unit she was assigned to. During the early 1950s, Vanguard was involved in a number of training exercises with NATO forces. In 1953 she participated in Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Review. While she was refitting in 1955, the Admiralty announced that the ship was going to be put into reserve upon completion of the work. Vanguard was sold for scrap and was broken up beginning in 1960.

[[Benefit (album)]]

Benefit is the third album by Jethro Tull, released in April 1970. It was the first Tull album to include pianist and organist John Evan – though he was not yet a permanent member of the group – and the last to include bass guitarist Glenn Cornick. It reached No. 3 in the UK album charts.Jethro Tull at Chart Archive. Retrieved 31 October 2012.
More hard-rocking and transcended from blues influences than its predecessor, Stand Up (1969), it also incorporated more advanced studio techniques, such as backward-recorded flute (on "With You There to Help Me") and piano, and sped-up guitar (on "Play in Time").
Ian Anderson said that Benefit was a 'guitar riff' album, made in a year when the musical groups were working on the idea that had come to prominence with bands like Cream, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. Anderson also noted that Benefit is "a rather dark and stark album, and although it has a few songs on it that are rather okay, I don't think it has the breadth, variety or detail that Stand Up has. But it was an evolution in terms of the band playing as 'a band.'". With the work on more studio effects and the addition of another band member (Evan), Anderson consider the album "a natural part of the group's evolution".http://www.tullpress.com/gwsept99.htm
The album have a American tour to supported it, songs like "With you there to help me" and to "To cry you a song" became part of the next year's repertoire of the band. Bassist Glenn Cornick said that, at this point: "I don't think the band was ever better than we were at that time."http://psychedelicbaby.blogspot.com.br/2011/12/glenn-cornick-interview-about-jethro.html

The Miao ([tpl]zh|c=苗|p=Miáo[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-vi|Mèo or H'Mông[/tpl]; Thai: แม้ว (Maew) or ม้ง (Mong); [tpl]lang-my|mun lu-myo[/tpl]) is an ethnic group recognized by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as one of the 55 official minority groups. Miao is a Chinese term and does not reflect the self-designations of the component nations of people, which include (with some variant spellings) Hmong, Hmu, A Hmao, and Kho (Qho) Xiong. The Chinese government has grouped these people and other non-Miao peoples together as one group, whose members may not necessarily be either linguistically or culturally related. For this reason, many Miao peoples cannot communicate with each other, and have different histories and cultures.  Some groups designated as Miao by the PRC do not even agree that they belong to the ethnic group.
The Miao live primarily in southern China, in the provinces of Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Hainan, Guangdong, and Hubei. Some members of the Miao sub-groups, most notably the Hmong people, have migrated out of China into Southeast Asia (northern Vietnam, Laos, Burma (Myanmar) and Thailand). Following the communist takeover of Laos in 1975, a large group of Hmong refugees resettled in several Western nations, mainly in the United States, France, and Australia.  There has been a recent tendency by Hmong Americans to group all Miao peoples together under the term Hmong because of their disdain for the Chinese term Miao. This however fails to recognize that, while the Hmong are a small nation within the broader linguistic/cultural family of Miao people, the vast majority of Miao people do not classify themselves as Hmong and have their own names for themselves.

CATEGORIES: 1977 albums, Jethro Tull albums, Chrysalis Records albums, Island Records albums, Albums produced by Ian Anderson

Songs from the Wood (1977) is the tenth studio album by Jethro Tull and is considered to be the first of a trio of folk rock albums (Songs from the Wood, Heavy Horses and Stormwatch) despite the fact that folk music elements are present in the work of Jethro Tull both before and after this trilogy.
Songs from the Wood was the first Tull album to receive unambiguously positive reviews since the time of Thick as a Brick (1972). Filled with folk and fantasy imagery, and ornamental folk arrangement, the album is a departure from the hard rock of earlier Tull material, though it still retained some of the band's older sound. The album reached No. 8 on the Billboard album chart, making it the last top ten album for the band to date. The song "The Whistler" was the only song to chart as a single in the United States, peaking at No. 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1977. The album peaked at No. 13 on the UK Albums Chart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/release.php?release=38323|title=UK chart history Jethro Tull ''Songs from the Wood|publisher=www.chartstats.com|accessdate=14 December 2011|archiveurl=http://archive.is/bjHr|archivedate=24 July 2012[/tpl]

Highway 14, named the West Coast (Sooke) Highway,Numbered Routes in British Columbia - Highway 14 is the southernmost numbered route in the province of British Columbia. An east-west highway on the southwestern coast of Vancouver Island in the Capital Regional District, it is sometimes known as the Juan de Fuca Highway, as well as Sooke Road, Sooke being one of the largest communities that the highway passes through.  Highway 14 first opened in 1953, extending west from Colwood, a suburb of Victoria, to the coastal community of Jordan River, and was extended all the way west to the remote community of Port Renfrew by 1975.  The highway's eastern terminus was relocated to northern Langford in 2002.
Outside of urban areas the route has exceptionally winding, curving and hilly stretches.  Some of the sharper corners have oversized, freeway-style, jersey barriers instead of the more typical steel crash rails, mostly to prevent an out-of-control vehicle from falling off a cliff into the Pacific Ocean.  These crash barriers show signs of many collisions, occasionally decorated with "X crashed here!" or a target painted around a particular collision mark on the wall.  Some bridges are single lane and were built corduroy road style.

[[Vert ramp]]

CATEGORIES: Skateboarding equipment, Inline skating, Roller skating, Vert skating

A vert ramp is a form of half-pipe with vertical in it and its used in "extreme sports" such as Vert Skating, Vert Skateboarding and Vert BMX.
Vert ramps are so named because they transition from a horizontal plane (known as the flat-bottom) to a vertical section on top.
The typical height of a Vert Ramp is [tpl]convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] with anywhere from [tpl]convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] 
to [tpl]convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] of vertical on top.
This vertical section makes it easier for the riders to take off and 'catch air' on a vert ramp rather than on a half-pipe.  
This is because the vert at the top causes the rider to naturally go straight up into the air instead of forward and off the ramp 
(as is the tendency on a half-pipes that does not go vertical up).

Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML, [tpl]IPAc-en||audio=En-us-xaml.ogg|ˈ|z|æ|m|əl[/tpl]) is a declarative XML-based language developed by Microsoft that is used for initializing structured values and objects.  It is available under Microsoft's Open Specification Promise.Microsoft adds XAML to 'Open Specification' list - Software Development Times On The Web The acronym originally stood for Extensible Avalon Markup Language - Avalon being the code-name for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).Rob Relyea : January 2004 - Posts
XAML is used extensively in .NET Framework 3.0 & .NET Framework 4.0 technologies, particularly Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Silverlight, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) and Windows Runtime XAML Framework and Windows Store apps. In WPF, XAML forms a user interface markup language to define UI elements, data binding, eventing, and other features. In WF, workflows can be defined using XAML. XAML can also be used in Silverlight applications, Windows Phone apps and Windows Store apps.
XAML elements map directly to Common Language Runtime object instances, while XAML attributes map to Common Language Runtime properties and events on those objects. XAML files can be created and edited with visual design tools like Microsoft Expression Blend, Microsoft Visual Studio, and the hostable Windows Workflow Foundation visual designer. They can also be created and edited with a standard text editor, a code editor like XAMLPad, or a graphical editor like Vector Architect.
Anything that is created or implemented in XAML can be expressed using a more traditional .NET language, such as C# or Visual Basic.NET. However, a key aspect of the technology is the reduced complexity needed for tools to process XAML, because it is based on XML. Consequently, a variety of products are emerging, particularly in the WPF space, which create XAML-based applications. As XAML is simply based on XML, developers and designers are able to share and edit content freely amongst themselves without requiring compilation. Since it is strongly linked to the .NET Framework 3.0 technologies, the only fully compliant implementation at present is Microsoft's.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl].

Situated on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond, it is the most southerly of the Munros. Ben Lomond lies within the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park and the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, property of the National Trust for Scotland.
Its accessibility from Glasgow and elsewhere in central Scotland, together with the relative ease of ascent from Rowardennan, makes it one of the most popular of all the Munros. On a clear day, it is visible from the higher grounds of Glasgow and eastwards across the low-lying central valley of Scotland; this may have led to it being named 'Beacon Mountain', as with the equally far-seen Lomond Hills in Fife. Ben Lomond summit can also be seen from Ben Nevis, the highest peak in Britain, over [tpl]convert|70|mi|km[/tpl] away. The West Highland Way runs along the western base of the mountain, by the loch.
Ben Lomond's popularity in Scotland has resulted in several namesakes in the former British colonies of Australia, New Zealand, Trinidad and the United States – see this list. The mountain is mentioned directly in the popular folk song The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond.

Friedrich I of Württemberg (19 August 1557, Montbéliard – 29 January 1608, Stuttgart) was the son of George of Mömpelgard and his wife Barbara of Hesse, daughter of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse.
Several references are made to him in Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, in which a series of anti-German jokes start with a horse theft, several references are made to German travellers in England and to a German Duke who is not expected to come to Windsor.
Frederick of Mömpelgard was heir apparent to the dukedom of Württemberg when he visited Windsor and other English cities in 1592. He developed a desire to be made a Knight of the Garter and solicited Queen Elizabeth for the honor repeatedly. After he had inherited the dukedom and become more prominent in affairs, she admitted him to the order. In a calculated slight, he was not informed of his admission in time to attend the investiture in spring 1597, the ceremony for which The Merry Wives of Windsor was written. Thus references to Mömpelgard's earlier visit and his not being in Windsor were jokes intended for the play's first audience, and appear in the First Folio edition of the play, taken from the first private performance, but not in the 1602 Quarto derived from public theatrical production.
In 1599, Frederick I issued an order that a new town should be established at the northern extremity of the black forest by the name of Freudenstadt. The aim was for the town to become the new residence of the Duchy of Württemberg as it was closer to Mömpelgard than the Württemberg capital Stuttgart. However, Frederick I died in 1608 and his plans never came to fruition.
The sons of Frederick I established the ducal house of Württemberg-Neuenstadt, a branch line of the House of Württemberg after a Fürstbrüderlicher Vergleich — a mutual agreement made between ducal brothers on 7 June 1617. The eldest son, Johann Friedrich, assumed barony over the Duchy of Württemberg while the second youngest son, Frederick Achilles, was bequethed Neuenstadt Castle and an annual endowment of 10,000 guilder.

Nathaniel Hone RA (24 April 1718 – 14 August 1784) was an Irish-born portrait and miniature painter, and one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768.
The son of a Dublin-based Dutch merchant, Hone moved to England as a young man and, after marrying in 1742, eventually settled in London, by which time he had acquired a reputation as a portrait-painter. While his paintings were popular, his reputation was particularly enhanced by his skill at producing miniatures and enamels. He interrupted his time in London by spending two years (1750–1752) studying in Italy.
As a portrait painter, several of his works are now held at the National Portrait Gallery in London. His sitters included magistrate Sir John Fielding and Methodist preacher John Wesley, and General Richard Wilford and Sir Levett Hanson in a double portrait.Double Portrait of General Richard Wilford and Sir Levett Hanson, 1777, Nathaniel Hone (R.A.), Artfact.comThomas Gainsborough and Picture Framing, Jacob Simon, The National Portrait Gallery, npg.org.uk

He courted controversy in 1775 when his satirical picture The Conjurer (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) was seen to attack the fashion for Italian Renaissance art and to ridicule Sir Joshua Reynolds (it also included a nude caricature of fellow Academician Angelica Kauffman, later painted out by Hone), and was rejected by the Royal Academy. To show his reputation was undamaged, Hone organised a one-man retrospective in London – the first such solo exhibition of an artist’s work. 
His great-grand-nephew shared the same name and was also a notable Irish painter, known as Nathaniel Hone the Younger (1831–1917).

[tpl]nihongo|Star Fox|スターフォックス|Sutā Fokkusu[/tpl], released as Starwing in Europe, apparently to avoid confusion with an association called "StarVox" in GermanyDamien McFerran."Want to Know The Real Reason Star Fox Was Renamed in Europe?" Nintendo Life. September 5, 2012. Retrieved April 11, 2014 is the first game in the Star Fox series of video games, released on February 21, 1993 in Japan, on March 23, 1993 in North America, and on June 3, 1993 in Europe for the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was the second three-dimensional Nintendo-developed game (behind 1992's X, also developed by Nintendo EAD together with Argonaut Software) and it included the Super FX chip, a coprocessor used to accelerate graphics display, which became Nintendo's first game to use 3D polygon graphics. The complex display of three-dimensional models with polygons was still new and uncommon in console video games, and the game was much-hyped as a result.
Star Fox featured anthropomorphic character designs by Nintendo artist Takaya Imamura, music composed by Hajime Hirasawa and obstacle course style gameplay. Star Fox was developed by Nintendo EAD with assistance by Argonaut Software, and was published by Nintendo. The game was a critical and commercial success, which established Star Fox as one of Nintendo's flagship franchises.
The storyline involves Fox McCloud and the rest of the Star Fox team, who must defend their homeworld of Corneria against the attacking forces of Andross.[tpl]cite book | year=1993 | editor=Argonaut Software | title=Star Fox Instruction Booklet | page=3, | publisher=Nintendo of America | id=[/tpl]

[tpl]nihongo|Ginkaku-ji|銀閣寺||lit. "Temple of the Silver Pavilion"[/tpl], officially named [tpl]nihongo|Jishō-ji|慈照寺||lit. "Temple of Shining Mercy"[/tpl], is a Zen temple in the Sakyo ward of Kyoto, Japan. It is one of the constructions that represent the Higashiyama Culture of Muromachi period.
Ashikaga Yoshimasa initiated plans for creating a retirement villa and gardens as early as 1460;Yamasa: Gikaku-ji. and after his death, Yoshimasa would arrange for this property to become a Zen temple."Protecting Ginkaku-ji, the Beauty of Wabi-sabi; Reluctance to Black Lacquering the Outer Wall," Kyoto Shimbun. January 23, 2008. The temple is today associated with the Shokoku-ji branch of Rinzai Zen.
The two-storied [tpl]nihongo|Kannon-den|観音殿||Kannon hall[/tpl], is the main temple structure. Its construction began February 21, 1482 (Bummei 14 , 4th day of the 2nd month).Keene, Donald. (2003). Yoshimasa and the Silver Pavilion, p. 87.  The structure's design sought to emulate the golden Kinkaku-ji which had been commissioned by his grandfather Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. It is popularly known as Ginkaku, the "Silver Pavilion" because of the initial plans to cover its exterior in silver foil; but this familiar nickname dates back only as far as the Edo period (1600–1868).Keene, p. 88.
During the Ōnin War, construction was halted.  Despite Yoshimasa's intention to cover the structure with a distinctive silver-foil overlay, this work was delayed for so long that the plans were never realized before Yoshimasa's death.  The present appearance of the structure is understood to be the same as when Yoshimasa himself last saw it.  This "unfinished" appearance illustrates one of the aspects of "wabi-sabi" quality.
Like Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji was originally built to serve as a place of rest and solitude for the Shogun. During his reign as Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimasa inspired a new outpouring of traditional culture, which came to be known as Higashiyama Bunka (the Culture of the Eastern Mountain). Having retired to the villa, it is said Yoshimasa sat in the pavilion, contemplating the calm and beauty of the gardens as the Ōnin War worsened and Kyoto was burned to the ground.
In 1485, Yoshimasa became a Zen Buddhist monk. After his death on January 27, 1490 (Entoku 2, 7th day of the 1st month),Titsingh, p. 361. the villa and gardens became a Buddhist temple complex, renamed Jishō-ji after Yoshimasa's Buddhist name.
In addition to the temple's famous building, the property features wooded grounds covered with a variety of mosses.  The Japanese garden, supposedly designed by the great landscape artist Sōami. The sand garden of Ginkaku-ji has become particularly well known; and the carefully formed pile of sand which is said to symbolize Mount Fuji is an essential element in the garden.
After extensive restoration, started February 2008, Ginkaku-ji is again in full glory to visit. The garden and temple complex are open to the public. There is still no silver foil used. After much discussion, it was decided to not refinish the lacquer to the original state. The lacquer finish was the source of the original silver appearance of the temple, with the reflection of silver water of the pond on the lacquer finish.

The Chief of Staff of Canada's Prime Minister's Office is the top official of the office. The position of Chief of Staff was created in 1987 to head the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).
Prior to the creation of the Chief of Staff position, the office was headed by the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary, a position which is now secondary to the Chief of Staff. People who held the position of principal secretary prior to 1987 were essentially de facto chiefs of staff, and may sometimes be informally referred to as chiefs of staff in some sources, but did not hold the formal title Chief of Staff. Bernard Roy, Brian Mulroney's principal secretary from 1984 to 1988, was the last principal secretary to act as head of the PMO before the creation of the Chief of Staff position.

[[Diffusion of responsibility]]

CATEGORIES: Group processes, Crowd psychology, Social psychology

Diffusion of responsibility is a sociopsychological phenomenon whereby a person is less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when others are present. Considered a form of attribution, the individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.Ciccarelli, S. K. & White, J. N. (2009). Psychology (2nd ed.) New Jersey: Pearson Education. ISBN 978-0-13-600428-8. The phenomenon tends to occur in groups of people above a certain critical size and when responsibility is not explicitly assigned. It rarely occurs when the person is alone and diffusion increases with groups of three or more.Darley, J. M. & Latané, B. (1968). Bystander intervention in emergencies: diffusion of responsibility.

Heinz Field is a stadium located in the North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It primarily serves as the home to the Pittsburgh Steelers and University of Pittsburgh Panthers American football teams, members of the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) respectively. The stadium opened in 2001, after the controlled implosion of the teams' previous stadium, Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium is named for the locally-based H. J. Heinz Company, which purchased the naming rights in 2001. It hosted the 2011 NHL Winter Classic between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals on January 1, 2011.
Funded in conjunction with PNC Park and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the $281 million ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|281|2001|r=1[/tpl][/tpl] million today) stadium stands along the Ohio River, on the Northside of Pittsburgh in the North Shore neighborhood. The stadium was designed with the city of Pittsburgh's history of steel production in mind, which led to the inclusion of 12,000 tons of steel into the design. Ground for the stadium was broken in June 1999 and the first football game was hosted in September 2001. The stadium's natural grass surface has been criticized throughout its history, but Steelers ownership has kept the grass after lobbying from players and coaches. Attendance for the 65,050 seat stadium has sold out for every Steelers home game, a streak which dates back to 1972 (a year before local telecasts of home games were permitted in the NFL). A collection of memorabilia from the Steelers and Panthers of the past can be found in the Great Hall.

This article is about the London magistrate. For the soldier, see John Williams (VC).
thumb|Portrait of John Fielding by Nathaniel HoneSir John Fielding (16 September 1721 – 4 September 1780) was a notable English magistrate and social reformer of the 18th century. He was also the younger half-brother of novelist, playwright and chief magistrate Henry Fielding. Despite being blinded in a navy accident at the age of 19, John set up his own business and, in his spare time, studied law with Henry.
Appointed Henry's personal assistant in 1750, John helped him to root out corruption and improve the competence of those engaged in administering justice in London. They formed the first professional police force, the Bow Street Runners. Through the regular circulation of a 'police gazette' containing descriptions of known criminals, Fielding also established the basis for the first police criminal records department.
When Henry died in 1754, John was appointed magistrate at Bow Street in his place, becoming renowned as the "Blind Beak", and allegedly being able to recognize three thousand criminals by the sounds of their voices. He also continued to develop his ideas on crime prevention and youth employment, helping to found the Asylum for Orphan Girls in Lambeth in 1758. He was knighted in 1761.

The Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali are 196 Indian sūtras (aphorisms) that constitute the foundational text of yoga. In medieval times, yoga was cast as one of the six orthodox āstika schools of Hindu philosophy.  According to the late Yogatattva Upanishad, yoga is divided into four forms — Mantrayoga, Layayoga, Hathayoga and RājayogaYogatattva Upanishad, translated by K. Narayanasvami Aiyar. YTU 18(b)-19. Now I shall proceed to describe Yoga to you: Yoga is divided into many kinds on account of its actions: (viz.,) Mantra-Yoga, Laya-Yoga, Hatha-Yoga, and Raja-Yoga. — the last of which is the highest (or royal) practice.For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents", and pp. 453-487.For a brief overview of the yoga school of philosophy see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.
Although the Yoga Sutras have become the most important text of yoga, the opinion of many scholars is that Patañjali was not the creator of yoga, which existed well before him, but merely a great expounder.Introduction, p. xi, The Yogasūtras of Patañjali on concentration of mind.

Lord Darcy is a detective in an alternate history, created by Randall Garrett. The first stories were asserted to take place in the same year as they were published, but in a world with an alternate history that is different from our own and that is governed by the rules of magic rather than the rules of physics. Despite the magical trappings, the Lord Darcy stories play fair as whodunnits; magic is never used to "cheat" a solution, and indeed, the mundane explanation is often obscured by the leap to assume a magical cause.

Minsden Chapel is an isolated ruined chapel in the fields above the hamlet of Chapelfoot, near Preston, Hertfordshire. Today it is a roofless shell, partly surrounded by a small wood, and accessible only by footpath. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is Grade II Listed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1347462|title=List entry|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl]
It was built in the 14th century, and by the 17th century had
fallen into disrepair. Marriages continued here into the 18th century, until the crumbling masonry became too dangerous.Minsden Chapel Haunting - mysteriousbritain.co.uk
One story says that a piece of falling stonework knocked the prayer-book out of a curate's hand during the marriage ceremony of Enoch West and Mary Horn in 1738.Puttick, B. Ghosts of Hertfordshire (1994, Countryside Books) - chapter 14: "The Haunting of Minsden Chapel" p83 ISBN 1-85306-292-8
In the 20th century the chapel was closely associated with the historian Reginald L Hine from nearby Hitchin. He frequently visited here, and eventually obtained a lifetime lease of the building from the vicars of Hitchin. So fond of the chapel was he, that he even bid "trespassers and sacrilegious persons take warning, for I will proceed against them with the utmost rigour of the law, and, after my death and burial, I will endeavour, in all ghostly ways, to protect and haunt its hallowed walls".Hine, Reginald L. The History of Hitchin, Vol II page 38 (1929, Allen and Unwin (London)) Contrary to popular belief Hine is not buried at Minsden. His body was cremated at Golders Green (London) and his ashes were subsequently scattered at the chapel. His family erected a memorial stone at the site, which was subsequently re-laid in its current grave-like horizontal position by them after it was damaged by vandals in the early 1980s.Whitmore, Richard The Ghosts of Reginald Hine (2007, Mattingley Press (Hitchin))
In 1907, T.W. Latchmore, a local professional photographer and friend of Hine, took a photograph of a ghostly monk at the Chapel.Minsden Chapel Ghost - Unexplained Mysteries Discussion Forums
Rumours of paranormal activity first appeared around this time.
The haunting most frequently reported is that of a single monk climbing stairs (which no longer exist) to the north-east area of the chapel; this is said to occur at midnight on Halloween.
Other reported experiences include the sighting of a glowing cross on the wall, and the hearing of distant music or the ringing of the stolen bells. Legends also exist of a lost tunnel and of a murdered nun.The Mysterious Sites of Hertfordshire: Minsden Chapel mysteriousbritain.co.uk
Despite the many reports, very little evidence exists to support the validity of any of these stories.
In an interview given in 1930 to Eugene O'Donnell, a well-known contemporary writer on occult matters, Latchmore finally admitted that his 'Minsden Ghost' photograph was a hoax. He explained that the picture was the deliberate result of an experiment in the techniques of double exposures, a subject that interested him greatly at the time. Although Latchmore refused to disclose the identity of the individual who had posed as the ghostly figure, it seems likely that it was a young man well known for practical jokes, Latchmore's good friend Reggie Hine. Hine re-published the photograph in 1929 in his History of Hitchin but never admitted it was a fake nor his own part in it.Whitmore, Richard The Ghosts of Reginald Hine pp113-116

Drum Castle is a castle near Drumoak in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. For centuries it was the seat of the chief of Clan Irvine.[ref]
Drum Castle at National Trust web site[/ref]  The place-name Drum is derived from Gaelic druim, 'ridge'.
The original 13th-century tower of Drum Castle has been suggested as the work of medieval architect Richard Cementarius, who built the Bridge of Don in Old Aberdeen.  It is believed to be one of the three oldest tower houses in Scotland (and notably unaltered).  A large wing was added in 1619 by the 9th laird, and further alterations were  made during the Victorian era.
The castle and its grounds were granted to William de Irwyn in 1325 by Robert the Bruce, and remained in the possession of Clan Irvine until 1975.  William de Irwyn (of the Irvings of Bonshaw clan) was armour
bearer/secretary (and neighbor) to King Robert the Bruce.  Drum played a role in the Covenanting Rebellion (as did nearby Muchalls Castle) leading to its being attacked and sacked three times.
righ|thumb|Chieftain's BannerThe castle is surrounded by late 18th-century gardens, including a rose garden and arboretum containing trees from all regions of the 18th century British Empire.
Today, the castle is owned by the National Trust for Scotland and is open during the summer months.  The chapel, dining hall and estate may be hired for weddings and corporate functions. A variety of local events such as classic car rallies and musical fetes also occur here. There is also a small shop and tearoom within the castle.

[[Vertical flute]]
CATEGORIES: Flutes

The vertical flute is either (1) a rim-blown (notched or un-notched) flute, (2) a tubular duct flute, with tapered bore or (3) a transversely blown flute, Giorgi flute, designed to be played in an upright position. The vertical flute is contrasted with the "cross flute" (or "transverse flute") and "globular flute", and in stricter usage may refer only to the first category above (Marcuse 1975, 187).
Rim-blown vertical flutes include the Jiahu flute, the xiao, the danso, the kaval, the ney, the quena, and the shakuhachi.
The most familiar ducted vertical flutes are the recorder, tin whistle, and tabor pipe. One historical variety has a slightly tapered (decreasing diameter) bore with 6 tone holes on the top side. A dorsal thumb hole is absent. It sometimes has a small foot section with a single key. The range is a little more than two octaves and the common keynote is "D" major. The instrument is often mistaken for a recorder with keynote C, but. like the tin whistle and tabor pipe, relies on overblowing to change registers instead of pinching open a thumbhole, recorder style, to "cancel" the fundamental harmonic (Bessaraboff 1941, 62–63). 
An unusual case of a transversely blown but vertically held flute is a special variation of the standard flute, or, more specifically, the Western concert flute, designed to be played in an upright position. This version uses a standard cross-blown flute head joint bent in a "?" question mark shape. It can also be modified for one-handed players for people with disabilities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]

Craigievar Castle is a pinkish harled castle six miles (10 km) south of Alford, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It was the seat of Clan Sempill and the Forbes family resided here for 350 years until 1963, when the property was given to the National Trust for Scotland. The setting is among scenic rolling foothills of the Grampian Mountains. The contrast of its massive lower storey structure to the finely sculpted multiple turrets, gargoyles and high corbelling work create a classic fairytale appearance.
An excellent example of the original Scottish Baronial architecture, the great seven-storey castle was completed in 1626 by the Aberdonian merchant William Forbes, ancestor to the "Forbes-Sempill family" and brother of the Bishop of Aberdeen, Patrick of Corse.  Forbes purchased the partially completed structure from the impoverished Mortimer family in the year 1610. Forbes' nickname was Danzig Willy, a reference to his shrewd international trading success with the Baltic states.
William's son was became a Baronet of Nova Scotia by Charles I and this title remains with the Forbes family today .  The Forbes Baronecy, of Craigievar in the County of Aberdeen, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 20 April 1630 for William Forbes.Forbes baronets#Forbes, of Craigievar (1630) He was also a descendant of Hon. Patrick Forbes, third son of the second Lord Forbes, and the nephew of the first Baronet of the 1628 creation. The fourth Baronet represented Aberdeenshire in the House of Commons. The fifth Baronet married the Hon. Sarah Sempill, eldest daughter of Hugh Sempill, 12th Lord Sempill. Their grandson, the eighth Baronet, succeeded as seventeenth Lord Sempill in 1884 (see the Lord Sempill for earlier history of this title). The titles remained united until the death of his grandson, the nineteenth Lord and tenth Baronet, in 1965.
Designed in the L plan, as was Muchalls Castle, which is located in the same region, Craigievar is noted for its exceptionally crafted plasterwork ceilings.  Craigevar, Muchalls Castle and Glamis Castle are generally considered to have the three finest ceilings in Scotland. The Clan Forbes family were close friends of the Clan Burnett of Leys, who built both Crathes Castle and Muchalls Castle. The ceilings feature plaster figures of the Nine Worthies and other family emblems.
By the early 19th-century, the tower had fallen into decay. Sir John Forbes had considered demolishing the tower and consulted the Aberdeen city architect John Smith who advised against that course of action, stating the tower was: "one of the finest specimens in the Country of the age and style in which it was built."[tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=David G.|title=Tudor Johnny: City Architect of Aberdeen: The Life and Works of John Smith 1781-1852|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1quYSQAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Librario|isbn=978-1-904440-97-0|pages=129–130[/tpl] Roof repairs were undertaken and involved the re-construction of almost all of the top floor. The windows, external harling and pointing were replaced and it is likely Smith also designed the gardener's cottage.[tpl]cite web|title=Craigievar Castle, Canmore ID 17471|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/17471/details/craigievar+castle/|publisher=RCAHMS|accessdate=18 November 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LDlInXwa|archivedate=18 November 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]
The castle originally had more defensive elements including a walled courtyard with four round towers; only one of the round towers remains today.  In the arched door to that round tower are preserved the carved initials of Sir Thomas Forbes[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl], William Forbes' son.  There is also a massive iron portculis or gate covering the entrance door which is named a yett.
The castle interior boasts a Great Hall that has the Stuart Arms over the fireplace; a musicians gallery; secret staircase connecting the high tower to the Great Hall; Queen's Bedroom; servants' quarters and of course several splendid plasterwork ceilings.  There is a collection of Forbes family portraits inside as well as a considerable quantity of Forbes furnishings dating to the 17th and 18th centuries.  The castle also houses two original Henry Raeburn portraits complete with original receipts.
The Forbes family also owned a large granite house at Fintray near Inverurie, Aberdeenshire.  This became the family's main residence for a number of years until the Second World War.  During this time Fintray House was used as a hospital for wounded Belgian soldiers.[tpl]cite book|last=Forbes|first=Ewan|title=The aul' days|publisher=Aberdeen University Press|location=Aberdeen|year=1984|isbn=0-08-032415-0[/tpl]
The castle, its estate, and over [tpl]convert|200|acre|km2[/tpl] of adjoining farmlands and woodlands have now entered their fiftieth year as a property of the National Trust for Scotland. They are open to the public from Easter until the end of September. The castle is strictly guided tours only with each tour lasting approximately 45 minutes to an hour. Due to limited group numbers large groups and coach tours must book in advance. During the July and August the castle is open from 11:00 until 5:30 with the last tour leaving at 4:45. During all other open months the castle is open Friday until Tuesday. Between November 2007 and October 2009 the castle was closed due to its exterior being given an entirely new harl, returning to it what is believed to be a close copy of the harling placed of the castle during the refurbishment of 1820.

Fyvie Castle is a castle in the village of Fyvie, near Turriff in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. 
The earliest parts of Fyvie Castle date from the 13th century - some sources claim it was built in 1211 by William the Lion.  Fyvie was the site of an open-air court held by Robert the Bruce, and Charles I lived there as a child.  Following the Battle of Otterburn in 1390, it ceased to be a royal stronghold and instead fell into the possession of five successive families - Preston, Meldrum, Seton, Gordon and Leith - each of whom added a new tower to the castle. The oldest of these, the Preston tower (located on the far right as one faces the main facade of Fyvie), dates to between 1390 and 1433. The impressive Seton tower forms the entrance, and was erected in 1599 by Alexander Seton; Seton also commissioned the great processional staircase several years later. The Gordon tower followed in 1777, and the Leith in 1890.
Inside, the castle stronghold features a great wheel stair, a display of original arms and armour, and a collection of portraits.
Manus O'Cahan  and  Montrose fought a successful minor battle against the Covenant Army at Fyvie Castle on October 28, 1644. The battlefield is currently under research to be inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/heritage/battlefields/battlefieldsunderconsideration.htm |title= Inventory battlefields|publisher=Historic Scotland | accessdate=2012-04-12[/tpl] 
Following Victorian trends, the grounds and adjoining Loch Fyvie were landscaped in the 19th century.  The Scottish industrialist Alexander Leith (later Baron Leith of Fyvie) bought the castle in 1885. It was sold to the National Trust for Scotland in 1984 by his descendants.
The castle (like many Scottish castles) is said to be haunted.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] A story is told that in 1920 during renovation work the skeleton of a woman was discovered behind a bedroom wall. On the day the remains were laid to rest in Fyvie cemetery, the castle residents started to be plagued by strange noises and unexplained happenings. Fearing he had offended the dead woman, the Laird of the castle had the skeleton exhumed and replaced behind the bedroom wall, at which point the haunting ceased. It is said that there is a secret room in the south-west corner of the castle that must remain sealed, lest anyone entering meet with disaster.Anthony D. Hippisley Coxe, Haunted Britain, page 177, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York 1973  It's not clear if this is the same room in which the skeleton was found. There is also an indelible blood stain, two ghosts and two curses associated with this place.The Green Lady of Fyvie Castle One of the curses has been attributed to the prophetic laird, Thomas the Rhymer.   
Fyvie Castle has featured in a number of British television programmes, such as Living TV's Most Haunted season 6.http://www.livingtv.co.uk/mosthaunted/214.php and stv's Castles of Scotland.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl]
The castle also played host of the setting of a children's gameshow on CBBC called Spook Squad in 2004.
2009 saw the publication of the children's fantasy novel, The Time-Tailor and the Fyvie Castle Witch Trials, written by Deborah Leslie.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] 
In recent years, the castle grounds have hosted an annual Fyvie Live music festival in August, which was headlined in 2011 by Beverley Knight and in 2012 by Sophie Ellis Bextor. Another annual event was a 5K fun run around the grounds and adjacent loch, held in April, however both of these events were discontinued in 2013.
Today, the castle is open to tourists during the summer months.

The shipwreck near the modern town of Mahdia is dated about the 80s BC,Date based on the associated ceramics, late second century — 86 BCE (Thompson group E (Fuchs 1963). or even later."Recent research has tended to lower the date of the Mahdia ship's final trip (perhaps as far down as 60)", observes Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway (Ridgway, Hellenistic Sculpture: The styles of ca. 100-31 B.C p. 2002, p. 69). 
In a series of underwater campaigns a large number of items were recovered and placed on display at the Musée National du Bardo, Tunis. The greater part of the sculptures were salvaged between 1907 and 1913 by French archaeologist Alfred Merlin, at that time Director of Antiquities in the Protectorate of Tunisia.http://www.tunisiaproduction.com/ Further survey work on the site was done by a team led by Mensun Bound, but unfortunately no further excavations have been possible.

Balvenie Castle is a ruined castle near Dufftown in the Moray region of Scotland. 
Originally known as Mortlach, it was built in the 12th century by a branch of the powerful Comyn family (the Black Comyns) and extended and altered in the 15th and 16th centuries. 
The castle fell out of use in the early 14th century when the Comyns were reduced by Robert the Bruce. At some point in the 14th century the castle and the lordship of Balvenie passed into the earldom of Douglas.  Nothing is documented as to how the Black Douglases first acquired the castle but the most likely account is that it came with the marriage of the heiress Joanna Murray to Archibald  'the Grim' , 3rd Earl of Douglas in 1362.  His son and successor Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas granted his younger brother James  'the Gross'  the lordship of Balvenie in 1408.  James's main residence was at Abercorn Castle, a coastal fortress to the west of Edinburgh and Balvenie Castle's use was as temporary accommodation when the need arose.
In 1440, William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas was murdered by King James II and the elderly James the Gross, possibly complicit to the murder became the 7th earl.  James immediately provided the lordship of Balvenie with its castle to his youngest son, John Douglas, Lord of Balvenie.  Earl James's death in 1443 signaled a resumption of the hostility between the royal Stewarts and the Black Douglases.  The Battle of Arkinholm in May 1455 saw the defeat of this, the main Douglas line by an army loyal to James II.  All of their lands and titles were forfeited to the Crown including Balvenie Castle.  King James divided up the estates among his supporters which included the Douglas earl of Angus and provided Balvenie Castle to Sir John Stewart, later the first Earl of Atholl. Balvenie Castle served as a garrison during the Jacobite rebellion. It was abandoned in 1720s but was briefly garrisoned by Government troops in 1746.
Today, the remains of the castle are managed by Historic Scotland; however, ownership continues in private hands. The current owner is Jeremy Duncan Nicholson, Baron of Balvenie, who resides in Atlanta, Georgia in the U.S.A. The castle is open to the public from the beginning of April to the end of September.  Balvenie whisky is produced by William Grant & Sons at the Balvenie distillery down the hill from the castle.

A TV tuner card is a kind of television tuner that allows television signals to be received by a computer. Most TV tuners also function as video capture cards, allowing them to record television programs onto a hard disk much like the digital video recorder (DVR) does.
thumb|D-Link external TV tuner The interfaces for TV tuner cards are most commonly either PCI bus expansion card or the newer PCI Express (PCIe) bus for many modern cards, but PCMCIA, ExpressCard, or USB devices also exist. In addition, some video cards double as TV tuners, notably the ATI All-In-Wonder series. The card contains a tuner and an analog-to-digital converter (collectively known as the analog front end) along with demodulation and interface logic. Some lower-end cards lack an onboard processor and, like a Winmodem, rely on the system's CPU for demodulation.
There are currently four kinds of tuner card on the market:
Analog television cards output a raw video stream, suitable for real-time viewing but ideally requiring some sort of video compression if it is to be recorded. More advanced TV tuners encode the signal to Motion JPEG or MPEG, relieving the main CPU of this load. Some cards also have analog input (composite video or S-Video) and many also provide a tuner (radio).

Kildrummy Castle is a ruined castle near Kildrummy, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  Though ruined, it is one of the most extensive castles of 13th century date to survive in eastern Scotland, and was the seat of the Earls of Mar.
The castle was likely built in the mid-13th century under Gilbert de Moravia. It has been posited that siting of Kildrummy Castle was influenced by the location of the Grampian Mounth trackway crossings, particularly the Elsick Mounth and Cryne Corse Mounth.C. Michael Hogan, Elsick Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed A. Burnham  Kildrummy Castle underwent siege numerous times in its history, first in defence of the family of Robert the Bruce in August–September 1306 (leading to the executions of Nigel Bruce and many other Scots), and again in 1335 by David of Strathbogie. On this occasion Christina Bruce held off the attackers until her husband Sir Andrew Murray came to her rescue. In the reign of David II, Walter Maule of Panmure was warden of Kildrummy Castle.[ref]
</ref>
In 1374 the castle's heiress Isobel was seized and married by Alexander Stewart, who then laid claim to Kildrummy and the title of Earl of Mar. In 1435 it was taken over by James I, becoming a royal castle until being granted to Lord Elphinstone in 1507.
The castle passed from the Clan Elphinstone to the Clan Erskine before being abandoned in 1716 following the failure of the Jacobite rebellion.
Kildrummy Castle is "shield-shaped" in plan with a number of independent towers. The flat side of the castle overlooks a steep ravine; moreover, on the opposite side of the castle the walls come to a point, which was once defended by a massive twin-towered gatehouse. The castle also had a keep, called the Snow Tower, taller than the other towers, built in the French style, as at Bothwell Castle. Extensive earthworks protected the castle, including a dry moat and the ravine. Most of the castle foundations are now visible, along with most of its lower-storey walls. Archaeological excavations in 1925 uncovered decorative stone flooring and evidence of battles.
The castle property now owned by Historic Scotland, and Kildrummy Castle gardens, in the quarry used to excavate stone for the castle, are both open to the public.[tpl]cite web|title=Kildrummy Castle|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=PL_169&PropName=Kildrummy%20Castle|work=Places to visit|publisher=Historic Scotland|accessdate=11 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Kildrummy Castle Gardens|url=http://www.scotlandsgardens.org/garden.aspx?id=0e040ed2-e3ec-4854-979f-9f8300ea8025|publisher=Scotland's Gardens Scheme|accessdate=11 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Kildrummy Castle Gardens website|url=http://www.kildrummy-castle-gardens.co.uk/|accessdate=11 July 2012[/tpl] A hotel (the Kildrummy Castle Hotel) has been built on the old estate, overlooking the ruins.

Salomon Morel (November 15, 1919 – February 14, 2007) was a Stalinist official and an accused war criminal. Immediately after the end of World War II, he became commander of the Zgoda labour camp in Świętochłowice. During the rise of the Polish United Workers' Party, Morel aquired the rank of colonel in the political police, or MBP, and commanded a prison in Katowice.
In 1994, soon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Morel was indicted by Poland's Institute of National Remembrance for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the "revenge killings" of 1,500 ethnic prisoners from Upper Silesia (most of them Polish Silesians and German civilians). After his case was publicized by the Polish, German, British, and American media, Morel fled to Israel and was granted citizenship under the Law of Return. Poland twice requested his extradition, but Israel refused to comply and rejected the more serious charges as being false, potentially part of an antisemitic conspiracy, and again rejected extradition on the grounds that the statute of limitations against Morel had run out, and that Morel was in poor health.

A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary. p. 979. is an ego-transcending spiritual practice.Flood, Gavin.  An Introduction to Hinduism. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1996. pp. 92, 156, 160, 167. ISBN 0-521-43878-0. It includes a variety of disciplines in Hindu, Sikh, Buddhisthttp://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Sadhana and Muslim traditions that are followed in order to achieve various spiritual or ritual objectives. 
The historian N. Bhattacharyya provides a working definition of the benefits of sādhanā as follows:
 ... religious sādhanā, which both prevents an excess of worldliness and molds the mind and disposition (bhāva) into a form which develops the knowledge of dispassion and non-attachment. Sādhanā is a means whereby bondage becomes liberation.Bhattacharyya, N. N. History of the Tantric Religion. Second Revised Edition. (Manohar: New Delhi, 1999) p. 174. ISBN 81-7304-025-7
  
Iyengar (1993: p. 22) in his English translation of and commentary to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali defines sādhanā in relation to abhyāsa and kriyā: 
 
 Sādhanā is a discipline undertaken in the pursuit of a goal. Abhyāsa is repeated practice performed with observation and reflection. Kriyā, or action, also implies perfect execution with study and investigation. Therefore, sādhanā, abhyāsa, and kriyā all mean one and the same thing. A sādhaka, or practitioner, is one who skillfully applies...mind and intelligence in practice towards a spiritual goal.Iyengar, B.K.S. (1993, 2002). Light on the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali.

[[Herdwick]]
CATEGORIES: Cumbria, Sheep breeds originating in England, British products with protected designation of origin

The Herdwick is a breed of domestic sheep native to the Lake District of Cumbria in North West England. The name "Herdwick" is derived from the Old Norse herdvyck, meaning sheep pasture.[ref]
</ref> Though low in lambing capacity and perceived wool quality when compared to more common commercial breeds such as [[Merino (sheep)|Merino sheep]], Herdwicks are prized for their robust health, their ability to live solely on [[forage]], and their tendency to be territorial and not to stray over the difficult upland terrain of the Lake District. It is considered that up to 99% of all Herdwick sheep are commercially farmed in the central and western Lake District.<ref>http://www.herdwick-sheep.com/herdwicks.html</ref>
The wool quality of a Herdwick has unique qualities relating to durability. Thick bristle type fibres will often protrude from garments forming a protective barrier layer in blizzards.  Most likely the same qualities that protect the sheep in similar conditions. They have been known to survive under a blanket of snow for three days while eating their own wool.Davies, Hunter "A Walk Around the Lakes", Frances Lincoln Limited, 2009 (revised edition), p. 94 
Severely threatened by the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in England and Wales, the breed has survived due to the intent to preserve this unique animal as a crucial part of traditional Lakeland agriculture. Still far less in number than most commercial breeds, Herdwicks survive largely due to farming subsidies and the aid of the British National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.

[[Webcast]]

CATEGORIES: Internet television, Internet radio, Streaming

A webcast is a media presentation distributed over the Internet using streaming media technology to distribute a single content source to many simultaneous listeners/viewers. A webcast may either be distributed live or on demand. Essentially, webcasting is “broadcasting” over the Internet.
The largest "webcasters" include existing radio and TV stations, who "simulcast" their output through online TV or online radio streaming, as well as a multitude of Internet only "stations". The term webcasting usually refers to non-interactive linear streams or events. Rights and licensing bodies offer specific "webcasting licenses" to those wishing to carry out Internet broadcasting using copyrighted material.
Webcasting is also used extensively in the commercial sector for investor relations presentations (such as annual general meetings), in e-learning (to transmit seminars), and for related communications activities. However, webcasting does not bear much, if any, relationship to web conferencing, which is designed for many-to-many interaction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/112104/Webcasting-101-Planning-and-Executing-High-Quality-Webcasts|title=Webcasting 101: Planning and Executing High Quality Webcasts|last=Shiao|first=Dennis|date=26 December 2012|publisher=INXPO|accessdate=15 May 2013[/tpl]
The ability to webcast using cheap/accessible technology has allowed independent media to flourish.  There are many notable independent shows that broadcast regularly online. Often produced by average citizens in their homes they cover many interests and topics. Webcasts relating to computers, technology, and news are particularly popular and many new shows are added regularly.
Webcasting differs from podcasting in that webcasting refers to live streaming while podcasting simply refers to media files placed on the Internet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webmarketcentral.com/webcast_podcast_overview.htm|title=Overview of Webcasting and Podcasting|publisher=WebMarketCentral|accessdate=15 May 2013[/tpl]

The first tower of the Z plan castle was built in 1546. After it was plundered and burned by James Graham, the first Marquess of Montrose, it was restored in 1645. 
Extensions were added in 1770 by General James Grant of the American Wars of Independence (whose ghost is said to haunt the castle) and in 1850 by the architect Thomas MacKenzie. Further extensions carried out in 1878 were mostly demolished during and modernisations enacted in 1965. It has been continuously occupied by the Russell and Macpherson-Grant families throughout its existence.
The castle houses an important collection of 17th century Spanish paintings. The dining room of Ballindalloch is said to be haunted by a ghost known as The Green Lady.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/scotland-s-specters-haunted-castles-part-1-1-2280035 |title=Scotland’s specters: Haunted castles, part 1 - Heritage |publisher=Scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07[/tpl]
The castle grounds contain a 20th-century rock garden and a 17th-century dovecote. The rivers Spey and Avon flow through the grounds, offering excellent fishing. The famous Aberdeen Angus cattle herd resides in the castle estate.
Today, the castle is still occupied by Clare Nancy Russell and her family.  Mrs. Russell is the current Lord Lieutenant of Banffshire. It is open to tourists during the summer months and a number of workshops on its grounds are in active use.

Situs inversus (also called situs transversus or oppositus) is a congenital condition in which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. The normal arrangement is known as situs solitus. In other rare cases, in a condition known as situs ambiguus or heterotaxy, situs cannot be determined.
The term situs inversus is a short form of the Latin phrase "situs inversus viscerum", meaning "inverted position of the internal organs". Dextrocardia (the heart being located on the right side of the thorax) was first seen and drawn by Leonardo da Vinci in 1452–1519, and then recognised by Marco Aurelio Severino in 1643. However, situs inversus was first described more than a century later by Matthew Baillie.
Situs inversus is thought to be present in 0.01% of the population, or a 1 in 10,000 chance.Situs inversus on eMedicine

Test pilots may work for military organizations or private, (mostly aerospace) companies. Testing military aircraft, in particular, is regarded as the most challenging and risky flying conducted in peacetime.
In the 1950s, test pilots were being killed at the rate of about one a week, but the risks have shrunk to a fraction of that, thanks to the maturation of aircraft technology, better ground-testing and simulation of aircraft performance, fly by wire technology and lately, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to test experimental aircraft features. Still, piloting experimental aircraft remains more dangerous than most other types of flying.

Delgatie Castle is a castle near Turriff, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. 
A castle has stood on the site of Delgatie Castle since the year 1030 AD, although the earliest parts of the castle standing today were built between 1570 and 1579.  Additional wings and a chapel were added in 1743.
The castle was stripped from the disgraced Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan after the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and given to Clan Hay (later to become the Earls of Erroll).  Mary, Queen of Scots, was a guest at the castle in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie.
thumb|left|Delgatie CastleLike many castles, Delgatie is rumoured to be haunted.  A number of reports of a ghostly red-haired figure, supposedly one Alexander Hay, were made by soldiers posted there during the Second World War. The castle's information boards, mostly written by Captain Hay who restored the house in the 1950s, recount that the ghost was first seen when a body was found bricked up in a priest hole.
Architecturally, the castle consists of a keep, adjoining house and two later wings.  Notable features include a very wide turnpike stair and painted ceilings dating from the 16th century in some rooms.Michael Bath, Renaissance Decorative Painting in Scotland, NMS (2003), 221-22 In many places may be seen the Hay family arms including the three cattle yokes which recall a farmer and his two sons who were instrumental in the defeat of a Danish raiding party at Cruden Bay. (See Clan Hay for more detail.)
Today, the castle and its gardens are owned by the Delgatie Castle Trust.  The castle, grounds, and café are open to the public throughout the summer months and suites within the castle itself and a number of cottages the estate are available to rent. There is also a popular fishing site on the river passing through.

Charn is a fictional city appearing in the 1955 book The Magician's Nephew, book six in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, written as a prequel to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.   Charn, and the planet and possibly entire "World" (in the books World refers to universe) of which it is the capital city, are the birthplace of Jadis, the evil White Witch who later takes over Narnia.  When visited briefly by Digory and Polly, the protagonists of the novel, the city is totally deserted, lifeless and crumbling, under a dying sun.  Rivers have dried up, and not even weeds or insects live.  All life on the planet of Charn had been destroyed by Jadis through an evil magic spell.  In the novel the city stands as an example of the dead end that can result if a civilization succumbs to evil.
During their visit, Digory accidentally wakes Jadis from suspended animation, and she is able to leave the planet with them.

He worked on several one-shot stories before releasing his serialized works: Cat's Eye, City Hunter and Angel Heart.
Hojo claims that he really did not have any inspiration for these works other than having to meet a deadline. He says he wrote down a few things, he thought about a few things, and one day the ideas just came to him, out of thin air. In reality, the process was a lot more complicated, with editors involved, but fans got the benefit of Hojo's sense of adventure and humor.
After the success of Cat's Eye and City Hunter, Hojo went on to work on other series such as Family Compo. His current ongoing series is Angel Heart, a spinoff of City Hunter set in an alternate universe. It has been serialized in the Weekly Comic Bunch since 2001 and 30 collected volumes has been published so far.
Tsukasa Hojo is Takehiko Inoue's mentor. Inoue worked as an assistant to Hojo during the production of City Hunter. Hojo is also a long-time acquaintance of Fist of the North Star illustrator Tetsuo Hara, who was also one of the founders of Coamix. Hojo contributed to the production Fist of the North Star: The Legends of the True Savior film series by designing the character of Reina.

Adam is a fictional character in the fourth season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Portrayed by George Hertzberg, he is a monster created from a man and the collected parts of demons, vampires, and technology: the product of a perverse experiment carried out by military scientists. The series' main character, Buffy Summers, encounters and ultimately defeats him in the fourth season. Adam is the creation of Dr. Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse), the head of a military-like organization called The Initiative that studies how to alter the harmful behavior inherent to demons. Adam and the Initiative are the fourth season's primary antagonists, or Big Bad.
The premise of the series is that Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a Slayer, endowed with superhuman strength to fight vampires and evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. In the fourth season, Buffy begins attending college, where she discovers that her psychology professor, Walsh, is a scientist for the Initiative. Adam is Dr. Walsh's horrible masterpiece, an allusion to Frankenstein's monster, whose first conscious act is killing his creator. Adam's search for understanding himself and his true nature, combined for his penchant for chaos, leads him to orchestrate a massacre between demons and humans, after which he will be able use body parts leftover from the melee to create an army of monsters to set loose on Sunnydale. Buffy's effectiveness as a Slayer is increased because her close friends and family, called the Scooby Gang, assist her in her battles. By the end of season four the members of the group have become estranged and must come back together in order to defeat the apparently invincible Adam.
Buffy studies scholars have critically examined the character of Adam, noting that he is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster. Throughout the action of the novel, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created, much like Adam. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to "find the stillness" in the character. The presence of Adam also serves to questioning tradition and authority, specifically institutional authority, which is a repeated theme on the show. Adam has a "design flaw": Adam supplants Dr. Walsh's existence with technology, finding her unnecessary and killing her—an act of questioning authority. Critical reception to Adam has been largely mixed, with critics' opinions ranging from negative to positive. Some commentators felt his subplot was confusing and unconvincing. Others enjoyed the concept and praised the make-up and special effects used to create the character.

Oliver Twist (1948) is the second of David Lean's two film adaptations of Charles Dickens novels. Following the success of his 1946 version of Great Expectations, Lean re-assembled much of the same team for his adaptation of Dicken's 1838 novel, including producers Ronald Neame and Anthony Havelock-Allan, cinematographer Guy Green, designer John Bryan and editor Jack Harris. Lean's then-wife, Kay Walsh, who had collaborated on the screenplay for Great Expectations, played the role of Nancy. John Howard Davies was cast as Oliver, while Alec Guinness portrayed Fagin.
In 1999, the British Film Institute placed it at 46th in its list of the top 100 British films.

Ancistrocheirus lesueurii, the sharpear enope squid, is the only species in the genus Ancistrocheirus and family Ancistrocheiridae.  With a mantle length of 25 cm, this moderately sized squid may be found throughout the tropical and subtropical oceans.  They tend to be found at mesopelagic depths (200-1000 m down).
Although only one species is recognized, some have suggested more than one species may exist due to differences in the paralarval morphology.  Paralarva is the first free-living stage for cephalopods.

[[Prayer of Manasseh]]

CATEGORIES: Old Testament Apocrypha, Anagignoskomena, Septuagint, Jewish prayer and ritual texts

The Prayer of Manasseh is a short work of 15 verses of the penitential prayer of king Manasseh of Judah.  Manasseh is recorded in the Bible as one of the most idolatrous kings of Judah ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|21:1–18|NIV[/tpl]; [tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:1–9|NIV[/tpl]). Chronicles, but not Kings, records that Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians. ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:11–13|NIV[/tpl]) While a prisoner, Manasseh prayed for mercy, and upon being freed and restored to the throne turned from his idolatrous ways. ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:15–17|NIV[/tpl]) A reference to the prayer, but not the prayer itself, is made in [tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:19|NIV[/tpl], which says that the prayer is written in the "history of the seers."
The prayer is considered apocryphal by Jews, Catholics and Protestants. It was placed at the end of 2 Chronicles in the late 4th-century Vulgate.  Over a millennium later, Martin Luther included the book in his 74-book translation of the Bible.http://beggarsallreformation.blogspot.com/2011/06/luther-added-books-to-his-bible.html It was part of the 1537 Matthew Bible, and the 1599 Geneva Bible. It also appears in the Apocrypha of the King James Bible. Pope Clement VIII included the prayer in an appendix to the Vulgate stating that it should continue to be read "lest it perish entirely." 
The prayer is included in some editions of the Greek Septuagint. For example, the 5th century Codex Alexandrinus includes the prayer among fourteen Odes appearing just after the Psalms.NET Bible  It is accepted as a deuterocanonical book by some Orthodox Christians, though it does not appear in Bibles printed in Greece. The prayer is chanted during the Orthodox Christian and Byzantine Catholic service of Great Compline. It is used in the Roman Rite as part of the Responsory after the first reading in the Office of Readings on the 14th Sunday in Ordinary Time (along with Psalm 51). It is used also as a canticle in the Daily Office of the 1979 U.S. Book of Common Prayer used by the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.
The prayer appears in ancient Syriac, Old Slavonic, Ethiopic, and Armenian translations.The shorter books of the Apocrypha: Tobit, Judith, Rest of Esther, Baruch, Letter of Jeremiah, additions to Daniel and Prayer of Manasseh. Commentary by J. C. Dancy, with contributions by W. J. Fuerst and R. J. Hammer. Cambridge Eng. University Press, 1972. ISBN 16230423 In the Ethiopian Bible, the prayer is found in 2 Chronicles.

In skateboarding and related sports, skyhooks are devices which serve as semi-open bindings. They are usually made of aluminium, steel  or hard plastic and are formed to cover the rider's boot, yet to allow him to easily free his feet from the hook. They may be screwed to the top of the board to facilitate jumping and enhance stability during a ride.
They are mostly used on freeboards and longboards without a kicktail.

A skyhook is a proposed momentum exchange tether concept that aims to reduce the cost of placing payloads into space. 
Skyhooks are often confused with an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator, but they are different.  A skyhook is much shorter than a space elevator and does not reach down to the surface of the Earth.  A skyhook requires a suborbital launch vehicle to get to the bottom end of the skyhook, a space elevator does not. 
Its promoter speculated in 1994 that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator,[tpl]cite journal |last=Sarmont |first=E. |title=How an Earth Orbiting Tether Makes Possible an Affordable Earth-Moon Space Transportation System |work=SAE 942120 |date=October 1994 |url=http://papers.sae.org/942120/ [/tpl] but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts.

The existence of a Sotadic Zone was an hypothesis of the British Orientalist and explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821-1890). He asserted that there exists a geographic zone in which pederasty (romantic-sexual intimacy between a boy and a man) is prevalent and celebrated among the indigenous inhabitants.[tpl]cite journal|last=Waitt|first=Gordon|coauthors=Kevin Markwell|title=The Lure of the "Sotadic Zone"’|journal=Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide|year=2008|volume=15|issue=2[/tpl] The name derives from Sotades, a 3rd-century BC Greek poet who was the chief representative of a group of writers of obscene, and sometimes pederastic, satirical poetry. (These homoerotic verses are preserved in the Greek Anthology, a collection of poems spanning the Classical and Byzantine periods of Greek literature.)
Burton first advanced his Sotadic Zone concept in the "Terminal Essay" (§1., D) contained in Volume 10 of his translation of The Arabian Nights — which he called The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night — in 1886.[tpl]cite book|title=The Book of the Thousand Nights and A Night|year=1886|publisher=Burton Society (Private printing)|location=s.l.[/tpl]

The Webley Revolver (also known as the Webley Break-Top Revolver or Webley Self-Extracting Revolver) was, in various marks, the standard issue service pistol for the armed forces of the United Kingdom, the British Empire, and the Commonwealth from 1887 until 1963.
The Webley is a top-break revolver with automatic extraction.  That is, breaking the revolver open for reloading also operates the extractor.  This removes the spent cartridges from the cylinder. The Webley Mk I service revolver was adopted in 1887.  A later version, the Mk IV, rose to prominence during the Boer War of 1899–1902. However,  the Mk VI, introduced in 1915 during the First World War, is perhaps the best-known model.
Firing the large .455 Webley cartridge,  Webley service revolvers are among the most powerful top-break revolvers ever produced. Although the .455 calibre Webley is no longer in military service, the .38/200 Webley Mk IV variant is still in use as a police sidearm in a number of countries.Historic firearm of the month, July 1999, Cruffler.com.

Empirically, one report proposes that HRT in American English and Australian English is marked by a high tone (high pitch or high fundamental frequency) beginning on the final accented syllable near the end of the statement (the terminal), and continuing to increase in frequency (up to 40%) to the end of the intonational phrase.[tpl]cite book |last=Ladd |first=R.

[[Electronic signature]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography

An electronic signature, or e-signature, is any electronic means that indicates either that a person adopts the contents of an electronic message, or more broadly that the person who claims to have written a message is the one who wrote it (and that the message received is the one that was sent). By comparison, a signature is a stylized script associated with a person. In commerce and the law, a signature on a document is an indication that the person adopts the intentions recorded in the document. Both are comparable to a seal.
Increasingly, digital signatures are used in e-commerce and in regulatory filings as digital signatures are more secure than a simple generic electronic signature.The University of VirginiaState of WINational Archives of Australia  The concept itself is not new, with common law jurisdictions having recognized telegraph signatures as far back as the mid-19th century and faxed signatures since the 1980s.
In many countries, including the United States, the European Union, India, Brazil and Australia, electronic signatures (when recognised under the law of each jurisdiction) have the same legal consequences as the more traditional forms of executing of documents.[ref]See US Federal Rules of Evidence 1001, 1002, and 1003.

CATEGORIES: Irish victims of human rights abuses, Roman Catholic Church sex abuse cases in Ireland, Imprisonment and detention, Living people, 1932 births

Mary Norris, the eldest of eight children, was born in 1932 in Sneem, South Kerry, Ireland. She was sent to a Magdalene laundry or asylum run by the Good Shepherd Order in Cork, Ireland, in 1949 at the age of 16. She spent two years there. The laundry closed down in 1994.
Mary was removed from her mother at the age of twelve. Her mother was having an affair, and Mary believes that those in authority thought she was a bad example. The children were taken to a judge and made wards of court. They were sent to different places run by different Roman Catholic institutions. Mary found herself at St Joseph's Orphanage in Killarney.
At the age of sixteen, Mary was sent to work as a maid, but was returned to the orphanage after she went to a cinema without permission. She was then sent to a laundry in Cork. She reports that the way she was treated at the laundry amounted to slavery, and that the girls and women were forced to work ten hours a day every day except Sunday. She reports also that her name was changed to Myra, as the nuns felt she did not deserve the holy name of Mary, and that she was told falsely that her family had abandoned her.
When Mary had been in the Magdalene laundry for two years, a concerned aunt in America tracked her down, and removed her from the laundry. (Later Mary petitioned the sisters of the Good Shepherd in Cork to obtain a list of the names of the Magdalenes who had been buried in unmarked graves behind the laundry.) She was reunited with her mother, brothers, and sisters. Eventually she moved to London with her mother. After her mother's death in 1989, Mary returned to Ireland.
Her brothers had been with the Christian Brothers in Tralee—an order which has also, in some cases, been found guilty of abuse. They were both alcoholics at the time of their deaths. One died as a result of a fire; the other as a result of murder. Her sisters emigrated, and Norris is the sole member of her immediate family to remain in Ireland.
She discusses her experience as an "orphan" in an interview published by the Irish Independent in January 1999. Mary has been married twice and has one daughter. She now lives in Co. Kerry.

Plaza Sésamo (Sesame Street in the American version) is an educational children's television series for preschoolers, which is the Spanish-language adaptation for Latin America of Sesame Street. Both programs are pioneers of the contemporary educational television standard, combining both education and entertainment. It is also dubbed in Nahuatl for areas in Mesoamerica that use this language.
The program was first broadcast in 1972. Originally co-produced by the Children´s Television Workshop (CTW), Xerox and Televicentro (later Televisa). Manolo Barbachano then with Televisión Independiente de México (TIM) brought the idea of making a Spanish speaking version to John Page who became the Executive Producer and produced the series from the Taller de Televisión Infantil in Mexico City.  It was written by Juan Manuel Torres, Ana María Palos, Gerardo de la Torre and Grillo MacGregor.   Studio producer was Fernando Morett and documentaries were done by Roberto Lomelí.  The editor was Gabriel Carbajal and Content Supervision was the responsibility of Zita Chao and later on by Patricia Arriaga Jordán. The second season was produced by Children's Television Workshop (CTW) and Televicentro (later Televisa). Later it was produced mainly in Mexico by CTW and Mexican television network Televisa. it aired in America of the United States
Currently it is jointly produced  by Sesame Workshop and Televisa. Hip TV Inc., a division of Los Angeles-based Hip Entertainment Group, were production supervisors for seasons 9, 10, and 11.
Plaza Sésamo can be seen in Mexico on Televisa's Canal 5 network. In Latin America on the satellite/cable channel Discovery Kids. In the United States, it can be seen on V-me and TeleFutura (and had previously aired on TeleFutura's parent network Univision), as well as selected PBS stations. Plaza Sésamo is also available On Demand on PBS Kids Sprout's on-demand channel.
Season 9 launched 2005, and seasons 10 and 11 debuted in 2006 and 2008. New seasons of the show are produced intermittently.
The show shares a lot of sketch footage with Sesame Street, dubbed in Spanish, but there is also a great deal of unique footage in the show, especially sketches featuring the live actors.
It is estimated that Plaza Sesamo reaches 84 percent of Spanish-speaking households in the United States. Within Mexico, 72% of mothers watched the series as a child, and 98% of them want to expose their children to the series.Sesame Workshop: Children's TV series Plaza Sésamo heads back in studio for a milestone new season focused on health; fact sourced to Gemark Research, "Plaza Sesamo Market Research Study", September 2005.
It is one of the longest running children's series in Mexico, although its broadcasting has not been continuous. Note that there is also another Spanish-language version of this series known as Barrio Sésamo in Spain that went on the air on three disjointed runs in 1979–1980, 1983–1987, and 1996–2000.

[[Book signing]]
CATEGORIES: Bookselling, Marketing techniques

Book signing is the affixing of a signature to the title page or flyleaf of a book by its author.  A book signing is an event, usually at a bookstore or library where an author sits and signs books for a period.
Book signing is popular because an author's signature increases the value of books for collectors. The author may add a short message to the reader, called a dedication, to each book, which may be personalized with the recipient's name upon request.  A simple author's signature without a dedication is typically more valuable to collectors (exceptions include inscriptions to persons of note, e.g. from Hemingway to Fitzgerald, or to persons of significance in the author's life). Many authors today spend a great deal of time signing their books, and sign many thousands of copies. James Ellroy is known for signing every copy of the 65,000 strong first run of My Dark Places.
Book signings provide more than a just a chance to obtain signatures.  Authors and bookstores are benefited by the fact that many copies of the book being promoted are sold.  Signings also increase public goodwill and allow authors to connect with their fans.  For fans, signings give them a chance to see and meet a favorite author and ask them questions.
Sometimes the author will sign additional copies for future sale. An additional advantage for authors for doing this is that once a book has been signed, it cannot be returned to the publisher for a refund.

[[Saturday Night Live Samurai]]

In the early years of Saturday Night Live, John Belushi portrayed an archetypal samurai—he had a dedicated concept of honor, spoke only (mock) Japanese, and wielded a katana. Each sketch had him located in a different place and time that was typically inappropriate for a samurai, yet he performed his tasks perfectly, despite scaring his clients quite a few times. The character was modeled after Toshiro Mifune's character in Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo.[tpl]cite news|last=Barra|first=Allen|title=That Nameless Stranger, Half a Century Later|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703309704575413672923186974.html|accessdate=10 January 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=17 August 2010[/tpl]
Samurai Futaba would probably not have become a recurring character if not for Buck Henry's insistence that there be a second sketch featuring him when he first hosted on January 17, 1976. It is perhaps due to these origins that it became standard practice on SNL to feature a Samurai sketch every time Henry hosted, up until the time Belushi left the cast. Except for "Samurai BMOC", each time Henry would play the same character, Mr. Dantley.
In issue #74 of Marvel Team-Up (cover dated October, 1978), Belushi (in character as Samurai Futaba) dueled Marvel Comics supervillain Silver Samurai, who believed that Belushi was disgracing the history of the samurai. He also appears briefly in issue #54 of The Sandman.

John Richard Thomas Sullivan OBE (23 December 1946 – 23 April 2011) was an English television scriptwriter responsible for several popular British sitcoms, including Only Fools and Horses, Citizen Smith and Just Good Friends.
From working-class South London, Sullivan worked in a variety of low-paid jobs for 15 years before getting his first break writing Citizen Smith. However, it was for the sitcom Only Fools and Horses (1981–2003) that he is best known. Other sitcoms include Dear John, Just Good Friends, Sitting Pretty, Roger Roger, and The Green Green Grass. In addition, he wrote the comedy drama serial Over Here and the drama series Micawber for ITV, and co-wrote the comedy Heartburn Hotel. His work won him a number of comedy awards, including the BAFTA for best sitcom on three occasions, and he was made an OBE in 2005. His last work was Rock & Chips, a comedy drama prequel to Only Fools and Horses. The final episode of Sullivan's last comedy series aired five days after his death from pneumonia on 23 April 2011. 
To remember Sullivan's work, the BBC broadcast the episode of Only Fools and Horses in which the Trotters drop a chandelier while cleaning it for an upper-class family. They also showed "Top 40 Only Fools and Horses Moments", where it is shown the best moment in Only Fools and Horses.

[[Null modem]]
CATEGORIES: Modems, Multiplayer null modem games, Out-of-band management

Null modem is a communication method to connect two DTEs (computer, terminal,
printer etc.) directly using an RS-232 serial cable. The name stems from the historical use of the RS-232 cable to connect two teleprinter devices to modems in order to communicate with one another; null modem communication was possible by instead using RS-232 to connect the teleprinters directly to one another.
The RS-232 standard is asymmetrical as to the definitions of the two ends of the communications link so it assumes that one end is a DTE and the other is a DCE e.g. a modem. With a null modem connection the transmit and receive lines are crosslinked. Depending on the purpose, sometimes also one or more handshake lines are crosslinked. Several wiring layouts are in use because the null modem connection is not covered by a standard.

[[Laughingthrush]]
CATEGORIES: Garrulax, Laughingthrushes

The Laughingthrushes are the genus Garrulax and Trochalopteron of the Leiothrichidae family of passerine birds. They primarily occur in tropical Asia.
These are rangy, medium-sized landbirds. These birds have strong legs and are quite terrestrial. This group is not strongly migratory, and most species have short rounded wings, and a weak flight.
A few, like the Streaked Laughingthrush occur in fairly open habitats, but most are jungle species, difficult to observe in the dense vegetation they prefer. 
These are noisy birds, and the characteristic laughing calls are often the best indication that these birds are present. They frequently occur in groups of up to a dozen, and the rainforest species like the Ashy-headed Laughingthrush often occur in the mixed feeding flocks typical of tropical Asian jungle.

He studied comets, and discovered the periodic comet 4P/Faye on 22 November 1843.  His discovery of "Faye's comet" attracted worldwide attention, and won him the 1844 Lalande Prize prize and a membership in the Academy of Sciences.  In 1848 he became an instructor  in geodesy at the Polytechnique, and in 1854 rector of the academy at Nancy and professor of astronomy in the faculty of science there.  Other promotions followed in succeeding decades.  He became Minister of Public Instruction in the Rochebouet cabinet in 1877, a position which he held only briefly.
His work covered the entire field of astronomical investigation.  It comprised the determination of comet periods, the measurement of parallaxes, and the study of stellar and planetary movements.  He also studied the physics of the sun.  He advanced several original theories on the nature and form of comets, meteors, the aurora borealis, and the sun.

[[List of military aircraft of France]]

CATEGORIES: French Air Force, French military aircraft, Lists of military aircraft

France has used many military aircraft both in its air force, the Armée de l'Air, and other branches of its armed forces. Numerous aircraft were designed and built in France, but many aircraft from elsewhere, or part of joint ventures have been used as well. Lighter-than-air aircraft such as dirigibles and balloons found use starting in the 19th century used mainly for observation. The advent of World War I saw an explosion in the number France's aircraft, though development slowed after. While having many promising designs in development in the 1930s, government wrangling delayed development enough there was little available at the out break of World War II. The armistice in 1940 marked a low point, with Vichy France being allowed only reduced numbers and development halting. Many French aircraft were captured and used by the Third Reich and its allies. Some aircraft that did escape served with the Allies or Free French forces, who also used many other types of allied aircraft. The cold-war saw the continued use of many other Western aircraft, mainly from the U.S., during a period of rebuilding of the aviation industry and under threat of war with the Soviet Union.  Many new types would come into service including the very successful Mirage series or the latest design, the Rafale.

"Margaritaville" is a 1977 song by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett from the album Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes. This song was written about a drink Buffett discovered at Lung's Cocina del Sur restaurant on Anderson Lane in Austin, Texas, and the first huge surge of tourists who descended on Key West, Florida around that time; he wrote most of the song that night in Austin and finished it while spending time in Key West.

Tragopan is a genus of bird in the family Phasianidae. These birds are commonly called "horny pheasants" because of two brightly colored, fleshy horns on their heads that they can erect during courtship displays. The scientific name refers to this, being a composite of tragus (billy goat) and the ribald half-goat deity Pan (and in the case of the Satyr Tragopan, adding Pan's companions for even more emphasis). Their habit of nesting in trees is unique among phasianids.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=McGowan |first=Philip |author= |authorlink= |coauthors=M.W.

Splatterpunk has been defined as a "literary genre characterised by graphically described scenes of an extremely gory nature."Warren Clements, "A quick course in Euro-surgery". The Globe and Mail September 28, 1996. 
Michael Shea's short fiction "The Autopsy" (1980) has been described as a "proto-splatterpunk" 
story.[ref]Robert A. Collins, Robert Latham, Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review Annual Meckler, 1989
ISBN 0887363695.  (p.99)[/ref]
Splatterpunk provoked considerable controversy among horror writers. Robert Bloch criticised the movement, stating "there is a distinction to be made between that which inspires terror and that which inspires nausea".[ref]Paul Bail, 
John Saul: A Critical Companion Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996
ISBN 0313295751 (p. 26).[/ref] William F. Nolan and Charles L. Grant also censured
the movement.[ref] Rob Latham,

the latter stating splatterpunk was a "survivalist" literature that "reflects the moral chaos of 
our times".
Though the term gained some prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, and, as a movement, attracted a cult following, the term "splatterpunk" has since been replaced by other synonymous terms for the genre.[tpl]cite web |url=http://diewachen.com/2007/07/types-of-horror_24.html |title=Types of Horror/All Sorts of Punk |accessdate=2008-10-10 |author=Remy, J.E. |date=2007-07-24 |work=Die Wachen[/tpl] The last major commercial endeavor aimed at the Splatterpunk audience was 1995's Splatterpunks II: Over the Edge, an anthology of short stories which also included essays on horror cinema and an interview with Anton LaVey. By 1998, one
commentator was stating that interest in splatterpunk was declining, noting such interest "seemed to have reached a peak" in 
the mid-1990s.Jane Sullivan, "Schlock Horror". Sunday Age July, 19th, 1998, (p. 15).  
The term is still sometimes used for horror with a strong gruesome element, such as Philip Nutman's novel Cities of Night.[ref]Publisher's Weekly's review described 
Cities of Night as "seasoned with a dash of splatterpunk".

[[History of alternative medicine]]
CATEGORIES: Alternative medicine

The term alternative medicine refers to systems of medical thought and practice which function as alternatives to or subsist outside of conventional, mainstream medicine. Alternative medicine cannot exist absent an established, authoritative and stable medical orthodoxy to which it can function as an alternative. Such orthodoxy was only established in the West during the nineteenth century through processes of regulation, association, institution building and systematised medical education.[tpl]sfn|Bivins|2007|p=171|ps=[/tpl]

The Antiphonary tonary missal of St. Benigne (also called Antiphonarium Codex Montpellier or Tonary of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon) was supposed to be written in the last years of the 10th century, when the Abbot William of Volpiano at St. Benignus of Dijon reformed the liturgy of several monasteries in Burgundy. The chant manuscript records mainly Western plainchant of the Roman-Frankish proper mass and part of the chant sung during the matins ("Gregorian chant"), but unlike the common form of the Gradual and of the Antiphonary, William organized his manuscript according to the chant genre (antiphons with psalmody, alleluia verses, graduals, offertories, and proses for the missal part), and these sections were subdivided into eight parts according to the octoechos. This disposition followed the order of a tonary, but William of Volpiano wrote not only the incipits of the classified chant, he wrote the complete chant text with the music in central French neumes which were still written in campo aperto, and added a second alphabetic notation of his own invention for the melodic structure of the codified chant.

[[Sami shamanism]]

CATEGORIES: Sami mythology, Shamanism

Sami  shamanism  is shamanism as practiced by the  Sami people. Though they vary considerably from region to region within Sápmi, traditional Sámi beliefs consist of three intertwining elements: animism, shamanism and polytheism. Animism is manifested in the Sámi belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul, and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional Sámi beliefs include a multitude of spirits.[tpl]cite web|title=The Decline of the Sámi People’s Indigenous Religion |last= Holloway|first= Alan “Ivvár”|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= TexasU|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/decline.htm[/tpl] Sami religion commonly emphasizes veneration of the dead and of animal spirit such as bear worship. The study of Sámi religion is also based on archaeological remains and written sources from missionary work in northern Scandinavia from the Middle Ages to as late to the early 18th century, though some of the knowledge exists as family oral tradition.

The European Committee for Standardization (CEN, [tpl]lang-fr|Comité Européen de Normalisation[/tpl]) is a non-profit organisation whose mission is to foster the European economy in global trading, the welfare of European citizens and the environment by providing an efficient infrastructure to interested parties for the development, maintenance and distribution of coherent sets of standards and specifications. 
The CEN was founded in 1961. Its thirty national members work together to develop European Standards (ENs) in various sectors to build a European internal market for goods and services and to position Europe in the global economy.  CEN is officially recognised as a European standards body by the European Union; the other official European standards bodies are the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).Council Directive 83/189/EEC of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations. Official Journal of the European Communities. April 26, 1983. This directive only recognises CEN and CENELEC as European standards institutions. Accessed 2009-04-27.See Annex 1 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure. Official Journal of the European Communities. July 21, 1998. Accessed 2009-04-27.
More than 60,000 technical experts as well as business federations, consumer and other societal interest organisations are involved in the CEN network that reaches over 460 million people. CEN is the officially recognized standardisation representative for sectors other than electrotechnical (CENELEC) and telecommunications (ETSI). On 12 February 1999 the European Parliament noted in a resolution that CEN, CENELEC and ETSI co-operate smoothly and that a merger of the three standardisaton bodies would not have clear advantages.European Parliament: Resolution on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament ‘Efficiency and Accountability in European Standardisation under the New Approach’(COM(98)0291 − C4-0442/98). Official Journal of the European Communities 12 February 1999. Other language versions can be accessed from European Commission: Directorate General Enterprise and Industry: Standardisation. Accessed 2009-04-27.
The standardisation bodies of the thirty national members represent the twenty seven member states of the European Union, three countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and countries which are likely to join the EU or EFTA in the future. CEN is contributing to the objectives of the European Union and European Economic Area with technical standards (EN standards) which promote free trade, the  safety of workers and consumers, interoperability of networks, environmental protection, exploitation of research and development programmes, and public procurement.   An example of mandatory standards are those for materials and products used in construction and listed under the Construction Products Directive.   The CE mark is a declaration by the manufacturer that a product complies with the respective EU directive and hence the harmonized standard(s) referenced by the directive(s).
CEN (together with CENELEC) owns the Keymark, a voluntary quality mark for products and services. A product bearing the Keymark demonstrates conformity to European Standards.

MythBusters is a science entertainment television program created by Peter Rees and produced by Australia's Beyond Television Productions for the Discovery Channel. The series is transmitted by numerous international broadcasters, including SBS Australia (New episodes, repeat episodes show on 7mate Australia), and other Discovery channels worldwide. The show's hosts, special effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, use elements of the scientific method to test the validity of rumors, myths, movie scenes, adages, Internet videos, and news stories. The show is one of the oldest—and the most popular—on Discovery Channel currently in production, being preceded only by How It's Made in the US and Daily Planet in Canada.
Filming is based in San Francisco, though some elements of production are done in Artarmon, Australia. Planning and some experimentation take place at Hyneman's workshops in San Francisco; experiments requiring more space or special accommodations are filmed on location, typically around the San Francisco Bay area and other locations in northern California, going elsewhere when required, such as Florida for alligator experiments, or Africa for shark and elephant myths.
During the second season, members of Savage's and Hyneman's team ("The Build Team") were organized into a second team and now generally test myths separately from the main duo and operate from another workshop. On rare occasions, there are episodes where the entire cast teams up to do a special.
MythBusters refers both to the name of the documentary and also the cast members who test the experiments.

The Balkan Campaign of World War II began with the Italian invasion of Greece on 28 October 1940. In the early months of 1941, Italy's offensive had been stalled and a Greek counter-offensive pushed into Albania. Germany sought, by deploying troops to Romania and Bulgaria, to aid Italy by attacking Greece from the east; while the British landed troops and aircraft to shore up Greek defences. A coup d'état in Yugoslavia on 27 March caused Hitler to order the conquest of that country.
The invasion of Yugoslavia by Germany and Italy began on 6 April, simultaneously with the new Battle of Greece. On 11 April, Hungary joined the invasion. By 17 April the Yugoslavs had signed an armistice and by 30 April all of mainland Greece was under German or Italian control. On 20 May Germany invaded Crete by air and by 1 June all remaining Greek and British forces on the island had surrendered. Although it had not participated in the attacks in April, Bulgaria occupied parts of both Yugoslavia and Greece shortly thereafter for the remainder of the war in the Balkans.

Guaifenesin protocol is an unapproved treatment for fibromyalgia suggested in the 1990s by R. Paul St. Amand. The protocol involves three parts: titrating the guaifenesin dosage, avoiding salicylates, and following a low-carbohydrate diet if the patient is hypoglycemic. Guaifenesin has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of fibromyalgia, and the protocol has not been shown to be effective in  clinical trials.

The Russell Tribunal, also known as the International War Crimes Tribunal or Russell-Sartre Tribunal, was a private body organized by British philosopher Bertrand Russell and hosted by French philosopher and playwright Jean-Paul Sartre. Along with Ken Coates, Ralph Schoenman, Julio Cortázar and several others, the tribunal investigated and evaluated American foreign policy and military intervention in Vietnam, following the 1954 defeat of French forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the establishment of North and South Vietnam.
Bertrand Russell justified the establishment of this body as follows:
The formation of this investigative body immediately followed the 1966 publication of Russell's book, War Crimes in Vietnam. The tribunal was constituted in November 1966, and was conducted in two sessions in 1967, in Stockholm, Sweden and Roskilde, Denmark. It was largely ignored in the United States.
Further tribunals were set up in the following decades on the same model, using the denomination Russell Tribunal.

Reverend Captain William Andrew White, II, D.D. (June 16, 1874 – September, 1936) was an American-born Canadian missionary and World War I chaplain, the only black chaplain in the entire British Army during the war. He was the father of singer Portia White. 
He was born to former slaves in King and Queen County, Virginia. He came to Nova Scotia in 1900 after a Canadian school teacher in Baltimore, Maryland impressed him with descriptions of the province.[ref]
</ref> He pictured this land as his key to freedom. He became the second black man accepted by [[Acadia University]] and the first to be later honoured with a Doctorate of Divinity. Rev. White graduated from Acadia in 1903 with an arts degree in [[Theology]], was ordained a minister, and spent the next two years as a travelling missionary for the African Baptist Churches of Nova Scotia.<ref name ="our"/>
Rev. White met and married Izie Dora White (coincidentally she had the same last name) of Mill Village, Nova Scotia and together they raised a family of thirteen children. One of their children, Portia White, grew to become a world famous singer. Another, Bill Jr., became the first Black Canadian to run for federal political office in Canada when he stood as a candidate for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the 1949 federal election. A third, Jack, was a noted Canadian labour union activist and the second black candidate to run for office in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. 
In 1916, Rev. White enlisted in the No. 2 Construction Battalion, an all black segregated unit serving in World War I. He was the only black chaplain in the entire British Army and was a commissioned officer serving with the rank of Captain.  Following the war Rev. White returned home to Halifax and was called to Cornwallis Street Baptist Church, a position he held for over 17 years. During the early  1930s, his services were broadcast over the radio every month, and they were heard throughout the Maritimes.
Rev. White died of cancer in September 1936.
His grandchildren include Senator Donald Oliver, politician and activist Sheila White and folk musician Chris White. The novelist and playwright George Elliott Clarke is his great-grandson.

[[Flexure bearing]]

CATEGORIES: Bearings

A flexure bearing is a bearing which allows motion by bending a load element.
A typical flexure bearing is just one part, joining two other parts. For example, a hinge may be made by attaching a long strip of a flexible element to a door and to the door frame. Another example is a rope swing, where the rope is tied to a tree branch.
Flexure bearings have the advantage over most other bearings that they are simple and thus inexpensive. They are also often compact, light weight, have very low friction, and are easier to repair without specialized equipment. Flexure bearings have the disadvantages that the range of motion is limited, and often very limited for bearings that support high loads.
A flexure bearing relies on the bearing element being made of a material which can be repeatedly flexed without disintegrating. However, most materials fall apart if flexed a lot. For example, most metals will fatigue with repeated flexing, and will eventually snap. Thus, one part of flexure bearing design is avoiding fatigue. Note, however, that fatigue is important in other bearings. For example, the rollers and races in a rolling-element bearing fatigue as they flatten against each other.
Flexure bearings can give very low friction and also give very predictable friction. Many other bearings rely on sliding or rolling motions, which are necessarily uneven because the bearing surfaces are never perfectly flat. A flexure bearing operates by bending of materials, which causes motion at microscopic level, so friction is very uniform. For this reason, flexure bearings are often used in sensitive precision measuring equipment.
Flexure bearings are not limited to low loads, however. For example, the drive shafts of some sports cars replace cardan universal joints with an equivalent joint called a rag joint which works by bending rubberized fabric. The resulting joint is lighter yet is capable of carrying hundreds of kilowatts, with adequate durability for a sports car. 
Many flexure bearings are combined with other elements. For example, many motor vehicles use leaf springs. The spring both holds the position of the axle as the axle moves (flexure bearing) and provides force to support the vehicle (springing). In many cases it is not clear where flexure bearing leaves off and something else takes up. For example, turbines are often supported on flexible shafts so an imperfectly balanced turbine can find its own center and run with reduced vibration. Seen one way, the flexible shaft includes the function of a flexure bearing; seen another, the shaft is not a "bearing".

Designed by an unknown architect, possibly the mason William Arnold, the three-storey mansion, constructed of the local Ham Hill stone, was built in about 1598 by Sir Edward Phelips, Master of the Rolls and the prosecutor during the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://collections.europarchive.org/ukparliament/20090701100701/http:/www.parliament.uk/gunpowderplot/ |title=The Gunpowder Plot: Parliament & Treason 1605 - People |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=2008-07-02[/tpl]
Sir Edward Phelips' descendants occupied the house until the early 20th century. Following a brief period, when the house was let to tenants, one of whom was Lord Curzon who lived at the house with his mistress, the novelist Elinor Glyn, it was acquired by the National Trust in 1927. It is fully open to the public. Since 1975, the mansion's Long Gallery, the longest in England, has served as a regional outpost of the National Portrait Gallery and displays an important collection of oils and watercolours contemporary to the house.
The house and its gardens have been a filming location for several films and a setting for television costume dramas and literary adaptations.

[[Zamindar]]

CATEGORIES: Mughal Empire, Indian feudalism, Indian words and phrases, Urdu words and phrases, Feudalism in Pakistan

A zamindar on the Indian subcontinent was an aristocrat, typically hereditary, who held enormous tracts of land and held control over his peasants, from whom the zamindars reserved the right to collect tax (often for military purposes). Over time, they took princely and royal titles such as Maharaja (Great King), Raja (King), Deshmukh (Chief), Nawab (Lord), Mirza (Prince), Taluqdar (District Holder), Chaudhary (Lord), Reddy (Headman), "Naidu," "Gounder," and many others.
Although zamindars were considered to be equivalent to lords and baronsTime Magazine 1963 in some cases they were seen as independent, sovereign princes.Nathanial William Wraxall (1836): Posthumous memoirs of his own time (Volume 2) pg 135 Often zamindars were Indian princes who lost their sovereignty due to British Rule (see: Madras Zamindari). For example, the Sivaganga Zamindari and Ramnad Zamindari were the lesser and greater Kingdom of Marava ruled by the royal family till 1803; ever since then they were the Zamindars of Marava.
There is no clear distinction between royal zamindars, such as Raja Venkata Ranga Rao, or merely aristocratic zamindars. Many kings were former zamindars, such as the Royal House of Benares; conversely many new zamindars were old kings.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] As a result, there is some confusion about the Indian kingdoms about who is a king and who is a zamindar, as there were as many as 568 kingdoms and, according to some other sources, 572 princely states in India before independence. During the Mughal Empire, zamindars belonged to the nobilityBarbara Daly Metcalf, Joint Committee on South Asia Moral conduct and authority: the place of adab in South Asian Islam pp 269 and formed the ruling class. Emperor Akbar granted them mansabs and their ancestral domains were treated as jagirs.An account of the Ruling Classes of Mughal Empire
The practice took structural footholds before the Mughal Era and was solidified by the indirect system of taxation in the Mughal Empire and British Raj. After the British withdrew, the system was legally abolished with the creation of India, Pakistan and (after independence in 1971) Bangladesh; however, it is current in some areas of modern Pakistan. Zamindars built lavish palaces, lush gardens, schools, temples and other venues of philanthropy. Several families were of ancient lineage and had been independent rulers in earlier periods. In most cases, zamindar families were descendants of cadet branches of earlier royal families.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Zamindars held considerable powers in their territories: magisterial, army recruitment (as lathials), revenue collection and taxation, among others.
Other terms for zamindar were and are used. For example, a zamindar is known as a Wadera or Wadero in Sindh and as a thakur in  Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttrakhand, Chhatisgarh and Bihar. In the Punjab and Haryana, there are multiple variations, such as chaudhary (which often became lambardar or zaildaar during the British Empire's occupation of North India), Sardar and Malik (an Arabic term which literally means "King"). The word zamindar is derived ultimately from the Persian زمین Zamīn, "earth/land", and the common suffix دار -dār, "-holder" (also found in many of the terms above)."zamindar" in the American Heritage Dictionary The term means, in Persian, 'land owner.'
