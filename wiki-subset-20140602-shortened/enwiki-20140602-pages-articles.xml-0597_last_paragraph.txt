[[Claviorganum]]
CATEGORIES: Pipe organ, Harpsichord, Keyboard instruments

The claviorganum (also known as the claviorgan, or organised piano) is a combination of a harpsichord  and an organ. Its origin is uncertain. A number of "virgynalls with regals" are mentioned in the inventories of Henry VIII in 1542/3 and 1547 and Wilson Barry Wilson Barry (1990: 38) cites references to the claviorganum in England dating back to the 1530s. The term claviorganum in its strictest sense refers to the combination of a harpsichord (or other harpsichord type instrument) and an organ, although later could also be used to refer to a combination of a piano and organ. Michael Praetorius describes the claviorganum in his Syntagma Musicum of 1619 as
 
 " ... a clavicymbal, or some other symphony, in which a number of pipes is combined with the strings. Externally it looks exactly like a clavicymbal or symphony, apart from the bellows, which are sometimes set at the rear and sometimes placed inside the body"Michael Praetorius (1619) Chapter 42 (translated David Crookes)

Charles Camilleri (7 September 1931 – 3 January 2009) was a Maltese composer, who had long been acknowledged as Malta's national composer.
Camilleri was born in Ħamrun and, as a teenager, had already composed a number of works based on folk music and legends of his native Malta. He moved from his early influences by Maltese folk music to a musical form "in which nothing is fixed and his compositions evolve from themselves with a sense of fluency and inevitability". He composed over 100 works for orchestra, chamber ensemble, voice and solo instruments.
Camilleri's work has been performed throughout the world and his research of folk music and improvisation, the influences of the sounds of Africa and Asia, together with the academic study of European music, helped him create a "universal" style.
Camilleri is recognized as one of the major composers of his generation. His works include the now famous Malta Suite, Maltese Dances, A Maltese Overture - Din l-Art Helwa, operas in Maltese, a ballet based on the Knights of Malta and the oratorio Pawlu ta' Malta.  His piano piece Cantilena, is currently part of the Grade 5 Trinity Guildhall piano syllabus. The Missa Mundi for solo organ was described by its first publisher as "the organ's Rite of Spring".
He died on 3 January 2009 at the age of 77. His funeral took place two days later at Naxxar, his long-time town of residence. Flags across Malta were flown at half-mast in a national tribute to him.
In 2014, the Central Bank of Malta issued a silver €10 and gold €50 coin in Camilleri's honour - and as part of the EUROPA star collector coin series which  highlights European culture and events on an annual basis.

"Viscoelastic Dissipation in Compact Bone: Implications for Stress-Induced Fluid Flow in Bone." Transactions of the ASME 122 (2000): 166-172. Bone is a composite of the bio-polymer collagen and the bio-ceramic hydroxyapatite. Additionally the collagen is plied in various directions around the bone. Bone has two structural forms; cortical and cancellous.³
The viscoelasticity of bone can therefore arise from the void collapse and desification of cancellous bone and the natural viscoelastic response of collagen as a polymer.3.051/BE.340 Lecture 20: Biomaterials for Organ Replacement. Cambridge, MA: Anne Mayes, 2006.

Naval Air Station Kingsville or NAS Kingsville [tpl]Airport codes|NQI|KNQI|NQI[/tpl] is a military airport located 3 miles east of Kingsville, Texas.
Under the current US Navy organization known as Commander, Naval Installations (CNI), NAS Corpus Christi and NAS Kingsville are part of Navy Region Southeast headquartered at NAS Jacksonville, Florida.  Both facilities were previously under the since-disestablished Navy Region South, where the rear admiral serving as Region Commander and as Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) were the same individual.
NAS Kingsville’s operation is the natural complement of NAS Corpus Christi. NAS Kingsville operates higher performance single engine aircraft, generally over land.  Distance, rather than safety or capacity concerns, limits NAS Kingsville use of overwater areas.
NAS Kingsville also organizes and hosts the annual Wings Over South Texas Air Show.

CookXml is a unique XML data binding engine in Java.  It is capable of mapping XML documents of desired format directly onto the corresponding object-oriented classes, essentially treating XML as a programming language rather than merely a data storage format.  Therefore, it is ideal to use CookXml to write any programs that interpret XML.  The tag library of CookXml is constructed dynamically at run time, and thus allows dynamic XML schema.  The current implementation has unmarshalling part done.
CookXml is free software, distributed under a permissive, X11 style, licence.

Ernest Rudolph Johnson (April 29, 1888 – May 1, 1952) was a Major League Baseball shortstop.  A native of Chicago, Illinois, he played for the Chicago White Sox (1912, 1921–23), St. Louis Terriers (Federal League 1915), St. Louis Browns (1916–1918), and New York Yankees (1923–1925). In between, he spent [tpl]By|1920[/tpl] with the Salt Lake City Bees as their player-manager.
Johnson took over the White Sox shortstop job from the recently banned Swede Risberg in 1921.  He hit .295 and was fourth in the American League with 22 stolen bases.  In 1922 his batting average dropped to .254 and he had the dubious distinction of leading the league in outs (494).
He was acquired by the Yankees via waivers on May 31, 1923 and he batted .447 for them in a limited role.  He played in two games of the 1923 World Series against the New York Giants and scored the series-deciding run as a pinch runner in game number six. Johnson spent the next two years with New York in a part-time role, batting .353 and .282.  On October 28, 1925 at age 37, Johnson was sent to the St. Paul Saints of the American Association as part of a multi-player trade.
Johnson's career totals for 813 games include 697 hits, 19 home runs, 256 runs batted in, 372 runs scored, a .266 batting average, and a slugging percentage of .350.
After Johnson's playing career, he spent several years as a manager in the minor leagues. He managed the Portland Beavers from [tpl]By|1926[/tpl] until [tpl]By|1928[/tpl] and the Seattle Indians from [tpl]By|1929[/tpl] until [tpl]By|1933[/tpl]. After that, he worked for the Boston Red Sox as an advance scout until his death in 1952.
His son was former major league second baseman Don Johnson. His brother, George, was a long-time minor league umpire.

[[MS Batory]]

The M/S ''Batory'' was a large (14,287 BRT) ocean liner of the Polish merchant fleet, named after Stefan Batory, the famous sixteenth-Century king of Poland.  
She was built at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico Monfalcone Shipyard in Trieste, Italy, under an arrangement where part of her payment was made in shipments of coal from Poland.  She was among the most notable tourist attractions of the Polish seaside and among the best-known Polish ships of the time.  She was launched on 3 July 1935.  The ship was powered by 2 sets of Burmeister and Wain diesel engines driving 2 screws giving a speed of 18 knots.  She began regular service in May 1936 on the Gdynia—New York run, and by 1939 she had carried over 30,000 passengers.   
Mobilized at the outbreak of World War II, she served as a troop transport and a hospital ship by the Allied Navy for the rest of the war. In 1940 she, along with M/S Chrobry, transported allied troops to Norway. She was also responsible for secretly shipping many valuable Polish treasures to Canada for safekeeping. She participated in the evacuation of Dunkirk late May early June, taking aboard 2,500 persons. Later she carried as many as 6,000 people in one evacuation. In June to July, she secretly transported much of Britain's gold reserves (₤40 million) from Greenock, Scotland to Montreal, Canada for safekeeping.  On 4 August 1940 she left Liverpool with convoy WS 2 (Winston's Specials) transporting 480 children to Sydney Australia, under the Children's Overseas Reception Board for safekeeping until the war was over. She sailed via Cape Town, India, Singapore (where she disembarked 300 troops) and Sydney. The journey had been a happy one, with so much music and laughter that the Batory was dubbed the "Singing Ship" and was the subject of a book  The singing ship : an odyssey of evacuee children, Meta Maclean, Angus and Robertson, Sydney. 1941, by the same name. 
She was involved in the invasion of Oran in Algeria in 1942, transported troops to India and the invasions of Sicily and southern France, where she was the flagship of General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army.  She came under attack several times from the ground and the air, but managed to escape serious damage.
Dubbed the Lucky Ship for her military career during World War II, she was a sister ship to the less fortunate MS Piłsudski which was sunk in November 1939.
220px|left|thumb Returned to Poland in 1946, she continued her civilian service, transporting such eminents as Ryszard Kapuściński.  From May 1949 through January 1951, she was the subject of several political incidents in which dockers and shipyard workers in the United States refused to unload cargo from her, or to service the ship by drydocking and painting.
After these incidents, she was withdrawn from the North Atlantic route, refurbished at Hepburn for tropic service, and sailed in August 1951 from Gdynia and Southampton to Bombay and Karachi, via Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, and Suez. In 1957, she returned to the North Atlantic route.  She continued in service until 1971, when she was scrapped in Hong Kong.
She was replaced by TSS Stefan Batory, which began service in April 1969.

The Treaty of Falaise was an agreement made in December 1174 between the captive William I, King of Scots, and the English King Henry II.
William was captured at the Battle of Alnwick during an invasion of Northumbria and was being held in Falaise in Normandy while Henry sent an army north and took several Scottish castles, including Berwick and Edinburgh.  Since he had no heir, William was forced to bargain for release to prevent the end of the Scottish line of kings. 
The Treaty required William to swear that Scotland would thereafter be subordinate to the English crown. English soldiers were also to occupy several key Scottish castles, and Scotland would be heavily taxed to pay for their upkeep.The Struggle for Mastery page 226: ''By the Treaty of Falaise in 1174 William was released, but in return for acknowledging that his kingdom was henceforth a fief held from the king of England. Henry was also to receive homage and fealty from the earls and barons and other men of "the land of the king". All of this was to be guaranteed though the surrender by King William of the castles of Roxburgh, Berwick, Jedburgh, Edinburgh, and Sterling.  During the next 15 years, William was forced to observe Henry's overlordship, and to obtain permission from the English crown before putting down local uprisings.Andrew Lang, A History of Scotland from the Roman Occupation, 1900. p. 113.
The treaty was cancelled in 1189 when Richard the Lionheart, Henry's heir, effectively sold southern Scotland back to the Scottish king to help fund Richard's crusade in the Holy Land.The Struggle for Mastery: ''With Richard in a hurry, a bargain was quickly struck. William gave £6,666 to recover the castles of Berwick and Roxburgh and free his realm from the subjection to England imposed in 1174.

CATEGORIES: Units of time

Samvatsara is a Sanskrit term for "year". In Hindu tradition, there are 60 Samvatsaras, each of which has a name. Once all 60 samvatsaras are over, the cycle starts over again. On occasion, one will be skipped, as the count is based on the zodiac position of Jupiter, whose period around the Sun is slightly less than 12 years (the full cycle of 60 covers five Jovian years).
The sixty Samvatsaras are divided into 3 groups of 20 Samvatsaras each. The first 20 from Prabhava to Vyaya are assigned to Brahma. The next 20 from Sarvajit to Parabhava to Vishnu and the last 20 to Shiva.

The TS/S ''Stefan Batory was an ocean liner built in the Netherlands in 1952, as the fourth HA liner to serve under the name of 'SS Maasdam''', initially used to service the Dutch East Indies by the Holland America Line. Originally planned as ordinary freighter under the name of "Diemerdyk".
She was bought from the Netherlands in June 1968 and began service as a Polish ocean liner on 11 April 1969 as a replacement for the then obsolete, but legendary MS Batory, both named after a king of Poland Stefan Batory (1533–1586). 
After she was refitted and renamed at Gdansk, she became the flagship of the Polish Ocean Lines (1969–1988) and mainly sailed from Gdynia–Copenhagen–Rotterdam–London–Montreal–Southampton–Rotterdam–Copenhagen–Gdynia. According to contemporary press infos, on her first arrival in Rotterdam as the "Stefan Batory" in 1969, the former owners of her expressed their interest in buying her back from Polish owners for service under the former flag.
During her long service, the "Stefan Batory" has at least twice appeared in film, significantly remembered, as "part of the set" in "Kochaj albo rzuć" (Love or Leave). The picture team have simply filmed the ship, festively leaving Gdynia, and a part of her original, regular voyage.
She remained in service until 1988 and was the World's last regularly operated transatlantic liner. Festively farewelled by the people, and rather roughly by the Neptune, she was sold to third hands and finally scrapped in Aliağa, Turkey, works commencing in May 2000.http://StefanBatoryOceanLiner.weebly.com

[[Cost driver]]
CATEGORIES: Management accounting, Costs, Production economics

According to CIMA, ‘cost driver is any factor which causes a change in the cost of an activity.  A cost driver is the unit of an activity that causes the change in activity's cost. 
Examples: In marketing, cost drivers are  Number of advertisements, Number of sales personnel etc. In Customer service, cost drivers are Number of service calls attended, number of staff in service department, number of warranties handled, Hours spent on servicing etc...
"Cost drivers are the structural determinants of the cost of an activity, reflecting any linkages or interrelationships that affect it" (M. Porter).  Therefore we could assume that the cost drivers determine the cost behavior within the activities, reflecting the links that these have with other activities and relationships that affect them.
The Activity Based Costing (ABC) approach relates indirect cost to the activities that drive them to be incurred. 
Activity Based Costing is based on the belief that activities cause costs and therefore a link should be established between activities and product. The cost drivers thus are the link between the activities and the cost.
Generally, the cost driver for short term indirect variable costs may be the volume of output/activity; but for long term indirect variable costs, the cost drivers will not be related to volume of output/activity.
In traditional costing the cost driver to allocate indirect cost to cost objects was volume of output. With the change in business structures, technology and thereby cost structures it was found that the volume of output was not the only cost driver. Some examples of indirect costs and their drivers are: indirect costs for maintenance, with the possible driver of this cost being the number of machine hours; or, the indirect cost of handling raw-material cost, which may be driven by the number of orders received; or, inspection costs that are driven by the number of inspections or the hours of inspection or production runs.
John Shank and Vijay Govindarajan list cost drivers into two categories:
Structural cost drivers that are derived from the business strategic choices about its underlying economic structure such as scale and scope of operations, complexity of products, use of technology, etc., and
Executional cost drivers that are derived from the execution of the business activities such as capacity utilization, plant layout, work-force involvement, etc.
Resource cost Driver is measure of quantity of resources consumed by an activity. It is used to assign cost of a resource to activity or cost pool.
Activity Cost Driver is measure of frequency and intensity of demand placed on activities by cost object. It is used to assign activity costs to cost objects.
To carry out a value chain analysis, ABC is a necessary tool. To carry out ABC, it is necessary that cost drivers are established for different cost pools.

Peter McGuffin is a psychiatrist and geneticist from Belfast, Northern Ireland.
After emigrating with his parents at aged 10 to the Isle of Wight, he first decided that he wanted to be a psychiatrist at the age of 16 after coming across Freud’s Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, in a local public library. He attended medical school at the University of Leeds, England where he graduated in 1972 and then received postgraduate training in internal medicine. It was at this stage that he became interested in genetics and had his first publications on immunogenetic aspects of coronary heart disease. He transferred this interest to psychiatric disorders and carried out one of the first genetic marker association studies on schizophrenia.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.132.2.149 |title=Histocompatability antigens and schizophrenia |year=1978 |last1=McGuffin |first1=P. |last2=Farmer |first2=A. E. |last3=Rajah |first3=S. M. |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=149[/tpl] 
He completed his training as a psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital, London and was awarded a Medical Research Council Fellowship to study genetics at the University of London and at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. He subsequently became an MRC Senior Clinical Fellow at the Maudsley and the Institute of Psychiatry and then took up the Chair of Psychological Medicine at the University of Wales College of Medicine in Cardiff in 1987. He succeeded Prof Sir Michael Rutter as Director of the MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre at the Institute of Psychiatry in October 1998. From January 2007 to December 2009 he was the Dean of the Institute of Psychiatry.

[[Utopia, Northern Territory]]
CATEGORIES: Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, Australian Aboriginal freehold title, Australian Aboriginal culture, Geography of the Northern Territory

Utopia is an Aboriginal homeland formed in November 1978 by the amalgamation of the former Utopia pastoral lease with a tract of unalienated land to its north. It covers an area of 3,500 square kilometres, transected by the Sandover River, and lies on a traditional boundary of the Alyawarra and Anmatjirra people, the two language groups which predominate there today. The name is probably a corruption of Uturupa, which means ‘big sand hill’, a region in the north west extremity of the area.
It has a number of unique elements.  It is one of a minority of communities created by autonomous activism in the early phase of the land rights movement. It was neither a former mission, nor a government settlement, but was successfully claimed by indigenous people who had never been fully dispossessed.  Its people have expressly repudiated any municipal establishment, and instead live in a score of outstations or clan sites, each with a traditional claim to the place.
Its Aboriginal artists have been remarkably successful, and continue to produce distinctive works that are collected by people in Australia and all over the world.  A series of population health surveys carried out between 1986 and 2004, have shown that Utopia people are significantly healthier than comparable groups, particularly their rates of mortality.  This has been attributed to the more active ‘outstation way of life’. Community living, cultural factors and the primary health care facility were also important factors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/health-oatsih-pubs-linkphc~health-oatsih-pubs-linkphc-local~casestudies~case1 |title=The Link Between Primary Health Care and Health Outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians |publisher=Department of Health and Ageing |accessdate=28 July 2012 [/tpl]  This finding is of considerable interest to students of indigenous health.

Plasmatronics is a company, founded by former Air Force Weapons Laboratory (now Phillips Laboratory) scientist Dr. Alan E. Hill, which produced a plasma speaker design.  This was first demonstrated at the 1978 Winter Consumer Electronics Show.
The product was effectively a loudspeaker with an integrated amplifier; however, it used a gas plasma, sourced from a helium tank in the back  of the unit, as a near-massless driver.  The plasma driver only reproduced the higher frequencies as a tweeter; the lower frequencies used a conventional woofer driver.
While praised for accurate sound reproduction at demonstrations, the system had a number of disadvantages, including high cost, and the periodic handling of heavy compressed helium cylinders.

The 1970 English cricket season was marked by controversy when a tour by South Africa was forced to be abandoned in view of mounting opposition to the apartheid policy maintained by that country's then government.  Instead, England played a highly successful series of unofficial Tests against a Rest of the World XI which was captained by Gary Sobers and included some of the best South African players such as Graeme Pollock, Eddie Barlow, Mike Procter and Barry Richards. These matches were promoted as Tests at the time, but were not recognised as such by the International Cricket Conference. Alan Jones played for England only in this series, and had the unfortunate experience of thinking that he had played in Tests only subsequently to discover that he had not.

CATEGORIES: Greek rock music groups, Musical groups from Athens

The Earthbound is a Greek band.
The band was formed in Athens in 1998 by six members and former members of The Last Drive, Honeydive, Rockin' Bones and Engine-V. After playing locally for about a year, including a slot in Rockwave festival in 1999, the Earthbound recorded its debut 7" single "The Valley/Riverside Song/Tercera Cancion", released with Fractal Press magazine. 
The Earthbound signed to Trade Records and recorded their self-titled debut album produced by their sound-engineer, Jim Spliff. It was released in 2000 and featured 13 songs, including three covers of songs by Kyuss, Woody Guthrie and Guillermo Portaballes that showcased the band's diverse influences. 
In 2001 they recorded the soundtrack for the film Stakaman by Antonis Kafetzopoulos, which was released by M Records. At the same period, Alex K and Thanos A worked on the soundtrack for the film SOSE ME (directed by Stratos Tzitzis), released a few months later by Universal (Greece). The Earthbound spent the next eighteen months touring. They also took part in two benefit concerts for the campaign Escuelas para Chiapas (A School for Chiapas) and in June 2003 they played at the demonstration against the EU summit in Thessaloniki. In September 2003 Louis (former member of the historical Athenian punk band Stress) joined on trumpet and percussion. 
In 2004 they signed to Sirius (the record label formed by Manos Hadjidakis) and started working on their third album, Brotherhood of the Dog, this time produced by Jim Spliff and the band itself. The album was released later the same year and featured 11 songs (including an Ennio Morricone cover). 
In early 2005 they played two gigs in Cyprus and recruited a second trumpet player, Johnny Mato (also member of Dr. Vodkatini and Da Traces).The eight-piece band contributed a track to the Spinalonga records compilation In The Junkyard vol. II and continued touring and writing songs for their next album. 
It was finally released in spring of 2008 at the band's own label, LAB Records, under the title La Guerra Final   . Including 11 original songs, it is considered by many their best studio effort. 
The Earthbound suspended action in summer of 2009.

[[Plasma speaker]]
CATEGORIES: Magnetic propulsion devices, Plasma physics, Loudspeakers

Plasma speakers are a form of loudspeaker which varies air pressure via a high-energy electrical plasma instead of a solid diaphragm. Connected to the output of an audio amplifier, plasma speakers vary the size of a plasma glow discharge, corona discharge or electric arc which then acts as a massless radiating element, creating the compression waves in air that listeners perceive as sound. The technique is an evolution of William Duddell's "singing arc" of 1900, and an innovation related to ion thruster spacecraft propulsion. 
The effect takes advantage of two unique principles. Firstly, ionization of gases causes their electrical resistance to drop significantly, making them extremely efficient conductors, which allows them to vibrate sympathetically with magnetic fields. 
Secondly, the involved plasma, itself a field of ions, has a relatively negligible mass. Thus as current frequency varies, more-resistant air remains mechanically coupled with and is driven by vibration of the  more conductive and essentially massless plasma, radiating a potentially ideal reproduction of the sound source.
Conventional loudspeaker transducer designs use input electrical frequencies to vibrate a significant mass: This driver is coupled to a stiff plastic composite speaker cone - a diaphragm which pushes air at respective frequencies. But the inertia inherent in its mass resists acceleration- and all changes in cone position. Additionally, speaker cones will eventually suffer tensile fatigue from the repeated shaking of sonic vibration.
Thus conventional speaker output, or the fidelity of the device, is distorted by physical limitations inherent in its design. These distortions have long been the limiting factor in commercial reproduction of strong high frequencies. To a lesser extent square wave characteristics are also problematic; the reproduction of square waves most stress a speaker cone. 
In a plasma speaker, as member of the family of massless speakers, these limitations do not exist. The low-inertia driver has exceptional transient response over other designs. The result is an even, linear output accurate even at extreme frequencies beyond any audible range. Such speakers are notable for accuracy and clarity, but not tremendous power because plasmas composed of tiny particles are unable to move large volumes of air. So these designs are more effective as tweeters.

[[Reverence (sculpture)]]
CATEGORIES: Outdoor sculptures in Vermont, Vermont culture, South Burlington, Vermont, Artworks surveyed by Save Outdoor Sculpture!, Stone sculptures, 1989 sculptures

Reverence is a sculpture created by Jim Sardonis in 1989.  The sculpture depicts two tails of whales "diving" into a sea of grass and is meant to symbolize the fragility of the planet.  The tails were made from 36 tons of African black granite and stand 12-13 feet tall.
The sculpture was originally commissioned by British metals trader David Threlkeld, who was then a resident of Randolph, Vermont.  The tails were to be at the entrance to a conference center that Threlkeld was planning, but financing fell through and Threlkeld moved to Arizona.  After ten years at this Randolph site, they were sold and then moved to Technology Park in South Burlington where Ben & Jerry's ice cream has its corporate headquarters.
The Whale Tails, as the sculpture is more commonly known by local residents, is a landmark of sorts on the side of Interstate 89 between Exits 12 and 13 in Vermont. The sculpture is located at [tpl]coord|44|26|44|N|73|08|35|W|display=inline,title[/tpl], on the right side of the north-bound lane. The sculpture has graced the covers of at least two books, Weird New England by Joseph A. CitroJoseph A. Citro, Joe Citro's weird New England (New York: Sterling Publishing Co., 2005) ISBN 978-1-4027-3330-7  and the art history textbook A World of Art by Henry Sayre.Henry M. Sayre, A World of Art, 4th ed. (Upper Saddle River, N.J. : Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2005) ISBN 978-0-13-189262-0 It was included in Weird New England because the sculpture is well-known statewide, has an unusual location, and depicts sea creatures in New England's only landlocked state.  A World of Art also includes a CD-ROM with video of the creation of the sculpture.
This sculpture is documented in the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture! database.Save Outdoor Sculpture! Inventories: Reverence, http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!310396~!0#focus (accessed December 20, 2009).

Options arbitrage trades are commonly performed by floor traders in the options market to earn small profits with very little or zero risk.
Traders perform conversions when options are relatively overpriced by purchasing stock and selling the equivalent options position. When the options are relatively underpriced, traders will do reverse conversions or reversals. In practice, actionable option arbitrage opportunities have decreased with the advent of automated trading strategies.

Tom Quinn is a fictional character in the BBC espionage television series Spooks, which follows the exploits of Section D, a counter-terrorism division of MI5. He is portrayed by British actor Matthew Macfadyen. In the first two series, Tom is the chief of Section D. The character was in the first and second episode of the third series but was decommissioned as a result of sabotaging an operation.
Series creator David Wolstencroft believed that writing Tom was the most fun, yet hardest to work on. During the second series, the producers were unsure whether Macfadyen would return for the third; because of this, Tom was originally killed in the second series finale. However, when Macfadyen decided to appear in the first two episodes of the third series, series writer Howard Brenton had to "unkill him." Reaction towards the character by fans were positive, though critics were mixed about Macfadyen's portrayal. Tom Quinn would later appear again as a cameo on the final episode of Spooks; his brief return was met with generally positive reactions.

[[Trifluoromethyl]]

CATEGORIES: Haloalkyl groups

Trifluoromethyl is a functional group in organofluorines that has the formula -CF3.  The naming of is group is derived from the methyl group (which has the formula -CH3), by replacing each hydrogen atom by a fluorine atom.  The trifluomethyl group has a significant electronegativity that is often described as being intermediate between the electronegativities of fluorine and chlorine.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jan E. True, T. Darrah Thomas, Rolf W. Winter, Gary L. Gard | year = 2003 | title = Electronegativities from Core-Ionization Energies: Electronegativities of SF5 and CF3 | journal = Inorganic Chemistry | volume = 42 | pages = 4437–4441 | doi = 10.1021/ic0343298 | pmid = 12844318 | issue = 14[/tpl]  For this reason, trifluoromethyl-substituted compounds are often strong acids, such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and trifluoroacetic acid.  In other cases, the trifluoromethyl group is employed to lower the basicity of organic compounds or to confer distinctive solvation properties (e.g. trifluoroethanol). 
The trifluoromethyl group occurs in certain pharmaceuticals, drugs, and abiotically synthesized natural fluorocarbon based compounds. The medicinal use of the trifloromethyl group dates from 1928, although research became more intense in the mid-1940s.[tpl]cite journal | author = Yale, Harry L. | title = The Trifluoromethyl Group in Medicinal Chemistry | journal = Journal of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry | year = 1959 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–133 | doi = 10.1021/jm50003a001[/tpl] The trifluoromethyl group is often used as a bioisostere to create derivatives by replacing a chloride or a methyl group. This can be used to adjust the steric and electronic properties of a lead compound, or to protect a reactive methyl group from metabolic oxidation. Some notable drugs containing trifluoromethyl groups include efavirenz (Sustiva), an HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor; fluoxetine (Prozac), an antidepressant; and celecoxib (Celebrex), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.

Eudrilids further differ from megascolecids, and ocnerodrilids in the development of internal fertilisation with the equivalent of the spermathecae opening directly to the ovisacs, allowing sperm to combine with the eggs from the ovaries via a female opening in segment 14.

[[Centroacinar cell]]
CATEGORIES: Digestive system

Centroacinar cells are spindle-shaped cells in the exocrine pancreas. Centroacinar cells are an extension of the intercalated duct cells into each pancreatic acinus. The intercalated ducts take the bicarbonate to intralobular ducts which become lobular ducts. These lobular ducts finally converge to form the main pancreatic duct.[tpl]cite book| author = Wendy Lackey M.A. | title = Oral Cavity and Upper GI tract (coursepack from Michigan State University College of Human Medicine) | chapter=lectures ession 12 | page = 327 |date=February 2011 | pmid = | doi = | url = | issn = [/tpl]
These cells are commonly known as duct cells, and secrete an aqueous bicarbonate solution under stimulation by the hormone secretin. They also secrete mucin.

The Burston Strike School was at the centre of the longest running strike in British history, between 1914 and 1939.  Now a museum, it is in the village of Burston in Norfolk, England.  
The strike began when teachers at the village's Church of England school, Annie Higdon and her husband, Tom Higdon, were sacked after a dispute with the area's school management committee and schoolchildren went on strike in their support. The Higdons set up an alternative school which was attended by 66 of their 72 former pupils.  Beginning in a marquee on the village green, the school moved to a local carpenter's premises and later to a purpose-built school financed by donations from the labour movement. Burston Strike School carried on teaching local children until shortly after Tom's death in 1939.

[[Lisburn Racquets Club]]

CATEGORIES: Sport in County Antrim, Sport in Lisburn

The Lisburn Racquets Club is a sports club in Lisburn, Northern Ireland. The club was formed in 1932 by the members of Lisburn Cricket Club to keep their members together during the winter months. It played in the British Legion Hall until the late 1950s and then moved to the Black Hall on the Hillhall Road. It incorporates Alpha Badminton Club, Lisburn Racquets Squash Club & Hilden Tennis Club.
In the 1960s it fund raised with the members of Hilden Tennis Club, with whom it had many members in common and with grant aid from the Department of Education it built the first stage of the current club. Play started here in November 1971.
A number of extensions have been added over the years – the major one being the addition of a 12 court badminton hall in 1996 with the help of Lottery Funding. This hall is also used by ten schools during the day and for netball and football – one of its current users being the Manchester United F.C. Academy.
Alpha is the largest badminton club in Ireland and over the last 15 years has won the All-Ireland Senior Cup 10 times. In doing so it qualified to represent Ireland in the Europe Cup – a competition for the champion club teams of all the European countries.
Alpha is divided into a number of sections decided mainly by the standard of player and partly by age. The Senior Club plays on Tuesday evenings with players of approximately League Division 1 standard. The Minor Club plays on Thursday evenings with players ranging from League Division 2 to Division 6 standard. The Tyros Club plays on Wednesday evenings with players from League Divisions 7 to 9 standard.
It has over 550 children divided into 10 sections playing on Friday evenings and on Saturdays from 9.00 – 6.00 with 30 league teams playing in the Ulster Juvenile Leagues.
The three adult sections have 13 teams in the leagues with entries also in the All-Ireland Cup competitions. The Senior section has many current Irish International players, all of the Northern Commonwealth Games team and many promising junior players many of whom have played for Ireland.
Each year Club Championships are held for most of the sections of the Club with preliminary rounds during the season and about fifty finals on a Saturday at the end of the season – late March or early April depending on when Easter falls.

[[Perisinusoidal space]]
CATEGORIES: Liver anatomy, Histology

The perisinusoidal space (or space of Disse) is a location in the liver between a hepatocyte and a sinusoid. It contains the blood plasma.  Microvilli of hepatocytes extend into this space, allowing proteins and other plasma components from the sinusoids to be absorbed by the hepatocytes. Fenestration and discontinuity of the endothelium facilitates this transport.[tpl]cite book |author=Robbins, Stanley L.; Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Collins, Tucker |title=Robbins pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-7335-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] This space may be obliterated in liver disease, leading to decreased uptake by hepatocytes of nutrients and wastes (like bilirubin, for example).  
The Space of Disse also contains Ito cells, also called hepatic stellate cells, which store fat or fat soluble vitamins (like vitamin A).  A variety of insults that cause inflammation can result in Ito cells transforming to myofibroblasts, resulting in collagen production, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.
The Space of Disse was named after German anatomist Joseph Disse (1852–1912).[tpl]cite journal |author=Haubrich WS |title=Disse of the space of Disse |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=127 |issue=6 |pages=1684 |year=2004 |pmid=15578505 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2004.10.021[/tpl]

[[Themes of C. J. Cherryh's works]]
CATEGORIES: C. J. Cherryh, Themes of writers' works

Several themes recur throughout the works of American science fiction and fantasy author C. J. Cherryh.
Cherryh's protagonists often attempt to uphold existing social institutions and norms in the service of the greater good while the antagonists often attempt to exploit, subvert or radically alter the predominant social order for selfish gain.  Even when they have conflicting loyalties, her characters do not behave randomly or inexplicably, but for reasons well-rooted in their personality, biology, and culture.  A number of Cherryh's novels focus on military and political themes, and on ways in which individuals interact with The Other.
Cherryh frequently incorporates the theme of the outsider finding his (or her) place, whether in society, in a family, or in a family-like group.  Examples of such outsiders include Tully, Nhi Vanye, Sten Duncan, Bren Cameron, Hallan Meras, Bet Yeager, Sandor Kreja, Fletcher Neihart and Tristen.  Characters who have lost their families or have become estranged, often find or create new families in which to belong.
An underlying theme of Cherryh's work is an exploration of gender roles. Her characters reveal both strengths and weaknesses regardless of their gender, although her female protagonists are portrayed as especially capable and determined.

[[Quo Primum]]

CATEGORIES: Apostolic constitutions, Tridentine Mass, 1570 works, Documents of Pope Pius V

Quo Primum (from the first) is the name of an Apostolic constitution in the form of a papal bull issued by Pope St. Pius V on 14 July 1570. It promulgated the 1570 edition of the Roman Missal, and made its use obligatory throughout the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, except where there existed a different Mass liturgy of at least two hundred years' standing.
The declared reason for this measure was this: "It is most becoming that there be in the Church... only one rite for the celebration of Mass." However, he made the exception mentioned, which permitted the survival, within limited areas or in celebrations by members of certain religious orders, of Latin liturgical rites other than the Roman Rite, rites such as the Ambrosian and Mozarabic Rites, that of the Diocese of Lyon and certain Catholic Order Rites. Some of these dioceses and religious orders have since decided to adopt the Roman Rite. Others preferred not to avail themselves of the exemption to which they were entitled and instead to adopt the Roman Missal immediately.
Thus, although the bull Quo primum contained expressions such as "Let all everywhere adopt and observe what has been handed down by the Holy Roman Church, the Mother and Teacher of the other Churches, and let Masses not be sung or read according to any other formula than that of this Missal published by Us. This ordinance applies henceforth, now, and forever, throughout all the provinces of the Christian world", exceptions were allowed from the start, and not all priests, even of the Latin Rite were obliged to adopt the Missal of Pius V.Patrick Madrid, Peter Vere, More Catholic than the Pope (Our Sunday Visitor 2004 ISBN 978-1-93170926-2), p. 125
In the bull Pope Pius V declared: "By this present Constitution, which will be valid henceforth, now, and forever, We order and enjoin that nothing must be added to Our recently published Missal, nothing omitted from it, nor anything whatsoever be changed within it." And he concluded: "No one whosoever is permitted to alter this notice of Our permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, indult, declaration, will, decree, and prohibition. Should anyone dare to contravene it, let him know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul."
By this, he forbade alterations by other authorities, ecclesiastical or civil, or by private individuals. He gives a list of ecclesiastical dignitaries who, he says, may not alter his Missal, even of the level of cardinal ("each and every patriarch, administrator, and all other persons or whatever ecclesiastical dignity they may be, be they even cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, or possessed of any other rank or pre-eminence"), but does not include those of a higher level, that is popes.Denis Crouan, The History and the Future of the Roman Liturgy (Ignatius Press 2005 ISBN 978-1-58617015-8), p. 76James Likoudis, Kenneth D. Whitehead, The Pope, the Council, and the Mass (Emmaus Road Publishing 2006 ISBN 978-1-93101834-0), p. 54 He himself altered his Missal when, after the victory of Lepanto in the following year, he added to it the feast of Our Lady of Victory. In 1585, Pope Sixtus V restored the feast of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary, which Pope Pius V had removed from the Missal. Only 34 years after the publication of Quo primum, Pope Clement VIII made a general revision of the Roman Missal, as did Pope Urban VIII 30 years later. The custom of placing tabernacles on altars, introduced later, made it necessary to introduce new rituals not in the missal of Pius V.

[[HSV SV88]]

The HSV SV88 was Holden Special Vehicles's (HSV) first attempt at a luxury performance car (in similar vein to the HDT Director). It was based on the 5.0-litre Holden VL Calais with upgraded power level (up [tpl]convert|10|kW|hp|0[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|136|kW|hp|0[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|355|Nm|lbft|0[/tpl] of torque). The SV88 also featured a minor bodykit and VL Group A 16×7 wheels painted in the bodycolour (which was "Dorward Blue"). On top of Holden's list of options, buyers could also have an in-car phone and a fax.
During 1986, Peter Brock's HDT Special Vehicles were instrumental in engineering the final fitment of the unleaded version of the carburetted V8 into the new updated Commodore, delivering [tpl]convert|126|kW|hp[/tpl]. This motor in standard Holden form was still down on power compared to the Japanese-sourced Nissan turbo six-cylinder.
Soon after the release of HSV's Walkinshaw, May 1988 saw the release of yet another pleasing SV derivative—the limited edition Calais based "SV88" which was a vehicle built for the luxury buyer. In a completely different arena to the "Walkinshaw" Group A homologation special, which was based on Holden's SL, The SV88 was based on the top of the line Calais and thus came equipped from the factory with better sound deadening and did not require SV's refitment of the Calais standard options. The SV88 also did not utilize the Group A motor and instead came equipped with the familiar Rochester quadrajet powered 4.9-litre, which was up-specced using left over HDT internals to produce [tpl]convert|136|kW|hp|0[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|355|Nm|lbft|0[/tpl].
Interior in the SV88 was HSV sports leather and velour in light blue, with optional car phone and or mobile fax available for order. The body kit on the SV88 consisted of slat type grille and a rear deck spoiler combination. Like the Holden Calais, the SV88 Calais was actually painted in two tone "Dorward Blue" over "Jewel Midnight" and separated with a unique red pin stripe.

[[FINA Swimming World Cup]]
CATEGORIES: FINA Swimming World Cup, Recurring sporting events established in 1988

The FINA Swimming World Cup is an international series of short course (25 m) swimming meets organized by FINA, the International Federation for swimming. The series was started in the 1988/1989, and is open to swimmers from FINA member countries.
The series has traditionally been held in the northern hemisphere's winter-time (October-February range), placing it within the normal short course competition times for many countries (with long course competition predominating in summer months). In some years, the World Cup has been held across a New Year's, leading to dual-year designations for a given series (e.g. "2004-2005 World Cup"), and in other years, the series has been held entirely on one side of a New Year's Day, leading to a single year description. This latter is the current format in place (e.g. the "2010 World Cup").
Currently, the overall 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishers are awarded prize money.FINA/ARENA Swimming World Cup 2008 - Scoring

[[Portal triad]]

CATEGORIES: Liver anatomy

A portal triad (also known as portal field, portal area, or portal tract) is a distinctive arrangement in the liver. It is a component of the hepatic lobule. It consists of the following five structures:
The misnomer "portal triad" traditionally has included only the first three structures, and was named before lymphatic vessels were discovered in the structure. It can refer both to the largest branch of each of these vessels running inside the hepatoduodenal ligament, and to the smaller branches of these vessels inside the liver.
In the smaller portal triads, the four vessels lie in a network of connective tissue and are surrounded on all sides by hepatocytes. The ring of hepatocytes abutting the connective tissue of the triad is called the periportal limiting plate.

[[Electronic Yellow Pages]]
CATEGORIES: Telephone numbers, Yellow pages

Electronic Yellow Pages are online versions of traditional printed business directories produced by telephone companies around the world. Typical functionalities of online yellow pages include the alphabetical listings of businesses and search functionality of the business database by name, business or location. Since Electronic Yellow Pages are not limited by space considerations, they often contain far more comprehensive business information such as vicinity maps, company profiles, product information, and more.
An advantage of Electronic Yellow Pages is that they can be updated in real time; therefore, listed businesses are not constrained by once-a-year publishing of the printed version which leads to greater accuracy of the listings since contact information may change at any time.
Before the popularity of the internet, business telephone numbers in the United Kingdom could be searched by accessing a remote computer terminal by modem. The initial prototype of this was superseded in 1990 with a commercial service. This service allowed searches via Name, Business classification and locality for business listings and a free text field was provided to allow "unstructured text" searching of Adverts. This dialup service was available via Prestel and "BT Gold" services. The service Electronic Yellow Pages was superseded in the mid-1990s by the internet service www.yell.com. A similar system called Phonebase for published residential phone numbers was discontinued in the 1990s, being superseded a web-based search interface.

[[Year of the Cat (song)]]
CATEGORIES: 1976 singles, Al Stewart songs, Debut singles, 1976 songs, RCA Records singles

"Year of the Cat" is a single by singer-songwriter Al Stewart, released in July 1976. The song is the title track of his 1976 album Year of the Cat, and was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, London in January 1976 by engineer Alan Parsons. The song reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1977. Although Stewart's 1978 single "Time Passages" is his career record with a #7 peak[tpl]Clarify|which chart?|date=February 2014[/tpl], "Year of the Cat" has remained Stewart's signature recording, receiving regular airplay on both classic rock and folk rock stations. The track is noted for its lengthy instrumental sections:; over four minutes of 6:40 album version of the song is instrumental, including a long, melodic series of solos that encompasses cello, violin, piano, acoustic guitar, distorted electric guitar, synthesizer and saxophone. The transition from acoustic guitar to electric to saxophone was initiated by Tim Renwick. The acoustic lead is played by Peter White with Tim Renwick then taking the electric lead. Parsons had Phil Kenzie add the saxophone part of the song — and by doing so transformed the original folk concept into the jazz-influenced ballad that put Al Stewart onto the charts. 
Shorter versions of the track can be found on some European 7" single formats. Though both of the discs carry the same label and catalogue number (RCA PB 5007), the French single features the A-side track clocking in at 4:30, while the Italian one features an even shorter mix of just 3:30 so that the lengthy instrumental intro is completely missing.
Co-written by Peter Wood, "Year of the Cat" is a narrative song written in the second person whose protagonist, a tourist, is visiting an exotic market when a mysterious silk-clad woman appears and takes him away for a gauzy romantic adventure. On wakening the next day beside her, the tourist realizes, with equanimity, that his tour bus has left without him and he has lost his ticket.
The Cat is one of the twelve signs of the Vietnamese zodiac. It corresponds to that of the Rabbit in the Chinese zodiac. At the time of the song's release, the most recent Year of the Rabbit had been February 11, 1975 to January 30, 1976. Thus, the song itself was recorded in the Year of the Cat.
The song "Year of the Cat" began as "Foot of the Stage", a song written by Stewart in 1966 after seeing a performance by comedian Tony Hancock whose patter about "being a complete loser" who might as well "end it all right here" drew laughs from the audience: Stewart's intuitive response that Hancock was in genuine despair led to the writing of "Foot of the Stage".(Hancock subsequently did commit suicide, in 1968). Dave Thompson, 1000 Songs that Rock Your World, p. 142, Krause Publications, Iola, WI (2011). ISBN 978-1-4402-1422-6. It was the melody for this never recorded song which Stewart set the lyrics of "Year of the Cat" to in 1975: pianist Peter Wood was given a co-writing credit on the song in recognition of his piano riff on the recorded track.
Subsequent to the entry of the single on the US charts, the track afforded Stewart a major hit in Australia (#13), Belgium/Flemish Region (#7), Canada (#3), Italy (#5), the Netherlands (#6) and New Zealand (#15). In the UK, where the single had been overlooked on its original July 1976 release, it gained renewed interest which was evident in a Top 40 chart entry although interest levelled off outside the Top 30 with a #31 peak in January 1977. "Year of the Cat" would remain Stewart's sole chart single in his native UK.

CATEGORIES: Histology

Hassall's corpuscles (or thymic corpuscles (bodies)) are structures found in the medulla of the human thymus, formed from eosinophilic type VI epithelial reticular cells arranged concentrically. Newer studies indicate that Hassall's corpuscles differentiate from medullary thymic epithelial cells after they lost Autoimmune regulator (Aire) expression.Xiaoping Wang et al., 2012: Post-Aire maturation of thymic medullary epithelial cells involves selective expression of keratinocyte-specific autoantigens, Front. Immunol., 05 March 2012 | doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2012.00019, PMID:     22448160 They are named for Arthur Hill Hassall, who discovered them in 1846.Louis Kater: A Note on Hassall’s Corpuscles. Contemporary Topics in Immunobiology Volume 2, 1973, pp. 101-109.Hassall, A. H., 1846. Microscopic Anatomy of the Human Body in Health and Disease, Highly, London.
The function of Hassall's corpuscles is currently unclear, and the absence of this structure in the murine thymus has restricted mechanistic dissection. It is known that Hassall's corpuscles are a potent source of the cytokine TSLP. In vitro, TSLP directs the maturation of dendritic cells, and increases the ability of dendritic cells to convert naive thymocytes to a Foxp3+ regulatory T cell lineage.* [tpl]cite journal | author = Watanabe N, Wang Y, Lee H, Ito T, Wang Y, Cao W, Liu Y | title = Hassall's corpuscles instruct dendritic cells to induce CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in human thymus. | journal = Nature | volume = 436 | issue = 7054 | pages = 1181–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16121185 | doi = 10.1038/nature03886[/tpl]"Old mystery solved, revealing origin of regulatory T cells that 'police' and protect the body" It is unknown if this is the physiological function of Hassall's corpuscles in vivo.
Beloveskin and others perform a complex research of systemic organization of Hassall’s corpuscles in the thymus of first year children. There has been determined  that main cells forming Hassall’s corpuscles are two types of cells that differ from each other by origin, texture, function, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features. We revealed that composition and amount of accessory cells in Hassall’s corpuscles depends on their stage of development. It has been established that the main systemic factor of Hassall’s corpuscles organization is the process of synthesis, mobilization and transduction of tissue-specific autoantigens for immune tolerance induction.
In the past decade, Hassall's corpuscles were again in the focus of pathologists and clinicians, as the researchers found tissue-specific self-antigens in corpuscles and revealed their role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Goodpasture's syndrome and others. They also discovered that Hassall's corpuscles synthesize chemokines affecting different cell populations in thymic medulla . Despite this, the information on the relationship between Hassall's corpuscles with other cell types of thymic medulla (dendritic, myoid, neuroendocrine cells, thymocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, etc.) remains insufficient and often contradictory . Mechanisms of these relationships and their functional significance are still unclear . The lack of such data does not allow forming a holistic, systemic view of the differentiation processes in the thymus.
Hassall's corpuscles vary in size with diameters from 20 to more than 100μm, and tend to grow larger with age.[ref]

CATEGORIES: Housing in the United Kingdom, Low-energy building in the United Kingdom, Energy conservation in the United Kingdom, Building energy rating

The National Home Energy Rating Scheme (NHER) is both a UK accreditation scheme for energy assessors and a rating scale for the energy efficiency of housing.
The NHER is owned and operated by National Energy Services (NES). Until 2011, NES was a trading subsidiary of the National Energy Foundation, an independent charity set up in 1988 to promote energy conservation and renewable energy, which launched the NHER scheme in 1991.
The NHER runs an accreditation scheme for energy assessors to produce the following:
The NHER scale for new build dwellings runs from 0 to 20, with 20 being best. It uses different criteria than the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) rating. The NHER rating takes into account the local environment and the effect it has on the building's energy rating. The NHER calculates the costs of space and water heating, but adds cooking, lights and appliances to give a comprehensive picture of energy usage in the home.
An average dwelling in England would currently score between 4.5 and 5.5 on the NHER scale. A gas-heated masonry semi meeting current United Kingdom Part L1 Building Regulations would score approximately NHER 10. A dwelling with NHER rating 20 achieves zero CO2 emissions along with zero net running costs.

Joseph Parkes (22 January 1796 – 11 August 1865) was an English political reformer.
Born into Unitarian Whig circles, Parkes developed an association with the Philosophical Radicals. In 1822 he established a Birmingham solicitor's practice specializing in election law. He was an advocate of legal reform, and active in the local efforts for parliamentary reform. Although he initially opposed the formation of the Birmingham Political Union, and remained less radical than Thomas Attwood, the BPU's founder, Parkes worked with it during the period of agitation for the Reform Act - acting in effect as an intermediary between radicals and whigs. 
In 1833 Henry Brougham appointed Parkes secretary of the commission on municipal corporations; he combined this work with a successful Westminster practice as a parliamentary solicitor. In 1847 ill-health prompted his retirement to work on literary projects.

Fabius was by adoption a member of the patrician gens Fabia, but by birth he was the eldest son of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus and Papiria Masonis and the elder brother of Scipio Aemilianus. He was the father of Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus.
Fabius served under his blood father in the Third Macedonian War and was sent by his father to Rome to announce the news of the Roman victory at Pydna. Fabius served as praetor in Sicily during 149 BC-148 BC and was elected consul for 145 BC. After his consulship he went as proconsul to Hispania where he fought and defeated Viriathus in an episode of the Lusitanian War but failed to capture him and the war went on until the fall of Numantia by his brother a decade later.
Fabius and his brother were the pupils and patrons of the historian Polybius, who recorded the strong fraternal bond between the brothers, even after their adoption into other houses.

Tŷ Siamas is the 'National Centre for Folk music' in Wales, and is situated in Dolgellau.
Tŷ Siamas opened its doors to the public in Easter 2007 following extensive renovation and development of the old Neuadd Idris, which was formerly the market hall for the town of Dolgellau.
The centre houses an interactive exhibition which will allow visitors to experience Welsh music.  
Tŷ Siamas is the brain child of Dyfrig Siencyn, Emyr Lloyd, Huw Dylan Owen, Dan Moris, and Ywain Myfyr (chairman and an establisher of Sesiwn Fawr Dolgellau), and managed by Mabon ap Gwynfor.
The dream of establishing a National Centre for Folk Music in Wales was realised after Siamas Cyf, the company created by local volunteers to oversee the project, managed to secure £1.2 of public funding from Gwynedd County Council via their Local Regeneration Fund, (a fund of money awarded to local authorities by the Welsh Assembly); European Objective 1 regional aid; the old Welsh Development Agency now part of the Welsh Assembly Government's Department of Enterprise, Innovation and Networks; Cronfa Arbrofol Eryri, provided by Snowdonia National Park; and Cist Gwynedd, provided by the Economy and Regeneration Service of Gwynedd County Council.
The vision was to create a national centre for the folk music of Wales which would contribute to the understanding of Welsh heritage and the revival of Welsh culture, traditions and customs.
Tŷ Siamas are currently conducting a pilot project in local schools (Brithdir, Rhydymain and Dinas Mawddwy) with the poet Twm Morys on three old Welsh musical customs associated with the winter - Mari Lwyd, Calennig, and the Plygain.

The Medicines Act 1968 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom.Medicines Act 1968, Legislation.gov.uk It governs the control of medicines for human use and for veterinary use, which includes the manufacture and supply of medicines.
The Act defines three categories of medicine: prescription only medicines (POM), which are available only from a pharmacist if prescribed by an appropriate practitioner; pharmacy medicines (P), available only from a pharmacist but without a prescription; and general sales list (GSL) medicines which may be bought from any shop without a prescription.
The Act controls supply of the drugs it covers, but does define any offence of simple possession. Possession of a prescription only drug without a prescription is only an offence if the drug is also controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and possession is thus specified as an offence. Therefore, for example, possession of a prescription only antibiotic without a prescription is not an offence.
For description of the legal classification of medicines in the UK see the Royal Pharmaceutical Society web site and the publication 'Medicines ethics and practice'. http://www.rpharms.com/mep/legal-classification-of-medicines.asp

[[Prost AP01]]
CATEGORIES: Prost Formula One cars, 1998 Formula One season cars

The Prost AP01 was the car with which the Prost Formula One team used to compete in the 1998 Formula One season.  It was driven by Olivier Panis, who was in his fifth season with the team (including Ligier), and Jarno Trulli, who was in his first full season with the team after deputising for the injured Panis in 1997.
After the good results of the previous season, 1998 was a disaster for Prost.  The car's main weakness was its gearbox: it was unreliable and heavy, which prevented the team from finishing races, upset the balance of the car and meant that the team could not optimise the position of its ballast, as many of its rivals could.  The team also scraped into the season by a narrow margin after the chassis failed the mandatory FIA crash test three times.
With these problems allied with the relocation of the team's factory nearer Paris, the year turned into an exercise in damage limitation.  Only one point was scored, at the chaotic 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, giving Prost 9th place in the Constructors' Championship. Only 8 cars finished the race with the two cars behind Trulli having spent so long in the pits being repaired their drivers were able to get out of the car for some time. In the final 6 laps Trulli lost an entire lap to the front runners with engine problems but still managed to finish.
For the first few races, X-wings were used, but they were banned after the San Marino Grand Prix.

[[Uposatha]]

CATEGORIES: Buddhist festivals, Festivals in India, Buddhist holidays

The Uposatha ([tpl]lang-sa|Upavasatha[/tpl]) is Buddhist day of observance, in existence from the Buddha's time (500 BCE), and still being kept today in Buddhist countries.[ref]For a description of the contemporary practice of the Uposatha in Thailand, see Khantipalo (1982a), which is also excerpted in this article below. 
Kariyawasam (1995), ch. 3, also underlines the continuity of the ancient uposatha practice in Sri Lanka: "The poya for uposatha observance, which is as old as Buddhism itself, has been followed by the Sinhala Buddhists up to the present day, even after the Christian calendar came to be used for secular matters. Owing to its significance in the religious life of the local Buddhists, all the full-moon days have been declared public holidays by the government."[/ref][ref]The uposatha day is sometimes likened to the Judeo-Christian notion of the Sabbath.  Pali English dictionaries that define "Uposatha" as "Sabbath," are Buddhadatta (2002), p. 63, and, and PED(Rhys-Davids & Stede,1921-25), p. 151. 
For an example of the Uposatha being equated with Sabbath by a modern Buddhist master, see Mahasi (undated), p. 2, where he writes: "For lay people, these rules discipline comprise the eight precepts which Buddhist devotees observe on the Sabbath days (uposatha) and during periods of meditation."  Harvey (1990), p. 192, also refers to the uposatha as "sabbath-like."[/ref] The Buddha taught that the Uposatha day is for "the cleansing of the defiled mind," resulting in inner calm and joy.Thanissaro (1997b); Anguttara Nikaya 3.70: Muluposatha Sutta. On this day, lay disciples and monks intensify their practice, deepen their knowledge and express communal commitment through millennia-old acts of lay-monastic reciprocity. On these days, the lay followers make a conscious effort to keep the Five Precepts or (as the tradition suggests) the Eight Precepts. It is a day for practicing the Buddha's teachings and meditation.

Bari is spoken by several distinct tribes: the Bari people themselves, the Pojulu, Kakwa, Nyangwara, Mundari, and Kuku. Each has their own dialect. The language is therefore sometimes called Karo or Kutuk ('mother tongue') rather than Bari. 
Dialects are:
Bari is a tone language. It has vowel harmony, subject–verb–object word order, and agglutinative verbal morphology with some suppletion.  A very competent dictionary and grammar were published in the 1930s, but are very difficult to find today.

Reducción de Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana (Reduction of Our Lady of Saint Ana) was one of the many missions or reductions founded in the 17th century by the Jesuits in the Americas during the Spanish colonial period. It was within what the Spanish then called the Province of Paraguay.
The Spanish relocated Guarani Native Americans from scattered villages to the reductions, where they established mission centers. These generally were modeled on Spanish rural villages, complete with a town square bounded by a church and administrative buildings. Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana was founded in 1633, and is located in the present-day Candelaria Department of the Misiones Province, Argentina.
It is 2 kilometers from Santa Ana, the chief city of the department. The ruins of Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana are not far from the reduccion site of San Ignacio Miní. Like most settlements of the era, the reducciones were located along waterways, which supplied drinking and washing water, and were used for transportation and trade.
In 1984 Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana was one of four sites of Jesuit reductions in Argentina and one in Brazil to be declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.List of World Heritage Sites, UNESCO

This condition is characterized as a synkinesis: when two or more muscles that are independently innervated have either simultaneous or coordinated movements. 
Common physiologic examples of synkineses occur during sucking, chewing, or conjugate eye movements. There are also several abnormal cranial nerve synkineses, both acquired and congenital. Marcus Gunn jaw-winking is an example of a pathologic congenital synkinesis. 
First described by the ophthalmologist Marcus Gunn in 1883,Gunn RM. Congenital ptosis with peculiar associated movements of the affected lid. Trans Ophthal Soc UK. 1883;3:283-7. this condition presents in approximately 5% of neonates with congenital ptosis. This condition has been associated with amblyopia (in 54% of cases), anisometropia (26%), and strabismus (56%).

Reducción de Nuestra Señora de Loreto (Reduction of Our Lady of Laurel), founded in 1610, was the first reductions established by the Jesuits in the Province of Paraguay in the Americas during the Spanish colonial period. The site is located in the Candelaria Department of Misiones Province, Argentina.
The Jesuits learned Indian languages and developed ways to write them using the Roman alphabet. They established a printing press at this mission, for which it became renowned. Not only did the Jesuits print works in Spanish and Latin (the language of the Catholic liturgy, Bible and prayer book), but they translated the Bible and other Christian works into Indian languages, as well as printing dictionaries.
Father Antonio Garriga was a Spanish Jesuit attached to Nuestra Señora de Loreto beginning in the last years of the 17th century and extending well into the early 18th century. He was particularly known as a linguist and missionary to the Moro people; he worked in the region from 1696 and served as Superior of the Mission several times. His book, Practical Instruction to Order One’s Life According to Saintly Precepts (c.1713) was the second oldest book printed at the mission.[tpl]cite wdl|2835[/tpl]
Today only the ruins of the Jesuit reduction are left at the site. In 1984 it was one of four reducciones in Argentina (others were San Ignacio Mini, Nuestra Señora de Santa Ana, and Santa María la Mayor) and São Miguel das Missões in Brazil designated as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. In 1993 UNESCO added two missions of the Province of Paraguay, located in present-day Paraguay, as World Heritage Sites.
Vegetation has grown over and contributed to deterioration of the ruins, which are not as well preserved as those of San Ignacio Miní, also in Misiones.

[[St John's in the Vale]]
CATEGORIES: Valleys of Cumbria

St John's in the Vale is a glacial valley in the Lake District National Park, Cumbria, England. Within the vale are a number of farms and small settlements, in addition to several disused quarry and mining works. St Johns Beck meanders northward along the floor of the vale, and is the primary route of outflow from Thirlmere reservoir to the south. Alongside the beck runs the B5322, St Johns in the Vale Road.
The vale is in the heart of the northern Lake District and is surrounded by many of the most striking of the Lakeland fells. It runs from south to north, set between the rocky flanks of Clough Head to the east and the neighbours High Rigg and Low Rigg to the west. The southern end of the vale is a narrow pass between High Rigg and Great Dodd, just to the north of the small settlement of Legburthwaite. At its northern end the vale widens to meet the broad east-to-west valley of the River Greta near Threlkeld. The view north from the vale is dominated by the mountains Blencathra and Skiddaw.
High on the western side of the vale lies St Johns in the Vale Church, located in a low pass between High Rigg on the southern side and Low Rigg to the north. This pass provides access for suitably capable vehicles between the vale and Dale Bottom in the Naddle Valley to the west of High Rigg. The present building dates from 1845, with the earliest reference to a church at the site being 1554.[tpl]cite web|title=VisitCumbria.com|url=http://www.visitcumbria.com/kes/chk8.htm|accessdate=27 October 2006[/tpl] On the opposite side of the vale, cut into the northern flank of Clough Head, lies the Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum.

Motormouth was a Saturday morning children's television series that was produced by Television South and aired across the ITV network for four series, running between 3 September 1988 and 4 April 1992.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.paulmorris.co.uk/satkids/index2.htm |title=Sat Kids |publisher=Paulmorris.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-04-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/446013/ |title=Saturday Morning TV |publisher=screenonline |date=1996-08-26 |accessdate=2009-04-21[/tpl] Each series generally ran from the autumn of one year to the spring of the next, as was common among many 'main' Saturday morning series.
The programme was launched following the decision to axe No. 73, which had run in the same slot until early 1988. No. 73 had been revamped during its final series as 7T3, with a partially exterior set. However, the new 7T3 set-up was expensive and difficult to produce, and so it was decided to switch to a fully studio-based set-up. The new show was produced as the same studio complex (The Maidstone Studios) as its predecessor, and many of the production team (and several presenters) transferred to the new show. Whereas No. 73 had included an inherent narrative storyline, the decision was taken that Motormouth would have a straightforward magazine presentation format.
The studio set for the first series was dominated by several giant inflatable elements, including a giant motorised mouth, from which the show took its name. In the second series, billed in some cases as Motormouth II or Motormouth 2, there were changes, including the introduction of new graphics and set elements based on cogs and sprockets. The use of the giant mouth declined following this alteration.
The show's third series - which boasted new graphics and remixed theme music, and was for a brief time billed as All New Motormouth - also had a new, predominantly white set; the giant mouth was removed altogether at this point, along with all other remaining inflatables. This series saw the introduction of a diner-style set (sometimes referred to as 'The Motormouth Cafe') which saw guests and audience members sitting at tables.  This format and styling was left largely intact for the fourth series.

Lunsford Richardson Preyer (January 11, 1919 – April 3, 2001), who typically went by 'Richardson' or 'Rich,' was a jurist and a U.S. representative in Congress from North Carolina. He was the grandson of inventor Lunsford Richardson. His parents were William Yost Preyer (June 4, 1888 Ohio – 1970) and Mary Norris Richardson (1889–1969) daughter of Lunsford Richardson (1854–1919) and Mary Lynn Smith (1858–1940). He was married to Emily Irving Harris (1919–1999).
Preyer, a native of Greensboro, North Carolina, graduated from Woodberry Forest School and from Princeton University in 1941, with a B.A. majoring in English. At Princeton he was on the 150 lb. football team and the golf team and was vice-president of Tower Club. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1941 through 1946 serving as gunnery officer and executive officer on destroyers in both the Atlantic and Pacific. He received a Bronze Star for action at Okinawa. In 1949, he earned a law degree from Harvard Law School.  
He worked for Vick Chemical Company in 1950 (founded by his grandfather) before serving as a North Carolina superior court judge from 1956 to 1961, when President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. He resigned as a judge in 1963 and became a candidate for Governor of North Carolina. Preyer eventually lost in the 1964 Democratic Party primary runoff to another former judge, Dan K. Moore. I. Beverly Lake, Sr. was also a

[[Bessel process]]

CATEGORIES: Stochastic processes

In mathematics, a Bessel process, named after Friedrich Bessel, is a type of stochastic process.  The Bessel process of order n is the real-valued process X given by
where ||·|| denotes the Euclidean norm in Rn and W is an n-dimensional Wiener process (Brownian motion) started from the origin.
The n-dimensional Bessel process is the solution to the  stochastic differential equation
For n ≥ 2, the n-dimensional Wiener process is transient from its starting point: with probability one, Xt > 0 for all t > 0.  It is, however, neighbourhood-recurrent for n = 2, meaning that with probability 1, for any r > 0, there are arbitrarily large t with Xt  2, meaning that Xt ≥ r for all t sufficiently large.
A notation for the Bessel process of dimension ''n' started at zero is BES0(n).

McCashin's Brewery is a microbrewery based in Nelson, New Zealand. It was founded in 1981 by former All Black and farmer Terry McCashin.  Terry has been credited with starting the micro-brewery renaissance in New Zealand.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]   Prior to opening McCashin's Brewery in 1981 there were only two breweries in New Zealand: New Zealand Breweries and Dominion Breweries.  Today, Nelson alone has 11 breweries.
McCashin's Brewery is housed in the Rochdale Cider factory.  Rochdale Cider was started in the late 1930s, but the current building was built in the 1950s.  Rochdale Cider is still being made there today.
In 1999 Lion Breweries, part of the Lion Nathan group, bought the Mac's brand. The brewery itself is still owned by Terry McCashin but in August 2000 Lion leased it. In 2005 Lion Nathan moved half of the production of Mac's best-selling beer, Mac's Gold, from Nelson to Auckland.
In March, 2005, Wellington's Shed 22 Brewing Company came under the Mac's brand. Shed 22's brewpub, The Brewery Bar and Restaurant, was refurbished and became the first Mac's Brewbar, on October 3, 2006
In November 2006 Mac's underwent a re-branding exercise and released a new line of six core  beers, which are all lagers of different colours, from Great White wheat beer through to Black Mac.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref]  At the same time, production of some of the Macs beers also shifted to Shed 22 in Wellington, and by 2008 Macs was no longer being brewed at McCashin's Brewery.
In April 2009, the family who set up Mac's Brewery moved back in. Dean McCashin, the son of Mac's founders Terry and Bev McCashin, said the family hoped to restore the neglected building and plant.  "We want to take it back to its former glory and employ as many people as we did once. We don't want to repeat the cycle of a corporation coming in and thinning it out."
McCashin's Brewery currently produces Rochdale Cider, Frute, 26000 Vodka and Stoke beer.

[[Orchestral enhancement]]

CATEGORIES: Sound production technology, Orchestral music

Orchestral enhancement is the technique of using orchestration techniques, architectural modifications, or electronic technologies to modify the sound, complexity, or color of a musical theatre, ballet or opera pit orchestra. Orchestral enhancements are used both to create new sounds and to add capabilities to existing orchestral ensembles.
Adding additional instruments to a pit orchestra is a long-practiced  technique used to obtain a fuller, richer sound. Starting in the 1970s, instruments in musical theatre were amplified with sound reinforcement systems. In the 1980s, the introduction of electronic synthesizers, sequencers and prerecorded music tracks was initially greeted with fear by musicians' unions and performers. However, rather than entirely replacing traditional orchestra pit instruments, these technologies are often used alongside the "live" violin players, wind instrumentalists, and rhythm section members.

The Chilean Coastal Range ([tpl]lang-es|Cordillera de la Costa[/tpl]) is a mountain range that runs from north to south along the Pacific coast of South America parallel to the Andean Mountains, extending from Morro de Arica in the north to Taitao Peninsula, where it ends at the Chile Triple Junction, in the south. The range has a strong influence on the climate of Chile since it produces a rain shadow to the east. Because of this the vegetation growing on the seaward slopes is much more exuberant than in the interior. Compared to the coastal lowlands and the Intermediate Depression it is sparsely populated with land use varying from protected areas to grazing and silviculture. The range is present in all Chilean regions except for Coquimbo Region and Magallanes Region.

[[John Thibaut]]

CATEGORIES: Social psychologists, Year of death missing, Year of birth missing

John Thibaut was a social psychologist, one of the last graduate students of Kurt Lewin. He spent a number of years as a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and was the first editor of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. 
The research group which he headed at UNC was regularly attended by Harry Upshaw, Jack Brehm, Kurt Back, and Edward E. Jones. He is best known for "A Social Psychology of Groups", co-authored by his long-time collaborator Harold Kelley. 
The examination of social exchange led John Thibaut and Harold Kelley to develop social exchange theory, a process which was facilitated by Thibaut spending a year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences where he had significant interaction with Kenneth Arrow. 
The early variations of Social Exchange Theory stem from Alvin Ward Gouldner's (1960) norm of reciprocity, which simply argues that people ought to return benefits given to them in a relationship. Peter M. Blau built on the work done by George C. Homans in Exchange and Power in Social Life (1964). Later modifications to this theory focus attention on relational development and maintenance rules (see Murstein et al.).
Thibaut's later research was in the area of procedural justice, where he co-authored a book with legal expert Laurens Walker.

[[Guide, Lancashire]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Lancashire, Geography of Blackburn

Guide is a village on the edge of Blackburn, in Lancashire.  It is located south of the town centre, and the M65 motorway passes around the south and east of the village with junction five situated immediately to the southwest of the village.
People who were born and lived in Guide all of their lives are known as 'Guiders'.  The traditional village pub, The King Edward, remains there.  It is sited on a corner of the original crossroads.  Also in the village is a Post Office, Cantonese restaurant and a Working Man's Club which features artists and is available for private hire.
There are a number of industrial and office buildings in the area, many of which have been built since the motorway was extended.  Residents of the village have protested against the increasing industrial development of the area.
The Guide reservoir was surrounded with countryside and now features a new pub called the Willows, JJB Sports shop, football dome and gym.
The main roads in the village were originally Haslingden Road (the former B6232), Blackamoor Road, and School Lane (both B6231). As part of the M65 extension work which was completed in 1997, a section of Haslingden Road, including the crossroads, was bypassed and the road became part of the A6077, which connects Blackburn town centre to the motorway.

It was released in August 2004, and was also the first single that Reuben had ever released in the wake of an album. Opinion was divided as to whether or not it was the right choice to follow "Freddy Kreuger", some[tpl]Who|date=March 2009[/tpl] saying that the band should have released a more immediate single, and some arguing that it was a strong song that ably demonstrated another side of the band's diversity. It received only a small number of plays on radio, and even fewer showings on TV. In spite of this, the single still managed to reach #59 in the UK singles chart, only six places down from its predecessor. It was released on CD and 7" vinyl format, with a special alternative B-side on the vinyl copies.

Dokorder was a brand of tape recorder from Japanese electronics company Denki Onkyo, located in Ōta, Tokyo (not related to the Onkyo audio company of Osaka, neither to Denon) that included a four-reel transport system called "Dub-A-Tape" capable of feeding two different tapes through the same tape head assembly and, in the process, recording a duplicate of a tape.  (The master and blank tapes passed through the same capstan, but through different tape head areas, yielding a Y-shaped tape path reflected in the slots built into the head assembly. Denki Onkyo also supplied a consumer and semi-pro line of reel to reel recorders (including 4 track multitracks) that competed with Tascam/Teac and Sony but ultimately its products were found to be less durable than the competition.
In 1982, Murata Manufacturing acquired 55% shares of Denki Onkyo, and in 1999, the company has been fully merged into Murata.

It was collected in Småland or Blekinge by Gunnar Olof Hyltén-Cavallius and George Stephens and published in Svenska folksagor och äfventyr (1:1-2, 1844-49). It has been filmed on several occasions.
It is of the Aarne-Thompson type 425A, the search for the lost husband. The themes of marriage to the monstrous or mysterious husband, of curiosity inspired by the mother, and even the drops of spilled tallow are very similar to the Hellenistic romance of Cupid and Psyche.

Arthur Maitland was born on 7 December 1928 in Blackburn, England. He gained his BSc Physics degree in 1956 as a part time student studying for a London University External Degree. In 1972 St Andrews University, whom he was employed as a researcher and lecturer in 1963, awarded him a DSc degree on the basis of his published papers on ionised gases. At the time he was also working for several electrical engineering companies. He was an influential figure, founding the laser research department at St Andrews University in 1964. He led a group of 14 physicists there working in the areas of lasers and their applications, gas discharge tubes, ionised gases, optical methods of signal processing, and applications of ionised gases to fast switching (see Thyratrons). He became Professor of Physics at St Andrews in 1993.
Professor Maitland was a fellow of the Institute of Physics, and published over 40 research papers on lasers, ionised gases and fast switching, and was co-author of Laser Physics (North Holland), Vacuum as an Insulator (Chapman and Hall) and posthumously contributing a chapter to High Voltage Vacuum Insulation (Academic Press). He also held 40 patents and was a consultant for the gas tubes division of EEV Co., Chelmsford, England and Nobel's Explosives Company Ltd. He died of cancer on 30 June 1994, aged 65.
At St Andrews University he very quickly established a group working on gas lasers. Professor Maitland recognised that the gas-discharge laser had enormous potential for practical use. Through his ground breaking research into the physics of gas-discharge lasers, Professor Maitland invented several methods for generating gas-discharge based lasers.
Professor Arthur Maitland is credited with the invention of apparatus capable of forming a beam of electrons.The link for this patent is attached to this article.

The 1947 English cricket season was the first to be reviewed by Playfair Cricket Annual which began publication in April 1948. The season is chiefly remembered for the batting performances of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich who established seasonal records that, with the subsequent reduction in the number of first-class matches, will probably never be broken. Their form was key to their team Middlesex winning the County Championship for the first time since 1921, although they were involved in a tight contest for the title with the eventual runners-up Gloucestershire, for whom Tom Goddard was the most outstanding bowler of the season. Compton and Edrich were assisted by the fact that it was the driest and sunniest English summer for a generation, ensuring plenty of good batting wickets. The South Africans toured the British Isles and played a Test series of five matches against England, who won the series 3–0 with two matches drawn, again largely thanks to the batting of Compton and Edrich.

The Scottish Gaelic word clann means children.Mark (2003), p. 458. In early times, and possibly even today, clan members believed themselves to descend from a common ancestor, the founder of the Scottish clan. From its perceived founder a clan takes its name. The clan chief is the representative of this founder, and represents the clan as well. In the Scottish clan system, the term chief denotes a greater chief than that of a chieftain. In consequence, branch chiefs (heads of branches of a clan) are designated chieftains.Adam; Innes of Learney (1970), p. 154–155. Scottish clans who no longer have a clan chief are referred to as armigerous clans.

The radiant of the meteor shower is located in the constellation Lyra, near this constellation's brightest star, Alpha Lyrae (proper name Vega).  Their peak is typically around April 22 each year.
The source of the meteor shower is particles of dust shed by the long-period Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher.[tpl]cite journal | last=Jenniskens | first = P. | title=Meteor Showers and their Parent Comets | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2006 | pages=790[/tpl] The April Lyrids are the strongest annual shower of meteors from debris of a long-period comet, mainly because as far as other intermediate long-period comets go (200 - 10,000 years), this one has a relatively short orbital period of about 415 years. The Lyrids have been observed for the past 2600 years.
The shower usually peaks on around April 22 and the morning of April 23. Counts typically range from 5 to 20 meteors per hour, averaging around ten. As a result of light pollution, observers in rural areas will see more than observers in a city. Nights without a moon in the sky will reveal the most meteors. April Lyrid meteors are usually around magnitude +2. However, some meteors can be brighter, known as "Lyrid fireballs", cast shadows for a split second and leave behind smokey debris trails that last minutes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/meteors/lyrids/lyrids.html|title=the Lyrid meteor shower|year=2008|publisher=spaceweather.com|page=1|accessdate=2008-08-05[/tpl]
Occasionally, the shower intensifies when the planets steer the one-revolution dust trail of the comet into Earth's path, an event that happens about once every 60 years.  This results in an April Lyrid meteor outburst. The one-revolution dust trail is dust that has completed one orbit: the stream of dust released in the return of the comet prior to the current 1862 return.This mechanism replaces earlier ideas that the outbursts were due to a cloud of dust moving in a 60-year orbit.[ref]

[[Uptown Avondale]]

CATEGORIES: 1992 EPs, The Afghan Whigs albums, Sub Pop EPs

Uptown Avondale is an EP by the band The Afghan Whigs. It bears the Sub Pop catalog number SPCD 53/215 and is representative of the Cincinnati band's soul influences. The EP contains covers of 4 classic Stax/Motown-era tracks:
It also contains a stark, robotic remix of the Whigs song "Milez Is Ded" as a hidden track — the original was itself a sinister, funk-tinged hidden track on the 1992 album Congregation. This version takes the song and gives it a bit of a menacing dancefloor tweak, complete with a looped drum track (same bed as The Stone Roses' "Fools Gold", and dozens of other tracks from the same timeframe) and some heavy effects on the vocals and guitars. Cue track #4 to 4:28 for the beginning of "Milez Is Ded"'s remix, which the band playfully referred to as "Rebirth Of The Cool".

Agave angustifolia (Caribbean Agave) is a plant which is native to Mexico and Central America. It is used to make mezcal and also as an ornamental plant, particularly the cultivar 'Marginata'.
The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families regards Agave angustifolia as an illegitimate synonym for Agave vivipara L.[tpl]Citation |author=WCSP |year=2011 |title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |publisher=The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/home.do |accessdate=2011-09-26 [/tpl], search for "Agave vivipara"
Other sources maintain them as distinct species with non-overlapping native distributions (García-Mendoza and Fernando Chiang 2003). A. angustifolia has narrow, stiffly erect leaves with moderately-spaced spines, producing capsules, not bulibiferous; whereas A. vivipara is described as having shorter, recurved leaves with short-spaced spines and bulbiferous. A. vivipara is likely similar to A. karatto. The A. vivipara of Miller (1768) and Smith et al. (2008) seem different, of a much smaller habit and narrower leaves, from the A. vivipara of Trelease (1913) and García-Mendoza and Fernando Chiang (2003), of a much larger habit.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

[[Tomy Lee]]
CATEGORIES: 1956 racehorse births, 1971 racehorse deaths, Thoroughbred racehorses, Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom, Racehorses trained in the United States, American racehorses, Kentucky Derby winners, Thoroughbred family 1

Tomy Lee (1956–1971) was a Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 1959 Kentucky Derby defeating Sword Dancer, First Landing, Royal Orbit and the filly Silver Spoon. Tomy Lee became only the second non-American bred horse to ever win the Kentucky Derby and Bertie Kerr became the first non-American agent to buy a winner.
Foaled in England, Tomy Lee was purchased as a weanling by Fred Turner, Jr., a millionaire oilman and rancher from Texas. Los Angeles Times, June 25, 1958  In 1956 the bloodstock agent Bertie Kerr  attended the Newmarket sales, acting on behalf of Turner. Kerr was instructed to buy two horses that Turner had picked straight out of the catalogue. The Texan was chiefly interested in a colt and son of Tulyar. That horse later came to be named Tuleg. However Turner believed horses needed company and he also wanted to buy a second horse in order to provide Tuleg with a travelling companion. That second horse would eventually turn out to be Tomy Lee. Shortly after Tomy Lee won the 1959 Kentucky Derby, Kerr relayed to Michael O'Hehir the story behind the purchase. O’Hehir then retold the story in the Daily Racing Form.  After viewing Turner’s first choice for Tuleg’s travelling companion, Kerr was less than impressed and he subsequently cabled him, advising him not to buy this particular foal. Instead Kerr recommended another colt he had seen at the sale. Turner gave Kerr the go ahead “to bid up to $15,000”  but Kerr managed to buy Tomy Lee for just $6,762. Tuleg was purchased for $25,000 but proved to be a dud. Tuleg could not race at two because of an injury, and at three bowed a tendon.   www.directoryoftheturf.com    David Needham: Ireland’s First Real World Cup -The Story of the 1924 Ireland Olympic Football Team (2012, The Manuscript Publisher) ISBN 978-0-9571157-2-9  However Kerr’s recommendation turned out to be a bargain. At two, Tomy Lee stood 16 hands and weighed a bit over a thousand pounds and was sound.  The press called the bay with four white stockings a greyhound, slim and perfectly proportioned.  Sent to California for his first year on the track, he won his first six races.  Then he was sent East to run in two more, both jousts with First Landing, his only losses that year, and in each case he was closing fast.  At age three, he won four of seven races, one the Blue Grass Stakes, with two 2nd place finishes.  At ages two and three, he was runner-up in the voting for Champion male.
Bill Shoemaker, who had ridden Sword Dancer to a win in the Stepping Stone Purse a week before the Kentucky Derby, had already agreed to ride Tomy Lee in the Derby itself.  Early on, Tomy Lee was involved in a speed duel with a horse called Troilus, and won it, so when Sword Dancer made his move under Bill Boland, Shoemaker thought Tomy Lee was spent and Sword Dancer might take the Derby.  Seeing Boland come up, he called out, "Good luck, I hope you win it."  Sword Dancer took over the lead by half a length, but Tomy Lee came on again in mid stretch, behind by only a head.  Both horses bumped several times.  At the wire, Tomy Lee won by a nose.  Boland claimed a foul, but the judges disallowed it after deliberating for 17 minutes.  First Landing came in third, three and a half lengths behind these two, and Royal Orbit, who went on to win the Preakness Stakes that year, came from last to fourth.  A creditable fifth was Silver Spoon, the first filly to enter the Derby since 1945, and the last until 1980. 
After his win in the Kentucky Derby, Tomy Lee did not run in the remaining two U.S. Triple Crown races.  His trainer, Frank Childs, said he didn't like races too close together, so Tomy Lee returned to California to rest.  Later that year, he finished sixth in the Cinema Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack, a race won by Silver Spoon.  Shoemaker could not ride Tomy Lee in this race since he was committed to Sword Dancer in the Belmont Stakes (which they won), so Tomy Lee was guided by Don Pierce.  Turner felt that Pierce mishandled his colt, who needed "special care" and understanding, something only Shoemaker could give him.  In anger, he took his horse out of training for six months.  At the end of the year, Johnny Longden rode him to a win in a 6 furlong race. 
Tomy Lee ran twice at four and was unplaced both times.  Between 1960 and 1963, he earned just $27,697.  Tomy Lee was retired to stud at L.P. Doherty's Stallion Station in Kentucky.  But Tomy Lee proved to have an odd condition as a stallion.  His sperm did not live long enough to impregnate a mare.  He was put back into training and won four more races before being returned to stud.
Tomy Lee died in 1971.  He is buried at Pillar Stud in Lexington, Kentucky.

[[Diversification (marketing strategy)]]

CATEGORIES: Types of marketing

Diversification is a corporate strategy to increase sales volume from new products and new markets. Diversification can be expanding into a new segment of an industry that the business is already in, or investing in a promising business outside of the scope of the existing business.
Diversification is part of the four main growth strategies defined by Igor Ansoff's Product/Market matrix:Ansoff, I.: Strategies for Diversification, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 35 Issue 5,Sep-Oct 1957, pp. 113-124
Ansoff pointed out that a diversification strategy stands apart from the other three strategies. The first three strategies are usually pursued with the same technical, financial, and merchandising resources used for the original product line, whereas diversification usually requires a company to acquire new skills, new techniques and new facilities.
Note: The notion of diversification depends on the subjective interpretation of “new” market and “new” product, which should reflect the perceptions of customers rather than managers. Indeed, products tend to create or stimulate new markets; new markets promote product innovation.
Product diversification involves addition of new products to existing products either being manufactured or being marketed. Expansion of the existing product line with related products is one such method adopted by many businesses. Adding tooth brushes to tooth paste or tooth powders or mouthwash under the same brand or under different brands aimed at different segments is one way of diversification. These are either brand extensions or product extensions to increase the volume of sales and the number of customers.

First discovered at Jodrell Bank Observatory in England during the summer of 1947, the showers are caused when the Earth passes through a dense portion of two interplanetary meteoroid streams, producing an average of 60 shooting stars each hour, that originate in the sky from the constellation Aries and the constellation Perseus.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/daytime_arietids.html|title=Arietids|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Meteor Showers Online|author=Meteor Showers Online| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927220347/http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/daytime_arietids.html| archivedate= 27 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] However, because both constellations are so close to the Sun when these showers reach their peak, the showers are difficult to view with the naked eye.

"Gym and Tonic" is a single released by British production duo Spacedust. Released on 12 October 1998, it peaked at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart; however, it was the lowest-selling UK number-one song of 1998, reaching No. 109 on the year-end chart.
The song was originally recorded by French record producer Bob Sinclar as "Gym Tonic", with co-production by Thomas Bangalter and a 12 minute section of improvised funk by James Andrew (Gym) Dakin. The Track was included on the Sinclar's album Paradise. Their version sampled "Arms", a workout recording by American actress Jane Fonda. However, Fonda refused clearance of her vocals being used as a sample, which eventually led to a single never being released. When Spacedust recorded their version of the track, the Fonda vocal samples were re-recorded with a session vocalist. In addition to this, the song was a recreated mash-up of Stardust's "Music Sounds Better with You" and Thomas Bangalter and Bob Sinclar's original version "Gym Tonic".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Spacedust |title=Spacedust Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01[/tpl]

thumb|N.V. KrishnaiahN. V. Krishnaiah (also known as NVK) was a communist politician from Andhra Pradesh, India. He was a municipal councillor in Nellore, member of the Andhra Pradesh legislature, president of the Indian Federation of Trade Unions and a central leader in the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist).
NVK was born in 1930 in Yataluru village, Venkatagiri mandal, Nellore district. He completed high school in Venkatagiri and then moved to Nellore to join V.R. College. At V.R. College he joined the students movement and later became a member of the Communist Party in 1952.
He then returned to Venkatagiri and began to work in the peasant front of the party. In 1957 he shifted his activities to Nellore and became a trade union organizer amongst motor workers. In both cases he led militant campaigns and came into conflicts with landlords and private bus company owners.
When the Communist Party of India was divided, NVK sided with the leftist tendency. He became the secretary of the Nellore town committee and a member of the Nellore district committee of the new party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). In 1964 he was elected to the Municipal Corporation of Nellore.
NVK contested the 1967 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election as a CPI(M) candidate in the Nellore constituency. He came second with 11951 votes (25.89%). He was defeated by the Jan Sangh candidate M. R. Annadata.List Of Political Parties
At the same time, the CPI(M) in Andhra Pradesh faced another split. Large sections of the regional party cadres began to condemn the CPI(M) leadership as 'neo-revisionist'. Led by T.N. Reddy, the radical elements rallied around the Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries. NVK joined the APCCCR, and as a consequence he later resigned from his position as a municipal councillor.
NVK was one of the accused in the Hyderabad Conspiracy Case. During the period of 1968-1978, he was frequently jailed, and spent over five years in imprisonment. When the APCCCR was divided in 1971, NVK sided with the Chandra Pulla Reddy-led faction. This grouping merged into the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)
After being released from jail in 1978, he became involved in trade union activities. He became the president of the Indian Federation of Trade Unions. In 1980 he sided with C.P. Reddy, who broke away and formed his own CPI(ML).
In the 1989 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, NVK contested the Sircilla seat as an independent. He won with 26430 votes (29.84%).List Of Political Parties During his legislative tenure, he raised over 2500 questions in the assembly.Visit our Guest Book One of the issues he highlighted was the need for irrigation in the Karimnagar area.
Following the 1994 Legislative Assembly election, CPI(ML) Janashakti was divided. NVK became the leader of a break-away group, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti COC. Later, CPI(ML) Janashakti COC would merge with the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) New Initiative of Arvind Sinha and form the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Unity Initiative. CPI(ML) Unity Initiative then merged with the Communist Organisation of India (Marxist-Leninist) of Kanu Sanyal to form the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). In January 2005, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red Flag merged into the CPI(ML) led by Sanyal, at a conference in Vijayawada. NVK became a Central Committee member of the unified CPI(ML).
NVK died on September 13, 2006.http://www.cpiml.in/061001.htm

[tpl]nihongo|Takenaka Shigekata|竹中 重固||1828–1891[/tpl] was a Japanese samurai of the late Edo period, later a figure in efforts to colonize Hokkaido. He is also known by his court title, Tango no kami (丹後守).
Takenaka Shigekata was born in 1828 in the town of Iwate, in Mino Province, the son of Tokugawa retainer Takenaka Motoyuki. Motoyuki, though the head of a branch house, was a descendant of the great Sengoku-era strategist Takenaka Hanbei Shigeharu. Following his father's death, Shigekata was adopted by Takenaka Shigeakira, the 5000 koku hatamoto who was head of the main Takenaka house. Though a senior hatamoto due to his rank, he entered the ranks of the Greater Guardsmen (Ōbangumi; 大御番組) in 1864. He later became an Army Magistrate, and took part in the campaign that put down the Tengu Party. He also concurrently held the rank of wakadoshiyori.
In 1868, Takenaka was part of the force headed for the Fushimi bugyōsho, but was beaten back by the new Imperial Army. Returning to Edo as part of the Tokugawa withdrawal, he was singled out as a scapegoat for the defeat, and was stripped of his court rank and title, and prohibited from entering Edo Castle. Though he briefly entered the priesthood, he still wanted to fight the Imperial army, and so he formed the Junchūtai (純忠隊). He initially had tactical coordination with the Shogitai, but following the defeat at the Battle of Ueno, he led the unit northward (together with former roju Ogasawara Nagamichi and his men), engaging in guerilla warfare as he moved farther into Mutsu Province. Joining Enomoto Takeaki's fleet in Sendai, he traveled to Hokkaido, where he became a Judge Advocate General officer in the new Ezo Republic.
Just before the end of the Battle of Hakodate, he headed to Tokyo on a foreign steamship, ostensibly to find some unexplored option for fighting the Imperial Army; however, as he no longer had any solutions, he heeded his father Shigeakira's advice and surrendered. As punishment he forfeited his holdings, and was placed under the supervision of the Fukuoka domain. Later transferred to the guardianship of his father, he followed the latter to Hokkaido, where they settled. Moved by the plight of the impoverished former samurai there, Takenaka submitted a memorandum to the new government on the increase of agricultural productivity in Hokkaido. This reached the right ears, and he was pardoned in 1873, being allowed to return to Tokyo and work in the new government. However, in 1875, he left that post, and worked in the Hoeisha Company that his younger brother Motoyori had started, furthering the cause of increased productivity in Hokkaido.
Takenaka died in 1891 at the age of 63, and is buried Takanawa-Sengakuji Temple.

[[When the Sky Comes Down It Comes Down on Your Head]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 albums

When The Sky Comes Down It Comes Down On Your Head is the second full length album released by Edinburgh based shoegaze band The Zephyrs. It was recorded at The Substation in Cowdenbeath, Scotland. Additional recording took place at Blackwing Studios in London, and at the home of Rachel Goswell (of Mojave 3).
It includes several noteworthy guest musicians. Adele Bethel of Arab Strap performs vocals on "Modern Beats", Rachel Goswell sings on "Setting Sun" and Sean O'Hagan (The High Llamas and Stereolab) contributes string arrangements.
Allmusic called it "...a rare perfect record."
Southpaw Records folded on the very same week that they released this album. Unfortunately for the band, this meant that their publishing deal evaporated, as did their promotional and touring budget. And so, despite the critical acclaim this record received, the band did not have the finances to capitalise on it and each went back to their day jobs.

In some universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland — particularly collegiate universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, Durham and York — students and the academic body are  organised into common rooms. These groups exist to provide representation in the organisation of college or residential hall life, to operate certain services within these institutions such as laundry or recreation, and to provide opportunities for socialising. Typically, though there are variations based on institutional tradition and needs, the following common rooms will exist in the a college or hall:
In addition to this, each of the above phrases may also refer to an actual room designated for the use of these groups. At the University of Cambridge, the term combination room (e.g., "Junior Combination Room") is also used, with the same abbreviations. As a generalisation, JCRs are associations of undergraduates and SCRs an association of tutors and academics associated with a college. Postgraduates are sometimes given their own MCR, or placed in with either of the other groups. This terminology has, in addition, been taken up in some universities in other English speaking nations.

The BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms (formerly the BBC Electric Proms) was an October music festival in London run by the BBC for five years, 2006–2010. On 31 January 2011, the BBC announced that the event would be discontinued with immediate effect due to financial cutbacks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/01_january/31/electric_proms.shtml |title= Statement on the BBC Electric Proms |publisher=BBC Press release |accessdate=31 January 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110202044647/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/01_january/31/electric_proms.shtml| archivedate= 2 February 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The name was taken from The Proms, a classical music festival running since 1895, and borrowed a few traditions from its counterpart such as the final night culminating in an interpretation of "Land of Hope and Glory". The musical performances at the festival typically involved Indie rock bands incorporating instruments outside of their usual arrangement, most commonly in the form of collaborations with the BBC Concert Orchestra.
Primarily the festival's headline acts played at The Roundhouse in Camden but events, which included a programme of film, were not limited to this venue. For example, acoustic events took place at Cecil Sharp House. In 2008 in acknowledgement of its status as European Capital of Culture, events were staged in both Liverpool and London.
In Australia, this program started airing on ABC2 from 1 May 2009 with episodes in a scattered order.[tpl]cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Airdate: BBC Electric Proms|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/04/airdate-bbc-electric-proms.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=16 April 2009|accessdate=4 October 2010[/tpl]

[[Sauber C17]]

CATEGORIES: Sauber Formula One cars, 1998 Formula One season cars

The Sauber C17 was the car with which the Sauber Formula One team competed in the 1998 Formula One season.  It was driven by Jean Alesi, who joined from Benetton, and Johnny Herbert, who was in his third season with the team after an impressive 1997 season.
1998 confirmed Sauber's position as a respectable midfield runner unable to make the final breakthrough needed to become a top team.  The team's package was quick and reliable, but not quite enough to regularly score points.  Indeed, Alesi and Herbert finished just outside the points, in seventh, no less than five times.  The highlight of the year was Alesi's run to third at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix to score the team's third podium since their F1 début in 1993.  This capped an encouraging season for the Frenchman, who was duly kept on for another year.  Herbert, despite a points finish in the first race of the season, lost his motivation after a sequence of bad luck and narrowly missing out on further points.  He decided to move to Stewart for 1999, and would be replaced by Pedro Diniz. 
The team eventually finished sixth in the Constructors' Championship with ten points.  This was their best WCC position so far, but there was still some way to go to take on the likes of Ferrari and McLaren.
It was with this car that the last round steering wheel in Formula 1 was used. All steering wheels have been rectangular since then.

Swarm of the Snakehead is a 2006 comedy/horror feature film directed by Frank A. Lama and Joel C. Denning and written by Seth Hurwitz. It is the first feature from producers Lama and Hurwitz's Baltimore-based production company Ten Pound Films.
The ensemble cast includes Gunnar Hansen (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre), Rigg Kennedy (Slumber Party Massacre) and Miss Maryland Teen USA 2006 Jamie O'Brien.
Swarm of the Snakehead was shot on 16 mm film in and around Easton, Maryland between 2002 and 2005. Post-production was completed during the summer of 2006. A rough cut of the film was premiered for friends and family at The Charles Theatre in Baltimore (where John Waters premiered many of his early films) on June 21, 2006. The sold out screening led to several articles in Maryland papers including The Baltimore Sun, as well as radio and television appearances. During one such appearance on the Baltimore CBS affiliate WJZ-TV, anchor and longtime Maryland personality Marty Bass called Swarm of the Snakehead "lots of fun" and "John Waters-esque."
While making Swarm of the Snakehead, Lama starred in Fear of Clowns released by Lions Gate Entertainment in 2005 and the upcoming Fear of Clowns 2, which he also produced. At the same time, Hurwitz edited Swarm and shepherded the film through post-production, working closely with sound designer Kevin Hill and composer Tom Alonso.

"Scared of the Police" is the debut single by Surrey-based rock band Reuben. It was recorded in December 2001 at EMI studios in London with Idlewild/80's Matchbox producer Paul Tipler, and was the first recording to be released with Guy Davis on drums. The band's press company had suggested that they release a single, so they approached Andy Ross of Food records to release it as the first record on his new label, Bossmusic. It was released in March 2002 and reached #87 in the UK chart, impressive for a small release, and received good reviews from the music magazines, most notably a KKKKK rating from Andrew W.K in that week's issue of Kerrang! magazine. The accompanying video, the band's first to be played on TV, was a surprise success and reached #2 in MTV2's Most Wanted chart.

[[Lojong]]

CATEGORIES: Buddhist terms, Tibetan Buddhist practices, Mental training

Lojong (Tib. བློ་སྦྱོང་,[tpl]bo|w=blo sbyong[/tpl]) is a mind training practice in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition based on a set of aphorisms formulated in Tibet in the 12th century by Geshe Chekhawa. The practice involves refining and purifying one's motivations and attitudes.
The fifty-nine or so slogans that form the root text of the mind training practice are designed as a set of antidotes to undesired mental habits that cause suffering. They contain both methods to expand one's viewpoint towards absolute bodhicitta, such as "Find the consciousness you had before you were born" and "Treat everything you perceive as a dream", and methods for relating to the world in a more constructive way with relative bodhicitta, such as "Be grateful to everyone" and "When everything goes wrong, treat disaster as a way to wake up."
Prominent teachers who have popularized this practice in the West include Pema Chodron,Pema Chödrön (2007), Always Maintain a Joyful Mind. (Boston: Shambhala) ISBN 978-1-59030-460-0.

ESPN Hollywood was a television program that aired on ESPN2 in 2005. The daily 30-minute show was centered on the convergence between the sports and entertainment worlds, and was a part of the network's ESPN Original Entertainment (eoe) programming effort, which was intended to spread the network's viewership beyond the regular or hardcore sports fan.
The program premiered on August 15, 2005[tpl]citation|last=Grossman|first=Ben|title=ESPN Benches Hollywood|newspaper=Broadcasting & Cable|date=January 17, 2006|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6300107.html?display=Breaking+News|accessdate=2008-11-10[/tpl] to a dismal rating of 0.08% of United States households with cable televisions, about 75,000 people.[tpl]citation|last=Hiestand|first=Michael|title=Sports Television:NHL is in line to skate to Outdoor Life Network|newspaper=USA Today|date=August 16, 2005|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2005-08-16-hiestand-tv_x.htm|accessdate=2008-11-10[/tpl] The show, described by the New York Daily News as "a sports version of Entertainment Tonight or Access Hollywood", was hosted by Mario Lopez and Thea Andrews.  Andrews also was the producer for the show.http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0028870/ A typical show would include news of athletes appearing in movies, on television, and in commercials, coverage of movie premieres, and interviews with athletes and entertainers.
The show's launch was controversial; promotional advertisements featured photos of baseball player Derek Jeter with a woman whose face was not shown.  A spokesman for Jeter's employer, the New York Yankees, objected to the ad, saying "In the ad they insinuate they are out with Jeter, with his permission, or they are following him. Give me a break. Neither is true."[tpl]citation|last=Raissman|first=Bob|title=ESPN's Jeter Ad Too Sexy for Yanks|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=August 26, 2005|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2005/08/26/2005-08-26_espn_s_jeter_ad_too_sexy_for.html|accessdate=2008-11-10[/tpl]  ESPN realized that the show would be risky; if sports figures were angered by their coverage on ESPN Hollywood they might refuse to participate in interviews on other ESPN programs. The final episode was broadcast on January 26, 2006.  An ESPN executive vice president later remarked that the premise of the show was unworkable, saying "I think fans want information about athletes in the context of sports coverage."[tpl]citation|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=Now Batting for the Yankees, Lindsay Lohan|date=June 1, 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/sports/baseball/01sandomir.html|accessdate=2008-11-10[/tpl]
ESPN Hollywood continued as a segment on Cold Pizza, also on ESPN2, until early 2006. Both hosts have since moved on to general entertainment news programs in syndication, as Lopez is the current host of Extra, while Andrews now hosts omg! Insider.

Lawrence Giustiniani, C.R.S.A. ([tpl]lang-it|Lorenzo Giustiniani[/tpl], July 1, 1381 – January 8, 1456), is venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. He was a canon regular who was appointed as a bishop and became the first Patriarch of Venice.
He was a member of the well-known Giustiniani family, which includes several saints. The piety of his mother seems to have served as an inspiration for his own spirituality, as he chose of a life of prayer and service. In 1404, after he had been ordained a deacon, at the suggestion of an uncle who was a priest, he joined a community of secular canons following a monastic form of life on the island of San Giorgio in Alga.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/34500|work=Santi e beati|title= San Lorenzo Giustiniani|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]it icon[/tpl]
He was admired by his fellows for his poverty, mortification, and fervency of prayer. Two years after his ordination to the Catholic priesthood in 1407, the community accepted the Rule of St. Augustine. He was chosen to be the first prior of the community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.augustiniancanons.org/About/saints.htm#St.%20Martin%20of%20Leon|work=Confederation of Canons Regular of St. Augustine|title=Saints of the Canons Regular|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl]
Gustiniani promoted the Constitutions which he been established for the canons of St. George, which was embraced by other communities of canons in the region and shortly thereafter he became the Prior General of a congregation. He was so zealous in spreading it that he was looked upon as if he were the actual founder of the Order. 
In 1433, Pope Eugene IV, one of the founders of the Monastery of San Giorgio,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.augustiniancanons.org/About/houses_and_congregations_through_copy%281%29.htm#Alga|work=Augustinian canons|title=Congregations and Houses|accessdate=16 February 2013[/tpl] named Gustiniani as the Bishop of Castello. He found a diocese in shambles and his administration was marked by considerable growth and reform. In 1451, Pope Nicholas V united the Diocese of Castello with the Patriarchate of Grado, and the seat of the patriarchate was moved to Venice, making Giustiniani the first Patriarch of Venice, a post that he held for over four years.
It was during Gustiniani's rule that Constantinople fell to Muslim forces. Due to their centuries of close trading partnerships with Byzantine Empire, the people of Venice were in panic as to their future. He took a leading role in helping the Republic to deal with the crisis, working with the Senate to help chart its future, as well as with the clergy and people to calm them.

[[Wheelbarrow (robot)]]
CATEGORIES: Bomb disposal robots, Land warfare, Emergency services, Tracked robots, Robots of the United Kingdom, 1972 robots

The Wheelbarrow is a remotely controlled robot designed in 1972 for use by British Army bomb disposal teams operating in Northern Ireland (321 EOD), mainland Britain (11 EOD Regiment) and Iraq. Over 400 have been destroyed in operation, and they are considered to have saved the lives of hundreds.
The idea was instigated by Major RJW ‘Pat’ Patterson (1924 – 2003) in the aftermath of a period (1971 – 72) when the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) lost eight ATOs (Ammunition Technical Officers) on active duty in Northern Ireland. An appalling rate of attrition due to the limited options available to an operator faced with an IED.
As head of the RAOC’s Bomb Disposal School (CAD Kineton, Warwickshire) Pat’s invention of the ‘Pigstick’, a device which fires an explosively-propelled jet of water to disrupt the circuitry of a bomb and disable it, had just begun to be used by the ATOs in Northern Ireland. Thoroughly effective its main drawback was that the muzzle must be placed within 3 ins of the bomb which meant that an EOD operator still had to approach the bomb to be able to use it.
However terrorists soon recognised – and exploited – this weakness and changed their tactics  in two ways: firstly by fitting bombs with time fuses which were set to expire around the time of arrival of the EOD operator and, secondly, by increasing the use of car bombs as the terrorists realised that the Pigstick was virtually useless against them.
Major 'Pat' Patterson knew that if a bomb, particularly one in a car, could be neutralised from a distance both the ATO and members of the public would be better protected. To that end he and his team conceived of a remote controlled go-kart that could:
1 – be capable of attaching tow ropes to suspect cars in relative safety. Once a tow rope had been attached it was a simple matter to pull the suspect vehicle to a position where, should the car bomb explode, it would be less likely to cause injuries or major damage to property.
2 – enable the Pigstick to be utilised so as to neutralise the bomb.
The crude prototypes produced at CAD Kineton proved difficult to manoeuvre so a team at the then Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE, Chertsey) was tasked to improve the tracking and steering. The team included John 'Peter' Miller (1912 – 2006), a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the Royal Tank Corps, who had previously modified his own lawnmower to mow independently with the aid of a lanyard. Remembering how effective it was he returned to his local garden centre to order the chassis and motor of a powered wheelbarrow to incorporate. Once there he was advised by the sales assistant to use the chassis of a battery-operated wheelbarrow instead; hence the origination of the name.
Liaison with CAD Kineton and their EOD-trained teams working in Northern Ireland  ensured that the latest innovations were incorporated as time went on which meant that lives and property were at minimal risk caused by improvised explosive devices. The latest iteration is the 'Wheelbarrow Revolution'. The most notable feature in this model is the 360 degree arm which can be outfitted with various EOD attachments. The Wheelbarrow Revolution is also capable of climbing stairways.
It is important to mention the major effort put in by Lofty Pattinson MBE,Cyril Luger & Rod Crane of RARDE Chertsey during the early development of Wheelbarow. See http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wheelbarrow_(robot)&oldid=320596241

"I Wanna Be the Only One" is a single by Eternal. It was the third single released from their album Before the Rain. In May 1997, the group joined forces with US singer BeBe Winans and scored their first - and only - UK chart-topper with this song. The girl group had previously scored #1 hits in Japan with "Stay", "Power Of A Woman", "Who Are You" and "Finally".
"I Wanna Be the Only One" became Eternal's biggest hit to date: it was the third most played song on British radio and the most played song on European radio by a UK act in 1997.  It earned Eternal a MOBO Award and Capital FM Award for Best Single. It was also nominated for Best Single at the BRIT Awards; although the gong went to All Saints, unofficial reports suggest that winner Never Ever was closely challenged by both Eternal and the Spice Girls.

Enterprise systems engineering (ESE) is the discipline that applies systems engineering to the design of an enterprise.R.E. Giachetti (2010). Design of Enterprise Systems: Theory, Architecture, and Methods, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, p. 3  As a discipline, it includes a body of knowledge, principles, and processes tailored to the design of enterprise systems.  
It accomplishes all of the tasks of "traditional" systems engineering, further informed by an expansive view of the context (political, operational, economic, technological, interacting systems, etc.) in which the system(s) under consideration are being developed, acquired, modified, maintained, or disposed of.
Enterprise systems engineering may be required when the complexity being faced (due to scale, uncontrollable interdependencies, and other uncertainties) breaks down the assumptions upon which textbook systems engineering is based, such as requirements being relatively stable and well-understood, a system configuration that can be controlled, and a small, easily discernible set of stakeholders.

The 1957 English cricket season saw a continuation of Surrey success and an easy win for England over West Indies. Of Surrey's run of Championship titles from 1952 to 1958, this was the most decisive. They won 21 matches out of 28 and lost none, finishing with 312 points to the runner-up's (Northamptonshire) 218. It was jokingly suggested that they might still have won the title had they had no stumps to bowl at, for Mickey Stewart held 77 catches (only one short of Walter Hammond's record for a non-wicketkeeper), and Ken Barrington and Tony Lock each held 64.

The Newark Holy Stones refer to a set of artifacts allegedly discovered by David Wyrick in 1860 within a cluster of ancient Indian burial mounds near Newark, Ohio. The set consists of the Keystone, a stone bowl, and the Decalogue with its sandstone box.  They can be viewed at the Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum in Coshocton, Ohio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jhmuseum.org/holy_stone_about.htm|title=Collections|publisher=Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum|accessdate=31 January 2011[/tpl] The site where the objects were found is known as The Newark Earthworks, one of the biggest collections from an ancient American Indian culture known as the Hopewell that existed from approximately 100 BC to AD 500.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283|title=Hopewell Culture|publisher=Ohio History Central|accessdate=23 August 2010[/tpl]
The events surrounding the discovery and authenticity of the artifacts are controversial.  A wide consensus believes that the artifacts are either the subject of a hoax or originate from a time period that has no relation to the Hopewell.  Others believe that the artifacts' inscription contains dialect that is in fact of Judean descent and could have existed during that time.

[[Vindicianus]]
CATEGORIES: 8th-century Christian saints, Belgian saints, Belgian Roman Catholic saints, 632 births, 712 deaths, Bishops of Arras, Bishops of Cambrai, Merovingian saints

Saint Vindicianus (Vindician) ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Vindicien[/tpl]) (c. 632 – c. 712) was a bishop of Cambrai-Arras.  His feast day is 11 March.  He is called a spiritual follower of Saint Eligius (Saint Eloi).
Traditionally, his birthplace is given as Bullecourt, near Bapaume.  This is the birthplace indicated in the documents dating much later than the saint's death, but which claim to reproduce an ancient local tradition. Nothing is known of his early years.
On the death of St. Aubert, Bishop of Cambrai-Arras (about 668), Vindicianus was elected his successor. In any case he was bishop of this see in the reign of Thierry III of Neustria (about 673). The author of the Gesta episcoporum Cameracensium (written 1024/1025, but generally trustfull) declares that he didn't know the duration of the episcopate of Vindicianus.
Legend has crept into the history of the holy bishop, but the following facts may be regarded as certain.
In 673 Vindicianus supervised the translation of the body of St. Maxellende to Caudri. In the same year he consecrated the monastery of Honnecourt sur l'Escaut, which was given in 685 to St. Bertin. In 675 he signed a charter of donation in favour of the abbey at Maroilles, rendered illustrious by St. Humbert (Emebertus). In the same year he consecrated the church at Hasnon. He was probably in relation with St. Arnaud of Tongeren, since we find his signature to the latter's testament in 679. In 681 he claimed for his diocese the honour of possessing the body of St. Léger, the unfortunate victim of the political strife which was then filling Neustria with blood, but he did not succeed, the remains of St. Léger being confided to Ansoald, Bishop of Poitiers. His predecessor, St. Aubert, had founded the Monastery of St. Vaast, the building of which he had been unable to complete; Vindicianus finished it, apparently in 682, and placed it temporalities under the protection of Thierry III, who conferred numerous gifts on the monastery.
In 685 a certain Hatta was placed at its head by Vindicianus. In the following year the latter dedicated the church at Hamaye, and acted at the exhumation of the bodies of Sts. Eusebia[tpl]dn|date=February 2012[/tpl] and Gertrude, who had been abbesses of the monastery of that name.
The events of his life after this date (686) are unknown. He was buried at Mont-St-Eloi. The region was ravaged by the Normans in the ninth century, and on more than one occasion the relics of the saint were in danger, until in 1030 Bishop Gerard I of Cambrai had his body removed to the episcopal city. After having been at Douai and Arras, the relics were returned to Mont-St-Eloi in 1453. After still further translations, especially in 1598 and 1601, the body was finally placed in the cathedral at Arras.
His successor on that see about 695 was St. Abelbert (often confused with St. Emebert, brother of Saint Gudula and St. Reinelda).

[[HLA-DQ8]]

CATEGORIES: HLA-DQ haplotypes, Human MHC mediated diseases

HLA-DQ8 (DQ8) is a human leukocyte antigen serotype within the HLA-DQ (DQ) serotype group. DQ8 is a split antigen of the DQ3 broad antigen. DQ8 is determined by the antibody recognition of β8 and this generally detects the gene product of DQB1*0302.
DQ8 is commonly linked to autoimmune disease in the human population. DQ8 is the second most predominant isoform linked to coeliac disease and the DQ most linked to juvenile diabetes. DQ8 increases the risk for rheumatoid arthritis and is linked to the primary risk locus for RA, HLA-DR4. DR4 also plays an important role in juvenile diabetes. While the DQ8.1 haplotype is associated with disease, there is no known association with the DQB1*0305, DQ8.4 or DQ8.5 haplotypes (see infobox) with autoimmune disease; however, this may be the result of lack of study in populations that carry these and the very low frequency.
DQ8.1 also differs from other HLA in population frequencies. Typically for MHC Class II antigens in humans, haplotype frequencies do not exceed 40%. For example, in the US the highest haplotype frequency, the haplotype that encoded DQ6.2, is around 15%, this translates into phenotype frequencies of less than 30%. Atypically haplotype frequencies exceed 40%.
For DQ8 the highest haplotype frequencies approach 80% in parts of Central and South America and the phenotype frequencies approach 90%. This is the highest phenotype frequency observed for any DR or DQ phenotype in the human population by a wide margin.

[[Robert Courtneidge]]

CATEGORIES: English theatre managers and producers, Musical theatre librettists, 1859 births, 1939 deaths, People from Glasgow

Robert Courtneidge (29 June 1859 – 6 April 1939) was a British theatrical manager-producer and playwright.  He is best remembered as the co-author of the light opera Tom Jones (1907) and the producer of The Arcadians (1909).  He was the father of the actress Cicely Courtneidge, who played in many of his early 20th century productions. 
Courtneidge began as a comic actor in the late 1870s, working with Kate Santley, George Edwardes and others.  In the early 1890s, he toured in Australia with Edwardes and J. C. Williamson companies.  In 1896, he became a theatre manager in Manchester and then a West End producer.  In the first years of the 20th century, he began to direct musical theatre pieces and to write or co-write the book for some of his productions, including Tom Jones (1907).  His most popular productions included The Arcadians (1909), Princess Caprice (1912), Oh! Oh! Delphine (1913) and The Cinema Star (1914).  He directed the hit musical The Boy in 1917.
After the war, he presented Paddy the Next Best Thing, which had a long run, and then took a touring company to Australia, presenting a repertory of comedies.  In the 1920s, he returned to producing British provincial tours and became the lessee of the Savoy Theatre, presenting a mixture of productions ranging from Shakespeare to farce.  A lifelong socialist, he joined with other managers in campaigning for fair pay and treatment of actors.  He also returned briefly to acting.  Later in the decade, he presented more West End musicals and operettas, producing his last show in 1930.  In 1933 he wrote a novel, Judith Clifford.

[[Self-reconfiguring modular robot]]

CATEGORIES: Robot architectures

Modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems or self-reconfigurable modular robots are autonomous kinematic machines with variable morphology. Beyond conventional actuation, sensing and control typically found in fixed-morphology robots, self-reconfiguring robots are also able to deliberately change their own shape by rearranging the connectivity of their parts, in order to adapt to new circumstances, perform new tasks, or recover from damage. 
For example, a robot made of such components could assume a worm-like shape to move through a narrow pipe, reassemble into something with spider-like legs to cross uneven terrain, then form a third arbitrary object (like a ball or wheel that can spin itself) to move quickly over a fairly flat terrain; it can also be used for making "fixed" objects, such as walls, shelters, or buildings.
In some cases this involves each module having 2 or more connectors for connecting several together. They can contain electronics, sensors, computer processors, memory, and power supplies; they can also contain actuators that are used for manipulating their location in the environment and in relation with each other. A feature found in some cases is the ability of the modules to automatically connect and disconnect themselves to and from each other, and to form into many objects or perform many tasks moving or manipulating the environment.
By saying "self-reconfiguring" or "self-reconfigurable" it means that the mechanism or device is capable of utilizing its own system of control such as with actuators or stochastic means to change its overall structural shape. Having the quality of being "modular" in "self-reconfiguring modular robotics" is to say that the same module or set of modules can be added to or removed from the system, as opposed to being generically "modularized" in the broader sense. The underlying intent is to have an indefinite number of identical modules, or a finite and relatively small set of identical modules, in a mesh or matrix structure of self-reconfigurable modules.
Self-reconfiguration is also different from the concept of self-replication, and self-replication is not necessarily a quality that a self-reconfigurable module or collection of such modules can or must possess. A matrix of N-number of modules does not need to be able to increase the quantity of modules to greater than N to be considered self-reconfigurable. It is sufficient for self-reconfigurable modules to be a device that is produced at a conventional factory, where dedicated machines stamp or mold components, and factory workers on an assembly line assemble the components to build each module.
There are two basic types of methods of segment articulation that self-reconfigurable mechanisms can utilize to reshape their structures, chain reconfiguration and lattice reconfiguration.

Puntiagudo-Cordón Cenizos ([tpl]IPA-es|puntjaˈɣuðo korˈðon seˈnisos[/tpl]) is a snow-capped volcanic chain located in the Andes, in Los Lagos Region of Chile, near Volcán Osorno. It lies between Rupanco Lake and Todos los Santos Lake. "Volcán Puntiagudo" (Spanish for "Sharp-pointed volcano") is a stratovolcano with a prominent 2,493 m high sharp-pointed summit that results from glacial dissection and gets its name from this feature. According to locals, the Puntiagudo volcano lost some of its sharp point in the earthquake of 1960 (9,5 Ritchter). So the volcano was more pointed than it is today. Puntiagudo is also given the name Cerro Cenizas.
Puntiagudo is partially contained within Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park.

Spectacular Spas is a Canadian television travel series about spa treatments from around the world.
The series began in 1998. Hosted by Carrie Olver, the programme mainly visits destination spas and day spas, and has been to many different world regions — including all around North America, as well as the Caribbean, Scandinavia, England, central Europe and east Asia — in search of different sorts of treatments and experiences. It covers types of massage particular to a region (e.g., Swedish or Icelandic, which were both covered in one episode); areas with natural hot springs for bathing, different kinds of cuisine, alternative holistic treatments and materials thought to have healing qualities are also explored.
The mood of the programme is very relaxed, and its theme tune and incidental music are deliberately soothing, to reflect the subject matter. It has been shown worldwide since beginning on Canada's Life Network, to (among others) NDTV in India and You TVYou TV, UK. (now Sumo TVSumo TV.) in the UK.
The large amount of nudity on Spectacular Spas is not usually a problem for censors, since only Carrie Olver's back is exposed when she gets massaged, but You TV decided to cut out a sequence where she stripped off her towel in a river after having a mud bath.[tpl]fact|date=November 2010[/tpl]

NCTT is one of 14 National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education Resource Centers of Excellence, each one organized around a specific technology focus. NCTT is charged with leading a national collaborative of business and education partners to develop and disseminate an always relevant, industry-driven curriculum to teach and train tomorrow’s ICT technicians and technologists.
The Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) industry - driven by demand for instantly accessible information - is profoundly transforming the world. Voice, data, and video communications across a worldwide network are creating challenges and opportunities that did not exist even a few years ago.
The major challenge today for the ICT industry and increasingly for ICT-dependent industries is to secure an appropriately skilled workforce that will insure their companies can compete effectively in the global marketplace. With even more rapid breakthroughs in technology anticipated in the coming years, education is the key to their success.
In 2008 the Center was renamed the National Center for Information and Communications Technologies (ICT Center).

Sardinella are generally coastal, schooling marine fish. Juveniles are often found in lagoons and estuaries, and adults are more common off the coast.
Species are distinguished by their ranges and by specific body features, but they are often confused with one another. Fish of the genus have 7 to 14 striped markings along the scales of the top of the head. The paddle-shaped supramaxilla bones are characteristic; they separate Sardinella from other genera and their shapes help distinguish species. There are paired predorsal scales and enlarged fin rays.[tpl]cite book|last=Whitehead|first=P. J. P.|title=FAO species catalogue. Vol. 7. Clupeoid fishes of the world.

[[Species Tulips]]

CATEGORIES: Garden plants, Liliaceae

Species Tulips are different from the hybridized garden tulips, seen in gardens world wide, in that they are less widely grown—and known—than the garden hybrids, and are unlikely to ever outsell or even approach their level of popularity. However, more and more species are becoming available each year.
Species tulips are frequently listed under the heading ‘botanical tulips’, which makes them sound dull or specialized, and probably difficult to grow. Tulip species are not difficult to grow and they are certainly not dull. 
You do not have to buy species tulips new every year to guarantee flowers. Plant the bulbs in the right place and they will re-bloom year after year with colorful flowers, and, in time, may even increase by themselves to form sizeable colonies. 
Tulip species are the starting point in the long story of the garden tulip and they are still out there, growing in the wild—in Europe, North Africa, and Asia. They are usually smaller and less bold than the garden hybrids, and extra care may be needed to grow some of them successfully, but they amaze with the intensity of their color and surprise with the size of their flowers. Growing in distant mountain ranges, hidden gorges, and remote meadows are plants that wouldn’t look out of place in the brightest, most flamboyant garden.

Charles de WaillyThe "de" in the name "de Wailly" is not a nobiliary particle but finds its origin in the Flemish definite article "der".[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]  It is usual practice to refer to him as "de Wailly" ("De Wailly" at the beginning of a sentence) and not "Wailly". However, the name is generally indexed as "Wailly, Charles de". (An exception is found in Eriksen 1974, however, his example has not been followed by subsequent authors, such as Braham 1980 or Cleary 1998.) During the Revolution de Wailly began to sign his name "Dewailly" (Braham 1972, p. 673 note 7), but this form of the name has not been generally adopted. ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʃaʁl də vaji[/tpl]) (9 November 1730 – 2 November 1798) was a French architect and urbanist, and furniture designer, one of the principals in the Neoclassical revival of the Antique.

[[Sigurd Hart]]

CATEGORIES: Norwegian petty kings

Sigurd Hart or Sigurd Hjort was a legendary king of Ringerike in Norway, who appears in Ragnarssona þáttr and in Halfdan the Black's saga.
Ragnarssona þáttr informs that he was the son of Helgi the Sharp (the great-great-grandson of king King of Ringerike) of the Dagling dynasty and Aslaug. She was the daughter of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye (one of Ragnar Lodbrok's sons) and Blaeja, the daughter of king Aelle II of Northumbria. When Sigurd Hart was only twelve years old he slew a berserker named Hildibrand in a duel, and twelve other men. He married Ingeborg, the daughter of the Jutish chieftain Harald Klak. Sigurd and Ingeborg had the children Guttorm and Ragnhild. When his uncle king Fróði of Ringerike died, Sigurd went to Norway to succeed him as king. 
Ragnarssona þáttr and Halfdan the Black's saga relate that a berseker from Hadeland named Haki killed Sigurd, but lost a hand in the fight. Then Haki went to Sigurd's residence at Stein and took Sigurd's children Ragnhild and Guttorm. Haki returned with the children and all the loot to Hadeland. Before Haki recuperated from his wounds and could marry the 15 or 20 year old Ragnhild, she was captured a second time, by Halfdan the Black. Halfdan and Ragnhild were the parents of Harald Fairhair.
Excerpt from Halfdan the Black's saga:Halfdan the Black.
Sigurd Hjort was the name of a king in Ringerike, who was stouter and stronger than any other man, and his equal could not be seen for a handsome appearance. His father was Helge Hvasse (the Sharp); and his mother was Aslaug, a daughter of Sigurd the snake-eyed, who again was a son of Ragnar Lodbrok. It is told of Sigurd that when he was only twelve years old he killed in single combat the berserk Hildebrand, and eleven others of his comrades; and many are the deeds of manhood told of him in a long saga about his feats. Sigurd had two children, one of whom was a daughter, called Ragnhild, then twenty years of age, and an excellent brisk girl. Her brother Guthorm was a youth. It is related in regard to Sigurd's death that he had a custom of riding out quite alone in the uninhabited forest to hunt the wild beasts that are hurtful to man, and he was always very eager at this sport. One day he rode out into the forest as usual, and when he had ridden a long way he came out at a piece of cleared land near to Hadeland. There the berserk Hake came against him with thirty men, and they fought. Sigurd Hjort fell there, after killing twelve of Hake's men; and Hake himself lost one hand, and had three other wounds. Then Hake and his men rode to Sigurd's house, where they took his daughter Ragnhild and her brother Guthorm, and carried them, with much property and valuable articles, home to Hadeland, where Hake had many great farms.

[[Definition of man]]

CATEGORIES: Anthropology literature, Definitions

Definition of Man, sometimes now referred to as Definition of Human, originated from a summary essay of Kenneth Burke (1897–1993) which he included in his 1966 work, Language as Symbolic Action.  Burke's work in communication has spanned many fields and focuses primarily on rhetoric.  Perhaps he is best known for his theory of Dramatism, wherein he characterizes life to not just reflect or be like a drama but rather that life is drama.Miller, K.

The addition of Sisto's vocal alongside a predominantly ex-Birdman lineup, created what many [tpl]Who||date=February 2012[/tpl]  believed as the next generation of Birdman, with a vocal which mirrored that of The Doors.

[[Communication accommodation theory]]

CATEGORIES: Communication, Communication theory

Communication accommodation theory (CAT) is a theory of communication developed by Howard Giles. It argues that “when people interact they adjust their speech, their vocal patterns and their gestures, to accommodate to others”.[tpl]sfn|Turner|West|2010[/tpl] It explores the various reasons why individuals emphasize or minimize the social differences between themselves and their interlocutors through verbal and nonverbal communication. This theory is concerned with the links between “language, context and identity”.[tpl]sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005[/tpl] It focuses on both the intergroup and interpersonal factors that lead to accommodation as well as the ways in which power, macro and micro-context concerns affect communication behaviors.[tpl]sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005[/tpl] There are two main accommodation processes described by this theory. Convergence refers to the strategies through which individuals adapt to each other’s communicative behaviors, in order to reduce these social differences.[tpl]sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991[/tpl] Meanwhile, Divergence refers to the instances in which individuals accentuate the speech and non-verbal differences between themselves and their interlocutors.[tpl]sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991[/tpl] Sometimes when individuals try to engage in convergence they can also end up over-accommodating, and despite their good intentions their convergence can be seen as condescending.

George John Kurowski (April 19, 1918 – December 9, 1999) was a third baseman  in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis Cardinals ([tpl]by|1941[/tpl]-49). Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair.
A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. Kurowski overcame childhood osteomyelitis,[tpl]cite book |author=Charlton, James; Shatzkin, Mike; Holtje, Stephen |title=The Ballplayers: baseball's ultimate biographical reference |publisher=Arbor House/William Morrow |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=0-87795-984-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=592[/tpl] which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=7830&bid=1553 |title=The Baseball Biography Project. |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-10-30[/tpl] Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942.[tpl]cite book |title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|publisher=Free Press |isbn=0-684-80697-5 |page=568 [/tpl] His most productive season came in [tpl]by|1947[/tpl], when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging % (.544) and on-base % (.420). 
An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding %, and once in double plays.
In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were World Champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the Series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947.
In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. 
In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter," consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team.
Kurowski died in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, at age 81.

Angels & Airwaves is an American rock supergroup led by Blink-182 guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge. Other members are guitarist David Kennedy (from Over My Dead Body, Hazen Street and Box Car Racer), bassist Matt Wachter (from Thirty Seconds to Mars) and drummer Ilan Rubin (from Lostprophets and Nine Inch Nails). Former original members are bass guitarist Ryan Sinn (formerly of The Distillers), who left the group in 2007 for reasons still unclear, as well as drummer Adam "Atom" Willard (formerly of The Offspring and Rocket from the Crypt), who amicably parted ways with the band in fall 2011 shortly before the release of their fourth album.
Formed after Blink-182 went on hiatus in 2005, the band has continued to record and tour despite DeLonge reigniting his career with Blink-182 in 2009. The band has established themselves as very prolific musicians having released four studio albums We Don't Need to Whisper (2006), I-Empire (2007), Love (2010) and Love: Part Two (2011) in the space of 5 years. The project also resulted in the documentary  film Start the Machine (2008). In 2011, accompanying the two Love albums, the group scored and produced the science fiction drama film Love by director William Eubank in 460 theatres nationwide during their multimedia event, Love Live. The band will release their fifth album, POET on Halloween 2014.

[[Natural fertility]]
CATEGORIES: Demography, Population, Birth control, Fertility

Actual natural fertility is based on cohort parity: the fraction of women in a cohort who have reached a specific parity or number of children. Natural fertility refers to the absence of parity-specific family planning, meaning that couples are not regulating their fertility based on their current parity. Family planning, on the other hand, is when couples regulate their fertility (e.g. stop having children) after reaching a specific parity.[tpl]Cite book | author=Watcher, Kenneth W. | year=2013 |title=Essential Demographic Methods | publisher=Harvard University Press [/tpl]

[[Alternative teacher certification]]

CATEGORIES: Teaching

Alternative teacher certification is a process by which a person is awarded a teaching license even though that person has not completed a traditional teacher certification program. In the US, traditional teacher certification is earned through completing a bachelor's or master’s degree in education, taking standardized tests (usually a Praxis test), and fulfilling additional state requirements. Alternatively certified teachers typically possess a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university and are completing (or have completed) an alternative certification program while teaching full-time. Other state certification requirements, such as the type of education coursework or the length of practice teaching, may be modified or waived. In the United States, alternative certification is offered in forty-eight states and the District of Columbia.
Alternative certification programs first appeared in the 1980s. A decline in the number of students seeking a degree in education was creating a shortage of teachers in American elementary and high schools. States began to search for a way to recruit and train people who had already earned a four-year degree and wanted to become teachers.[tpl]cite web | last =Feistritzer | first =Emily | title =Alternative Teacher Certification | publisher =National Center for Alternative Certification | date =2006-02-01 | url =http://www.teach-now.org/intro.cfm | accessdate =2006-10-25  | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061003233216/http://www.teach-now.org/intro.cfm| archivedate= 3 October 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] While the requirements for an alternative certification vary from state to state, there are certain commonalities found in the programs. A prospective teacher is usually required to complete an accelerated university program, pass the state licensing test, and submit to a series of interviews. He or she must be able to demonstrate a mastery of educational methods, and participate in a mentor program with a teacher who has completed a traditional education degree.[tpl]cite web | title =Overview of Alternative Routes to Teacher Certification | publisher =National Center for Alternative Certification | date =2006-02-01 | url =http://www.teach-now.org/overview.cfm | accessdate =2006-10-25  | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061003233050/http://www.teach-now.org/overview.cfm| archivedate= 3 October 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

[[Feste]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional characters introduced in 1602, Characters in Twelfth Night, Male Shakespearean characters

Feste is a fictional fool in the William Shakespeare's comedy Twelfth Night. He is attached to the household of the Countess Olivia. He has apparently been there for some time, as he was a "fool that the Lady Olivia's father took much delight in" (2.4). Although Olivia's father has died within the last year, it is possible that Feste approaches or has reached middle age, though he still has the wit to carry off good 'fooling' when he needs to, and the voice to sing lustily or plangently as the occasion demands. He is referred to by name only once during the play, in answer to an inquiry by Orsino of who sang a song that he heard the previous evening. Curio responds "Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house" (2.4). Throughout the rest of the play, he is addressed only as "Fool," while in the stage directions he is mentioned as "Clown." 
Feste seems to leave Olivia's house and return at his pleasure, rather too freely for a servant. (At the very least he is doing some free-lance entertaining over at the house of Duke Orsino (2.4).) His peripatetic habits get him into trouble with Lady Olivia: when we first see him, he must talk his way out of being turned out — a grim fate in those days — for being absent, as it were, without leave. He succeeds, and once back in his lady's good graces, he weaves in and out of the action with the sort of impunity that was reserved for a person nobody took seriously.

Giovan Battista Ruoppolo (1629–1693) was a Neapolitan painter from the Baroque era, notable for painting still-lifes. He was a disciple of Paolo Porpora (1617–1673), a contemporary of Salvatore Rosa. Additional Porpora pupils who formed a school of still-life painters in Naples were Giovan Battista, Giuseppe Recco, and Ruoppolo's brother of Giuseppe Ruoppolo.  In addition, he influenced Andrea Belvedere and Giacomo Nani. The initials of Ruoppolo match those of the younger Recco, suggesting some canvas attributions are likely in error. The dark backgrounds to his still life call to memory Caravaggio's bowl of fruit and flowers. Another contemporary painter, though trained in Rome, of still lifes in Italy was Giovanna Garzoni.

Colonel Robert Munro of Foulis (died April 1633), also known as the Black Baron, was traditionally the 18th Baron of Foulis in Scotland. He was a soldier of fortune, who served in Germany under the banners of Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden. It is not certain how he got his epithet of the 'Black Baron', but quite possibly it was from the colour of his hair rather than any perceived martial ferocity. Although this Robert Munro is traditionally 18th Baron and 21st overall chief of the Clan Munro, he is only the 11th Munro chief that can be proved by contemporary evidence."The Munro Tree 1734".

The river flows east, paralleled by the Hancock Notch Trail, into a broad valley with Mount Carrigain to the north and the smaller summit known as Greens Cliff to the south.
The river turns northeast, with Carrigain Brook joining from the north and the outlet of Sawyer Pond joining from the south, and enters a deeper, narrower mountain valley as it descends to Crawford Notch.  The river is paralleled in this lower section by the Livermore Road, a gravel access road.  The Sawyer River enters the town of Hart's Location and ends at the Saco River near its great bend to the east as it leaves Crawford Notch.

In one remarkable struggle, Col. James Bowie, armed only with his Bowie knife, killed three opponents carrying both guns and knives. A knife fight is defined by the presence of a knife as a weapon and the violent intent of the combatants to kill or incapacitate each other; the participants may be completely untrained, self-taught, or trained in one or more formal or informal systems of knife fighting.MacYoung, Marc, Lies About Knife Fighting, retrieved 1 August 2011 Knife fights may involve the use of any type of knife, though certain knives, termed fighting knives, are purposely designed for such confrontations – the dagger being just one example.

Country Casanova is the third album by the band Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen.  It was released in 1973 on Paramount Records.  
The album was originally available on LP and 8-track, and later cassette.  In 1991, it was released on CD.
Country Casanova is highlighted by the band's classic cover version of "Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)." Their cover version of "Everybody's Doin' It" reportedly got them banned from some country music stations because it includes the word "fuckin'" repeated several times, band leader George Frayne claimed in the liner notes of Too Much Fun: The Best of Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen. The original song was a 1937 Western Swing recording by the Modern Mountaineers, a Texas band. It, too included "fuckin'" in the lyric, a trick pulled by pianist-vocalist Smokey Wood.  Cody copied the original arrangement at a slightly faster tempo and removed the original's reference to "darkies."

The Foix ([tpl]IPA-ca|ˈfoʃ[/tpl]) is a river in Catalonia in the province of Barcelona, northeastern Spain. Its source is near La Llancuna in the Comarca of Anoia 800 m above the sea. Later it runs through the Comarca of Alt Penedès, where it feeds a reservoir in the nature reserve of Parc del Foix since 1928, which is highly important for the drinking water supply of the densely populated coastal plain between Barcelona and Tarragona. Then it goes through the Comarca of Garraf from north to the south where it ends into the Mediterranean Sea west of the village of Cubelles. This little delta became an important natural reserve and recreational area after the campground ″Camping Paradiso″ was removed in the late 1990s.
For most of the year, the river is dried up because of the dam and because of hot-summer climatical reasons. That may suddenly change in the winter month when heavy rain comes down in the mountains.

The Rush Line Corridor is a transport corridor and proposed commuter rail service that will run from Union Depot in downtown Saint Paul to Hinckley, Minnesota. It roughly follows the path of U.S. Route 61 and Interstate 35. Along with the Red Rock Corridor in the southeast and the Southwest Corridor in the southwest metro, it is considered a "Tier Two" commuter rail project with scheduled implementation after 2020.[tpl]Citation| title=2030 Transportation Policy Plan| publisher=Metropolitan Council| origyear=2004|date=January 2009| chapter=Chapter 7 – Transit| chapterurl=http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/TPP/2008/Ch7Transit.pdf| url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/TPP/2008/index.htm| [/tpl] Efforts to improve the corridor are coordinated by the Rush Line Corridor Task Force, formed in 1999 and composed of 22 elected officials from counties and municipalities along the corridor.
Commuter rail costs are expected to be high if implemented, due to the multiple railroads operating the tracks, additionally some sections of rail would have to be rebuilt on county-owned abandoned rights-of-way.[tpl]Cite web| title=2030 Transit Master Study: Twin Cities Metropolitan Area| publisher=Metropolitan Council| date=August 8, 2008| url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/tpp/2008/TMSReport.pdf| format=pdf| accessdate=June 10, 2010[/tpl] Existing rail is a combination of Class I and Class III railroads.[tpl]Cite web| title=Rush Line Corridor 2008 Annual Report| publisher=Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority| date=January 2009| url=http://www.rushline.org/Docs/2008%20Rush%20Line%20Annual%20Report.pdf| format=pdf| accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl] Despite a relatively high population density, projected ridership is lower than originally anticipated because commuters are split in their final destination, mostly downtown Saint Paul or downtown Minneapolis.

Queen's Park Savannah is a park in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Known colloquially simply as "De Savannah," it is Port of Spain's largest open space—and the world's largest traffic roundabout. It occupies about [tpl]convert|260|acre|km2[/tpl]  Agostini, Keifel A. Queens Park Savannah: Save Our Savannah. Sunday Express, September 21, 1997. of level land, and the distance around the perimeter is about 2.2 mi (3.5 km). Once sugar land, it was bought by the town council in 1817 from the Peschier family (except for a small parcel near its centre that served as the Peschier cemetery, which remains in private hands). 
At first it was used as a vast cattle pasture in what was then the town's suburbs, but by the middle of the 19th century it had become established as a park. Until the early 1990s, horse racing was held frequently at the Savannah race track, and it also contains several cricket, football and rugby pitches. Apart from a ring of trees round its perimeter, the Savannah was never really landscaped, except for the small area in its northwest corner called the Hollows, a former reservoir now drained and planted with flowering shrubs. 
thumb|250px|Royal Botanic GardensImmediately north of the Savannah—also the northern limit of the city of Port of Spain—are the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Emperor Valley Zoo, the official residences of the president and the prime minister, and Queen's Hall, the city's major performing arts venue. Lady Chancellor Road, which ascends the hills overlooking the Savannah, is one of Port of Spain's most exclusive residential areas.
On the Savannah's southern side is the Grand Stand, formerly used for viewing horse races, now used for various cultural events, most notably Carnival, when a temporary North Stand and raised stage are constructed in front of the Grand Stand, creating the "Big Yard", Carnival's central location since the early 20th century (previously, the main viewing area for Carnival was in downtown Port of Spain).Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday : newsday.co.tt : From this location the Parade of Bands is broadcast live to the nation on Carnival Monday and Tuesday; it is also the venue for the Calypso Monarch and Carnival King and Queen Competitions and the finals of the Panorama steelpan competition.
The western edge of the Savannah, along Maraval Road, is the location of the Magnificent Seven, a group of late Victorian buildings built in an eccentric and flamboyant variety of styles. These are Queen's Royal College; the residences of the Anglican bishop (Hayes Court) and the Roman Catholic archbishop; Whitehall, once a private residence, now the office of the prime minister; Mille Fleurs, the future home of the Law Association; Roomor, an ornate black-and-white chateau-like building that remains a private residence; and Stollmeyer's Castle, a turreted house supposedly modelled on Balmoral Castle which is now being converted into subsidiary offices for the prime minister's staff.

[[Stall (engine)]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanics, Machines, Driving techniques

A stall of an engine refers to a sudden stopping of the engine turning, usually brought about accidentally.  
It is commonly applied to the phenomenon whereby an engine abruptly ceases operating and stops turning. It might be due to not getting enough air, fuel, or electric spark, mechanical failure, or in response to a sudden increase in engine load. This increase in engine load is common with manual transmission when the clutch is released too suddenly.
The ways in which a car can stall is usually down to the driver, especially on manual transmission. For instance if a driver engages the clutch too quickly while stationary then the engine will stall; engaging the clutch slowly will stop this from happening. Stalling also happens when the driver forgets to depress the clutch and/or change to neutral while coming to a stop. Stalling can be dangerous, especially in heavy traffic.
A car fitted with an automatic transmission could also have its engine stalled when the vehicle is travelling in the opposite direction to the selected gear. For example, if the selector is in the 'D' position and the car is moving backwards, (on a steep enough hill to overcome the torque from the torque converter) the engine will stall. This is because, hypothetically, if the car is rolling backward fast enough, the force from the rotating wheels will be transmitted backward through the transmission and act as a sudden load on the engine.
Digital electronic fuel injection and ECU ignition systems have greatly reduced stalling in modern engines.

William Peter Fowler (born 13 March 1959) is a retired English cricketer who played first-class cricket in England for Derbyshire in 1983 and 1984.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/11/11913/11913.html| title = Bill Fowler |publisher = www.cricketarchive.com | accessdate = 2011-03-11[/tpl] 
Fowler's cricketing career started at Worcestershire's Second XI in 1979 before he found himself out of the side at the end of the season, thought ineffective as a middle-order batsman after his final-game duck against Yorkshire.
Fowler moved to New Zealand in the early part of 1980 in order to play for Northern Districts, who he represented until 1982. He moved to Derbyshire in the 1983 season in time for that year's County Championship. A regular fixture in the first team, he played seventeen out of the twenty-four games of the season, and in the 1984 season, was a middle-order fixture as he recorded his career-best score of 116 against Glamorgan.
Altering between England in the Northern Hemisphere summer and New Zealand in theirs, he did not play another County Championship game after the 1985 season. Fowler played in the Shell Trophy in the last two years of his first-class career.
During his career, Fowler played as a lower-middle order batsman, and maintained a strong one-day bowling average of under 24. He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler.

[[Pulsus bigeminus]]
CATEGORIES: Cardiovascular diseases

Pulsus bigeminus is a cardiovascular phenomenon characterized by groups of two heartbeats close together followed by a longer pause. The second pulse is weaker than the first. Look for a pattern of what appears to be a relatively normal QRS complexes, each followed by a smaller, abnormal one. The smaller beat is palpated as either a missing or an extra beat, and on EKG resembles a PVC.[tpl]cite journal|last=Anand|first=Nidhi|coauthors=Manish Anand;  Alok Vardhan Mathur;  Madhukar Maletha;  SK Ghildyal|title=Intra-operative ventricular bigeminy: Can retractor be a cause|journal=Journal of Anesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology|date=2/3/2011|year=2010|volume=26|issue=4|pages=569–570|url=http://www.joacp.org/article.asp?issn=0970-9185;year=2010;volume=26;issue=4;spage=569;epage=570;aulast=Anand|accessdate=2012-05-16[/tpl]  These PVCs appearing every other beat are also called extrasystoles.
This phenomenon can be a sign of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or of many other types of heart disease (see list below). Other causes include digitalis toxicity, induction of anesthesia,[tpl]cite journal|last=ROLLASON|first=WN|coauthors=D. J. HALL|title=Dysrhythmias during inhalational anaesthesia for oral surgery|journal=Anaesthesia|date=March 1973|volume=28|issue=2|pages=139–145|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2044.1973.tb00305.x/abstract|accessdate=2012-05-16|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1973.tb00305.x[/tpl] placement of surgical instrumentation into the thorax or as a benign, temporary phenomenon.
In Pulsus Bigeminus not all of the conducted electrical activity will elicit sufficient ventricular contraction to produce a palpable pulse. This is important for two reasons. One, an ECG may give a ventricular contraction rate that does not correspond to the palpated pulse rate. Secondly, because not all beats are being conducted, patients may present with symptoms of low output heart failure, e.g. Dizziness, shortness of breath or hypotension, even with a normal ECG.
Management includes looking for and removing underlying cause, including medicines (such as a Calcium Channel blocker) and inotropic therapy to return cardiac output back to normal. If highly symptomatic over a longer period ablation therapy may be the only viable option.
Causes Include:
A doctor can discriminate pulsus bigeminus from pulsus alternans by auscultating the heart.

[[Jorge de Villalonga]]

CATEGORIES: 1664 births, Year of death missing, Viceroys of New Granada, Spanish generals

Jorge de Villalonga, segundo conde de la Cueva (born  1664) was a Spanish lawyer, general and the first official viceroy of New Granada, from November 25, 1719 to May 11, 1724.
Villalonga was a knight of the Order of San Juan. In the army, he rose to the rank of lieutenant general. He was a member of the council of war and a solicitor in the Kingdom of Majorca. In Madrid, he married his niece Catalina María de Villalonga y de Velasco, daughter of his brother Francisco. In 1708 he was placed in charge of the port and presidio of Callao, Peru.
On December 15, 1718 while he was serving as head of the army in Peru, he received the news that he had been named the first official viceroy of the recently created Viceroyalty of New Granada. The new colony included the present-day countries of Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador. Until May 27, 1717, this territory had been part of the Viceroyalty of Peru.
Villalonga made a long overland trip to take up his new post, stopping on the way in Quito and Popayán. On December 17, 1718, he made a great impression on the inhabitants of Santa Fe de Bogotá by the great pomp of his formal entrance into the capital. His lifestyle thereafter continued to contrast greatly with the poverty of most of the inhabitants of the city.
The viceroy had specific orders to clean up the disorder and corruption rampant among the royal officials of the colony. In 1722 he brought charges against the accountant Domingo de Mena. Nevertheless, his administration was known for its arbitrariness and corruption. Villalonga's instructions also specified that he was to prevent the development of wine-making and textile industries in the colony, in order to protect the Spanish industries from the competition. In November 1720, Spanish forces attacked the long-time Dutch settlement in Tucacas, on the coast of what is now Venezuela. This was a center of the contraband trade. It was largely destroyed by the Spanish, including a synagogue that was located there.
In 1721, following orders from the cabinet in Madrid, Villalonga expelled all foreigners, both residents and temporary visitors, not excluding men married to women born in the colony. He took direct control of the treasury. He improved the civil registry and aided in the foundation of the Jesuit college in the city of Santa Fe de Antioquia.
Viceroy Villalonga sent repeated recommendations to the Crown to abolish the viceroyalty and reestablish the earlier government under Peru, for the sake of economy. He argued that the colony was too poor to support viceregal government, there being few Spaniards and many Indians within its borders. In September 1723, three years into Villalonga's administration, the King Philip V issued the order to do that. The reunification took effect on May 11, 1724. Villalonga left Bogotá on May 31 of that year. The two colonies remained reunited until 1740, when the Viceroyalty of New Granada was established once again, this time permanently.

[[Meat tenderizer]]
CATEGORIES: Cooking utensils

A meat tenderizer is hand-powered tool used to tenderize slabs of meat in preparation for cooking the meat. Although a meat tenderizer can be made out of virtually any object there are three types that manufactured specifically for tenderizing meat. The first, most common, is a tool that resembles a hammer or mallet made of metal or wood with a short handle and dual heads. One face of the tool is usually flat while the other has rows of pyramid-shaped tenderizers. The second form resembles a potato masher with a short handle and a large metal face that is either smooth or adorned with the same pyramid-shaped tenderizers as found in the first form. The third form is a blade tenderizer that has a series of blades that are designed to puncture the meat and cut into the fibers of the muscle.
Tenderizing meat with the mallet softens the fibers, making the meat easier to chew, and easier to digest.  It is useful when preparing particularly tough cuts of steak, and works well when broiling or frying the meat.[tpl]cite book|last=Gwyther|first=Pamela|title=The Beginner's Cookbook|publisher=Parragon Publishing|year=2001|location=Queen Street House, 4 Queen Street, Bath BA1 1HE, UK|isbn=1-4054-3689-1|page=13[/tpl]  It is also used to "pound out" dishes such as chicken fried steak or schnitzel to be wider and thinner.

[[Diagram (category theory)]]
CATEGORIES: Functors

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a diagram is the categorical analogue of an indexed family in set theory. The primary difference is that in the categorical setting one has morphisms that also need indexing. An indexed family of sets is a collection of sets, indexed by a fixed set; equivalently, a function from a fixed index set to the class of sets. A diagram is a collection of objects and morphisms, indexed by a fixed category; equivalently, a functor from a fixed index category to some category.
Diagrams are central to the definition of limits and colimits, and to the related notion of cones.

The Roki Tunnel (also called Roksky Tunnel, [tpl]lang-ka|როკის გვირაბი[/tpl]; Ossetic: Ручъы тъунел; [tpl]lang-ru|Рокский туннель[/tpl]) is a mountain tunnel of the Transkam road through the Greater Caucasus Mountains, north of the village Upper Roka. It is the only road joining North Ossetia–Alania in the Russian Federation into South Ossetia, a breakaway republic of Georgia.  The road is manned at the town of Nizhny Zaramag in North Ossetia and is sometimes referred to as the Roki-Nizhny Zaramag border crossing.
The tunnel, completed by the Soviet authorities in 1984, is one of only a handful of routes that cross the North Caucasus Range.  It is at about 2,000 meters altitude and its length is 3,730 meters, and near the Roki Pass at about 3,000 meters altitude, which can only be used in summer.Der Roki-Tunnel – Schlüsselstelle im Georgien-Konflikt[tpl]cite web | title = Structurae.de: Roki Tunnel | publisher = Structurae.de | url = http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0021059 | accessdate = 2008-08-10[/tpl]  The other routes between Georgia and Russia include the Kazbegi-Verkhni Lars customs checkpoint on the Georgian Military Road, closed June 2006http://groups.msn.com/justicefornorthcaucasus/osetia.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=12992 (accessed 2008-8-10) and reopened 2010, and the Gantiadi-Adler crossing in Abkhazia which Georgia asserts functions illegally.http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=527&id=688852 (accessed 2008-8-10)
The tunnel has been important throughout the Georgian-Ossetian conflict.  The South Ossetian authorities use tolls levied on tunnel traffic as one of their main sources of revenue. The Georgian government – backed by the United States – has long called for the South Ossetian side of the tunnel to be placed under the control of international monitors, rather than by the South Ossetian secessionists and their Russian allies.[tpl]cite web | title = Georgian rebel region evacuates children after deadly clashes | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 2008-08-05 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/364929/1/.html | accessdate = 2008-08-10[/tpl] When the Russian authorities blocked the Kazbegi-Verkhni Lars customs checkpoint between June 2006 and March 2010, the Roki Tunnel was the only available road route from Russia to South Ossetia.

He continued for a season in the second team, though come 1989, he was out of Derbyshire altogether, as the team cleared their ranks after two consecutive mediocre seasons.
In this year, he started playing Minor Counties Cricket for Norfolk, in the Minor Counties Championship and, in the final game of his career, as an opening batsman in the NatWest Trophy.
Throughout his career with Derbyshire, he played as a middle-order batsman, and a consistent bowler, with a first-class average with the ball peaking at 27 in 1985.

CATEGORIES: Acaciella, Shrubs, Forages, Flora of India, Flora of South America, Entheogens

Acaciella angustissima (Prairie acacia, White ball acacia, Ocpatl, Palo de PulqueHortipedia) is most recognized for its drought tolerance and its ability to be used as a green manure and ground covering. It is a perennial, deciduous, and belongs to the Fabaceae family (been/legume) and as it grows it starts as a shrub but eventually matures to a small tree. The tree has a high density of leaves along with small clumps of white flowers and creates 4-7 cm long seed pods. 
Acaciella angustissima is found in tropical areas around the equator since, its water needs can vary from 750-2,500 mm a year. It has an advantage it can withstand a moderate drought, since its leaves are retained even in long dry periods. Aside from being drought tolerant, Acaciella angustissima also has the benefit of being a green manure, since it has such a high leaf density, but also loses the majority of its leafs each season. So the leafs can be used in composting or can be saved and used as livestock feed. It should only be used as an additive to the feed and not the main source, since it also toxic in high doses

[[Alexander Cosby]]

CATEGORIES: Lieutenant Governors of Nova Scotia, 1742 deaths, Year of birth unknown, Year of birth uncertain

Alexander Cosby (c 1685–1742) was born in Ireland and had a younger sister who married Richard Philipps, governor of Nova Scotia and a military man. Through this connection, Cosby was appointed major in the 40th regiment and was stationed in Nova Scotia around 1721. He looked to be appointed  lieutenant governor in 1725 but the appointment went to Lawrence Armstrong.
This was a time when the  governor was often absent as was the case with Philipps. Cosby refused to follow orders given by Armstrong and also was appointed lieutenant governor of Annapolis Royal in 1727 by Philipps to succeed John Doucett. It appears that Cosby was always in some kind of turmoil within the military and the governing body, a condition which continued until his death. Accounts of his actions must be tempered by the fact that his correspondence did not survive and accounts are only from the other perspectives.

Apart from its title, it has nothing to do with the collection of Latin poems  by Ovid (the word tristia in Latin means 'sad things').  The individual works were composed at different times and published together in 1852. Berlioz associated them in his mind with Shakespeare's Hamlet, one of his favourite plays.

Hueyatlaco is an archeological site in the Valsequillo Basin near the city of Puebla, Mexico. After excavations in the 1960s, the site became notorious due to geochronologists' analyses that indicated human habitation at Hueyatlaco was dated to ca. 250,000 years before the present.Irwin-Williams, C., et al., Comments on the Associations of Archaeological Materials and Extinct Fauna in the Valsequillo Region Puebla Mexico, American Antiquity, Volume 34, Number 1, Pages 82-83, Jan 1969Szabo, B.J., Malde, H.E., and Irwin-Williams, C., Dilemma Posed By Uranium-Series Dates On Archaeologically Significant Bones From Valsequillo Puebla Mexico, Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Volume 6, Pages 237-244, Jul 1969
These controversial findings are orders of magnitude older than the scientific consensus for habitation of the New World (which generally traces widespread human migration to the New World to 13,000 to 16,000 ybp). The findings at Hueyatlaco have mostly been repudiated by the larger scientific community, and have seen only occasional discussion in the literature.Gonzalez, Silvia; Huddart, David; and Bennett Matthew.

Pensacola School Of Liberal Arts is a private secondary school in Pensacola, Florida, established by William Holston to be an alternative to area public schools. Bill Holston, along with previous Alumni, operate in the School as both office staff and as teachers, assisting a wide array of students of all ages and of various ethnic and financial backgrounds. The house itself has belonged to Bill Holston for several years, but was converted into a school, and then into an office when a secondary building was constructed near it that houses much of the class activities.
The school's history is somewhat different from that of many other local schools, as William Holston founded the school on the premise of bettering students who could not function, or were rejected, from other area schools. Holston was originally a principal at a nearby High School in the town of Pensacola, however, he left the school for various reasons, the chief being the way the school was conducted. This decision to leave the school set in motion the events that brought the Pensacola School of Liberal Arts into what it is, a haven for students to excel in an environment where they are in close contact with knowledgeable instructors.

The confusion about the date of operation was also clarified in this book, though Major Rafiqul Islam wrote that the operation was done on August 16.A Tale of Millions, Islam, Major Rafiqul Bir Uttam, p. 265 It was the first major involvement of Naval Special Service Group, under Commodore David Felix, in the conflict and actively participated in the conflict. Ironically, SSG(N) also led their counter-operations under the same codename. Finally, the operational plan of Lt. General Sagat Singh, commanding the Indian Army IV corps against Pakistan naval forces defending the eastern naval sector (Syhlet, Comilla, Noakhali and Chittagong districts) during December 3–16 may also have been named "Operation Jackpot".Bangladesh at War, Shafiullah, Maj.

Controlled Conversations (Polish: Rozmowy kontrolowane) is a Polish film released in 1991, directed by Sylwester Checinski.
This very black comedy finds humor in what was otherwise a terrifying time: the outbreak of Martial Law in Poland in 1981. Starring Stanisław Tym as Ryszard, a gullible and mildly corrupt government functionary, and Krzysztof Kowalewski as Colonel Zygmunt Molibden, a member of the Polish secret police, Controlled Conversations is a brilliantly funny but extremely hermetic (for non-Poles) examination of the rise of an accidental hero.

John William "Jack" McCartan (born August 5, 1935) was a goaltender for the gold-medal-winning 1960 United States hockey team. He is also a member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, inducted in 1983.
McCartan was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He was a college standout at the University of Minnesota from 1955-1958. McCartan also played baseball at Minnesota.http://www.gophersports.com/genrel/090607aaz.html McCartan was named First Team All-America after the 1957-1958 season. He played for the bronze medal winning US team in baseball at the 1959 Pan American Games.http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mc/jack-mccartan-1.html After graduating, he joined the U.S. Army. While in the army, he joined the United States Olympic hockey team. His heroics helped the U.S. team defeat such powerful teams as Canada, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia and win the gold medal at Squaw Valley. For his efforts, he was named as the "All-World" goaltender of the Winter Games.
He could not duplicate his success in the National Hockey League. The New York Rangers gave him a four-game trial late in the 1959–60 season and he did quite well, the highlight being a save on Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings. Coach Alf Pike decided to alternate Gump Worsley and McCartan in 1960–61, but when McCartan gave up 36 goals in 7½ games, Worsley became the full-time goalkeeper and McCartan was demoted to the minors. He played for several minor league teams over the next several years. He played in the Eastern Professional League, Western League, Central League, and World Hockey Association. In the early 1970s he resurfaced when the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World Hockey Association signed him, but he retired after two seasons.
He later scouted for the Vancouver Canucks.

CATEGORIES: Pseudoarchaeology, Stones, Archaeological forgeries

The Lenape Stone is a piece of slate found in Bucks County, Pennsylvania in 1872, which appears to depict Native Americans hunting a woolly mammoth. This image, however, seems to have been carved some time after the stone was broken into two; for this and other reasons, it is generally considered an archaeological forgery.

Timbúes is a town (comuna) in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina. It has 3,325 inhabitants as per the [tpl]census-ar|2001[/tpl]. It lies in the south of the province, at the confluence of the Paraná River and the Carcarañá River, 30 km north of Rosario and 144 km south of the provincial capital Santa Fe, on National Route 11.
Timbúes started as an agricultural colony in lands purchased by Camilo Aldao and former provincial governor José María Cullen, in 1868. Its name was Colonia Jesús María. The settlement was officially acknowledged on 15 July 1871, and the first local authorities were elected on 2 September 1874. In 1892, the Ferrocarril General Manuel Belgrano railway reached the colony, and the station received the name of Timbúes, which in time became the name of the town itself in popular use, though it was officially changed only in 1974. The Timbúes were an indigenous tribe that formerly populated the area.
The town is located at the northern end of the Industrial Corridor, an area with a great concentration of heavy and medium industries, as well as many important ports, that is centered in Rosario and reaches up to San Nicolás de los Arroyos.
In 2006, contracts were signed to build a thermal power plant in Timbúes. The San Martín Thermoelectric Central, which will be built by Siemens AG, is slated to cost 570 million USD and will be generating 555 MW by May 2008 and 824 MW by April 2009.

Imagine That is a country/pop song written for Patsy Cline by Justin Tubb. 
"Imagine That" was one of three minor hits produced by Patsy Cline in 1962. By this time as well, Patsy Cline was already a very successful Country/Pop singer, racking up a string of major hits like "I Fall to Pieces", "Walkin' After Midnight", "Crazy" and "She's Got You". "Imagine That" however was not as successful as its counterparts that were also minor hits for Cline. The song only reached to #21 on the Country charts and to #90 on the Pop charts, failing to gain big success. "Imagine That" was also never featured on her 1962 album either, called Sentimentally Yours. The song discusses how the singer is so devoted to her lover that nothing the lover may do will change that devotion.
"Imagine That" was featured on Sara Evans's album Three Chords and the Truth.

[[Perceptual paradox]]
CATEGORIES: Perception, Paradoxes

A perceptual paradox illustrates the failure of a theoretical prediction.  Theories of perception are supposed to help a researcher predict what will be perceived when senses are stimulated.
A theory usually comprises a mathematical model (formula),
rules for collecting physical measurements for input into the model,
and rules for collecting physical measurements to which model outputs should map.  When arbitrarily choosing valid input data, the model should reliably generate output data that is indistinguishable from that which is measured in the system being modeled.
Although each theory may be useful for some limited predictions,
theories of vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste are not typically
reliable for comprehensive modeling of perception based on sensory inputs.  A paradox illustrates where a theoretical prediction fails.
Sometimes, even in the absence of a predictive theory,
the characteristics of perception seem nonsensical.
This page lists some paradoxes and seemingly impossible properties of perception.  When an animal is not named in connection with the discussion, human perception should be assumed since
the majority of perceptual research data applies to humans.

[[Leaf angle distribution]]

CATEGORIES: Radiation, Plant morphology, Leaves

The Leaf Angle Distribution (or LAD) of a plant canopy refers to the mathematical description of the angular orientation of the leaves in the vegetation. Specifically, if each leaf is conceptually represented by a small flat plate, its orientation can be described with the zenith and the azimuth angles of the surface normal to that plate. If the leaf has a complex structure and is not flat, it may be necessary to approximate the actual leaf by a set of small plates, in which case there may be a number of leaf normals and associated angles. The LAD describes the statistical distribution of these angles.

The site is now the home of SkySong, Arizona State University's Scottsdale Center for New Technology and Innovation.
Los Arcos Mall opened in 1969 and was developed by Phoenix-based Westcor Partners.  The cross-shaped enclosed mall was anchored by Broadway Southwest on the east end, Sears on the south end, an entrance and a food court on the north end, and another entrance and a lower-level movie theatre on the west end.  The mall was one of the largest and most modern in the Phoenix metropolitan area for its first decade or so.  However, as newer and larger centers were built nearby, Los Arcos' drawing power began to fade.

Without Anesthesia (alternative English title: Rough Treatment) is the English-language title for the Polish film Bez znieczulenia, released in 1978, directed by Andrzej Wajda. It was entered in the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1918/year/1979.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Without Anesthesia |accessdate=2009-05-24|work=festival-cannes.com[/tpl]
According to the screenplay, Without Anesthesia takes place in the 1960s. Jerzy (Zbigniew Zapasiewicz), a well-known journalist and foreign correspondent who reports on wars, revolutions and guerrilla movements in the third world, is a man whose world is falling apart.
The main character is based on Ryszard Kapuściński, the prominent Polish journalist and author of the "reportage" school.Tomasz Łubieński, "Kapuściński's pupil?" Gazeta Wyborcza, 3 March 2010, p. 13 (in Polish) ("Ryszard Kapuściński was the original model for the main character of Andrzej Wajda's film Without Anesthesia.")
The film opens with Jerzy sitting in as a celebrity-guest on a mildly idiotic television talkshow, but when he returns home that evening, he finds that his wife has walked out on him, taking their daughter with her, to live with a younger man. On its surface, the film seems to be about Jerzy's attempts to win back his wife, Ewa (Ewa Dalkowska), and to come to some understanding about what went wrong with their marriage. But as is often the case with Polish films[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=April 2010[/tpl], what went wrong is inextricably bound up with politics.

"Leavin' On Your Mind" is a famous Country/Pop song written by Wayne Walker and Webb Pierce was popularized by Patsy Cline in 1963.
In 1963, Patsy Cline was at the height of her career. In the meantime, she was looking for her next single to release for the upcoming year. Wayne Walker and Webb Pierce wrote the song for her called "Leavin' On Your Mind". Cline released the song in January 1963 and it became a top ten Country hit for Cline. Unlike her earlier hits "Crazy" and "I Fall to Pieces", "Leavin' On Your Mind" was an unfortunate failure on the pop chart, where it stalled at #83. However, the song today remains a classic in Country music. Initially, Cline was going to release the single on her next upcoming, fourth album called Faded Love, along with two other singles that year.
However, the album was never released due to the tragic event that ended her life, which was a plane crash that March. The album was to be released at the end of March. Instead, the album was released on a double compilation album called The Patsy Cline Story. This album featured all of Cline's big hits, starting for her first in 1957 to 1963. The album was a huge hit and is still being sold today.

[[Szilassi polyhedron]]
CATEGORIES: Nonconvex polyhedra, Toroidal polyhedra

The Szilassi polyhedron is a nonconvex polyhedron, topologically a torus, with seven hexagonal faces.
Each face of this polyhedron shares an edge with each other face. As a result, it requires seven colours to colour each adjacent face, providing the lower bound for the  seven colour theorem.   It has an axis of 180-degree symmetry; three pairs of faces are congruent leaving one unpaired hexagon that has the same rotational symmetry as the polyhedron. The 14 vertices and 21 edges of the Szilassi polyhedron form an embedding of the Heawood graph onto the surface of a torus.
The tetrahedron and the Szilassi polyhedron are the only two known polyhedra in which each face shares an edge with each other face. If a polyhedron with f  faces is embedded onto a surface with h  holes, in such a way that each face shares an edge with each other face, it follows by some manipulation of the Euler characteristic that
This equation is satisfied for the tetrahedron with h = 0 and f = 4, and for the Szilassi polyhedron with h = 1 and f = 7. The next possible solution, h = 6 and f = 12, would correspond to a polyhedron with 44 vertices and 66 edges, but it is not known whether such a polyhedron exists. More generally this equation can be satisfied precisely when f  is congruent to 0, 3, 4, or 7 modulo 12.
The Szilassi polyhedron is named after Hungarian mathematician Lajos Szilassi, who discovered it in 1977. The dual to the Szilassi polyhedron, the Császár polyhedron, was discovered earlier by [tpl]harvs|first=Ákos|last=Császár|authorlink=Ákos Császár|year=1949|txt[/tpl]; it has seven vertices, 21 edges connecting every pair of vertices, and 14 triangular faces. Like the Szilassi polyhedron, the Császár polyhedron has the topology of a torus.

Four Crosses railway station was a station on the former Cambrian Railways between Oswestry and Welshpool. Opened in 1860 as part of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway (O&NR), it served the village of Four Crosses in Powys, Wales.
The O&NR line south of [tpl]rws|Llanymynech[/tpl] to [tpl]rws|Newtown (Powys)[/tpl] was single track, with passing loops at each intermediate station. Four Crosses was the main crossing point for passenger trains from [tpl]rws|Oswestry[/tpl] to Newtown, and so was re-configured by the Great Western Railway in 1925, when a private sidings was also laid to the nearby creamery, giving milk trains direct access. The GWR improved the up-platform, installed longer passing loops of [tpl]convert|1116|ft[/tpl] in length, and reconfigured the 1896 signal box to cope with additional traffic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cambrianrailways.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=46&start=290|title=Llanymynech sgnal box|publisher=CambrianRailways.com|accessdate=2012-02-10[/tpl]
In 1963, the former CR mainline was vested to the London Midland Region of British Railways, who decided to keep the parallel-route running former Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway open. The line from Welshpool to Oswestry was hence closed in 1965, including Four Crosses station.
The station was immortalised in 1964 in the song "Slow Train" by Flanders and Swann.

John Andrew Beazley (May 25, 1918 – April 21, 1990) was a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Braves.
As a rookie in 1942, Beazley went 21-6 with a 2.13 ERA for the Cardinals, as his 21 wins and ERA ranked him second in the National League behind teammate Mort Cooper (22 and 1.78). Beazley completed his feat pitching two complete-game wins in the team’s World Series victory over the New York Yankees in five games, allowing three runs in Game Two and two runs in Game Five for a combined 2.50 ERA.
After the season, Beazley enlisted in the U.S. Air Force during World War II. While serving, he was sent to pitch for an Army team and felt pain in his arm, but ordered by his commanding officer to pitch through the pain, Beazley severely hurt his arm. Coming out of the service in 1946, he tried in vain to regain his form but was never the same, winning only nine games for the rest of his career.  
In a six-season career, Beazley posted a 31-12 record with 147 strikeouts and a 3.01 ERA in 76 games, including three shutouts and 21 complete games in 374 innings pitched.
After leaving baseball, Beazley worked as a beer distributor. He died of cancer in Nashville at age 71.

"Faded Love" is a Western swing song written by Bob Wills, his father John Wills,San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. page 11. ISBN 0-252-00470-1 and his brother, Billy Jack Wills. The tune is considered to be an exemplar of the Western swing fiddle component of American fiddle.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]The melody came from an 1856 ballad, Darling Nelly Gray, which John Wills knew as a fiddle tune.Wolff, Country Music, p. 112: "It Love' originated with western swing pioneer Bob Wills, who grew up in the 1910s and 1920s fiddling in rural Texas with his father, John Wills. They wrote the melody together when Bob was very young; it wasn't until 1950 that the song gained lyrics, courtesy of Bob's younger brother, Billy Jack."McWhorter, Cowboy Fiddler, p. 61: "And he Rogers played a tune called 'Forsaken Lover.' It's note-for-note the same as 'Faded Love.' Bob took that old tune and slowed it down and put in that long Bob Wills bow, and it became 'Faded Love'." "Faded Love" is a sentimental song about lost love. The name comes from the refrain that follows each verse:
The song was a major hit for Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys (MGM K10786) reaching No.8 on the Country charts in 1950.Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits, p. 393: "Rusty McDonald and The Playboy Trio (vocals)". It became one of his signature songs.
Leon McAuliffe had two Top 40 hits with "Faded Love", both reaching No.22 (Cimarron 4057, 1962, and MGM 14249, 1971). The former was an instrumental version, and the latter rendition was a collaboration with Tompall & the Glaser Brothers.Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits, p. 218. Also in 1962, it was a modest hit for Jackie DeShannon, reaching No.97 on the Billboard Hot 100.
The song had even greater success when Patsy Cline covered the song in 1963. Her version became a hit, reaching No.7 on the U.S. Country charts and No.96 on the Billboard Hot 100.
Due to the aeroplane crash that ended Cline's life, her version was never released on a studio album. Instead, it was belatedly released on Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits, a compilation album in 1967. Cline's version was originally intended to be the title cut for a planned album and was made at what turned out to be the last recording session before her death.

[[Suslin representation]]

CATEGORIES: Set theory

In mathematics, a Suslin representation of a set of reals (more precisely, elements of Baire space) is a tree whose projection is that set of reals.  More generally, a subset A of κω is λ-Suslin if there is a tree T on κ × λ such that A = pT.
By a tree on κ × λ we mean here a subset T of the union of κi × λi for all i ∈ N (or i Here, p = { f | ∃g : (f,g) ∈  } is the projection of T'',
where  = { (f , g ) | ∀n ∈ ω : (f(n), g(n)) ∈ T } is the set of branches through T.
Since  is a closed set for the product topology on κω × λω (where κ and λ are equipped with the discrete topology) (and all closed sets in  κω × λω come in this way from some tree on κ × λ), λ-Suslin subsets of κω are projections of closed subsets in κω × λω.
When one talks of Suslin sets without specifying the space, then one usually means Suslin subsets of R, which descriptive set theorists usually take to be the set ωω.

[[Greek destroyer Aetos]]

CATEGORIES: Wild Beast-class destroyers (1912), World War II destroyers of Greece, 1912 ships

Aetos ([tpl]Lang-el|Α/Τ [tpl]lang|grc|Άετός[/tpl][/tpl], "Eagle") served in the Royal Hellenic Navy from 1912–1945.
The ship, along with her three sister ships of Wild Beast class destroyers Ierax, Panthir and Leon, was ordered from England.http://www.hellenicnavy.gr/aetos12_46_en.asp (2008) Hellenic Navy Official website.  They were purchased in 1912, ready for delivery, each for the sum of £148,000, from the English shipyards Cammell Laird in Birkenhead, when the Balkan Wars seemed likely. These ships had originally been ordered by Argentina; Aetos was originally named San Luis.  The four ships were sailing with a non-Greek crew to Algiers, to meet the requisitioned personnel transport ship Ionia which contained the Greek crews for the ships.  When Aetos entered the Mediterranean she went adrift due to a serious engine breakdown. By pure coincidence one of the other destroyers passed nearby and towed Aetos to Algiers.
During the Balkan Wars, the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition. Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship, and for this reason these ships were initially named 'scouts' rather than 'destroyers'. She was under the command of Commander A. Douroutis, RHN. 
During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente. Due to Greece's neutrality, the four Beast Class ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916, taken over by the French in November, and served in the French Navy from 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the Aegean Sea. 
Aetos participated in the evacuation of Greeks from Russia during the Russian Civil War in 1918 and saw action in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) in the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea. 
After the war, Aetos was extensively rebuilt by the J Samuel White yard from 1925–1927 and emerged as a much more modern unit.http://www.hellenicnavy.gr/aetos12_46_en.asp (2008) Hellenic Navy Official website.  Four Yarrow boilers replaced her five original units with 5 funnels reduced to two.  This allowed the bridge to be moved further aft reducing spray and allowed a deckhouse to be built forward of it for a super firing 4-inch gun.  One more gun between the funnels and one on the quarterdeck aft with two single Pom Pom's completed the gun armament.  Torpedo tubes were increased to 2 triple mounts and a Vickers director fire control as was fitted. 
Aetos participated in the Second World War. After surviving the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, Aetos served under the operational control of the Royal Navy based in the Indian Ocean, where despite her age she served with distinction.  Further modifications included new anti-aircraft guns, and anti-submarine weapons.  After the end of World War II, Aetos was stricken in 1945.

CATEGORIES: Executive ministers, 18th-century Indian people, History of Bengal, History of medieval India

Diwan Mohanlal (c. 1756 - 1757), was a Diwan of Siraj Ud Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal at Murshidabad. The Nawab made the decision of elevating a Hindu Kayastha bureaucrat named Mohanlal as his supreme Diwan[tpl]ref|mohanlal[/tpl]. The elevation of a Hindu to such a prominent position caused the Muslim nobility, and in particular Mir Jafar, great offense. Mir Jafar was then the head of the armed forces, second only to the Nawab, and the elevation of a Hindu to a post above him was taken almost as a personal insult.
On the day of the Battle of Plassey, Siraj-Ud-Daulah faced off against the British, apparently with overwhelming force, but at the critical time Mir Jafar's men stood watching passively while the soldiers of Siraj-Ud-Daula were decimated by the smaller but much better armed British forces.

The Green Cove Lions were an indoor football team intended to be based in Green Cove Springs, Florida.

The Green Cove Lions' registered agent was former National Football League player Cleveland Gary. The Lions evidently originated with the Jacksonville Stallions, a planned NIFL team that attempted to get a contract to play at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville in 2006. This never came through, but the team may have been related to the later Jacksonville Pelicans, another ephemeral NIFL team who listed their home address in the suburb of Green Cove Springs. The Pelicans evidently rebranded as the Green Cove Lions for the 2007 season and paid a deposit to use the Clay County Fairgrounds arena in Green Cove Springs as their home stadium. However, they apparently determined that the arena would not be suitable for indoor football. The team played two away games before withdrawing from the rest of their schedule, and folded before ever playing a home game.

"Hey Lover" is the Grammy Award winning first single released from LL Cool J's sixth album, Mr. Smith, featuring Boyz II Men. It was released on October 31, 1995 for Def Jam Recordings and was produced by The Trackmasters and LL Cool J. Hey Lover would prove to be the most successful single from the album, making it to #3 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs charts, as well as #17 on the UK Singles Chart. The song sampled Michael Jackson's "The Lady in My Life" from his 1982 album Thriller, thus Rod Temperton, the writer of that song, was given credit as a writer of this song. On the B-side was the "I Shot Ya" remix.
At the Grammy Awards of 1997, the song won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, becoming his second Grammy in that category after 1992's "Mama Said Knock You Out".
The video starred television and film actress Gillian Iliana Waters as LL Cool J's love interest in the music video.

[[Yungavolucris]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous birds, Euenantiornithes, Bird genera

[tpl]italic title[/tpl]

Yungavolucris is a genus of enantiornithine birds. It contains the single species Yungavolucris brevipedalis[ref]
Etymology: "Short-footed Yunga bird". Yungavolucris, after the Yungas region + Latin volucris, "bird" (literally "flyer"). brevipedalis, from Latin brevis, "short" + pedalis, from Latin pes, "foot".[/ref]
which lived in the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian, c.70.6 - 66 mya). The fossil bones were found in the Lecho Formation at estancia El Brete, Argentina.
Little is known about it because the only remains discovered so far are 6 tarsometatarsi, only one of which is nearly complete. This single foot bone, however, differs from all other birds in being very flat, and also very wide at the lower end. The specimens are small, just over 4 cm long, and if its legs and feet were not excessively shortened in relation to the body, the bird was about the size of a large blackbird in life.
Y. brevipedalis had short, wide, and dorsoplantarly flattened "legs" (actually ankles) with disproportionally broad and splayed "feet" (actually the front part of the feet only) which seem to have pointed markedly outwards (Chiappe 1993). This must have resulted in a somewhat Charlie Chaplin-like waddle if the bird walked on the ground. It was thus probably better adapted to swimming or even perching in trees than for running around in its richly vegetated shoreline habitat that was dotted by - possibly brackish - lakes and/or small rivers (Chiappe 1993).
Y. brevipedalis was an advanced enantiornithine and is sometimes[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] considered to be closely related to Avisaurus. This is quite unlikely however; it certainly lacks the backwards-projecting growth of the trochlea where the middle toe attaches that is typical for Avisauridae. Moreover, as opposed to the undisputed avisaurids which apparently all were fairly large carnivores, it was a much smaller animal and almost certainly did not hunt vertebrates.
Due to the peculiar autapomorphies of the present species' remains, the question of its affinities is hard to decide however. It seems somewhat closer to the avisaurids than Lectavis bretincola, another enantiornithine discovered in the same deposit (Chiappe 1993). On the other hand given that the Spanish Early Cretaceous (Barremian, 130-125 mya) enantiornithine Concornis lacustris appears closer to the avisaurids than either Yungavolucris or Lectavis (Sanz et al. 1995), a close relationship between the two El Brete taxa and Avisaurus seems highly unlikely.

Lawrence Armstrong (1664 – 6 December 1739) was a lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia and acted as a replacement for the governor, Richard Philipps, during his long absences from the colony. 
Armstrong was a military man and became lieutenant-colonel of Philipps’ Regiment (later the 40th Foot). He arrived in the New World in 1711 as a ship-wreck victim along with troops headed to take Quebec. He and a contingent of men were dispatched to strengthen Annapolis Royal, in Nova Scotia. The garrison was impoverished and Armstrong spent until the appointment of Richard Philipps as governor in 1717, trying to improve their situation. In 1725, he was appointed lieutenant-governor.
His period as lieutenant-governor was marked by many difficulties and attempts to improve the lot of the colony. There was a mistrust and dislike between Armstrong and the governor and ongoing problems with the governor's brother-in-law, Major Alexander Cosby, who had a great deal of influence in the colonies of Nova Scotia.
Lieutenant-governor Armstrong committed suicide at Annapolis Royal, N.S to end his stormy, and often frustrating, career.

Headlong (ISBN 0-8050-6285-8) is a novel by Michael Frayn, published in 1999.
The plot centres on the discovery of a long-lost painting from Pieter Bruegel's series The Months. The story is essentially a farce, but contains a large amount of scholarship about the painter.
Frayn distinguishes between the iconology and iconography of the paintings and suggests that rather than simply being a series of pastoral images they symbolise a Dutch populace undergoing great suffering as a result of Spanish rule.
The novel was shortlisted for the 1999 Booker Prize.

[[Gwennap Head]]

CATEGORIES: Headlands of Cornwall, Penwith

Gwennap Head ([tpl]lang-kw|Toll Pedn Pennwydh[/tpl], meaning holed head of Penwith) ([tpl]gbmapping|SW3621[/tpl]) is the most southerly headland on the south coast of the Penwith peninsula, Cornwall, United Kingdom. The South West Coast Path closely follows the entire coastline around the headland. Its intricate and varied granite cliffs include the famous Chair Ladder crag, making it a popular destination for recreational climbers of all abilities. The older and more correct name for the headland is Tol-Pedn-Penwith (locally "Tol-Pedn" for short) which comes from the Cornish for 'the holed headland of Penwith', referring to the awesome vertical blowhole from the clifftop to a sea cave. From 1888 the name was changed to Gwennap Head, perhaps named after a local family.Weatherhill C. (2007) Cornish Place Names and Language. Ammanford: Sigma Press.
The inshore waters around the headland are busy with shipping of all sizes. There is a Coastwatch station on the headland in the former coastguard building.
There are a pair of cone-shaped navigation markers on Gwennap Head, in line with the Runnelstone buoy. These are day markers warning vessels of the hazard of the Runnel Stone. The cone to the seaward side is painted red and the inland one is black and white. When at sea the black and white one should always be kept in sight in order to avoid the submerged rocks nearer the shore. If the black and white cone is completely obscured by the red cone then the vessel would be directly on top of the Runnel Stone. The black and white landmark was erected by the Corporation of Trinity House in 1821 - an event recorded on a plaque on the back of the marker.  These feature as "the Cones of Runnel" in Hammond Innes's thriller "The Trojan Horse".

Vagabond Ways is a rock album by Marianne Faithfull. This is her first album of original material since A Secret Life (1994). This work, produced by Daniel Lanois and Mark Howard, is a balladry-like extension of her then neo-cabaret persona, interpreting songs by herself and legendary songwriters of her generation, like Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, Leonard Cohen and the songwriting duo Elton John/Bernie Taupin.
Incarceration of a Flower Child was written by Roger Waters in 1968, and never recorded by Pink Floyd. The lyrics seem to be about the downfall of Syd Barrett, but Waters has never confirmed this.

The German newspaper Die Rote Fahne ("The Red Flag") was created on 9 November 1918 by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in Berlin, first as organ of the left wing revolutionary Spartakusbund. After the founding of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) on 1 January 1919, it became the central publication of the party, until 1933. Outlawed after the end of the Weimar Republic and the Reichstag fire in 1933, it was illegally distributed during the Nazi dictatorship by underground groups close to the Communist Party until 1942. 
Since the 1970s, a number of projects by different left-wing socialist groupings or small parties tried to publish Die Rote Fahne again. At present, at least two internet publications use the name, each claiming to be the successor of the historical newspaper.

The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a dietary pattern promoted by the U.S.-based National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (part of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services) to prevent and control hypertension. The DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods; includes meat, fish, poultry, nuts and beans; and is limited in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, red meat, and added fats. In addition to its effect on blood pressure, it is designed to be a well-balanced approach to eating for the general public. It is now recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as an ideal eating plan for all Americans.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
The DASH diet is based on NIH studies that examined three dietary plans and their results. None of the plans were vegetarian, but the DASH plan incorporated more fruits and vegetables, low fat or nonfat dairy, beans, and nuts than the others studied. The diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mm Hg in patients with high normal blood pressure, now called "pre-hypertension." Those with hypertension dropped by 11 and 6, respectively. These changes in blood pressure occurred with no changes in body weight. The DASH dietary pattern is adjusted based on daily caloric intake ranging from 1600 to 3100 dietary calories.[ref]

In 1079, Castelló d'Empúries became the capital of the Empúries county due to the previous capital, Sant Martí d'Empúries, being too easily sacked by pirates.  1325-1341 saw a period of large expansion of this capital town, which ultimately ceased being the capital once the county joined the Crown of Aragon and Catalonia in 1385.
The old town is somewhat dwarfed by the neighboring urbanisation of Empuriabrava, on the coastline of the Costa Brava.

The neutron magnetic moment is the magnetic moment of the neutron. It is of particular interest, as magnetic moments are created by the movement of electric charges. Since the neutron is a neutral particle, the magnetic moment is an indication of substructure. For a time, the neutron was thought to be made of a proton, with a charge of +1 e and an electron, with a charge of −1 e, whose charge would cancel out. However, since the advent of the quark model, it is now known that the neutron is made of one up quark (charge of +2/3 e) and two down quarks (charge of −1/3 e).

The ongoing controversy involves several Reformed denominations including the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC), the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), the United Reformed Churches in North America (URCNA), and the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States (RPCUS), and the Protestant Reformed Churches in America (PRCA).

[[State Plane Coordinate System]]

CATEGORIES: Cartography, Geographic coordinate systems, Land surveying of the United States

The State Plane Coordinate System (SPS or SPCS) is a set of 124 geographic zones or coordinate systems designed for specific regions of the United States.  Each state contains one or more state plane zones, the boundaries of which usually follow county lines.  There are 110 zones in the continental US, with 10 more in Alaska, 5 in Hawaii, and one for Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands. The system is widely used for geographic data by state and local governments.  Its popularity is due to at least two factors.  First, it uses a simple Cartesian coordinate system to specify locations rather than a more complex spherical coordinate system (the geographic coordinate system of latitude and longitude).  By thus ignoring the curvature of the Earth, "plane surveying" methods can be used, speeding up and simplifying calculations.  Second, the system is highly accurate within each zone (error less than 1:10,000).  Outside a specific state plane zone accuracy rapidly declines, thus the system is not useful for regional or national mapping.
Most state plane zones are based on either a transverse Mercator projection or a Lambert conformal conic projection.  The choice between the two map projections is based on the shape of the state and its zones.  States that are long in the east-west direction are typically divided into zones that are also long east-west.  These zones use the Lambert conformal conic projection, because it is good at maintaining accuracy along an east-west axis (explain why, reference needed).  Zones that are long in the north-south direction use the Transverse Mercator projection because it is better at maintaining accuracy along a north-south axis (explain why, reference needed).  The panhandle of Alaska, whose maximum dimension is on a diagonal, uses an Oblique Mercator projection, which minimizes the combined error in the X and Y directions.

Sverd i fjell ([tpl]lang-en|Swords in Mountain[/tpl]) is a commemorative monument located at the  Hafrsfjord fjord, just outside the city of Stavanger in Norway.
The monument was created by sculptor Fritz Røed from Bryne and was unveiled by king Olav V of Norway in 1983. The three swords stand 10 metres tall and are planted into the rock of a small hill next to the fjord. They commemorate the historic Battle of Hafrsfjord that took place there in the year 872, when King Harald Fairhair gathered all of Norway under one crown.
The largest sword represents the victorious Harald, and the two smaller swords represent the defeated petty kings. The monument also represents peace, since the swords are planted into solid rock, whence they may never be removed.

John Parr Snyder (12 April 1926–28 April 1997) was an American cartographer most known for his work on map projections for the United States Geological Survey (USGS).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/state/darm/links/guides/psnyd001.html |title=NJDARM: Collection Guide |publisher=State.nj.us |date= |accessdate=2012-03-03[/tpl] Educated at Purdue and MIT as a chemical engineer, he had a lifetime interest in map projections as a hobby, but found the calculations tedious without the benefit of expensive calculators or computers. At a cartography conference in 1976, he learned of the need for a map projection that would suit the special needs of satellite imagery. He had recently been able to purchase a pocket calculator (TI-59) of his own and set to work creating what became known as the space-oblique mercator projection, which he provided to the USGS at no charge.
He was subsequently offered a job within the USGS within two years, where his work apparently led him to the eventual publication of the definitive technical guide to map projections entitled Map Projections: A Working Manual among other works. He also authored Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections which details the historical development of hundreds of map projections. Snyder developed at least one other projection, called GS50, which uses a complex polynomial to project the 50 U.S. states with minimal distortion. He taught courses on map projection at George Mason University.  He was president of the American Cartographic Association from 1990–1991 and also served as a secretary to the Washington Map Society.
John Snyder died April 28, 1997.

Homer Hill Norton (December 30, 1896 – May 26, 1965) was an American football, basketball, and baseball player and coach.  He served as the head football coach at Centenary College of Louisiana from 1919 to 1921 and 1926 to 1933 and at Texas A&M University from 1934 to 1947, compiling a career college football record of 143–75–18.  His 
1939 Texas A&M team went 11–0, beating Tulane in the Sugar Bowl, and was named a national champion.  Norton's record at Texas A&M was 82–53–9, giving him the second most wins of any coach in Texas A&M Aggies football history.  He was fired in 1947 when his team went 3–6–1 and lost to Texas for the eighth straight year.  Norton was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1971.

Ramkhamhaeng University ([tpl]lang-th|มหาวิทยาลัยรามคำแหง[/tpl]) is one of two open universities in Thailand. The university was named in honour of King Ramkhamhaeng the Great of Sukhothai, who traditionally is credited for creating the Thai alphabet.
Before the establishment of Ramkhamhaeng University in 1971, Thailand had what has been described as "a crisis in the quest for higher education", since the number of high school graduates seeking competitive place in the government universities far outnumbered the capacity of all universities combined. Parliament finally passed a law authorizing the establishment of Ramkhamhaeng University, the kingdom's first open-admission university.
The university is composed of the Faculties of Law, Business Administration, Humanities, Education, Science, Political Science, Economics, Engineering, and Education Technology. The Faculty of Engineering admits a limited number of students, while other faculties are open to anyone who wishes to enroll.
Ramkhamhaeng University has two major campuses, both located in Bangkok. Freshman classes are held at Bang Na campus in Phra Khanong District. Most others classes are conducted at the main campus at Hua Mak, Bang Kapi District.

Kintarō Ōki (Japanese: 大木金太郎, Korean: 김일, Hanja: 金一, February 24, 1929 Jeollanam-do, South Korea (then just Korea) – October 26, 2006 Seoul, South Korea) was arguably the greatest South Korean professional wrestler of all time[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl], also known professionally as Kim Il or KIM Il during his career in the Japan Wrestling Association, All Japan Pro Wrestling and International Pro Wrestling from the 1950s to the 1980s.
Ohki had hopes of becoming a student of Japanese wrestling legend Rikidōzan, another Korean, and entered Japan illegally in 1958 to do so, but was arrested in 1959.  After being released he was able to train with Rikidōzan and joined the Japan Wrestling Association, debuting in November 1959 under his real name. On September 30, 1960, Ohki defeated fellow rookie Kanji Inoki, later Antonio Inoki, who was making his debut along with Shohei Baba, later Giant Baba.  Ohki, Baba and Inoki were considered a part of a rookie trio groomed to become the eventual successors to Rikidōzan himself.  Ohki was also trained by Mr. Moto and Yoshinosatohttp://www.puroresu.com/wrestlers/kim_il/.
With Rikidōzan's murder in 1963 Ohki returned to his homeland to raise the profile of professional wrestling there, but returned to the JWA when Toyonobori and Inoki left the promotion, though he returned the next year.  Also in 1967 Ohki became the top star in Korea with his defeat of Mark Lewin to win the World Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Championship.  With this the JWA wanted to rename him to Rikidōzan but the plan never went through.http://www.puroresu.com/wrestlers/kim_il/
Inoki and Baba famously left the JWA in 1972 to found the All Japan and New Japan promotions in 1972, letting Ohki become the JWA's top star, winning the NWA International Heavyweight Championship.
In April 1973 the JWA closed and was absorbed into All Japan, and though he competed for the new organization for a time he wrestled mostly as a freelancer in Japan and a main event star in South Korea, famously wrestling against his former fellow rookies Inoki and Baba in 1974 and 1975.  He defended the NWA International title in IPW and South Korea until ordered by the NWA to vacate it in 1981.http://www.puroresu.com/wrestlers/kim_il/
Since then Ohki did not compete much, with his official retirement card on April 2, 1996 held at a weekly pro-wrestling magazine sponsored show at the Tokyo Dome in Japan.  Wrestling legend Lou Thesz assisted the wheelchair-bound Ohki at this, his last public appearance in Japan.
During his career Ohki also held the Far East Heavyweight title, All Asia Heavyweight and Tag Team title four times each, NWA Texas Tag Team title and NWA International Tag Team title, also four times.http://www.puroresu.com/wrestlers/kim_il/
Ohki died in the Eulji General Hospital in Seoul on October 26, 2006 of a heart attack brought on by renal insufficiency and kidney failure.

[[Austin Powers (film series)]]
CATEGORIES: Austin Powers, Film series, Comedy films by series

The ''Austin Powers'' series is a series of three American action-comedy films – Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997), Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) – directed by Jay Roach, produced, written by and starring Mike Myers as both the title character and the main antagonist Dr. Evil, and distributed by New Line Cinema. The franchise parodies numerous James Bond, Derek Flint, Jason King, and Matt Helm films, characters, and incorporates a myriad of other elements of popular culture as it follows a British spy's quest to bring his nemesis to justice.
The films poke fun at the outrageous plots, rampant sexual innuendo, and one-dimensional stock characters characteristically associated with 1960s spy films, as well as the cliché of the ultra-suave male super spy. Contrary to the handsome, super-smooth leading men of the James Bond genre, Austin Powers is not conventionally attractive (he is especially known for his bad teeth), although female characters in the films seem to find him irresistible.
The general theme of the films is that the arch-villain Dr. Evil plots to extort large sums of money from governments or international bodies but is constantly thwarted by Powers, and (to a degree) his own inexperience with life and culture in the 1990s. In the first film, Austin and Dr. Evil are awakened after being cryogenically frozen for 30 years. Continuing to incorporate cultural elements of the 1960s and 1970s, the second and third films feature time travel as a plot device and deliberately overlook inconsistencies.

[[Open Circle Theater]]

CATEGORIES: Theatre companies in Washington (state), Culture of Seattle, Washington

Open Circle Theater was a multi-disciplinary performance company in Seattle, Washington.
It was committed to the development of new works and adaptations that spoke to the human condition through fantasy and mythic storytelling. Founded in the early 90’s, the theater established its reputation for unique theater at a small black-box space in a warehouse in the Lake Union/Cascade neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.  Throughout their seasons, Open Circle's resident company united with local directors, musicians, visual artists and performers, to bring fresh insight and invention to their creations of highly physical, ensemble-style theater. One of their popular events was the annual adaptation and production of the works of H. P. Lovecraft for the stage, which reflected their experiments with new and adapted work.
In 2008, due to development in the South Lake Union area where the new campus of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center was set be constructed, the building Open Circle Theater had called home for ten years was torn down.  After a year being itinerant, the company relocated to a space on the second floor of a building in the thriving neighborhood of Belltown, Seattle very close to downtown.  The space opened in October, 2008 with their all new adaptation based on H.P. Lovecraft's works called The Necronomicon.  The company shared the floor with the theater school Freehold.
Despite recent artistic and business management changes and a string of successful shows, the company was unable to maintain financial viability and officially closed in October 2011.

Myrmecophily ([tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɜr|m|ɨ|ˈ|k|ɒ|f|ɨ|l|i[/tpl];[tpl]USdict|mûr′·mĭ·kŏf′·ə·lē[/tpl] literally "ant-love") is the term applied to positive interspecies associations between ants and a variety of other organisms such as plants, arthropods, and fungi. Myrmecophily refers to mutualistic associations with ants, though in its more general use the term may also refer to commensal or even parasitic interactions. 
The term myrmecophile, is used mainly for animals that associate with ants. There are an estimated 10,000 species of ants (Formicidae), with a higher diversity in the tropics.B. Holldobler and E.O. Wilson, The Ants, Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1990. In most terrestrial ecosystems ants are ecologically and numerically dominant, being the main invertebrate predators. As a result, ants play a key role in controlling arthropod richness, abundance, and community structure.K. Fiedler, B. Holldobler, and P. Seufert, "Butterflies and ants: The communicative domain," Cellular and molecular life sciences, vol. 52, 1996, pp. 14-24. There is evidence that the evolution of myrmecophilous interactions has contributed to the abundance and ecological success of ants,B. Holldobler and E.O. Wilson, Journey to the Ants,  Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1994. by ensuring a dependable and energy-rich food supply and thus providing a competitive advantage for ants over other invertebrate predators.N. Bluthgen, N.E. Stork, and K. Fiedler, "Bottom-up control and co-occurrence in complex communities: honeydew and nectar determine a rainforest ant mosaic," Oikos,  vol. 106, 2004, pp. 344-358. Most myrmecophilous associations are opportunistic, unspecialized, and facultative (meaning both species are capable of surviving without the interaction), though obligate mutualisms (those in which one or both species are dependent on the interaction for survival) have also been observed for many species.B. Stadler and T. Dixon, Mutualism: Ants and their insect partners,  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008.

Originally it was constructed between 1938-1941 as part of a planned North-South S-Bahn network in Munich, which was abandoned due to the war effort.  For this reason, the platform is 135 meters long, significantly longer than that of any other U-Bahn station (usually about 120 meters). It marked the terminus of the first U-Bahn line, opened on 19 October 1971.http://world.nycsubway.org/world/de/munich-u6.html
It is also noted as being one of the stations on Munich's U-Bahn network that pipes in classical music.

The Temagami region is known as n'Daki Menan, the homeland of the area's Aboriginal community, most of whom are Anishnaabe (Ojibwe), living on Bear Island.  The official name for this group is the Temagami First Nation.  However, a larger group that includes these people, plus non-status residents and some non-residents is called the Teme-Augama Anishnabai.
Some of the main tourist attractions within the community include old-growth red and white pine, Lake Temagami, Caribou Mountain, fishing, showings of Grey Owl from the 1930s, and over 4,000 km of canoe routes.
It is also known as the staging point for cottage vacationing and wilderness canoeing trips on Lake Temagami, in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park, and vast tracts of wilderness in the area. There are several outfitters here that cater to outdoor activity, including Smoothwater Outfitters and Ecolodge.
The community is home to the Finlayson Point Provincial Park, which itself offers access to Lake Temagami. An excellent view of the entire Temagami area is offered by the Temagami Fire Tower on Caribou Mountain, a renovated [tpl]convert|100|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl]-tall fire lookout tower that visitors can climb for a small fee. The Temagami Fire Tower was last used in the 1970s to spot fires. The original fire tower built here was [tpl]convert|45|ft|m[/tpl] high and made of square timber.
The Municipality of Temagami also includes the communities of Lake Temagami, Marten River, and Temagami North.

CATEGORIES: Natural parks of Catalonia, Ramsar sites in Spain, Protected areas established in 1983

The Parc Natural dels Aiguamolls de l'Empordà is a natural park in Catalonia, Spain. It forms part of the Bay of Roses and, like the Ebro Delta, was a malarial swampland. The marshland lies between the Rivers Fluvià and Muga.  It is the second largest wetland in Catalonia at over 4800 hectares and was established in 1983.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empordaturisme.com/en/Associats/Natural_Parks-188/PARC_NATURAL_DELS_AIGUAMOLLS_DE_LEMPORDA-30.htm|title=Aiguamolls de l'Empordà|publisher=Empordaturisme.com|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last1=Cisneros|first1=Blanca Elena Jiménez|last2=Jiménez|first2=Blanca|last3=Asano|first3=Takashi|title=Water Reuse: An International Survey of Current Practice, Issues and Needs|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zYcTnBmZeIcC&pg=PA508|accessdate=21 December 2012|date=30 May 2008|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=978-1-84339-089-3|page=508[/tpl]
During the 19th century much of the marsh was drained as canals were created and the land converted to agriculture. However virgin marsh and dunes remained and was given Natural Park status in the 1980s after a campaign to save the area from development.
The park is home to 327 different species. Great Spotted Cuckoo, Spoonbill, Nightingale, Collared Pratincole and Stone-curlew are among its many birds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.catalanbirdtours.com/Spain%20birding/AE%20bird%20watching%20holiday.html|title=Aiguamolls de l'Empordà|publisher=Catalan Bird Tours|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl] The park offers seven hides and one tower for bird watchers.

[[Playtoy Industries]]
CATEGORIES: Toy companies of Canada, Defunct manufacturing companies of Canada

Playtoy Industries was a Canada-based toy company created in 1985 in Toronto, Ontario, by Donald Griffin. In 1997, it moved to Concord, Ontario. They were in bankruptcy in 2001.
The company distributed a range of games in Canada for the Sega Genesis.  Playtoy both developed its own games, and licenced from other.  Most often they licenced from Pressman Toy Corporation.  Playtoy Industries would then translate the product into French in order to ship a bilingual product.  Playtoy also licenced to Pressman Toy Corporation as in the case of IQ2000.
Games were manufactured both locally at their combined offices/factory and overseas.  The most notable exceptions were hoolahoops and some other plastic products which were assembled by ARC Industries (a sheltered workshop for adults with a developmental disability).
They also manufactured games based on game shows from TQS, CBC Television and some other Canadian channels, and were Johnson &  Johnson's infant toys distributor in Canada (and responsible for the French translation).
Playtoy's mass manufactured Co-Operative Game line was licensed from Jim Deacove (Family Pastimes), who continued to manufacture the same games in small batches.  Thus the same games, with same titles, were sold in two very different forms at the same time.

[[Northeastern Ontario]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of Northern Ontario

Northeastern Ontario is the region within the Canadian province of Ontario which lies north and east of Lakes Superior and Huron.
Northeastern Ontario consists of the districts of Algoma, Sudbury, Cochrane, Timiskaming, Nipissing and Manitoulin; and the single-tier municipality of Greater Sudbury.
For some purposes, Parry Sound District and Muskoka District Municipality are treated as part of Northeastern Ontario even though they are geographically in Central Ontario. These two divisions are coloured in green on the map.
Northeastern Ontario and Northwestern Ontario may also be grouped together as Northern Ontario. An important difference between the two sub-regions is that Northeastern Ontario has a sizeable Franco-Ontarian population — approximately 25 per cent of the region's population speaks French as a first language, compared to just 3.2 per cent in the northwest.

[[Cameo (album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1973 albums, ABC Records albums, Dusty Springfield albums

Cameo is the eighth studio album released by singer Dusty Springfield. Cameo is her first LP for the ABC Dunhill Records label. It was recorded in the States between July and October 1972 and released in the UK (by Philips Records) in May 1973, having appeared in the States some three months earlier. Cameo was produced by Steve Barri, Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter who later went on to write and produce major hits for among others Glen Campbell, The Four Tops and The Tavares. The album also included material written by Alan O'Day, David Gates, Nickolas Ashford, Valerie Simpson and Van Morrison and among the all-star line up of musicians contributing were Hal Blaine, Paul Humphrey, Larry Carlton, Wilton Felder, Carol Kaye, Victor Feldman, Michael Omartian, Venetta Fields and Clydie King.
While Cameo was only a moderate critical success and a commercial failure in 1973 – charting neither in the UK nor the US – it has since been re-evaluated by both fans and music critics alike and is now often cited as one of the highlights of Springfield's recording career alongside 1969's Dusty in Memphis. A planned second album on the ABC Dunhill label with the working title of Elements (eventually re-titled Longing), was started, but never finished, due to Springfield's personal problems at the time. Most of the uncompleted album Longing can also be found on the Hip-O Records compilation Beautiful Soul, released in the United States in 2001.
Cameo was digitally remastered and released on CD for the first time in Europe by Mercury/Universal Music in 2002, though not containing any bonus tracks. Due to its relative obscurity upon the LP's initial release in 1973, Cameo is considered to be one of the rarer titles of Springfield's official catalogue/discography, and hard to find on any format, though its increased popularity in recent years due to the CD release and digital music file sharing has alleviated that difficulty to a good degree.

The league consisted of Yangon-based football clubs, made up mostly of clubs run by various government ministries plus a few private football clubs. Founded in 1996, the league was an attempt to reform the Burma First Division football, which consisted of all government ministry run football clubs, by allowing private football clubs. Nonetheless, the Yangon-based league never gained traction with Burmese fans, and has been replaced by the Myanmar National League, the country's first ever professional league since March 2009.

[[Bradshaw model]]

CATEGORIES: Topography

The Bradshaw Model is  a geographical model which describes how a river's characteristics vary between the upper course and lower course of a river. It shows that discharge, occupied channel width, channel depth and average load quantity increases downstream. Load particle size, channel bed roughness and gradient are all characteristics that decrease; it is represented by triangles, of different sizes according to their quantity, facing either towards or away from the mouth or the source of the river downstream. Generally it shows the characteristics we expect to see in a river but due to the nature of rivers and the ever changing environment in which we live not all rivers fit the model perfectly therefore the model is usually used in order to compare natural rivers to concepts laid down by the model. earthstudies.co.uk

[[Baghdad Arabic]]

CATEGORIES: Arabic languages, Fertile Crescent, Languages of Iraq

Baghdad Arabic or the Baghdadi Arabic is the Arabic dialect spoken in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. During the last century, Baghdad Arabic has become the lingua franca of Iraq, and the language of commerce and education.  It is a subvariety of Mesopotamian Arabic.
An interesting sociolinguistic feature of Baghdad is the existence of three distinct dialects: Muslim, Jewish and Christian Baghdadi Arabic. Muslim Baghdadi belongs to a group called gilit dialects, while Jewish Baghdadi (as well as Christian Baghdadi) belongs to qeltu dialects.
Baghdadi gilit Arabic, which is considered the standard Baghdadi Arabic, shares many features with Gulf Arabic and with varieties spoken in some parts of eastern Syria. Gilit Arabic is of Bedouin provenance, unlike Christian and Jewish Baghdadi, which is believed to be descendant of Medieval Iraqi Arabic. Until the 1950s Baghdad Arabic contained a large inventory of borrowings from English, Turkish, Persian or Kurdish language.
During the first decades of the 20th century, when the population of Baghdad was less than a million, some inner city quarters had their own distinctive speech characteristics, maintained for generations. From about the 1960s, with the population movement within the city, and the influx of large numbers of people hailing mainly from the south, Baghdad Arabic has become more standardized, and has come to incorporate some rural and Bedouin features and Modern Standard Arabic.
Distinct features of Muslim Baghdadi Arabic is the use of 'ani' as opposed to the fusha 'ana' meaning 'I am'. Also, they add 'ich' when directing females; 'ani gilitlich' meaning 'I told you' whereas maslawis would say: 'ana qeltolki'.

West Bank Premier League is one of the two top divisions of the Palestinian Football Federation (PFA). The other is the Gaza Strip League. Palestinian clubs have a rich history stretching back to the early 1930s, but most teams folded due to the political turmoil that ensued. The league has existed in the West Bank since 1977 but due to the difficulties associated with the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and internal feuding within the Palestinian Football Federation only seven seasons have been played in their entirety. Over the years, the format of the league has taken many different shapes. The league has been uninterrupted since 2008.
The 2010–11 season marked the creation of the first professional league in the territories and saw high profile signings for many clubs. Most notably Fadi Lafi (Hilal Al-Quds), Hernán Madrid (Wadi Al-Nes), and many Arab-Israelis who played for teams in the second and third tier of Israeli football.
The original format of the WBPL consisted of 12 teams playing each other twice over 22 matchdays, the bottom two clubs are relegated to the second division and the team with the most points are crowned champions.http://www.kooora.com/default.aspx?c=4943 Markaz Shabab Al-Am'ari won the inaugural season beating out Hilal Al-Quds on goal differential.
The 2011–12 included only 10 teams but the PFA have announced that four teams will be promoted from the First Division returning the league to its traditional 12-team format. The PFA also altered the rules on player eligibility banning the use of foreign players but letting teams have an unlimited amount of Arab Israeli citizens in their squads.

Jeff Browaty is a city councillor in Winnipeg, Manitoba.[tpl]cite news|last=Crocker|first=Ryan|title=Browaty stands tall against opposition in North Kildonan|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/our-communities/herald/Browaty-stands-tall-against-opposition-in-North-Kildonan-105927544.html|accessdate=17 November 2010|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|date=27 October 2010[/tpl]  He was elected in the North Kildonan ward on October 25, 2006 defeating eleven-year incumbent Mark Lubosch. Jeff is currently Chair of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure Renewal & Public Works and represents the City on several other committees.
Before engaging in professional politics Browaty worked at the family owned and operated Dennis T. Browaty & Associates a commercial real estate appraisal and consulting company.  He had previously completed a Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Manitoba's I.H. Asper School of Business. 
Browaty began his professional political career as a staffer to Manitoba PC Leader Stuart Murray and then to local Member of Parliament Joy Smith. On October 25, 2006, Jeff Browaty, defeated incumbent Mark Lubosch.  Browaty received 6,820 votes (52%) to Mark Lubosch's 4,563 (35%). Candidate James Viehweg placed third with 1,712 votes (13%). Public outcry over speedbumps and the McIvor street closure that limited access to Lagimodière Boulevard as well as the sluggish progress towards the extension of the Chief Peguis Trail (to Lagimodiere Boulevard) were the issues that Browaty appeared to capitalize on. The race was interesting as none of the candidates were endorsed by political parties, unions, the Mayor or other interest groups and it was the only ward which featured a true battle amongst independents.
At 29, Browaty was youngest councillor elected in 2006. He has become known for using technology as a means of staying in touch with voters by, amongst other things, building one of the largest Facebook group of any politician in Manitoba.

Natural ventilation is the process of supplying and removing air through an indoor space without using mechanical systems.  It refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of pressure or temperature differences. There are two types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings: wind driven ventilation and buoyancy-driven ventilation. While wind is the main mechanism of wind driven ventilation, buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1146/annurev.fluid.31.1.201[/tpl]

Tom Craft (born November 12, 1953) is the head football coach at Riverside Community College in Riverside, CA, and was the head football coach at San Diego State University (SDSU) from 2002-2005 and at Palomar College in San Marcos, CA from 1983-2000. Craft has also been the associate head coach and offensive coordinator at Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, CA.
Under his tenure, SDSU developed a reputation of playing the tough teams well but lacked consistency and never had a winning season. In 2004, SDSU lost to Michigan 24-21, and in 2005, where it pushed Ohio State at home, and lost 24-21 to Texas Christian University. SDSU fired Craft at the end of the 2005 season.[tpl]cite news | title=SDSU fires Craft: Athletic director says program needs more energy, confidence | first=Mick | last=McGrane | publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=December 6, 2005 | accessdate=2012-11-13 | url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051206/news_1s6azfoot.html[/tpl]
Craft is a graduate of Pacific Grove High School, in Pacific Grove, California, and thereafter played quarterback at SDSU.
Craft is considered by many[tpl]who|date=January 2013[/tpl] to be the greatest Junior College football coach for building a quarterback dynasty at this level. As head coach at Palomar College, Craft's stint can only be referred to as an "era." After serving as an assistant coach at the school from 1977 to 1982 and with the school openly questioning its commitment to football, he took over head coaching duties in 1983. After a pair of 4-6 seasons, the Comets' fortunes began to improve. By the time Craft left the San Marcos school for the Aztec coordinator's job, Palomar was coming off a three-year stretch of 31-2, had an offense ranked among the nation's top five for five consecutive years and was sporting two national championships. Craft compiled an overall record of 115-56 and three national Junior College football championships at Palomar.
While at Palomar, Craft taught and coached 7 All-American Quarterbacks, which include: Duffy Daughtery, Scott Barrick, Brett Salisbury, Andy Loveland, Tom Luginbill, Greg Cicero, and Andy Goodenough. No other Junior College coach in history has produced so many All-Americans.

Jion (1351–1409) was a famed monk during the Sengoku period (15th century) of Japan. Jion had been the founder of the Nen ryu fighting style, in which it was famed through the simple saying "Strike with the left arm extended". Throughout Jion's life, he had thoroughly trained fourteen disciples; Tsutsumi Hozan had been the 12th, in which he was thoroughly trained with the jitte fighting style. Tsutsumi Hozan once ripped off another desciples' jaw. Jion would see him never again. Jion had been rather strict into who would be transimitted of his teachings. Jion had assigned the system so that only one disciple could attain it within each specific fief. This was to make sure that Jion's influence would greatly spread between regions. Thus, in the end, Jion's fourteen disciples effectively developed and transmitted Jion's art throughout fourteen different regions. Due to this, many famed swordsmen such as Kamiizumi Nobutsuna and Yagyu Muneyoshi would be descended through Jion's teachings. It is known that Miyamoto Musashi himself had also somewhat followed some principles laid down from the monk Jion.

CATEGORIES: Squares in Bucharest, Historic monuments in Bucharest

Piața Unirii ([tpl]IPA-ro|ˈpjat͡sa uˈnirij[/tpl]; Unification Square or Union Square in English) is one of the largest squares in central Bucharest, located in the center of the city where Sectors 1, 2, 3, and 4 meet. It is bisected by Unirii Boulevard, originally built during the Communist era as the Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, and renamed after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. 
The square is a significant transport hub, containing the Piața Unirii metro station and a major interchange for RATB buses; there is also a tram terminal near the southwest corner. The Unirea Shopping Center the Cocor department store and a large taxi rank are located on the east side of this square, while Hanul lui Manuc is on the north side, near the northeast corner. The centre of the square boasts a small park and fountains which are particularly popular with commuters and passers-by  in the torrid summer months. There were plans to build the Romanian National Salvation Cathedral on the place of this park, but the idea proved technically impossible due to the busy underground environment and lack of popularity among local citizens and therefore the location was changed.

Ukrainian territory was fought over by various factions after the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the First World War, which added the collapse of Austria-Hungary to that of the Imperial Russia. The crumbling of the empires had a great effect on the Ukrainian nationalist movement and in the short period of four years a number of Ukrainian governments sprung up. This period was characterized by optimism and nation-building, as well as chaos and civil war. It ended in 1921, with the territory of modern-day Ukraine divided between Soviet Ukraine (which would become a constituent republic of the Soviet Union) and Poland, with small regions belonging to Czechoslovakia and Romania.

[tpl]nihongo|Tsutsumi Hōzan|堤宝山[/tpl], also known as [tpl]nihongo|Tsutsumi Yamashiro no kami Hōzan|堤山城守宝山[/tpl], was a swordsman during the Sengoku period (15th century) of Japan, who founded Hōzan ryū (Tsutsumi Hōzan Ryū).
Tsutaumi Hōzan was the twelfth disciple of the famed monk Jion.  Jion had fourteen disciples, each in a separate region of Japan to spread his art, Nen ryū, across the country.  Hōzan was said to have been an adept at fighting with the jitte, even at a young age.  Hōzan was also proficient at the art of jujutsu, which was a significant part of his Hōzan-ryū.  Although his teacher, Jion, died before Hōzan had learned all of Nen ryū's basics ("techniques of the past"), he is said to have mastered its teaching ("techniques of the future") due to his ability with the jitte, which is simpler to wield then a sword, as the jitte is a single handed weapon.
It is believed that Hōzan, or one of his disciples had transmitted the art of the jitte to Hirata Shokan, Miyamoto Musashi's grandfather.  It is for this reason the Miyamoto family taught the art of the jitte for many generations.  Musashi himself is said to have learned Jion's Nen ryū through Hōzan's jitte, which would have greatly influenced the single-handed method of Musashi's Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū.

The running of all internal combustion engines is dependent on the ignition quality of the fuel. For spark-ignition engines the fuel has an octane rating. For diesel engines it depends on the type of fuel, for distillate fuels the cetane numbers are used. Cetane numbers are tested using a special test engine and the existing engine was not made for residual fuels. For residual fuel oil two other empirical indexes are used: CCAI and Calculated Ignition Index (CII). Both CCAI and CII are calculated from the density and kinematic viscosity of the fuel.

Pyrocollodion is a smokeless powder invented by Dmitri Mendeleev. Mendeleev discovered it in 1892 and proposed to use it to replace gunpowder in the Russian Navy. This offer was rejected because of cost and efficiency. Pyrocollodion is known to be spontaneously combustible, and explosive. When ignited, it will burn/explode quickly, and with excessive heat output. If ignited in a tight, contained space, it will leave little to no remnants, such as unburned powder, particular kinds of flame scarring, or smoke of any kind. Pyrocollodion is a variant of nitrocellulose.  The natural ingredients found in Pyrocollodion can now be used in the production of cocaine and cigarettes.

[[Star diagonal]]

CATEGORIES: Optical devices

A star diagonal is an angled mirror or prism used in telescopes that allows viewing from a direction that is perpendicular to the usual eyepiece axis. It allows more convenient and comfortable viewing when the telescope is pointed at, or near the zenith (i.e. directly overhead).  Also, the resulting image is right side up, but is reversed from left to right. Star diagonals are available in 1.25" and 2" diameters. The 2" diagonals allow larger longer focal length low power 2 inch barrel eyepieces for a greater field of view. Star diagonals come in all price ranges, from as low as thirty dollars up to hundreds of dollars. However, even an expensive star diagonal will deliver poor performance if it is not in alignment with the optical axis of the telescope. A telescope in perfect collimation will be thrown out of collimation by a misaligned star diagonal and often this misalignment will determine the image quality of the telescope to a larger extent than the surface accuracy of the prism or mirror. Since the mirror or prism of the star diagonal is located nearly at the focal plane of the instrument, surface accuracy of greater that 1/4 wave is more in the line of advertising than any increase in optical performance. A 1/10  wave mirror or prism star diagonal that throws off the collimation of the telescope will perform worse than a 1/2 wave star diagonal that is in proper alignment.

Newlands Cross is a well-known crossroads in south-west Dublin in the county of South Dublin. It is the point where the N7 National Route to the South West and Mid West crosses an orbital local route, the R113. For many years this area roughly marked the place where Dublin City ended and the "country" began, though it is now inside the urban area.  
The R113 (in the form of the Belgard Road dual-carriageway) joins Newlands to Tallaght in the South and to the Fonthill Road in Clondalkin village to the North; the cross itself is located at the southern end of Clondalkin.
A very busy traffic junction, as of 2013 it is the only remaining at-grade and signal controlled crossing of the N7 between the M50 and Limerick, but work is underway to upgrade it to a grade-separated interchange to relieve serious traffic congestion. The upgraded N7 will pass over the R113. Construction went to tender in August 2008 and preparatory work started in September 2008. Following delays, construction proper started in June 2013 and is expected to be completed in May 2015.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/sod-turned-on-282m-newlands-cross-flyover-and-n11-projects-1.1419707|title=Sod turned on €282m Newlands cross flyover and N11 projects|work=Irish Times|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=7 June 2013|author=Genevieve Carbery[/tpl]

[[Calculated Ignition Index]]
CATEGORIES: Combustion

The Calculated Ignition Index (CII) is an index of the ignition quality of residual fuel oil.
The running of all internal combustion engines is dependent on the ignition quality of the fuel. For spark-ignition engines the fuel has an octane rating. For diesel engines it depends on the type of fuel, for distillate fuels the cetane numbers are used. Cetane numbers are tested using a special test engine and the existing engine was not made for residual fuels. For residual fuel oil two other empirical indexes are used CII and Calculated Carbon Aromaticity Index (CCAI). Both CII and CCAI are calculated from the density and kinematic viscosity of the fuel.

The song's lyrics use the imagery of an impending and unavoidable train wreck as an allegorical portrayal of a man's life falling apart. The song receives frequent airplay on classic rock radio stations. It was covered by Rabbitt on their 1975 album Boys Will Be Boys, by Italo-disco outfit Cat Gang in 1983, by W.A.S.P. on the reissue of their 1989 album The Headless Children (as a bonus track), Styx on their 2005 album Big Bang Theory, and Helloween on their 1999 album Metal Jukebox. A Swedish rock band, formed in 1995 by Janne Stark, takes its name from the song.

[[History of chiropractic]]

CATEGORIES: Chiropractic

The history of Chiropractic began in 1895 when Daniel David Palmer of Iowa performed the first chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard, who then mentioned a few days later to Palmer that his hearing seemed better. This led to Palmer opening a school of chiropractic two years later. The word "chiropractic" was coined from Greek root words by Rev. Samel Weed. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in vitalism, naturalism, magnetism, spiritualism and other constructs that were not amenable to the scientific method. Chiropractic's founder, D.D. Palmer, attempted to merge science and metaphysics.[tpl]cite book|last=Leach|first=Robert|title=The Chiropractic Theories: A Textbook of Scientific Research|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins|isbn=0683307479|pages=15[/tpl] In 1896, D.D. Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic was strikingly similar to Andrew Still's principles of osteopathy established a decade earlier. Both described the body as a "machine" whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction/subluxation to improve health.  Palmer drew further distinctions by noting that he was the first to use short-lever HVLA manipulative techniques using the spinous process and transverse processes as mechanical levers. He described the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by the nervous system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's-Lifeline-chrono.pdf |title=98_04_13~1.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-14[/tpl]
Despite their similarities, osteopathic practitioners sought to differentiate themselves by seeking licensure to regulate the profession calling chiropractic a "bastardized form of osteopathy" In 1907 in a test of the new osteopathy law, a Wisconsin based chiropractor was charged with practicing osteopathic medicine without a license. Practicing medicine without a license led to many chiropractors, including D.D. Palmer, being jailed. Ironically the Palmers legal defence of chiropractic consisted of the first chiropractic textbook 'Modernized Chiropractic' published in 1906, written by "mixer" chiropractors Longworthy, Smith et al. who the Palmers despised. Although the chiropractors won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.
The 2008 book Trick or Treatment states that in 1913 B.J. Palmer ran over his father, D.D. Palmer, at a homecoming parade during the Palmer School of Chiropractic. Weeks later D.D. Palmer died. Chiropractic historian Joseph C. Keating, Jr. has described the attempted patricide of D.D. Palmer as a "myth" and "absurd on its face" and cites an eyewitness who recalled that D.D. was not struck by B.J.'s car, but rather, had stumbled.
Division within the profession has been intense, with "mixers" combining spinal adjustments with other treatments, and "straights" relying solely on spinal adjustments. A conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health in 1975 spurred the development of chiropractic research. The American Medical Association called chiropractic an "unscientific cult" and boycotted it until losing a 1987 antitrust case. For most of its existence, chiropractic has battled with mainstream medicine, sustained by antiscientific and pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation. By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic.

A similar European dish is known as aubergine fritters.Contemporary Caribbean Cooking - Sally Miller. p. 18.
In Bangladesh, the dish may be prepared by coating eggplant with besan paste and then frying the pieces in oil.Uses of Tropical Grain Legumes: Proceedings of a Consultants Meeting. pp. 108, 335. The eggplant is usually cut longitudinally  ([tpl]Lang-bn|বেগুন[/tpl] begun) and are dipped in a batter of Bengal gram flour with salt and turmeric, and deep-fried in mustard oil. Sometimes a small amount of poppy seeds is added to the batter. Some people prefer adding a small amount of baking powder to the batter to make it more crunchy. It is commonly consumed along with puffed rice and is an extremely popular street food in the cities. It is normally an evening snack in Bengali households and is a very common component of Iftar in Bangladesh during the month of Ramadan of the Islamic calendar.
Beguni is also a quintessential component of the Bengali monsoon cuisine, where it is consumed along with a rice and lentil preparation called Khichuri.

CATEGORIES: Cycle types

A Jyrobike (formerly known as Gyrobike) is an bicycle with a special front wheel designed to make balancing easier. It is manufactured and sold by a company of the same name.
The special front wheel contains a battery-powered, rechargeable, motor-driven flywheel that spins at high RPMs like a gyroscope. This flywheel spins significantly faster than the front wheel rolls and thereby generates a gyroscopic effect even when the bike is moving slowly, such as when the rider is starting. The flywheel causes the front wheel to respond to a lean by precessing, that is the front wheel turns toward the direction of the lean, which can help provide stability at low speeds, whether riding straight or turning.
Jyrobike technology aims to help children and adults learning to ride a bicycle, and people who lack confidence in their balance and mobility skills.

[[Annual enrollment]]
CATEGORIES: Employment compensation

In the United States, annual enrollment (also known as open enrollment or open season) is a period of time, usually but not always occurring once per year, when employees of companies and organizations may make changes to their elected fringe benefit options, such as health insurance.  The term also applies to the annual period during which individuals may buy individual health insurance plans through the online, state-based health insurance exchanges established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  Open enrollment is also prominent in Medicare, where almost 50 million enrollees can choose to stay in original Medicare, or join or change plans within the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug programs for the coming calendar year. Individuals usually can make changes to their health insurance or fringe benefits only during the open enrollment period or when they have experienced a specific qualifying event.
During this time period, an employer will typically communicate to all eligible employees what options they have for their benefit program.  Often the vendors or insurance providers will be present to explain the details of their products. This can be done either with group presentations, "benefit fairs" or meetings one on one with each employee. As travel expenses continue to rise many vendors and insurance providers have turned to using independent "contract enrollers" to do the communication on their behalf.
For example, Health Advocate, Inc., a large health advocacy company that references employee benefit plans from over 6,000 employers, has a large push to update their system leading up to open enrollment, typically January 1 of each year. The process is very involved and takes several months as each employer plan may be very different.
Open season is a prominent feature of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program during which some 3 million Federal civilian employees and retirees may choose among several dozen health insurance plans for the coming year. Open season is scheduled in the fall each year, and plan enrollment decisions take effect in the following calendar year.

[[Steek]]

CATEGORIES: Knitting

In knitting, steeking is a shortcut used to knit garments such as sweaters in the round without interruption for openings or sleeves until the end. After completing a tube, a straight line is cut along the center of a column of stitches, in order to make room for an opening or place to attach another piece. The steek itself is a bridge of extra stitches, in which the cut is made, and is usually 6-10 stitches wide. This technique was developed by the knitters of the Shetland archipelago and is particularly associated with Fair Isle sweaters, although it can be used for solid colors as well. 
Before the steek is cut, the edges are tacked down on the wrong side of the fabric in order to create a neat finishing, or the adjacent stitches are sewn or crocheted together to prevent unraveling. The stitches can also be picked up and knit from, for example, to create a sleeve. Alternatively, a sleeve can be made separately and sewn onto the steek. After the garment with a steek has been worn and washed a few times, the facings will full and become durable finishes on the inside of the garment.
Steeks can be used for front openings (such as on a cardigan), armholes, or necklines. It has several advantages: For many knitters faster at the knit stitch than the purl stitch, it goes faster, and allows one to work with the right side of the fabric facing the knitter all the time, and thus follow an intricate pattern more easily.  It is also easier to maintain an even tension and, as the color changes can be hidden, there are fewer ends to weave in.
In general, there is little risk of unravelling the sweater with a steek cut if the sewn or crocheted line has been done with wool yarn that is not superwash. They can be further strengthened by using a sticky hairy animal yarn (Shetland wool, the traditional choice, is a good example), and using frequent color changes (such as a 1x1 rib or a check pattern) to secure the yarn. In addition, the sides of the steek can be reinforced by crocheting or sewing. 
Steeking is a procedure used in the making of Scottish traditional kilts in which the pleats of the kilt are "steeked," or stabilized, by a line of running stitches made from the wrong side of the fabric, just above the ending line of pleats, or "fell." Steeking is done after cutting extra fabric away at the top of the pleats, and before the kilt is pressed and other finishing elements like lining and buckles are applied. For more on kilt making, see this site.

Jean Mistler (1 September 1897 – 11 November 1988) was a French writer born in Sorèze, Tarn. In 1966 he was elected to the Académie française.
Mistler, whose father's family had left Alsace in 1871, did his schooling in Sorèze, before preparing for the entrance examination of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure at the Lycée Henri IV, where he read philosophy under Alain. Mistler was drafted into the artillery in 1915 and emerged from World War I a staunch pacifist. He is was accepted at the École normale in 1919 and came in first in the national Aggrégation exam in German the following year.
Instead of becoming a teacher in France, Mistler applied for a position abroad through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He was sent to the French legation in Hungary, becoming a cultural attaché, and teaching at the university of Budapest. In 1925 he was accepted into the Quai d'Orsay (Service des Oeuvres), where he succeeded Paul Morand.
He started a political career in 1928 when he was elected deputé of Aude under the radical socialist label. He received the appointment of under-secretary in charge of the Arts and served as a minister several times, starting in 1932. In 1934, he joined the government of Albert Sarraut, as Minister overseeing the postal service and telecommunications. A music lover, he founded the Orchestre national de la Radiodiffusion française (the ancestor of today's Orchestre National de France). From 1936, he chaired the Foreign Affairs Commission.
In parallel with his political activities, Mistler had begun a career as a writer, with the publication of Châteaux en Bavière (1925) and Ethelka (1929).
On 10 July 1940, in his role as the chair of the voting commission, Mistler introduced before the Parliament the bill that conferred the full powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain (with the ultimate objective of preparing a new constitution). This led critics to accuse him, after the war, of having been the "sinker of the Republic."
After working for the Éditions du Rocher, Mistler became first the general secretary then the president of the Maison du Livre Français (affiliated with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs). Finally, from 1964 to 1969, he became director of the general literature department at Librairie Hachette.
During these years, Mistler also regularly penned literary and musical criticism for L'Aurore.
On 2 June 1966 Mistler was elected to the Académie française, replacing Robert d'Harcourt.
Mistler died on 11 November 1988 in Paris and was buried in the vault of the d'Auriol family, in Sorèze.

[[Open admissions]]

CATEGORIES: University and college admissions

Open admissions (sometimes called open enrollment) is a type of unselective and non-competitive college admissions process in the United States in which the only criterion for entrance is a high school diploma or a General Educational Development (GED) certificate.Peterson's Guide: Glossary of terms
This form of "inclusive" admissionsCarnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching: Undergraduate Profile Technical Details is used by many public junior colleges and community colleges, and differs from selective admission policies held by most private liberal arts colleges and research universities in the United States, which often take into account standardized test scores as well as other academic and character-related criteria.
The open admissions concept was heavily promoted in the 1960s and 70s as a way to reduce discrimination in college admissions and promote education of the underprivileged, the first major application being at City University of New York,[tpl]cite journal|title=Education: Open Admissions: American Dream or Disaster?|date=19 Oct 1970|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944161-5,00.html|work=Time[/tpl]  CUNY later applied this policy only to 2-year Community Colleges which are better prepared for remedial education. Critics argue the open admissions forces an institution either to raise tuition to limit enrollment (which denies opportunities for some students), obtain increased subsidies from government or other sources (as happens with typical community college systems), or else lower standards and limit offerings to lower costs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

This vast plain—marshy and thinly populated in the north, hilly in the south—is of growing economic importance, mostly due to the abundance of natural resources: oil, coal, wood, water. There are vast oilfields in the Tyumen Oblast, and Russia's largest oil refinery is in Omsk. The Kuznetsk Basin around Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk is a center of coal mining, and the production of iron, steel, machinery, and chemicals. Logging is a significant industry throughout the region. Hydroelectric stations dam the Ob near Novosibirsk and Kamen-na-Obi. The navigable Ob-Irtysh watershed covers most of this area, and the southern part is also criss-crossed by the Trans-Siberian, South Siberian and Turkestan-Siberian rail lines. Agricultural products include wheat, rice, oats, and sugar beets, and livestock is raised.Russia. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07

According to 2000 federal census data, it serves a resident population of 25,591. In 2009, the district residents' per capita income was $19,473, while the median family income was $48,310.American Fact Finder, US Census Bureau, 2009 According to District officials, in school year 2007-08 the Trinity Area School District provided basic educational services to 3,542 pupils through the employment of 259 teachers, 142 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 20 administrators.
The history of the school district dates back to the 1850s when Joseph McKnight built a home on top of a hill overlooking the city of Washington, Pennsylvania.  This home came to be called Spring Hill and is now the old part of the district's high school.  It later was established as an Episcopal military school for boys and was named Trinity Hall Military Academy.  Trinity Hall Military Academy became one of the best equipped military schools for boys in the country.  The Smith family owned the property after McKnight and welcomed President Ulysses S. Grant to stay there on several occasions. It had to be expanded in 1881 due to the school's number of students had increased.  After the death of William Smith in 1904, the school had to close due to lack of funding.  It reopened in 1925 with a joint venture of Amwell, Canton, North Franklin, and South Strabane Townships to establish the building as a high school.  This marks the foundation of the school district.
The district operates six schools: Trinity North Elementary, Trinity South Elementary, Trinity East Elementary, Trinity West Elementary, Trinity Middle School and Trinity High School

U.S. Route 1 (US 1) is the easternmost and longest of the major north–south routes of the United States Numbered Highway System, running from Key West, Florida to Fort Kent, Maine.  In the U.S. state of Maryland, an [tpl]convert|80.86|mi|km|2|adj=on[/tpl] segment of the route runs through central Maryland between Mount Rainier and Rising Sun.
US 1 is paralleled by several major highways as it passes through Maryland, including Interstate 95, the Baltimore–Washington Parkway, U.S. Route 29, and U.S. Route 301. Thus, US 1 has lost its significance as a long distance route through the state. It is often congested, however, because it remains a major route in the individual towns it traverses.

[[Al-Shams (East Pakistan)]]

CATEGORIES: Bangladesh Liberation War, Far-right politics, Jamaat-e-Islami

The Al-Shams ([tpl]lang-bn|আল শামস[/tpl]) was a paramilitary wing of several Islamist parties in East Pakistan, that along with the Pakistan Army, Razakars and the Al-Badr, is held responsible for conducting a mass killing campaign against Bengali nationalists, civilians, religious and ethnic minorities during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The group was banned by the independent government of Bangladesh, but most of its members had fled the country during and after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which led to Bangladesh's independence.
Very little is known about the structure and composition of the group.  Newspaper coverage from that period indicate that it was an organ of the razakar para-military force.  Jamaat-e-Islami was the largest Islamic party in Pakistan at that time.  It seems that other Islamic factions, including Nezam-e-Islami and Muslim League, established the Al-Shams (meaning "the Sun"), as a response to Jamaat-e-Islami's strong influence on the military junta.  Jamaat's paramilitay, Al-Badr, was a close ally of the occupation army, and Al-Shams wanted to compete for that status.

[[Our Enemy — The Japanese]]
CATEGORIES: 1943 films, American World War II propaganda shorts, United States Navy in World War II films, Black-and-white films

Our Enemy—The Japanese was a 1943 short film produced by the US Navy and Office of War Information to provide background knowledge about the wartime foe.
The film begins with the narrator, former U.S. ambassador to Japan, Joseph C. Grew, stating that he has lived in Japan for ten years and that their logic is incomprehensible by Western standards, and that they are 2,000 years behind in ethical, social thinking.
The film is an odd assortment of truths and untruths; for instance, it was true that Japan had been geared to a war path for the last 11 years, that it was a totalitarian society with a tightly controlled press and militaristic education system, and that war production was being carried out in family houses.
However other things are statements of prejudice, or unsubstantiated: it implies several times that the Japanese are not inventive or resourceful, and that they get many of their ideas from the west, "aping American newspapers" or copying Nazi propaganda. It also states that the Shinto religion had always been, and that the Japanese people had always believed, an ideology preaching world domination and fascism—in fact the militarist brand of Shinto was a comparatively recent development.

The Buhl Aircraft Company was founded in 1925 by the Buhl family of Detroit. The family owned the Buhl Stamping Company and the Buhl Building. Buhl manufactured the first aircraft to receive an Approved Type Certificate. Certificate #1 was awarded to Buhl for the Buhl-Verville CA-3 Airster in March 1927. Buhl aircraft won a number of speed and endurance records and placed in the top in the Ford National Reliability Air Tour, the National Air Races.
Their first plane was made in late 1925. It was a commercial type of aircraft, suited to carrying passengers, aerial photography, insecticide dusting, training student pilots, and light cargo use. The plane featured folding wings, bearing and guiding surfaces interchangeability, an adjustable stabilizer, and wide-tracked axleless landing gear. The aircraft had a gasoline tank with a capacity of forty gallons and could fly a maximum of five hours on this quantity of fuel. It was tested at Packard Field in Utica, Michigan.New Airplane Tested, Wall Street Journal, December 11, 1925, pg. 11.Little known airports in Michigan, Packard Field.

[[Pasha (protein)]]
CATEGORIES: Proteins, MicroRNA

Pasha, also known as DGCR8 in vertebrates, is a protein localized to the cell nucleus that is required for microRNA processing. It binds to Drosha, an RNase III enzyme, to form the Microprocessor complex that cleaves a primary transcript known as pri-miRNA to a characteristic stem-loop structure known as a pre-miRNA, which is then further processed to miRNA fragments by the enzyme Dicer. Pasha contains an RNA-binding domain and is thought to bind pri-miRNA to stabilize it for processing by Drosha.

[[Manasses I (archbishop of Reims)]]
CATEGORIES: 11th-century births, Archbishops of Reims, 11th-century Roman Catholic archbishops, Year of death unknown

Manasses I, known as Manasses de Gournay, was the Archbishop of Reims, and thus primate of France, from c. 1069He was elected before, but was not consecrated until after, 4 October. to his deposition on 27 December 1080.
Manasses was indisputably of noble lineage, maybe even a son of the female line descended from Hugh Capet, King of France. He was a simple cleric before he succeeded Gervase of Chateau-du-Loir as archbishop. He was known to be enterprising and liberal and was addressed in a letter by Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, as "one of the columns of the church". He presided over one of the most intellectually and artistically vibrant episcopal courts of northern Europe. Pope Gregory VII entrusted Manasses with several delicate missions, but the bishop's character was not held in esteem by his former colleagues, the lower clergy. Among them, he was reputed to be tyrannical, violent, corrupt, impatient, insolent, and disregarding of ecclesiastical regulations. His language gave some cause to doubt his piety. According to Guibert of Nogent, writing in his memoirs thirty-five years later in 1115, Manasses was reported to have said that "the archbishop of Reims would be a fine thing, if one were not obligated to sing the Mass!"
A conflict with the monks of Saint-Remi over the installation of a new abbot prompted a legation of monks to complain to the pope. Manasses responded to the abbey's resistance by excommunicating the monks and despoiling their goods. Gregory VII intervened in 1077 to order Geoffrey, Bishop of Paris, to receive and absolve the monks fleeing into his territory. In Autun on 10 September 1077, papal legate Hugh of Die condemned Manasses as a heresiarch, apparently for consenting to the elevation of the bishop of Senlis, suffragan of Reims, to his office by King Philip I. Manasses reacted by defending his conduct in a letter to Gregory and accusing the legates of acting in bad faith.
The archbishop's appeal succeeded, and Gregory restored him to his office in early 1078. Manasses then traveled to Rome in spring 1078 to profess his faith. There he swore his innocence on the relics of St Peter. This was accepted, and Manasses returned to Reims. He continued to move against his political opponents, however, notably the schoolmaster Bruno of Cologne and the provost of the cathedral chapter, also named Manasses (the future Manasses II, Archbishop of Reims). When they complained again to Hugh of Die in 1079, the legate ordered the archbishop to appear before an ecclesiastical synod at Lyon to resolve the dispute once and for all.  Manasses refused to make the journey to Lyon, and was suspended and ordered to retreat to the abbey of Cluny. The pope offered him a delay in his sentence if he would make reparations. He never did and was deposed by Pope Gregory VII on 27 December 1080.  While Manasses continued to act as archbishop until at least September 1081, he thereafter disappears from the historical record.
Renaud du Bellay, the treasurer of Tours cathedral, succeeded Manasses in 1083, after a vacancy of several years.

It is in the tradition of earlier star catalogues, the so-called Three Stars Each lists, but represents an expanded version based on more accurate observation, likely compiled around 1000 BC.John H. Rogers, "Origins of the ancient contellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions", Journal of the British Astronomical Association 108 (1998) 9–28
The text lists the names of 66 stars and constellations and further gives a number of indications, such as rising, setting and culmination dates, that help to map out the basic structure of the Babylonian star map.
The text is preserved in a 7th-century BC copy on a pair of tablets, named for their incipit, corresponding to the first constellation of the year, [tpl]lang|sux-Latn|MULAPIN[/tpl] "The Plough", identified with Triangulum plus Gamma Andromedae.

CATEGORIES: American film producers, American film score composers, American television composers, American television directors, American television writers, Carnegie Mellon University alumni, Emerson College alumni, Living people, People from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Year of birth missing (living people)

John Harrison is a writer, director, producer and composer.
Harrison was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Emerson College in Boston with a BS in Theater Arts. For several years after that, he performed on the road with his band Homebrew before moving back to Pittsburgh to take a master's degree in film and television from Carnegie Mellon University. At the same time, he joined legendary blues guitarist Roy Buchanan, with whom he toured across the US and internationally for four years. He was also featured on several of Buchanan's albums, including That's What I'm Here For (1974), Live Stock (1975), and A Street Called Straight (1976).
In 1973, Harrison and his friends, Dusty Nelson and Pasquale Buba formed a film production company eventually named The Image Works to produce commercials and industrials in the Pittsburgh area. This partnership eventually led to the production of the film Effects (1980) which Harrison produced and performed in as the character, Lacey Bickle. In 1974, Harrison began a long collaboration and friendship with filmmaker George A. Romero. Harrison performed as Sir Pelinore in Romero's "Knightriders", then became his 1st Assistant Director for both Romero films "Creepshow" (1982) and "Day of the Dead" (1985).
Harrison also composed the scores for the Creepshow (1982), Day of the Dead (1985) as well as playing the "Screwdriver Zombie" in Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead (1978). The music that was composed for the score of Creepshow was also featured in the fake trailer for Thanksgiving in the film Grindhouse (2007).
After Creepshow, Harrison moved to Los Angeles to continue his writing and directing career. He wrote, directed and composed the music for multiple episodes of "Tales from the Darkside" TV show. He was then tapped by producer Richard P. Rubinstein to direct "Tales from the Darkside: The Movie" (1990) for Paramount which won the Gran Prix du Festival at Avoriaz, France (1991). Harrison's collaboration with Rubinstein culminated in the Emmy winning TV miniseries, "Frank Herbert's Dune" (2000) which Harrison wrote and directed, and "Frank Herbert's Children of Dune" (2003) which Harrison wrote and Co-Executive Produced.
In the Fall of '06, Harrison reunited with mentor Romero to co-produce Romero's film "Diary of the Dead" (2007). His action suspense thriller, "Blank Slate", for producer Dean Devlin, which Harrison wrote and directed, aired as a twenty episode micro-series on TNT in the Fall of '08. In 2009, Harrison completed his adaptation of acclaimed horror novelist Clive Barker's "Book of Blood"  which Harrison co-wrote and directed.

[[Trilobozoa]]

CATEGORIES: Trilobozoa, Cambrian life

Trilobozoa ("three-lobed animals") is an extinct taxon of organisms which displayed tri-radial symmetry. Trilobozoans were most dominant during the Ediacaran period — prior to the Cambrian explosion of modern life forms.
The taxonomic affinities of this groups are open to debate. Ivantsov and Fedonkin (2002) place them among the cnidarians. They reasoned that since the conulate Vendoconularia exhibited six-fold symmetry, the conularids — then regarded as a sister group  to the scyphozoan cnidarians — must be nested within the trilobozoa, making the trilobozoan group part of the cnidarian phylum.
The most primitive trilobozoans were disk-shaped, typified by Tribrachidium.  Through comparisons with the other discoidal trilobozoans, it appears the different "arm" patterns on each genus/species occurred due to growth arresting or progressing at different stages of developmental growth.
The more advanced, and much longer-lasting, trilobozoans were cone-shaped, as typified by the long-lived genus Conularia, and had shell-like structures that resemble angular ice-cream cones, which tended to have four corners.  However, the lack of septa or other features diagnostic of anthozoans lead researchers to disregard the conularids as being anthozoans.  Ivantsov and Fedonkin posit that the conularids were ancestrally tri-radially symmetrical, as typified with Vendoconularia.  Conularids are not generally thought to be a part of the Ediacaran biota, if only because of their fossil record, which began a little before the Cambrian period, and ended during the Lower Triassic.  It is now also thought that the conulate trilobozoans derived their four-fold symmetry from a six-fold symmetry, as seen in Vendoconularia, which, in turn, was originally derived from the ancestral disk-like trilobozoans' three-fold symmetry.

[[Diane Jenkins]]
CATEGORIES: The Young and the Restless characters, Fictional characters introduced in 1982, Fictional architects, Fictional models

Diane Jenkins (formerly Richards and Newman) was a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. The role was first portrayed by Alex Donnelley, who debuted in 1982. Diane was initially a two-day bit role, but was developed into a long-term character. Donnelley left the role two years later; returning briefly in 1986 before returning to the role fully in 1996. In 2001, Donnelley left again in what was supposed to be a storyline dictated departure, however, the role was later recast with Susan Walters. After an additional three years in the role, Walters was dropped to a recurring character but chose not to return afterward. After a six-year absence, Walters briefly reprised the role in February 2010. Seven months later, the role was recast a second time with Maura West, who took over in October.
Diane has had relationships with business tycoons Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Diane has a son with Jack, Kyle Abbott (Blake Hood), who was initially supposed to be Victor's son before his sperm sample was switched. Donnelley described Diane as "taking herself much too seriously", while Walters criticized the character for existing solely to advance another character's storyline. Former head writer Maria Arena Bell was heavily criticized for the writing for West; Zap2it said Bell missed an opportunity to focus on Diane's rivalry with Jack. In 2011, within eight months of joining the cast, West was let go and the character was killed off two months later in a whodunit murder storyline. The storyline was also harshly criticized for progressing too slowly, as it was a six-month period before the revelation that Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) murdered Diane in self-defense.

[[Benjamin Kidd]]
CATEGORIES: Political theorists, English political writers, 1858 births, 1916 deaths, British sociologists

Benjamin Kidd (1858–1916) was a British sociologist.  He entered the British civil service and did not become generally known until the publication of an essay, Social Evolution, in 1894.  This work passed through several editions and was translated into German (1895), Swedish (1895), French (1896), Russian (1897), Italian (1898), Chinese (1899), Czech (1900), Danish (1900), and Arabic (1913).
Kidd's major theme, set out in Social Evolution and continued in his later works, is that religion makes sense when seen as what he calls a 'supra-rational sanction' for our behaviour, which acts in the interest of survival of the group, and the yet-to-be-born members of the group, and is necessarily in conflict with our basic human instincts which act in favour of the individual in his lifetime, and also with our reason, which we tend to apply short-sightedly. Thus, while he is an evolutionist and atheist, Kidd proposed that religion, a feature of so many past and present societies, is probably essential to the evolutionary survival of any society.
He finds flaws in the theories of both Herbert Spencer, and Karl Marx, neither of which give due recognition to the fact that continuing struggle is an essential condition for any organism to progress rather than degenerate under the influence of Darwinian natural selection. He sees Christianity as the major factor in the success of the Western world, and the Reformation in particular as the event that brought about a 'softening' of character in the population, with greater sensitivity to the suffering of others as exemplified by Jesus Christ.  This change in character, with increased empathy, led, he claims, to greater equality of opportunity and the weakening of the will of the ruling classes to continue unfair practices like slavery. Those countries that continued the Roman Catholic tradition used it to sanction the divine right of kings and domination by the ruling class.
He also rejects socialism, predicting that in future western societies there will be greater opportunity for all which will maximise the scope for creativity and competition among the masses, thus shifting the struggle for survival somewhat from the group as a whole to the individual. Socialism, he claimed, sought to end the struggle for survival, which could only result in a stagnant society that would inevitably degenerate because of an increase in the 'underclass' or fall victim to competition with more vigorous societies.

[[Corn maze]]
CATEGORIES: Farms, Maize, Mazes

A corn maze or maize maze is a maze cut out of a corn field. They have become popular tourist attractions in North America, and a way for farms to create tourist income. Many are based on artistic designs such as characters from movies. Corn mazes appear in many different designs. Some mazes are even created to tell stories or to portray a particular theme.  Most have a path, which goes all around the whole pattern, either to end in the middle or to come back out again. In the United Kingdom, they are known as maize mazes ("corn" in British English is generally taken to refer to wheat), and are especially popular with farms in the east of England. These mazes are normally combined with other farm attractions of interest to families and day trippers. Some of these attractions include hay rides, a petting zoo, play areas for children, and picnic areas. Each year a few of the mazes are featured in national newspapers and TV. In the U.S., corn mazes typically are cut down circa the first week of November.

The significance of this landmark is that it is the halfway point between the urban and suburban areas of the county to the east, and the relatively rural, agricultural areas to the west.  These agricultural areas to the west of a North-South line through Twenty Mile Bend are collectively known as "The Glades".
The landmark is also used as an aeronautical landmark for planes traveling into Palm Beach International Airport.NOAA Miami Sectional Chart

Sir William Charles Windeyer (29 September 1834 – 11 September 1897) was an Australian politician and judge.
As a New South Wales politician he was responsible for the creation of Belmore Park (north of the new Central railway constructed in 1874 in Haymarket), Lang Park (in Church Hill, between York, Lang and Grosvenor Streets in the city), Observatory Park (on Flagstaff Hill in the west Rocks) and Cromwell Park at the head of Long Bay, Malabar and parks on Clark, Rodd, and Snapper Islands.  He was also the author of the New South Wales Patents Act and the Married Women's Property Act of 1879.[ref]
</ref>
As a judge he was able, conscientious and hard-working, and had much knowledge of law. He had the misfortune to preside over two notorious cases, the Mount Rennie rape case and the Dean trials, which caused much popular feeling, and gave him the reputation in some quarters of being a "hanging" judge. His friends agreed that this estimate was far from his character, and that though he had a brusque exterior he was really a man of noble qualities. This estimate is in conformity with the fact that he was appointed president of the charities commission in 1873, and that he was responsible for the founding of the Discharged Prisoners Aid Society in 1874. An example of his courage and common sense is his judgment on the case dealing with the proceedings arising out of Annie Besant's pamphlet, The Law of Population, which was published separately in 1889 under the title, Ex Parte Collins.[ref]

CATEGORIES: Parliamentary constituencies in London (historic), United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies established in 1918, United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies disestablished in 1950, Politics of Newham

Plaistow was a borough constituency returning a single Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the first-past-the-post voting system. The constituency was one of four divisions of the Parliamentary Borough of West Ham, which had at the time the same boundaries as the County Borough of West Ham. Although administratively separate since 1889, the area was formally part of the county of Essex; since 1965 it has been part of the London Borough of Newham in Greater London.
The creation of the constituency was recommended by the Boundary Commission in a report issued in 1917, and formally created by the Representation of the People Act 1918. It came into existence at the 1918 general election. Its first member was Labour's Will(iam) Thorne who won with an impressive 94.9% of the popular vote, a record for an English parliamentary seat held to this day. As the borough of West Ham had only 120,586 electors on 15 October 1946, the relevant date for the subsequent Boundary Commission review, the borough was only entitled to two Members of Parliament; North and South divisions were recommended. As a consequence Plaistow was abolished as a separate constituency by the Representation of the People Act 1948 and went out of existence at the 1950 general election.

In the 1948 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy festival Harold Daniell, lap record holder since 1938, failed to finish the 1948 Senior TT on his Norton, and victory went to Norton team member, Artie Bell, the flying Ulsterman. Norton dominated, taking the first three places, losing fourth to Geoff Murdoch's AJS, and then filling the next four places. There were thirty three Nortons in a field of fifty six.
Artie Bell also came third in the Junior TT with Freddie Frith taking the flag for first place, and A. R. (Bob) Foster coming second, both on Velocettes. Maurice Cann won the Lightweight with his DOHC 250 cc Moto Guzzi, followed by Roland Pike on a Rudge.
Three Clubman races were again included, for the second year, in the festival with the Clubman Senior race allowing entires of bikes up to 1,000 cc engine capacity.
Later in 1948, at the FICM (later called FIM) meeting in London, it was decided there would be a motorcycle World Championship along Grand Prix lines. It would be a six-race annual series with points being awarded for a placing, and a point for the fastest lap of each race. There would be four classes: 500cc, 350cc, 250cc and 125cc. In the past a Grand Prix had been an individual race. In 1949 for the first time, starting with the Isle of Man TT, a series of Grand Prix races would decide who would be the 1949 World Champion.

The Walnut Street Walking Bridge (#R0412) crosses the Zumbro River in Mazeppa, Minnesota. This bridge was added to the National Register of Historical Places in 2003. This bridge was built in 1904 and is a Pratt truss bridge. Almost lost in a flood caused by severe thunderstorms in June 1998 and having aged, the bridge was closed for safety reasons. When it was refurbished in 2002, the timber walkway was replaced, as were bearings, stringers, piers, abutments and hand railings. In a separate project, a small dam upstream was removed at the same time as the refurbishment. This work widened the stream near the bridge and provides a nice rippling river effect. Reopened in 2002, the "walking bridge" now connects Mazeppa's historic downtown to a city park and ball-field via a short bike trail. In 2002 the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota awarded this project with an Honor Award.

David Michael Morehead (born September 5, 1942 in San Diego, California) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher. A right-hander, Morehead pitched for the Boston Red Sox (1963–68) and Kansas City Royals (1969–70).
As a rookie in [tpl]By|1963[/tpl] Morehead broke into the Red Sox starting rotation and posted a 10-13 record with a 3.81 earned run average. He shut out the Washington Senators in his Major League debut on April 13. On May 12 of that same year, he pitched a one-hitter against the same Senators, the lone hit coming on a Chuck Hinton home run.
In [tpl]By|1964[/tpl] Morehead went 8-15 and his ERA ballooned to 4.97. In [tpl]By|1965[/tpl] he tied for the American League lead with 18 losses, against 10 victories, for a Red Sox team that finished next-to-last, with 100 losses. On September 16 of the latter year, the same day the Red Sox fired Pinky Higgins as general manager, Morehead no-hit the Cleveland Indians 2-0 before only 1,247 fans in a day game at Fenway Park, the lone baserunner coming on Rocky Colavito’s second-inning walk. Not until Hideo Nomo in [tpl]By|2001[/tpl] would another Red Sox pitch a no-hitter, and the next no-hitter at Fenway Park wouldn’t come until [tpl]By|2002[/tpl] (Derek Lowe). It was the fourth no-hitter by a Red Sox pitcher in a ten-year period, with Mel Parnell pitching one in [tpl]By|1956[/tpl] and Earl Wilson and Bill Monbouquette both pitching one in [tpl]By|1962[/tpl]. Parnell's and Wilson's no-hitters, like Morehead's, had also been pitched at Fenway Park—one of Major League Baseball's most notorious hitter-friendly stadiums. It would be another 37 years before a Red Sox pitcher threw a no-hitter at Fenway.
Over the next three years, Morehead would be beset by arm ailments that limited him to 33 games pitched—one fewer than in 1965. He was a member of the Carl Yastrzemski-led [tpl]By|1967[/tpl] Red Sox team that won the American League pennant and pitched two games in relief in the World Series, which the Red Sox lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Morehead was selected in the expansion draft by the Kansas City Royals and pitched in 21 games in [tpl]By|1969[/tpl], 19 in relief. In [tpl]By|1970[/tpl] he pitched in 28 games and posted a 3.62 ERA, the lowest of his career. In spring training of [tpl]By|1971[/tpl], the Royals released him; he had pitched his final game at 28 years of age, the arm ailments having ended his career prematurely.
In his career, Morehead won 40 games against 64 losses with a 4.15 ERA and 627 strikeouts in 819.1 innings pitched. He also exhibited periods of wildness, walking 463 batters for just over 5 BB/9 innings. In each of his first three seasons, Morehead was second in the American League in walks with 99, 112 and 113 respectively.

[[Papyrus sanitary pad]]
CATEGORIES: Appropriate technology, Feminine hygiene

A papyrus sanitary pad, or Makapad, is a sanitary napkin made from papyrus, a natural material. It is reported to be 75 percent cheaper than a conventional pad and thus an advantage to the poor, as well as being highly absorbent. 
The pads, developed by Dr. Moses Kizza Musaazi at Uganda's Makerere University Department of Technology, are targeted especially at rural primary school girls who have started menstruating. These girls would normally find it difficult to attend school if they had no pads, and often cannot afford conventional pads. 
They are made almost entirely from natural materials, with a few percent of non-woven material and polythene paper.

Thora Town-Hart ([tpl]lang-non|Þóra Borgarhjǫrtr[/tpl], Thora Borgarhjört) was the daughter of Herrauðr, the earl of Götaland and a wife of Ragnar Loðbrók. 
Her father gave her a small lindworm that grew into a serpent and encircled her bower. Her father promised Þóra to the one who could slay the serpent. Ragnar Loðbrók arrived, killed the serpent and married Þóra. Ragnar famously wore hairy breeches, whereby he gained his nickname, Loðbrók "Hairy-Breeks". Ragnar went to Västergötland and dressed himself in shaggy clothes that he had treated with tar and sand. He took a spear and approached the serpent, which blew poison at him. Ragnar protected himself with his shield and his clothes and stuck the spear through its heart. He then cut off the serpent's head and married Þora. 
According to the Tale of Ragnar's Sons (Ragnarssona þáttr), they had two sons, Eiríkr and Agnar, who would both die in battle with Eysteinn Beli, Ragnar's Earl of Sweden. Before this Þóra died of an illness and Ragnar was remarried to Aslaug (Aslög), the daughter of Sigurd and Brynhildr.Ragnar Lodbrok (Store norske leksikon)

Written and sung by keyboardist Rick Davies, it is the longest song Supertramp ever recorded clocking in at 16 and a half minutes (surpassing "Try Again" from their 1970 self titled debut album by more than three minutes).
The introduction to the track featured readings from George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The lyrics spoke about the Cold War that was happening at the time of the recording 1984/85. It was also recorded as a music video, which was filmed in the derelict Pan-Pacific Auditorium. The video was directed by Rene Daalder and aroused controversy due to its graphic violence.[tpl]Cite book|last=Melhuish|first=Martin|title=The Supertramp Book|place=Toronto, Canada|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=1986|isbn=0-9691272-2-7|page=192|ref=harv|postscript=[/tpl]
An excerpt from "The Internationale" can be heard from minute 1:10.
This track features drummer Bob Siebenberg's then brother-in-law Scott Gorham of Thin Lizzy on rhythm guitar. The guitar solos throughout the track were performed by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour who used his own mixing system where he controlled every sound that went from his guitar onto the album.  
In a 2002 radio interview on Rockline, Davies explained how Gilmour got involved on the title cut: "I remember saying to the guys, 'We need to find somebody that can play a bit like Gilmour' for the guitar stuff, and I think it was someone at A&M - it might have been Jordan Harris or somebody, one of those guys - and he said, 'Well, I know David - maybe he would like to come over and do it,' and he sent him a demo and he decided he'd like to do it and he was very reasonable. Came over, brought all his gear and straight to the studio. It was a home studio, my studio, and we did it."

During the time of the Spanish invasion, the Mam population was mainly situated in Xinabahul (Now modern-day Huehuetenango). However, due to the Spanish conquest, the people returned to the stone fortifications of Zaculeu for protection.
The city was attacked in 1525 by conquistador Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of Pedro de Alvarado.Polo Sifontes, undated. Kayb'il B'alam and his warriors successfully repelled the attempted siege by the Spanish forces for several months until being forced to surrender after being reduced to the verge of starvation.Recinos 1986, p.110.
In 1975, the Guatemalan Army created a special operations force, the Kaibiles, named after Kayb'il B'alam. The group is centered out of Huehuetenango ("Land of the Old") some 5 km from the original stand off site at Zaculeu.

Dracanum (Greek Drakanon) on the island of Kos near Samos was one of the sites that disputed with Thebes in mainland Greece for the site of the birth of Dionysus, according to the fragmentary Homeric Hymn, which commences
 "For some say it was at Drakanon, others on wind-swept Ikaros, and some say on Naxos,  Heaven-born, Eiraphiotes,Eiraphiotes: "Insewn". Dionysus, in Olympian myth, was sewn into the thigh of Zeus, who brought the prematurely delivered infant to term. but others by the deep-eddying river Alpheios, that Semele conceived and bore you to Zeus who delights in thunder.  And others, lord, say that you were born in Thebes; but they are lying, for the father of men and gods bore you far away from men, hiding you from white-armed Hera. There is a certain Nysa, a very high mountain blooming with forests, far from Phoenike, near the streams of Aigyptos..." (Shelmerdine translation) These fragmentary lines are preserved in a quote by Diodorus Siculus, 3.66.3, who attributes them to Homer himself. "All these sites boasted connections with the worship of Dionysos in antiquity," observes Susan C. Shelmerdine, The Homeric Hymns (Focus Classical Library), 2000: 27  
The geographer StraboStrabo, Book 14 reports the "small town Dracanum, bearing the same name as the promontory on which it is situated and having near by a place of anchorage."

[[Living Without Your Love]]
CATEGORIES: Dusty Springfield albums, 1979 albums, Mercury Records albums, United Artists Records albums

Living Without Your Love is the eleventh studio album recorded by singer Dusty Springfield, and tenth released. The album was recorded in summer 1978 and released in early 1979.
While Living Without Your Love was produced by the at the time fairly unexperienced session musician David Wolfert instead of Roy Thomas Baker, it could very easily have been mistaken for being It Begins Again, Volume 2; it was another no-expenses-spared Los Angeles production, recorded with more or less the same session musicians and backing singers as the previous album and partly in the same studios, it featured a cover version of a 60s Motown classic, "You Really Got a Hold on Me", combined with well-crafted material from a number of acclaimed composers and lyricists in the American adult contemporary genre; Melissa Manchester, David Foster, Steve Dorff, Carole Bayer Sager – and even Albhy Galuten and Barry Gibb – yet the result was as Springfield herself later described it: "unstunning" . Living Without Your Love met with the same fate as It Begins Again: lukewarm reviews and charting neither in the US nor the UK.
The album was originally titled Never Trust a Man in a Rented Tuxedo and then also had slightly risqué cover art, picturing a near naked Springfield coming out of a hotel room shower, only covering herself up with a towel and a man in a tuxedo – supposedly rented – leaving the room, the album with its alternate title and cover was even allotted a catalogue number. These plans were however shelved and the album was instead issued under the fairly unimaginative name Living Without Your Love – with matching cover art – taking its title from one of the album's tracks and also its only single release in the US.
The track chosen to promote the album in the UK was the ballad "I'm Coming Home Again" – a cover of a song released on Gladys Knight's first solo album the year before – with the chorus going: "...And I'm coming home again. It's been too long a time getting back what's mine. And I can't remember why I went away, but it's looking now like maybe I can stay..." The single was released simultaneously with the announcement that Springfield was to embark on a monthlong UK tour, her first live dates in Britain in more than six years. When Springfield arrived in the UK she was however met by the news that all concerts in the provinces had been cancelled due to poor ticket sales. Springfield subsequently made an appearance on UK TV wearing a black veil, jokingly saying she was "in mourning because all my dates have been cancelled". She also made a playback performance singing "I'm Coming Home Again" – with the comment that the lyrics perhaps weren't as relevant any longer.
Springfield did play two live dates at London's Drury Lane Theatre and one charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in the attendance of Princess Margaret, all sold-out and major successes – it was however during the Albert Hall concert that Springfield made the unfortunate off-the-cuff remark "I am glad to see that the royalty isn't confined to the box." – a tongue-in-cheek reference to her large gay following and the drag queens in the audience. The Princess took this as a personal insult, and later sent the singer a type-written apology to the Queen which Springfield was made to sign and return – which she to the surprise of close friends like backing singer Simon Bell did.
The publicity about the cancelled homecoming tour and the Albert Hall debacle which only generated more speculation about Springfield's own sexuality in the British tabloid press didn't help to boost her record sales in the UK. Living Without Your Love consequently became her last LP recorded for Phonogram, a company which she had been with in various forms (Fontana Records/Philips Records/Mercury Records) for nearly twenty years. Two non-album singles produced by David Mackay were recorded and released in the UK that same year: "Baby Blue", written and co-produced by Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes – at the time members of The Buggles – and Bruce Wooley, a disco-pop track also issued as an extended 12" single which did manage to become a minor club hit (#61) but "Your Love Still Brings Me to My Knees" never charted and the track became Springfield's swan-song for Phonogram.
Springfield didn't come home in 1979; she stayed on in Los Angeles for another ten years – a part of her life often referred to as her 'lost years' – and it was also to be more than a decade before she released her next full-length album in the UK.
In 2002, Mercury/Universal Music released Living Without Your Love on CD for the first time, though not including any bonus tracks, as had been fairly standard for Springfield's previous albums released to compact disc.
An edited version of the 1979 concert at the Royal Albert Hall was released on both CD and DVD by Eagle Rock in 2005.

A few years before The Holocaust, the Jewish population of the Soviet Union (excluding Western Ukraine and the Baltic states who were not part of the Soviet Union then) stood at over 5 million, most of whom were Ashkenazic as opposed to Sephardic, with some Karaite minorities. It is estimated that over half died directly as a result of the Shoah. Many more emigrated to Israel, USA, Argentina, and Germany, though Russia and Ukraine still have among the larger Jewish populations in the world today (440,000 in Russia, 300,000 in Ukraine).

The North Western Expressway was a planned freeway route in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, intended to link the Sydney CBD to its north-western suburbs, and ultimately the F3 Freeway to Newcastle.
The route was planned as early as 1962 (even providing a proposed freeway "dotted line" in the first UBD street directory of 1964), with the section from Fig Tree Bridge to Gladesville Bridge and the Western Distributor being the only completed sections. Work on stage one, from Ultimo to Pyrmont Bridge Road, began in 1974. 12 People were arrested during protests in Ultimo against the expressway, and the Whitlam government threatened to cut off $42 billion in road funding if the NSW government continued with construction.‘Work to halt on city expressway’ in The Sydney Morning Herald, 2 October 1974, p. 3 As a result, construction was suspended.
The Wran Government cancelled the project in 1977, as a part of a change in government policy regarding freeways.Ozroads: The Australian Roads Website[tpl]self-published source|date=December 2013[/tpl]

He was later coached by Albert Hill.  In July 1929, he became the first British sprinter to win the Amateur Athletic Association's 100 yards title since Harold Abrahams in 1924.   He was also a leading British high jumper in this period.  His athletic career was curtailed by a leg injury in 1930.  He joined a 4 × 100 metre relay for England against Germany in 1931, but was not selected for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
After he retired from athletics, he became an entertainer, playing piano in the original cast of the Noël Coward's musical Cavalcade at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1931.  He also appeared Will Hay's Gainsborough Pictures comedy Old Bones of the River in 1938.
He married at Marylebone register office in 1930, where his profession was recorded as "pianist".  He was later divorced and remarried in 1938.

CATEGORIES: Shipwrecks of the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Maritime incidents in 1981, Icebreakers

The MS ''Arctic Explorer'' was a ship which sank off St Anthony, Newfoundland, in the Strait of Belle Isle, on 3 July 1981. 
The 165 foot, 900 tonne icebreaker sank in calm seas in less than 20 minutes leaving 13 crew members dead and 19 survivors drifting in two inflatable liferafts for more than two days until rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard. The ship was chartered to Geophysical Service Inc., a seismic exploration company, which was owned by Texas Instruments at the time she sank. It was often incorrectly reported that the ship hit an iceberg. It appears that a ballast problem was the more likely cause.
The Arctic Explorer had just left the port of Saint Anthony, heading for Frobisher Bay, when it took on a list to starboard and sank three hours into its voyage.  Following two days without any communication to the shore base, the vessel was reported missing to the Canadian Coast Guard, who mounted an air search and found the survivors within six hours.

CATEGORIES: Archaeological sites in Emilia-Romagna, Roman towns and cities in Italy, Ancient Italian history, Roman sites of Emilia-Romagna, Former populated places in Italy

Veleia, an ancient town of Aemilia, Italy, situated about 20 miles south of Placentia. It is mentioned by Pliny among the towns of the eighth region, though the Veleiates were Ligurians by race. Its inhabitants were, in the census of Vespasian, found to be remarkable for their longevity. Nothing further was known of it until 1747, when some ploughmen found the famous Tabula alimentaria, now in the museum at Parma. This, the largest inscribed bronze tablet of antiquity (4 ft. 6 in. by 9 ft. 6 in.) contains the list of estates in the territories of Veleia, Libarna, Placentia, Parma and Luca, in which Trajan had assigned before AD 102 72,000 sesterces and then 1,044,000 sesterces on a mortgage bond to forty-six estates. The total value of which was reckoned at over 13,000,000 sesterces (~I3o,ooo), the interest on which at 5% was to serve for the support of 266 boys and 6 girls, the former receiving 16, the latter 12 sesterces a month. 
Excavations begun on the site in 1760, and were at first successful; the forum and basilica, the thermae and the amphitheatre and private houses with many statues (twelve of marble from the basilica, and a fine bronze head of Hadrian) and inscriptions were discovered. Pre-Roman cremation tombs have also been found, with objects of bronze and iron of no great value. But later excavations which were carried on at intervals up to 1876 have given less fruitful results. The oldest dated monument is a bronze tablet with a portion of the text of the Lex Rubria of 49 BC which dealt with the administration of justice in Cisalpine Gaul in connezion with the extension to it of the privileges of the Roman franchise, the latest an inscription of AD 276. How and when it was abandoned is uncertain: the previously prevalent view that it was destroyed by a landslip was proved to be mistaken by the excavations of 1876. Most of the objects found are in the museum at Parma.

You, the Living ([tpl]lang-sv|Du levande[/tpl]) is a 2007 Swedish film written and directed by Roy Andersson. The film is an exploration on the "grandeur of existence,"Andersson, Roy "You, the Living." Royandersson.com. Retrieved on 2009-08-04. centered around the lives of a group of individuals, such as an overweight woman, a disgruntled psychiatrist, a heartbroken groupie, a carpenter, a business consultant, and a school teacher with emotional issues and her rug-selling husband. The basis for the film is an Old Norse proverb, "Man is man's delight," taken from the Poetic Edda poem Hávamál. The title comes from a stanza in Goethe's Roman Elegies, which also appears as a title card in the beginning of the film: "Therefore rejoice, you, the living, in your lovely warm bed, until Lethe's cold wave wets your fleeing foot."Johann Wolfgang Goethe: Erotica Romana, elegy XII – Project Gutenberg, English translation. Linked 2012-10-25
The film consists of a fluent succession of fifty short sketches, most with a tragicomic undertone. The cast is mostly non-professional, and alienating techniques are employed such as presenting the characters in grim make-up and having them talk directly to camera. The financing was difficult and the shooting took three years to complete. The film won the Silver Hugo Award for Best Direction at the 2007 Chicago International Film Festival and has received positive reviews. It is the second film of an unfinished trilogy, Songs from the Second Floor being the first.

Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable is also the title of a 18-minute film by Ronald Nameth with recordings from one week of performances of the shows which were filmed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966. In December 1966 Warhol included a one-off magazine called The Plastic Exploding Inevitable as part of the Aspen No. 3 package.[tpl]Cite journal|title=From the research laboratories of Andy Warhol comes this issue of Aspen Magazine |date=April 1967 |url=http://www.ubu.com/aspen/advertisements/aspen3Ad.html |journal=Evergreen Review |volume=11 |issue=46[/tpl]
The Exploding Plastic Inevitable had its beginnings in an event staged on January 13, 1966 at a dinner for the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry.

Andy Warhol's lights engineer Danny Williams pioneered many innovations that have since become standard practice in rock music light shows. In May 27, 28 and 29 the  EPI played The Fillmore in San Francisco, where Williams built a light show including stroboscopes, slides and film projections onstage. At Bill Graham's request he was soon to come back and build more. Film maker Jonas Mekas (who pioneered film projections during concerts at New York's Cinematheque), Andy Warhol and Danny Williams' influential ideas much contributed to the legendary Fillmore Auditorium prestige and image and were also later used at the Fillmore East and Fillmore West, both opened in 1968.

Cyrus J. Young, Jr. (born July 23, 1928) is an American former athlete who competed mainly in the javelin throw. A graduate of UCLA, he was the first non-European man to win the gold medal in the javelin throw in the Olympics in 1952, and - through the 2012 London Olympics - he remains the only American male to earn Olympic gold in the event.
He attended the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and graduated in 1951. Incredibly, Young only toyed with the javelin for two years in junior college and only took it seriously after entering UCLA in 1948. In 1950, he placed second in the NCAA Championships, and in 1952 Young set a new U.S. record of 256 feet 3 inches (78.12 meters) in the javelin.[tpl]cite web|title=UCLA Hall of Fame to Induct 12 New Members|date=September 16, 1998|publisher=UCLA Athletics official website|url=http://uclabruins.cstv.com/genrel/091698aaa.html|accessdate=2011-10-31[/tpl]
Young competed in the javelin throw for the U.S. at the 1952 Summer Olympic Games in Helsinki, Finland where he won the gold medal.Biography and statistics at Sports-Reference.com
Young continued to throw during his mid-20s and four years later prepared to defend his Olympic title. In April 1956, Young had the best throw of his career with 259-8½ (79.16m). Later in the season, he won his only AAU championship. Because the Olympics were being in held in the Southern hemisphere - where the seasons are "reversed" in comparison to America and Europe - the Summer Games were delayed until late November, which was months after the track & field outdoor season typically ended. A few months before the Melbourne Games, Poland’s Janusz Sidło - the 1954 European Champion - pushed the javelin world record out to 83.66 (274-5¾). Nonetheless, Young headed to Melbourne, Australia as one of the favorites. Three days before the competition he twisted an ankle which caused him pain has he "planted" his leg to release his throw.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.modbee.com/2008/08/16/395683/modesto-gold-medalist-tackling.html|title=http://www.modbee.com/2008/08/16/395683/modesto-gold-medalist-tackling.html|first=Ron|last=Agostini|date=16 August 2008|publisher=Modesto Bee|accessdate=30 March 2014[/tpl]

[[Dave Schramm (musician)]]
CATEGORIES: Year of birth missing (living people), Living people, American rock guitarists, People from Long Island, Yo La Tengo members

Dave Schramm, born and raised on Long Island, New York, is an American musician best known for his stint as the lead guitarist for Yo La Tengo during the band's early years.
After learning to play several instruments from the age of eight, Schramm picked up the guitar in his teenage years.  He began his music career with a late incarnation of Human Switchboard, a short-lived group heavily influenced by The Velvet Underground and Joy Division.  Although Schramm was not around early enough to be involved in the band's only LP, he did contribute to the album After Words, a solo album by Switchboard lead singer Rob Pfeifer released in 1987, five years after the band's breakup.amg  Following Human Switchboard's breakup, Schramm played briefly with Jon Klages, formerly of The Individuals.  Soon after that, Schramm joined fledgling band Yo La Tengo, serving as the band's lead guitarist for a period of approximately two years.  During this span, he contributed to their debut recording "The River of Water" and the band's highly-acclaimed first LP, Ride the Tiger.
Following Ride the Tiger, Schramm amicably left Yo La Tengo to form the Schramms with a number of musicians he had previously been connected to - Ron Metz, who had played drums in Human Switchboard, and former Yo La Tengo members Mike Lewis (bass) and Terry Karydes, who initially played bass until her bass guitar was stolen, after which she moved to keyboards.  The band also had guitarist Todd Novak and saxophonist Pete Linzell.  The Schramms released their debut album Walk to Delphi in 1989, and gained a following in Germany.
In 1990, Schramm briefly worked with Yo La Tengo again, this time contributing to their album Fakebook.  Meanwhile, he continued writing songs with the Schramms, and after being signed to European label Normal Records, the band released its second album, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Dynamite in 1992.
Around this time, much of the original lineup had left the band, and a more-or-less new version of the Schramms released two albums in the mid-1990s: 1994's Little Apocalypse and 1996's Dizzy Spell.  In 2000, the Schramms released their most recent record, 100 Questions, again with a different lineup than the previous album.Schramm has also released two solo albums: 1994's Folk und die Folgen (only released in Germany), and 1999's Hammer and Nails.  He has worked on three albums by singer/songwriter Kate Jacobs, and has done session guitar work for many artists, including The Replacements, Soul Asylum, Freedy Johnston, Richard Buckner, and Chris Stamey - whom he had worked with previously as a member of The dB's in the 1980s. He plays in Syd Straw's band at her annual Valentine's Day 'Heartwreck' shows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christineohlman.net/photos/photodisp.php?id=IMG_0294|title=Christine Ohlman & Rebel Montez - Photos|accessdate=2007-12-06[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

The Psion Siena is a personal digital assistant made by Psion PLC and was released in 1996.
Two versions of the Siena were released, one containing 512KB of memory and the second with 1MB.
The main power is provided by two AAA batteries and the backup power by one cell-style CR1620 battery. The batteries are held in a compartment below a detachable casing in the top of the device. It does not have a socket for an external power source.
The Siena was of the same generation as the Psion 3 series but it has a smaller size screen (240x160 pixels) and an additional numeric pad next to the screen. The Siena uses the same 16bit NEC V30 processor as its predecessor the Series 3a. Although the Siena shares binary compatibility with the Series 3 many programs had to be modified due to the lower memory availability and smaller screen sizes.
Unlike the Series 3, the Siena does not have a bay for removable solid state disk drives; however, an external drive device is available which connects via an RS-232 serial port. The serial port also provides PC connectivity if used with the separately available PsiWin software and dial up access via the Travel modem accessory.  Additional connectivity was available via the included infrared port, alongside the serial port.

[[Chrysler Executive]]
CATEGORIES: Chrysler vehicles, Front-wheel-drive vehicles, Sedans, Luxury vehicles, Limousines, 1980s automobiles

The Chrysler Executive was a car offered by the American automobile producer Chrysler from 1983 through 1986. The Executive was a stretched version of the Chrysler LeBaron aimed at the then booming market segment of limousines. The Executive and Cadillac's Series 75 were the only factory-offered limousine models during the mid-1980s.  The two original 1982 Chrysler Executive prototypes were finished in dark red with matching vinyl tops, and red cloth interiors.  Although fully functional, these two vehicles were for promotional use only and were used in various car shows.
There were two distinct Executive models on different wheelbases:
All Executives were built by conversion specialist ASC near St. Louis, Missouri, and began as standard LeBaron coupes. Standard front doors (from LeBaron sedans) were utilized, while the rear doors were individually fabricated using the rearward-half of the coupe door.  Interiors were available in navy blue cloth or leather (available at extra charge), or powder gray cloth.  1983 interiors were only available in "Kimberly" cloth (a short-nap velour) upholstery, leather upholstery was an option starting in '84.  Limited colors were available for 1983.  For 1984 and on, standard exterior colors were black, medium blue, dark blue, white, charcoal (discontinued after 1984) and silver.  Standard vinyl roof coverings matched the body color, while the interior panels were all covered in cloth - even if leather seating was ordered.
Power came from the Mitsubishi-sourced 2.6 L G54B I4 engine in 1984 and 1985; for 1986 Chrysler's own turbocharged 2.2 L four-cylinder engine was used. Both engines were only available with a 3-speed automatic transmission.
The Executive Sedan was, simply, a stretched LeBaron that held a center console between the front seats.  The console held duct work for the two rear seat air conditioning vents.  The Executive Limousine (option code A-89) had a thick center divide behind the front seats that held a glass divider with power sliding center panel (controlled from the passenger-side switch panel), two upholstered jump seats (without seat belts), five air conditioning vents (with flow controlled by a switch on the rear passenger-side door), an illuminated storage compartment with a flip-down door, and an AM/FM stereo with cassette (separate from the driver's sound system) controlling the four rear speakers.  Above the divider glass was a "glamour module" lighting unit - with overhead lights for the console, as well as individual reading lamps for the two jump seats.  Once the rear doors were closed, the lamps located in this overhead console would slowly theatre-dim before turning off.  Executive Sedans had a similar lighting feature, in the form of a small single lamp located above each rear door.  Both Sedan and Limousine models had adjustable rear-seat headrests, two-position foot rests, rear quarter reading lamps, and pillar mounted assist straps.  Production figures are as follows:
1982 (prototype) - Limousine: 1, Sedan: 1
1983 (limited production) - Limousine: 2; Sedan: 9
1984 (regular production) - Limousine: 594; Sedan: 196
1985 (regular production) - Limousine: 759
1986 (limited production) - Limousine: 138
For 1983, the Executive used the standard LeBaron grille (as shown on the 1982 prototype models as well), while 1984 and 1985 utilized a slightly more vertical waterfall grill (borrowed from the New Yorker) that featured a heavier cap and narrow chrome extensions running beneath the headlights.  1984 and '85 models also received wrap-around tail lamps (from standard LeBaron models), versus the envelope styling on the 1983.  For Executive's final year, the 1986 models used the re-designed LeBaron tail end, featuring new tail lamps and deck lid.  Up front, Executive still utilized the New Yorker grille but the front fender-mounted cornering lamps were discontinued.

Automated Content Access Protocol ("ACAP") was proposed in 2006 as a method of providing machine-readable permissions information for content, in the hope that it would have allowed automated processes (such as search-engine web crawling) to be compliant with publishers' policies without the need for human interpretation of legal terms. ACAP was developed by organisations that claimed to represent sections of the publishing industry (World Association of Newspapers, European Publishers Council, International Publishers Association).ACAP FAQ: Where is the driving force behind ACAP?

[[Disgregation]]
CATEGORIES: Thermodynamic entropy

In the history of thermodynamics, disgregation was defined in 1862 by Rudolf Clausius as the magnitude of the degree in which the molecules of a body are separated from each other.[ref]Clausius, Rudolf. (1862). "On the Application of the Theorem of the Equivalence of Transformations to Interior Work." Communicated to the Naturforschende Gesellschaft of Zurich, Jan. 27th, 1862; published in the Viertaljahrschrift of this Society, vol. vii. P. 48; in Poggendorff’s Annalen, May 1862, vol. cxvi. p. 73; in the Philosophical Magazine, S. 4. vol. xxiv. pp. 81, 201; and in the Journal des Mathematiques of Paris, S. 2. vol. vii. P. 209.
[/ref]  This term was modeled on certain passages in French physicist Sadi Carnot's 1824 paper On the Motive Power of Fire that characterized the "transformations" of "working substances" (particles of a thermodynamic system) of an engine cycle, namely "mode of aggregation", which was a precursor to the concept of entropy, which Clausius coined in 1865.  It was also a precursor to that of Ludwig Boltzmann's 1870s theories of entropy and order and disorder.

Shi Zhecun ([tpl]Zh|t=施蟄存|s=施蛰存|p=Shī Zhécún[/tpl]) (December 3, 1905 - November 19, 2003) was a Chinese author and journal editor in Shanghai during the 1930s. He also wrote poetry and essays, but is now most known for his modernist short stories exploring the psychological conditions of Shanghai urbanites. From the 1940s onwards, he translated western novels into Chinese and also worked as a scholar of classical Chinese literature.
Shi Zhecun was quite active on the Shanghai literary scene. He edited the journal Les Contemporains (Xiàndài 現代) from 1932 to 1934. The journal introduced Chinese readers to various trends in modern literature and art. It covered both foreign and Chinese topics and promoted the works of Shi Zhecun's friends, such as Mu Shiying and Dai Wangshu.
Shi's short stories were written between 1928 and 1937. They cover a range of topics, from absurdist ghost stories to gentler pieces on the strains faced by modern couples in Shanghai. His most famous short story is probably "An Evening of Spring Rain" (Meiyu zhi xi 梅雨之夕). His works set in Shanghai frequently deal with the inner lives of the protagonists as they are beset by irrational fears and desires.
After the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, Shi Zhecun moved inland in 1937. He held various university posts and translated novels by Arthur Schnitzler among others. He became a scholar on classical culture and did research on Tang Dynasty poetry and stele inscriptions. His creative works were long considered politically suspect by the Chinese government, but there has been mounting interest since the 1980s and his works have been republished in recent years.

The Swakop River (Khoekhoe: Tsoaxaub) is a major river in the western part of Namibia, reaching the sea at the southern edge of the city of Swakopmund (German for Mouth of the Swakop). The Swakop is an ephemeral river, its run-off is roughly 40 million cubic metres per annum.
The Swakop River, along with its main tributary Khan, is one of the largest temporary water-bearing rivers in the dry western part of Namibia. It is 460 km long and has a 30,100 km ² large catchment area. In Swakopmund, it flows into the South Atlantic. The name comes from the Khoekhoe languages of the Nama and Damara Tsoa-xaub. Tsoa means ‘excrement opening’ or ‘anus‘ while xaub stands for the ‘contents of excrement.’ This name derives from the observation that the flow of large amounts of brownish sludge in the rain with it and discharges into the Atlantic Ocean.
The area around the river mouth and the surrounding dunes are also known for rich bird life and some unusual plant species (like the Welwitschia) that use the regular fog drifting in from the sea to sustain themselves in the absence of other moisture.
Groundwater levels in the area have also dropped about 0.3 m further due to the presence of two big dams built on the Swakop River.
Notwithstanding the river’s irregular flow, some agriculture is undertaken in the Swakop River valley, thus the region is well known for its fresh produce, especially tomatoes, asparagus and olives. There are some fears of salt and uranium (possibly natural, possibly from the Rössing uranium mine) endangering this farming industry.Uranium in groundwater 'not serious': Roessing - The Namibian, Friday 24 June 2005

CATEGORIES: Bassoon concertos, Compositions by Edward Elgar, 1910 compositions

The Romance, in D minor, Op 62, is a short work for bassoon and orchestra by Edward Elgar. It exists also in a transcription for cello and orchestra made by the composer. Both the bassoon and cello versions date from 1909-10. It is also published with the orchestral part reduced to a piano accompaniment.
The Romance was composed for the principal bassoonist of the London Symphony Orchestra, Edwin F James, who gave the first performance in February 1911 at Hereford, with the composer conducting. The cello transcription remained unplayed until 1985.
The work was composed between two of Elgar's most large-scale works, the Violin Concerto and the Second Symphony, and is a contrastingly short and gentle piece, lasting under eight minutes in performance. The Elgar expert Michael Kennedy remarks of it that it portrays the bassoon as poet and singer rather than comedian.

CATEGORIES: Living people, Turkish refugees, Turkish people of Kurdish descent

The Ay family are Kurdish asylum seekers who became the centre of a controversy in 2003 surrounding the policy of locking up children in high security immigration detention centres in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web | title = Executive 'failed' Ay family | publisher = BBC News : Scotland| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3131637.stm | date = 2003-08-07 | accessdate = 2007-05-18[/tpl]
Salih and Yurdugal Ay were Kurds seeking asylum who came to the UK to escape persecution in Turkey, it being alleged that Mrs Ay had been locked up and raped by Turkish militia. They brought their four children with them and settled in Gravesend in Kent where the children attended local schools. Salih was deported to Germany and from there further deported back to Turkey where he disappeared.
In 2002, Yurdugal Ay and her children were suddenly removed from their home by immigration officials and taken to Dungavel detention centre in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. They were all put together in one room where they lived for a year inside a razor wire surrounded compound. Yurdugal could not speak English very well so it was up to her eldest daughter, Beriwan Ay aged 13, to negotiate for her mother and her sisters. The family were threatened with deportation but appealed. It was claimed by the authorities that they had brought the long stay at Dungavel upon themselves by this appeal.
Conditions in the privatised detention centre, run by an American company, were far from satisfactory. There were no proper education facilities for the children.The children were treated as prisoners with just 2 hours exercise outside allowed each day.There were very limited play facilities.The Children's Commissioner for Scotland described the situation there as 'morally distressing' and threatened to report the UK Government and Scottish Executive to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child . The British Home Secretary at the time David Blunkett appeared to disregard various conventions on human rights requirements about not imprisoning children claiming that the other alternative — separating the children from their parents and putting them into care — was also undesirable.
Bishop John Mone met Beriwan Ay on a visit to Dungavel and was appalled by what he discovered. During a later visit he smuggled a video camera into the centre not being searched there, interviewed Beriwan to camera and released the video to the media. This was shown on BBC television's Newsnight programme. The case was also taken up by the Herald newspaper.
A media storm ensued. The Scottish Executive had responsibilities for children's welfare in Scotland but was clashing with a non devolved act from  the UK parliament in Westminster. Eventually the Ay family lost their appeal against deportation and were forcibly deported via Stansted Airport to Germany  where they were granted asylum. On 27 October 2006 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play by Frank Deasy called Broken English portraying the case from Beriwan Ay's point of view.[tpl]cite web | author = Moira Petty | title = Radio review - Drama | publisher = The Stage | url = http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/14697/radio-review-drama | date = 2006-10-30 | accessdate = 2007-05-18[/tpl]
In January 2012 the Home Office agreed to pay them a 6-figure sum of compensation in an out of court settlement following a civil action against the UK government for the ordeal of their time in detention.

They may be fixed or variable pitch. Early aircraft propellers were carved by hand from solid or laminated wood with later propellers being constructed from metal. The most modern propeller designs use high-technology composite materials.
The propeller is usually attached to the crankshaft of a piston engine, either directly or through a reduction unit. Light aircraft engines often do not require the complexity of gearing but on larger engines and turboprop aircraft it is essential.

Alexander Matveevich Poniatoff ([tpl]lang-ru|Александр Матвеевич Понятов[/tpl], 25 March 1892 - 24 October 1980) was a Russian-American electrical engineer.
Poniatoff was born 25 March 1892 in Aisha, Zelenodolsky District, Tatarstan, Russian Empire. He emigrated from Russia to China, where he worked for the Shanghai Power Company until he emigrated to the United States in 1927. He founded, in 1944, the Ampex company, using his initials, A.M.P., plus "ex" for "excellence" to create the name. The high-frequency bias technique, which made quality recording possible, was invented by Telefunken engineers and put into practical use by Poniatoff. Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen's original magnetic recorder was previously only usable for telephony recording. In 1956, engineers of Ampex created the world's first rotary head recorder, the VR-1000 videotape recorder. Poniatoff served as president of Ampex until 1955 when he was elected chairman of the board. He died in 1980.

An option screener is a tool that evaluates options based on criteria and generates a list of potential trading ideas. Most people who trade options are technical traders. It essentially means they look for patterns in charts. Also they use statistical correlations and deviations and give them Greek names like alpha beta theta gamma. Technical analysis can be very useful, but very few professional money managers would dare use it by itself. Its counterpart, fundamental analysis, similarly uses some math to generate ratios, but the inputs and outputs are much more tangible (e.g. income, revenue, assets).

CATEGORIES: 1771 births, 1845 deaths, Members of the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, Members of the Special Council of Lower Canada

Toussaint Pothier (May 16, 1771 – October 22, 1845) was a businessman, seigneur and political figure in Lower Canada.
He was born Jean-Baptiste Pothier in Montreal in 1771, the son of Louis-Toussaint Pothier, a merchant and one of the founders of the North West Company. He worked for the Michilimackinac Company, a fur trading company, and, later, for its successor, the South West Fur Company. He purchased the seigneuries of Lanaudière and Carufel in 1814 and also owned a large amount of land in the centre of Montreal.
Pothier helped capture Michilimackinac during the War of 1812. In 1820, he married Anne-Françoise, daughter of Ralph Henry Bruyeres. He served as a member of the Legislative Council of Lower Canada from 1824 until it was dissolved in 1838. He also served on the first and third Special Councils which administered the province after the Lower Canada Rebellion. After the union of Upper and Lower Canada, he retired from politics.
In 1839, Pothier was named sheriff for Montreal district, but served only five days. With Peter McGill, he was involved in the construction of the Champlain and St Lawrence Railroad, the first railway in the province. Around 1841, he suffered a series of financial losses which led to him declaring bankruptcy.
He died in Montreal in 1845.
His daughter Jessé-Louise later married George-Paschal Desbarats, the Queen's Printer.

Maud Muller is a poem from 1856 written by John Greenleaf Whittier (1807–1892).  It is about a beautiful maid named Maud Muller. One day, while harvesting hay, she meets a judge from the local town. Each is smitten with the other. The judge thinks that he would like to be a local farmer married to Maud, while she thinks that she would like to be the wealthy judge's wife. Neither voices these thoughts, however, and both the judge and the maiden move on. The judge marries a woman of wealth whose love for him is based on his riches. Maud Muller marries a young uneducated farmer. Throughout the rest of their lives, each remembers the day of their meeting and remorsefully reflects on what might have been.
This poem contains the well known quotation: "For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: 'It might have been!'"

[[List of works by El Greco]]

CATEGORIES: Paintings by El Greco, Lists of works of art

El Greco was a Cretan-born painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. El Greco left his birthplace for Venice in 1567, never to return. El Greco's three years in Venice profoundly influenced his style. In 1577, he emigrated to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until the end of his life.
El Greco's oeuvre is thus divided in three main periods:
El Greco was mainly a painter but a few sculptures, including Epimetheus and Pandora, have also been attributed to El Greco.X. de Salas, The Velazquez Exhibition in Madrid, 54-57 This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco. Pacheco saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines (of wax, stucco, and wood), but these may have been merely models, like those used in the Italian workshops (like the one El Greco himself had created, when he was in Italy). The figures illustrated recall certain nudes in paintings by El Greco in their elongated proportions, but their naturalism and the accentuated musculature of the male figure are regarded by certain researchers as surprising for El Greco.Web Gallery of Art, Epimetheus and Pandora Among the surviving works of the master are also four drawings;The Guardian, El Greco Drawings Could Fetch £400,000 three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth one is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion.Web Gallery of Art, Study for St John the Evangelist and an Angel

[[Old Korean]]

CATEGORIES: Korean language, Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, Vowel-harmony languages

Old Korean is the historical variety of the Korean language or Koreanic languages dating from the beginning of Three Kingdoms of Korea to the latter part of the Unified Silla,최기호, 국어사 서설(The History of Korean Language), 제8회 국외 한국어교사 연수회 (8th Research Conference of Korean Language Teacher in Abroad), 2004년 roughly during the 4th to 10th centuries CE. 
It is distinct from Proto-Korean (원시 한국어), the ancestral language reconstructed from comparison of Korean dialects. Old Korean may have been one of the Altaic languages, although this has not been clearly established.Kim (2004), p. 80. 
The extent of Old Korean is unclear. It is generally accepted as including Sillan, which is thought to be the direct ancestor of Middle and Modern Korean, and may also have included Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Baekje. If so, Old Korean was a language family, not a single language. (See Buyeo languages, Koreanic languages.)It has not been proven that during the age of Three Kingdoms of Korea that all three kingdoms used the same language, but it is accepted by many scholars that the Three Kingdoms utilized similar languages, and that these may have been dialects of a single language. 김수경(1989), 세나라 시기 언어 력사에 관한 남조선 학계의 견해에 대한 비판적 고찰 ("Criticism about the language opinion during three kingdoms of Korea)
Only some literary records of Unified Silla, changed into Goryeo text, are extant and some texts (written in their native Writing system) of the Three Kingdoms period are mostly available in form of inscriptions at present. 
Thus, the languages of the Three Kingdoms period are generally examined through official government names and local district names. The point at which Old Korean became Middle Korean is assessed variously by different scholars. The line is sometimes drawn in the late Goryeo dynasty, and sometimes around the 15th century in the early Joseon Dynasty. But it is usually thought that Middle Korean started at the establishment of Goryeo, and the standard language of Old Korean was changed from the Silla dialect to the Goryeo dialect.
The first texts in Old Korean date from the Three Kingdoms period.  They are written using Chinese characters (Hanja) to represent the sound and grammar of the native language.  Various systems were used, beginning with ad hoc approaches and gradually becoming codified in the scribal idu system and the hyangchal system used for poetry, and in a later phase (leading up to Middle Korean) gugyeol.
Additional information about the language is drawn from various proper nouns recorded in Korean and Chinese records, and from etymological studies of the Korean pronunciations of Chinese characters, which are believed to have been first adapted into Korean in the late Three Kingdoms period.

(10 October 867 – 15 December 933[tpl]harvnb|Wudai Shi|loc=ch. 44.[/tpl]), also known by his temple name Mingzong (明宗), was the second emperor of imperial China's short-lived Later Tang during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, reigning from 926 until his death. He was an ethnic Shatuo originally called Miaojilie (邈佶烈).
Adopted by the Shatuo leader Li Keyong of the Jin territory, Li Siyuan became a trusted general under both Li Keyong and Li Keyong's successor Li Cunxu, the 1st Later Tang emperor. In 926 he seized power by a coup d'état when a mutiny killed Li Cunxu, and ruled with both discipline and compassion for the next 7 years. Despite an abundance of natural disasters, his reign was markedly more peaceful than the half-century preceding it.

The subsequent Later Zhou and Song Dynasties sought to recover the ceded northern territories.   Most of the Sixteen Prefectures including the two principal cities, Youzhou (also called Yanzhou, modern Beijing) and Yunzhou (modern Datong)  remained in Liao hands until the 1120s, when the Jurchens of the Jin Dynasty conquered the region.  In 1123, the Jurchens ceded most of the territories except Yunzhou to the Song, but retook them in 1125.  The loss of the Sixteen Prefectures exposed the plains of central China to further incursions by the Jurchens (the ancestor of Manchus) from Manchuria and the Mongols.

[[New Victory Band]]

CATEGORIES: English folk musical groups

The New Victory Band was an English Country Dance band during the late 1970s/early 80s. 
The original line-up consisted of the members of Muckram Wakes (Roger Watson, Helen Watson, John Adams and Suzie Adams),  Pete and Chris Coe, and Ian and Linda Wordsworth.
There were several bands during the '70s looking for a different approach to playing country dance tunes and dancing than was current in the English Folk Dance and Song Society dances. Going back to listen to traditional musicians like Bob Cann and Scan Tester was a good start. Remembering that these were social dances, not a precious art form, gave licence to all sorts of creative cavorting. Of these new bands, Old Swan Band, Flowers and Frolics, Umps and Dumps, Pump and Pluck seemed to concentrate more on Southern English styles and repertoire. The New Victory Band developed a more Northerly aspect, listening to recordings of George Tremain, Ned Pearson, Adam Gray, Willie Taylor & Will Atkinson.
The New Victory Band recorded just one album, One More Dance & Then, for Topic Records in 1978.  It was re-released on CD by Backshift Records in 2000 and included six extra tracks recorded live on a continental tour towards the end of the band's existence.
During the life of the band, drummer Ian Wordsworth was replaced by Pierce Butler and additional members included Mel Dean on concertina and Peadar Long on sax.

USCGC ''Gallatin'' (WHEC-721) is a U.S. Coast Guard Hamilton-class high endurance cutter based out of Charleston, South Carolina. Built at Avondale Shipyards near New Orleans, Louisiana, Gallatin was named for Albert Gallatin, the fourth and longest serving United States Secretary of the Treasury.  Gallatin completed its final patrol 11 December 2013 and will be decommissioned in 2014 before being transferred to the Nigerian Navy.[tpl]cite news|last=Smith|first=Bruce|title=Coast Guard cutter returns from final patrol|url=http://www.charleston.af.mil/news/sthttp://www.navytimes.com/article/20131211/NEWS03/312110021/Coast-Guard-cutter-Gallitan-returns-from-final-patrolory.asp?id=123374545|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=Navy Times|date=11 December 2013|agency=Assocaited Press[/tpl]
Design
Gallantin is designed as a high endurance cutter. Her crossing range of 9,600 nautical miles (17,800 km) at 20 knots (40 km/h), and 80-foot (24 m) flight deck, capable of handling both Coast Guard and Navy helicopters, make the Gallatin an ideal platform for extended patrol missions. Her missions include enforcement of all U.S. maritime laws and treaties, fisheries conservation, marine pollution response, defense readiness, and search and rescue. Gallantin was one of the first naval vessels built with a combined diesel and gas turbine propulsion plant. Gallantin’s engineering plant includes two 3,500 horsepower (2,600 kW) diesel engines, and two 18,000 horsepower (13,000 kW) gas turbines, which can achieve a top speed of 28 knots (52 km/h). Two 13-foot (4 m) diameter controllable pitch propellers, combined with a retractable and rotatable bow propulsion unit, give Gallatin high maneuverability.
Gallantin’s capabilities are enhanced by advanced air search and surface search radars including the AN/SPS-73 digital surface radar system that incorporates a state of the art computerized collision avoidance system. Gallantin uses the Shipboard Command and Control System (SCCS) which uses a network of computers including large screen displays and a dedicated satellite network for communications. A closed circuit TV system enable's the Commanding Officer to monitor flight deck operations, machinery conditions, towing, damage control, and related activities from the bridge.

[[Misfeasance in public office]]

CATEGORIES: Civil law (common law), Law of negligence, English tort law

Misfeasance in public office is a cause of action in the civil courts of England and Wales and certain Commonwealth countries.  It is an action against the holder of a public office, alleging in essence that the office-holder has misused or abused his power. The tort can be traced back to 1703 when Chief Justice Sir John Holt  decided that a landowner could sue a police Constable who deprived him of his right to vote (Ashby v White).[tpl]cite web|author=Finance |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2918771/The-300-year-old-beginnings-of-Byers-day-in-court.html |title=The 300-year-old beginnings of Byers' day in court |publisher=Telegraph |date=2005-07-11 |accessdate=2013-11-21[/tpl] The tort was revived in 1985 when it was used so that French Turkey producers could sue the Ministry of Agriculture over a dispute that harmed their sales.
Generally, a civil defendant will be liable for misfeasance if the defendant owed a duty of care toward the plaintiff, the defendant breached that duty of care by improperly performing a legal act, and the improper performance resulted in harm to the plaintiff.
In theory, misfeasance is distinct from Nonfeasance. Nonfeasance is a term that describes a failure to act that results in harm to another party. Misfeasance, by contrast, describes some affirmative act that, though legal, causes harm. In practice, the distinction is confusing and uninstructive. Courts often have difficulty determining whether harm resulted from a failure to act or from an act that was improperly performed.

[[The Angie Pepper Band]]
CATEGORIES: Australian punk rock groups, New South Wales musical groups

The Angie Pepper Band was a band formed in Sydney, Australia, which centralised around the artist Angie Pepper. Angie Pepper first came to notice as vocalist for the post punk independent Sydney band the Passengers, who produced one single ("Face With No Name") on the Phantom label. She married Radio Birdman co-founder Deniz Tek, and they played together in the short lived Angie Pepper Band whose ranks included a future Hoodoo Guru in Clyde Bramley and a former Saints drummer in Ivor Hay. 
The band was short lived but in its time recorded a single called "Frozen World". Tracks that were recorded by the Passengers (in 1982) and the Angie Pepper Band (in 1984) were compiled on an LP and CD called It's Just that I Miss You that was issued on Citadel Records in 2001. In 2003 Angie Pepper released Res Ipsa Loquitor on Career Records, her first album of newly recorded material in years, which signals a powerful renaissance for this great singer. She has been described by Aretha Franklin's producer Arif Mardin as having a "most special voice".

[[Amino acid synthesis]]

CATEGORIES: Metabolism

Amino acid synthesis is the set of biochemical processes (metabolic pathways) by which the various amino acids are produced from other compounds. The substrates for these processes are various compounds in the organism's diet or growth media. Not all organisms are able to synthesise all amino acids. For example, humans are able to synthesise only 12 of the 20 standard amino acids.
A fundamental problem for biological systems is to obtain nitrogen in an easily usable form. This problem is solved by certain microorganisms capable of reducing the inert N≡N molecule (nitrogen gas) to two molecules of ammonia in one of the most remarkable reactions in biochemistry. Ammonia is the source of nitrogen for all the amino acids. The carbon backbones come from the glycolytic pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, or the citric acid cycle.
In amino acid production, one encounters an important problem in biosynthesis, namely stereochemical control. Because all amino acids except glycine are chiral, biosynthetic pathways must generate the correct isomer with high fidelity. In each of the 19 pathways for the generation of chiral amino acids, the stereochemistry at the α-carbon atom is established by a transamination reaction that involves pyridoxal phosphate. Almost all the transaminases that catalyze these reactions descend from a common ancestor, illustrating once again that effective solutions to biochemical problems are retained throughout evolution.
Biosynthetic pathways are often highly regulated such that building-blocks are synthesized only when supplies are low. Very often, a high concentration of the final product of a pathway inhibits the activity of enzymes that function early in the pathway. Often present are allosteric enzymes capable of sensing and responding to concentrations of regulatory species. These enzymes are similar in functional properties to aspartate transcarbamoylase and its regulators. Feedback and allosteric mechanisms ensure that all twenty amino acids are maintained in sufficient amounts for protein synthesis and other processes.

The Generalized Maxwell model also known as the Maxwell–Wiechert model (after James Clerk Maxwell and E WiechertWiechert, E (1889); "Ueber elastische Nachwirkung", Dissertation, Königsberg University, GermanyWiechert, E (1893); "Gesetze der elastischen Nachwirkung für constante Temperatur", Annalen der Physik, 286, 335–348, 546–570) is the most general form of the linear model for viscoelasticity. In this model several Maxwell elements are assembled in parallel. It takes into account that the relaxation which does not occur at a single time, but in a set of times.  Due to molecular segments of different lengths with shorter ones contributing less than longer ones, there is a varying time distribution.  The Wiechert model shows this by having as many spring–dashpot Maxwell elements as are necessary to accurately represent the distribution.  The figure on the right shows the generalised Wiechert model.Roylance, David (2001); "Engineering Viscoelasticity", 14-15Tschoegl, Nicholas W.

The team is formed by the top players in Hong Kong First Division League. Both Hong Kong and foreign players, including those from mainland China, can be included in the team. However, as the quality of local players is usually lower, it has been often that most of the outfield players are foreigners. 
In recent years, HKFA fielded the Hong Kong national football team to participate in matches which are usually played by Hong Kong League XI. Therefore, Hong Kong League XI has not formed a squad for a few years. However, the team returned and competed in the 2007 Lunar New Year Cup.

Paul Lachlan MacKendrick (1914 – 1998) was an American classicist, author and teacher.
He was born in Taunton, Massachusetts, but most of his productive years had been lived in Madison, Wisconsin.
MacKendrick was educated at Harvard University (1934 B.A., summa cum laude; 1937 M.A.; 1938 Ph.D.) and Balliol College, Oxford, after which he taught at Phillips Academy for some years. Future United States President George H.W. Bush was a student of MacKendrick's while he taught at Phillips Academy.Professor MacKendrick recounted this to a Latin course at the University of Wisconsin attended by the author of this note. He joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and served from 1941-45.
He taught at Harvard in 1946 and then moved to University of Wisconsin–Madison as Assistant Professor of Classics where he taught for six years. MacKendrick was named a Professor of Classics in 1952 and in 1975, the Lily Ross Taylor Professor of Classics. In all, he taught at the University of Wisconsin from 1946 to 1984.
In 1952, he worked with Herbert M. Howe on the publication of Classics in Translation, an anthology of selections by ancient Greek and Roman writers. In 1958, two books followed: The Ancient World, co-authored with Vincent M. Scramuzza and The Roman Mind At Work.
He is most widely known for a series of books that utilise the discoveries of archeology to reconstruct the histories of particular cultures or civilizations. The first of these, The Mute Stones Speak, surveys the cultures of the Italian peninsula from prehistoric times, with emphasis on the Romans, to the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the empire in 324 A.D.
The Greek Stones Speak then followed in 1962. Starting with the Troy and Heinrich Schliemann's excavations, the reader is told of accounts of excavations of major centers of the Hellenic world, including the story of Michael Ventris' decipherment of Linear B.
Several additional titles appeared in this series, and by 1980 it had surveyed regions and cultures of alomost the entire area of the Roman Empire.
Professor MacKendrick had retired from teaching in 1984.

A New Refutation of Time ([tpl]lang-es|Nueva refutación del tiempo[/tpl]) is an essay by Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges (written between 1944 and 1946) in which he argues that the negations of idealism may be extended to time. It consists of a prologue and two articles: the first one was written in 1944 and appeared in number 115 of the review Sur; the second, written in 1946, is a rework of the first. Borges comments that he did not combine the two texts into one, as the reading of two analogous texts might facilitate the comprehension of an indocile subject.
Just as George Berkeley denies that there is an object existing independently of our perception of it, and David Hume denies that there is a subject apart from a mere recollection of sensations, Borges tries to demonstrate that there is no time.
He proceeds on the assumption that if "man" is reduced, as according to Hume, to a collection of sensations, a single repeated perception, either in one man's life or in the experience of two different men, suffices to prove that time is a fallacy, since this repetition will destroy its linear sequence. Paradoxically, Borges closes the essay by refuting his refutation: "The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges."

CATEGORIES: 1876 births, 1942 deaths, 19th-century American painters, 20th-century American painters, People from Wyoming County, New York, American Congregationalist ministers

George Burton Drake (1870–1942) was a Congregational minister, born August 8, 1870 in Eagle, New York to John (1833–1901) and Emily (Helmer) Drake (1848–1904). Raised as an only child (his older brother William had died in 1872), George was relied upon heavily by his mother to help his father, who had been severely wounded by a Confederate sniper during the Civil War and left without the use of his right arm. During his teenage years, he attended Pike Academy in New York.
Drake attended Ridgeville College in Indiana where he met Ida Hattie Lawrence (b. April 14, 1872). They married on Dec 24, 1891 and she died shortly thereafter on March 24, 1893. In 1894 he moved to South Wardsboro, Vermont where he served as a minister. There he met and married Nellie (Nell) Jennie Rice (November 9, 1870 – December 23, 1966) May 13, 1894. In 1901 he moved back to western New York to look after his father due to John's failing health. On September 10, 1901, John Drake died in Pike, New York.
George Burton Drake and his wife served Congregational Churches in Mount Hope, Kansas, Valley Falls, Kansas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Chicago and eventually to Old Orchard Church in Webster Groves, Missouri. George Burton Drake retired to McPherson, Kansas, where he died on September 20, 1942. Nell was a poet.
Nell and George Burton Drake had one son, George Bryant Drake (December 8, 1895- April 26, 1979), a minister and past President of Doane College (1942–1947), and a daughter, Ruth Nellie Drake (December 16, 1900 – November 28, 1994). Through George Bryant Drake he had two grandsons, historian George Drake (emeritus President of Grinnell College) and history Professor Richard Drake (retired) of Berea College and a granddaughter, Jane Drake Erickson, who followed the family tradition as a minister's wife. Through Ruth Nellie Drake he had two grandsons, mathematician Alfred Willcox who served as the executive director of the Mathematical Association of America and United Church of Christ minister Brewster Willcox and a granddaughter, Barbara Willcox Schott.
He was also an accomplished painter. Drake typically signed his works as 'GB Drake', often employing accentuated vertical strokes within the signature. Drake seems to have produced far more watercolors paintings than those of other media, yet, as of 2010, his works in each media can still be found occasionally at auctions and estate sales for a modest sum due to the artist's obscurity in the art world and general lack of following.  His style is pastoral and serene, typically including his favorite subjects: large trees, a cottage or farmhouse in the distance, and perhaps an individual walking.

[[Management of multiple sclerosis]]
CATEGORIES: Autoimmune diseases, Multiple sclerosis, Medical treatments, Neurological disorders

Several therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) exist, although there is no known cure. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS).
The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, many of the people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.
The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS may have several adverse effects, and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different alternative treatments are pursued by many patients, despite the paucity of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study.
This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; borderline forms of MS have particular treatments that are excluded.

Protein metabolism denotes the various biochemical processes responsible for the synthesis of proteins and amino acids, and the breakdown of proteins (and other large molecules, too) by catabolism. 
Dietary proteins are first broken down to individual amino acids by various enzymes and hydrochloric acid present in the gastro-intestinal tract.Mehta, S. Digestion of Dietary Proteins These amino acids are further broken down to α-keto acids which can be recycled in the body for generation of energy, and production of glucose or fat or other amino acids. This break-down of amino acids to α-keto acids occurs in the liver by a process known as transamination, which follows a bimolecular ping pong mechanism.Mehta, S.

[[Cortical visual impairment]]
CATEGORIES: Blindness, Brain disorders

Cortical visual impairment (CVI) is a form of visual impairment that is caused by a brain problem rather than an eye problem. (The latter is sometimes termed "ocular visual impairment" when discussed in contrast to cortical visual impairment.) Some people have both CVI and a form of ocular visual impairment.
CVI is also sometimes known as cortical blindness, although most people with CVI are not totally blind.  The term neurological visual impairment (NVI) covers both CVI and total cortical blindness. Delayed visual maturation, another form of NVI, is similar to CVI, except the child's visual difficulties resolve in a few months.  Though the vision of a person with CVI may change, it rarely if ever becomes totally normal.
The major causes of CVI are as follows: asphyxia, hypoxia (a lack of sufficient oxygen in the body’s blood cells), or ischemia (not enough blood supply to the brain), all of which may occur during the birth process; developmental brain defects; head injury; hydrocephalus (when the cerebrospinal fluid does not circulate properly around the brain, and collects in the head, putting pressure on the brain); a stroke involving the occipital lobe; and infections of the central nervous system, such as meningitis and encephalitis.

Joe Jimenez (June 10, 1926 – August 11, 2007) was an American professional golfer best known for winning the 1978 PGA Seniors' Championship.
Jimenez, who was of Mexican American descent, was born in Kerrville, Texas.Willis, George, Newsday - Long Island, N.Y., "Fade to Black" (Jul 25, 1993, Sports Section, Page 16); "Other prominent minority players include Mexican-Americans Lee Trevino, Joe Jimenez, Homero Blancas and Fred Ruiz.." He was a 1952 graduate of Trinity University with majors in biology and physical education. Jimenez played on the PGA Tour in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. He spent many years (1964–1991) as the club pro at the Jefferson City Country Club in Jefferson City, Missouri. His best showing in a major championship was a T-45 at the 1958 U.S. Open. The highlight of his career came when he won the 1978 PGA Seniors' Championship in a playoff over Manuel de la Torre and Joe Cheves with a birdie on the first extra hole of a sudden-death playoff.
Jimenez holds or formerly held two of golf's "shoot below your age" records. At the 1991 GTE Northwest Classic, a Senior PGA Tour event, 65-year-old Jimenez became the youngest player to shoot his age or lower in a tournament on one of golf's major professional circuits by shooting a 63. This record was later broken when 61-year-old Walter Morgan shot a 60 in the AT&T Canada Senior Open Championship. Jimenez still holds the most-strokes-below-age (7) record. He shot a 62 during the 1995 Ameritech Senior Open at the age of 69.Article from golf.about.com: Golf Age Shooters - What are the Records for Age Shooters in Golf?

Lucius Cornelius Merula (died 87 BC) was a politician and priest of the late Roman Republic.
He held the office of Flamen Dialis (high priest of Jupiter), and wore the flamen's cap at all times, unlike the other flamines who only wore it while performing sacrifices.
In 87 BC, during the civil war between Marius and Sulla, he was appointed consul by the Senate in place of Marius's ally Cinna, who had been driven from the city. He negotiated the return of Cinna and Marius from banishment, and abdicated his consulship. However, false charges were made against him during Marius's purges of his political enemies, and he committed suicide, opening his veins in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and imploring the gods to avenge him on Cinna and his allies. He had first taken care to remove his flamen's cap, for it was considered a sin for a flamen to wear it at his death.
The position of Flamen Dialis was now vacant. Marius's seventeen-year-old nephew Julius Caesar was nominated to fill it in 86 BC by Marius and Cinna.Suet. Div. Iul.1.1 if that Julius was born in 102 - not 100 BC (so that he was of legal age 43 when he became consul in 59).  See Gaius Stern, "Julius Caesar’s Term as Flamen Dialis" CACW 2010.  Scholars disagree but this nomination was annulled by Sulla subsequently.Suet. Div. Iul.1.2 makes clear that Sulla deprived Julius of the priesthood, so he must have held it.  See Gaius Stern, op. cit. The position was not filled again until under Augustus, between 16 and 10 BC, dated by Dio to 11 BC, but Tacitus to 15 BC.Tac. Ann3.58.  Note that many translators wrongly edit Tacitus to match Dio instead of editing Dio to match Tacitus (the more reliable historian), again see Stern op. cit.

CATEGORIES: Phalacrocoracidae, Prehistoric birds, Controversial bird taxa

Valenticarbo is a supposed genus of extinct bird that lived during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene (c. 1.8 mya) of South Asia. It contains only the type species, V. praetermissus.
Harrison (1979) erected this genus because he found himself unable to assign a 19th-century plaster cast of a broken tarsometatarsus bone originally retrieved from Siwalik Hills sediments to modern cormorants. As the fossil itself is apparently lost, this makes the genus a nomen dubium.
Few other researchers have commented on this, most deciding not to discuss this taxon. Those that did chided Harrison's decision to assign an undiagnostic and possibly damaged cast as a type specimen of a new genus. Olson (1985) called it
 "...very near the acme of zealotry for naming new species of fossil birds. It is highly doubtful that the genus Valenticarbo could be shown to be valid, even if a specimen of it did exist." 
Carroll (1988) considers this "genus" a synonym of Phalacrocorax, the modern cormorants. Given that fossil cormorants not assignable to Phalacrocorax are not known to have occurred later than Early Pliocene, this is likely to be correct, but the possibility that the original fossil was not of a cormorant at all cannot be discounted.

There has been a church on the site for at least 900 years, however the original date of construction is unknown.http://www.stjohnsegglescliffe.org.uk/B2Worshipfolder/Worshipstjhistory.htm Church website (accessed 28.10.2006) It is claimed that there is an underground tunnel from the church to the Friarage in the grounds Yarm School. It is alleged that it was originally used as an escape tunnel for the monks when the Yarm School area was a catholic house. The Dominican Friars, Black Friars, occupied a site in Yarm from 1286 to 1583.
It is part of a long history and many more are buried in the church yard than there are gravestones for - some graves marked with just one name actually contain up to four people, since people have been buried there for hundreds and hundreds of years, grave stones only being introduced recently. 
There are also legends of spirits of the deceased buried in the cemetery, two gardeners, father and son, and the former owner of The Bluebell in Yarm.

It functions as a growth hormone secretagogue and ghrelin mimetic which causes the body to secrete human growth hormone in a way usually seen at puberty and in young adulthood. Initial studies have shown the drug to directly raise insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone levels.Pan LC, Carpino PA, Lefker BA, Ragan JA, Toler SM, Pettersen JC, Nettleton DO, Ng O, Pirie CM, Chidsey-Frink K, Lu B, Nickerson DF, Tess DA, Mullins MA, MacLean DB, DaSilva-Jardine PA, Thompson DD. Preclinical pharmacology of CP-424,391, an orally active pyrazolinone-piperidine growth hormone secretagogue. Endocrine. 2001 Feb;14(1):121-32. PMID 11322494  
The drug is being considered for its therapeutic value in aging adults because elderly people have much lower levels of growth hormone and less lean muscle mass, which can result in weakness and frailty.Thompson DD. Aging and sarcopenia. Journal of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions. 2007 Oct-Dec;7(4):344-5. PMID 18094505  
In a one-year treatment trial (starting 1999) with 395 seniors between 65 and 84 years old, patients who received the drug gained an average of 3 lb (1.4 kg) in lean body mass in the first six months and also were better able to walk in a straight line in a test of balance, strength and coordination. After 12 months, patients receiving capromorelin also had an improved ability to climb stairs, however the results were not good enough to continue the trial for the 2nd planned year.Heidi K. White, Charles D. Petrie, William Landschulz, David MacLean, Ann Taylor, Kenneth Lyles, Jeanne Y. Wei, Andrew R. Hoffman, Roberto Salvatori, Mark P. Ettinger, Miriam C. Morey, Marc R.

Capromorelin, however, has not been approved by major regulatory bodies such as the World Health Organization, the European Medicines Agency or the United States FDA. In the U.S. at least, approval is not expected to be forthcoming any time soon, because the FDA does not consider aging a disease, and so requires extraordinary evidence of benefit and non-toxicity to approve a drug for use as an anti-aging agent.Hersch EC, Merriam GR.

The Pride Library is a collection of books, periodicals, and audio-visual resources by and about gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transsexuals, and other queer folk. Located in the D.B. Weldon Library at The University of Western Ontario, the Pride Library is the first official queer resource center at a Canadian university.  Since its founding in the Faculty of Arts in the late 1990s, The Pride Library has grown rapidly with the support of donors, volunteers, faculty, and administrators at The University of Western Ontario.
The Pride Library collection consists of over 6000 catalogued items: scholarly books; popular novels; videocassettes and DVDs of queer documentaries and feature films; slides of paintings and posters by queer artists; academic periodicals; and community magazines.  Over 15 languages are represented in the collection.  Subjects include the Gay Liberation Movement, gay and lesbian literary history, coming out, women's health and safety, homophobia, bisexuality, trans life, pornography, censorship, and same-sex marriage.  Also included in the collection are early sexology works, homophobic classics, and queer pulps from the 1950s and 1960s. 
Special collections include the Hudler Archives and the Burroughs Collection.  The Hudler Archives is named after Richard Hudler, a local activist who served as president of the Homophile Association of London Ontario (HALO) from 1981 to 1995.  The archives include the HALO community records, Hudler's personal papers, literary manuscripts, newspaper clippings, legal files, photographs documenting queer social history in London, and the catalogues of the Visual AIDS poster exhibition from 1988 through 1995.  Exhibits of archival materials (Body Politic covers, HALO files, and Visual AIDS posters) can be viewed online at the library website.  The William S. Burroughs Collection—Burroughs, celebrated for being both subversive and surreal, is the author of Naked Lunch (1959) and Queer (1985)—includes fictional works as well as autobiographies, essays, and interviews.  
The Pride Library was founded by Professor James Miller in his office in the Tower of University College in 1997.   In the summer of 2005 it was relocated on the main floor of the Weldon Library at the heart of the campus and officially reopened on February 14, 2006.  Every aspect of the library was carefully designed and chosen to reflect its unique mandate and to welcome visitors into a distinctively queer space. 
Much of the Library's success is due to generous support from volunteers and donors. Volunteers offer reference services to visitors and assist in maintaining and organizing the collection. Businesses, organizations, and individuals have all helped the collection grow through donations. Notable donors include:
The University of Western Ontario has been supportive in a variety of ways. A donation of $50,000 from the university administration in the spring of 2006 covered the renovation of the new space and the conversion of the catalogued books into a circulating collection.  The University has also donated the space where the library is located, and included Pride materials in its online public access catalogue. In this way, resources are made accessible to students and non-students alike.

[[Lectavis]]

CATEGORIES: Cretaceous birds, Euenantiornithes, Bird genera

[tpl]italic title[/tpl]

Lectavis is a genus of enantiornithine birds. Their fossil bones have been recovered from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian, c.70.6 - 66 mya) Lecho Formation at estancia El Brete, Argentina. The genus contains a single species, Lectavis bretincola.[ref]
Etymology: "Lecho Formation bird living at El Brete". Lectavis, after Latin lectus ("bed") = Spanish lecho + Latin avis, "bird". bretincola, after the type locality estancia El Brete + Latin incola, "inhabitant".[/ref]
The only known (this far) fossil bones (PVL-4021-1) are most of the left tibiotarsus (lower leg) and tarsometatarsus (upper foot) of a single individual. L. bretincola was a sizeable bird, with a 16-cm tibiotarsus and a tarsometatarsus which if complete must have been nearly 10 cm long (Chiappe 1993); this would make it roughly similar to a large curlew in size and at least in leg shape. It is most interesting in possessing a hypotarsus, which it evolved autapomorphically from modern birds, as it covers the upper end of the second, not the third toe's bones. This structure serves to attach and arrest the posterior cruciate ligament, which in turn prevents the lower and upper leg from shifting out of position during walking.
Thus, it can be concluded that L. bretincola was a much more terrestrial species than its relative Yungavolucris brevipedalis which lived at the same time and place. Its habitat was a richly vegetated coastal area that was dotted by - possibly brackish - lakes and/or small rivers (Chiappe 1993), and it might thus be that the present species represents a case parallel evolution with waders and similar semi-aquatic forms, or even a running bird similar to an oversized courser, and quite unlike anything living today.
It was a rather advanced species of enantiornithine and possibly quite closely related to Enantiornis and Avisaurus, but more likely closer to other Euenantiornithes (Sanz et al. 1995). Its exact relationships, as with most enantiornithine birds, are unresolved however.

[[Early Swedish literature]]

CATEGORIES: Swedish literature

Early Swedish literature designates Swedish literature written between approximately 1200–1500 AD.
As Swedish evolved from Old Norse in the 13th century, the Swedish literature began to take form as an independent body of literature. The earliest form of an independent Swedish language is called Old Swedish, and it was used in the years 1225 to 1526. The period was initiated by the first provincial laws. In them, the runic Futhark was almost totally replaced by the Latin alphabet.Lönnroth, Delblanc, et al. The provincial laws are believed to have had a solid centuries-old foundation that was kept alive by oral tradition until they were written down. Compared to the Christianity-influenced Swedish literature during the ensuing centuries, the provincial laws are described as having a touch of the ancient folkhistory; of tradition and age.Gustafson 1961, pp.27-28
Because of the dominant Catholic Church, Latin had come to be the lingua franca for all matters of education, science and religion. Therefore, there are few traces of Old Swedish in the old medieval manuscripts. As mentioned, the most important exceptions were the provincial laws. Second to the laws come the legends of saints, popular among both commoners and scholars. These works would often be based upon the international best-seller Golden Legend (Legenda aurea), but also included biographies of many local Swedish saints.Gustafson, p.30-32
Literary writing in Swedish took a major step forward with the Eufemiavisor, translations of romances originally in Old French commissioned by the Norwegian Queen Euphemia of Rügen and sent to Sweden. The three ballads were titled Herr Ivan lejonriddaren (1303), Hertig Fredrik av Normandie (1301 or 1308)  and Flores och Blanzeflor (probably 1312). They were followed by a translation of the Norwegian Karlamagnús saga as Karl Magnus. The mid-fifteenth century also saw a Swedish verse translation Legends about Theoderic the Great of the Norwegian prose Þiðreks saga.
Other works need to be mentioned for their great historical importance. The Chronicle of Charles (Karlskrönikan), the Chronicle of Eric (Erikskrönikan) and the Chronicles of Sture (Stureskrönikorna) give a coverage of the entire time of Swedish history between the early 14th to the late 15th century. The earliest and most notable of these was the Chronicle of Erik, written around 1330, focusing on the life of Duke Erik Magnusson. In term of literary quality, the chronicles were written in an unambitious rhyming verse known as knittel, without actual literary ambitions.Algulin, p.21; Gustafson, pp.41-43

[[Swedish Reformation and Renaissance literature]]
CATEGORIES: Swedish literature

The German Protestant Reformation had spread to Sweden by 1520. The advent of the printing press facilitated a full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. From a philological view, a new period in the development of the Swedish language called Modern Swedish was initiated with the Bible translation. It also gave power to the vernacular language.
From a literary point of view, the period between 1400 to 1600 produced little of note, especially during the 1520–1600.Algulin, p.25Gustafson, p.54 Yet, paradoxically, the Bible translation published 1541 is possibly the most significant Swedish book of all times. First and foremost, it had a great religious impact, but apart from that it also introduced the common man to a language beyond the common-day.Gustafson, p.61Algulin, p.27 The Bible was used in churches for around 400 years until the Bible translation of 1917, and meanwhile translations (in 1618 and 1712) were merely revisions and corrections.Gustafson, p.26

The Sardinian Lynx is an extinct subspecies of the Eurasian Lynx that once could be found on the Italian island of Sardinia.
In 1908, Pasquale Mola described a lynx from Nuoro (Sardinia) as Lynx sardiniae. The length of the Sardinian Lynx was 1 m; the height 35 cm and the tail 33 cm. The cheeks were distinctly whiskered and the ears were tufted. The back was reddish with the dorsal area almost forming a band. The sides were reddish grey. The head, neck and shoulder, and flanks with reddish brown or greyish brown spots. The legs had transverse tawny stripes. The tail had a black tip and three black sub-terminal rings. This subspecies had also a head with black stripe on each side beginning at the mouth and passing back through the eye to the side of the neck. The ears were tawny inside and reddish outside, tending towards black. The underparts and inner surface of the legs are dirty white with a reddish tinge.[tpl]cite book | author = Miller, G.

Evidence of the existence of the lynx on the island have never been collected in historical times. It is therefore considered that the reporting by Mola is not to be considered valid for the present time.

Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari (born on 22 March 1971), or Owais Leghari, is the former Federal Minister for Information Technology of the Government of Pakistan and is currently Member National Assembly and Chairman Foreign affairs Committee on behalf of the Pakistan Muslim league Nawaz party.
He comes from an Agriculturist political family of Dera Ghazi Khan, Punjab. His family is a land owner of the area and owns approximately 2,500 acres of land.
His father –  Sardar Farooq Leghari – was a former President of Pakistan. His grandfather Nawabzada Muhammad Khan Leghari and great grandfather had both been ministers in the Pakistan government. Awais Leghari’s father was also the chief of the Leghari tribe. His father died in October 2010 after which Awais’ brother Jamal Leghari was crowned the 27th chief of the tribe.
Awais Leghari started his education at Aitchison College, Lahore. He passed Higher Senior Cambridge Examination in 1988. For higher studies he went to the University of Rochester in New York, USA. He graduated with honors in 1994 with economics (Game Theory) and political science as his majors.
Leghari entered politics in 1997 when he contested and won a provincial assembly seat from Rajanpur as an independent candidate. He joined the Millat Party soon after it was formed on August 14, 1998. Leghari contested the October 2002 elections and was elected from two seats, a National Assembly seat from Dera Ghazi Khan and a Punjab Assembly seat from Rajanpur. After  the Millat Party and the Sindh Democratic Alliance merged with the ruling PML-Q in May 2002 to form a united Pakistan Muslim League, Awais Leghari became one of the senior vice presidents of the newly constituted party.
He was appointed the federal minister for Information Technology in the cabinet of Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali in 2002 and was very successful in the office. He is known for his policies that helped promote IT and cellular networks in the country. It was in his tenure that Pakistan won the GSM award,http://www.onlinenews.com.pk/details.php?id=93264 which only Brazil had won in 2006 for its excellent IT policies. Leghari had been very successful in this ministry and after his tenure, the sector could not flourish as it did earlier. Thus, Pakistan has been left quite behind by other developing countries.
He lost the NA seat from Dera Ghazi Khan in 2008 by 250 votes, but after the untimely demise of his father; Farooq Leghari, he contested the by-election of NA-172 in March 2011 and won by a huge margin of more than 20,000 votes.
Awais Leghari joined the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf in December 2011 along with his brother Jamal Leghari and 28 other PML-Q members. By May 2013, differences with other senior members of The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf made him leave the party. 
He contested independently and won by a huge margin of over 20,000 votes against PPP-PML-N joint candidate Saifuddin Khosa. He then joined the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz. He is now Chairman Foreign Relations Committee of the Pakistan Parliamnet.
Besides agriculture, which is both his hobby and means of income, Leghari is fond of hunting and plays tennis. He is also active in providing interest-free loans, education and vocational training to the under privileged.

[[The Compleat Enchanter]]

CATEGORIES: 1975 short story collections, Fantasy short story collections by L. Sprague de Camp, Works by Fletcher Pratt, Works originally published in Unknown (magazine), Doubleday (publisher) books

The Compleat Enchanter: The Magical Misadventures of Harold Shea is an omnibus collection of three classic fantasy stories by science fiction and fantasy authors L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, gathering material previously published in two volumes as The Incomplete Enchanter (1941) and The Castle of Iron (1950), the first two books in their Harold Shea series, with the essay "Fletcher and I," de Camp's paean to his deceased collaborator. The collection was first published in hardcover by Nelson Doubleday in 1975 as an offering for its Science Fiction Book Club, and was reissued in paperback by Del Rey Books in 1976. Minus the essay, it has more recently been combined with Wall of Serpents (1960), the third book of the series in the omnibus edition The Complete Compleat Enchanter (1989). This book had been left out of The Compleat Enchanter due to "considerations of space and ... contractual considerations." (Afterword, p. 338) The stories in the collection were originally published in the magazine Unknown in the issues for May and August, 1940 and April, 1941.
The Harold Shea stories are parallel world tales in which universes where magic works coexist with our own, and in which those based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world and can be reached by aligning one's mind to them by a system of symbolic logic. Psychologist Harold Shea and his colleagues Reed Chalmers, Walter Bayard, and Vaclav Polacek (Votsy), travel to several such worlds, joined in the course of their adventures by Belphebe and Florimel of Faerie, who become the wives of Shea and Chalmers, and Pete Brodsky, a policeman who is accidentally swept up into  the chaos. The three stories collected in The Compleat Enchanter explore the worlds of Norse mythology in "The Roaring Trumpet," Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in "The Mathematics of Magic," and Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (with a brief stop in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Kubla Khan) in "The Castle of Iron."

X-ray pulsar-based navigation and timing (XNAV) is a navigation technique whereby the periodic X-ray signals emitted from pulsars are used to determine the location of a spacecraft in deep space.  A spacecraft using XNAV compares received X-ray signals with a database of known pulsar frequencies and locations.  Similar to GPS, this comparison allows the spacecraft to triangulate its position accurately (accurate to 1-5km) .

He is described by Frederick Douglass in My Bondage and My Freedom (published in 1855) as a "first rate hand at breaking young negroes". In 1833, Douglass was rented to Covey for a year so that Covey would break the teenage slave's spirit.  One day, after numerous vicious beatings at Covey's hands, Douglass fought back. He fought off Covey's cousin and his fight with Covey himself, which lasted nearly two hours long, ended with Douglass's victory.  Covey did not physically assault Douglass thereafter.

Stob Bàn is a Scottish mountain situated at the western end of the Mamores ridge, five and a half kilometres north-west of Kinlochleven. With a height of 999 metres (3,278 feet) it qualifies as a Munro. Stob Bàn is a distinctive sight when viewed from lower Glen Nevis with its sharp peak and capping of white quartzite rocksWestern Mamores Ridge. "with a sharp peak capped with white quartzite". which are often mistaken for snow; its Gaelic name translates as White Peak100 Best Routes on Scottish Mountains, p. 62, gives Gaelic translation as "White Peak". or Light Coloured Peak.The Munros, p. 69, gives Gaelic translation as "Light Coloured Peak". 
Stob Bàn exhibits striking examples of Dalradian rock geology and has been identified by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) as an important site in its Geological Conservation Review. Dalradian rocks were characteristically formed in the high ground to the east and south of the Great Glen of Scotland. Dairadia was the name for this ancient Celtic region.Joint Nature Conservation Committee Information on Dalradian Rocks. The mountain should not confused with another Stob Bàn, also a Munro which is located in the Grey Corries above Spean Bridge.
Stob Bàn has three main ridges: the east ridge connects to the former Munro of Sgor an Iubhair via the top of the Coire a' Mhusgain (Corrie of the Shellfish), the western ridge links to the adjoining Munro of Mullach nan Coirean while the northern ridge drops steeply to Glen Nevis over a series of terraced rocky outcrops. There is a less significant fourth ridge which gives a steep descent south west to the West Highland Way en route from Kinlochleven to Fort William and is quick way off the mountain for walkers who have approached from the south. Stob Bàn can be climbed as part of the Highland High Way,Amazon.co.uk. Book and synopsis of Highland High Way. a high level alternative of the West Highland Way, walkers often do the final day between Kinlochleven and Fort William over some of the Mamores peaks if the weather is fine.
Stob Bàn’s most striking physical characteristic are its crags on the north eastern face; these fall precipitously to Coire a' Mhusgain over 400 metres below and contribute greatly to the mountain’s classic pyramidal shape. The buttresses on the northern ridge of the mountain attract winter ice climbers. South Buttress has several good winter gully climbs, Central Buttress features three gully lines, a rocky rib and an arete all giving good winter climbs on broken rock.www.ukclimbing.com. Information on rock climbing.
Stob Bàn is usually climbed from Glen Nevis to the north; direct ascents start at Achriabhach and take the stalkers path which ascends Coire a' Mhusgain to reach the col between Stob Bàn and Sgor an Iubhair before climbing steeply up the eastern ridge to the summit. From the same starting point it is also possible to ascend the rough and undulating north ridge; on this route there is a significant false top at a height of 900 metresHamish's Mountain Walk, p. 166, gives info on 900-metre false top which can be seen in main picture. which is often mistaken for the summit. Stob Bàn is also quite often climbed in conjunction with the neighbouring Munro of Mullach nan Coirean which lies three kilometres to the west. The view from the summit takes in fine views of Ben Nevis and the Aonachs.

In the theory of ordinary differential equations, a movable singularity is a point where the solution of the equation behaves badly and which is "movable" in the sense that its location depends on the initial conditions of the differential equation.[ref]

Suppose we have an ordinary differential equation in the complex domain.  Any given solution y(x) of this equation may well have singularities at various points (i.e. points at which it is not a regular holomorphic function, such as branch points, essential singularities or poles).  A singular point is said to be movable if its location depends on the particular solution we have chosen, rather than being fixed by the equation itself.
For example the equation
It is a basic feature of linear ordinary differential equations that singularities of solutions occur only at singularities of the equation, and so linear equations do not have movable singularities.
When attempting to look for 'good' nonlinear differential equations it is this property of linear equations that one would like to see: asking for no movable singularities is often too stringent, instead one often asks for the so-called Painlevé property: 'any movable singularity should be a pole', first used by Sofia Kovalevskaya.

[[Hänschen klein]]

CATEGORIES: German folk songs, Children's songs

"[tpl]Lang|de|Hänschen klein[/tpl]" is a traditional German folk song and children's song originating in the Biedermeier period of the 19th century. The title translates to English as "Little Hans".
Originally it told of a juvenile who ventures to the world and returns as a man to his family. It gained much more popularity around 1900, when the following abridged textual version came to be adopted as among the first songs to be taught to small children, whether at home or in kindergarten. Now it is about a small boy, who is going away but returns immediately to hearth and home, since his mother, left alone, began crying.
The tune of this song is also used in the simple Mother Goose rhyme of "Lightly Row," and another version is the children's song "Little bird, have you heard," which in turn is related to the song "Warm Kitty" (made famous as "Soft Kitty" in the American sitcom The Big Bang Theory). It is the theme song of the 1977 war film Cross of Iron. It is also playable in Wii Music. In the German dubbed version of 2001: A Space Odyssey the HAL 9000 computer sings "[tpl]Lang|de|Hänschen klein[/tpl]" (instead of Daisy Bell) while deactivated.

CATEGORIES: Year of birth missing (living people), Living people, American film producers, University of Central Missouri alumni

Grant Curtis is a film producer, who has worked with director Sam Raimi on The Gift, Drag Me To Hell, the Spider-Man films and Oz the Great and Powerful. He grew up in the rural Missouri town of Warrensburg. Curtis received a Masters Degree in Mass Communication in 1997 from the University of Central Missouri (UCM), formerly CMSU (located in the town of Warrensburg). He wrote a thesis/screenplay entitled: "And God Stepped Aside". The screenplay examines the relationship between a young man who reluctantly fulfills the dying wishes of his estranged grandmother by taking her to Paris, France. The story was inspired by Curtis' own personal experiences with death within his family. Not long after he completed his thesis/screenplay while he lived in Los Angeles, CA., Curtis' neighbor informed him that director Sam Raimi was looking for an assistant. Curtis interviewed for the position, not entirely confident afterwards that his Missouri accent and demeanor, not to mention his limited practical experience, garnered Raimi's consideration. After waiting many months, Curtis discovered that he got the job, and his journey towards success began.Spider-Man Official Site
In 2002, Curtis received the University of Central Missouri's Alumnus Associations Outstanding Recent Alumni Award.
In 2007, Spider-Man 3 earned $151 million the first weekend it hit theaters—the second highest grossing opening weekend in history.http://www.ucmo.edu
Aside from producing films, Curtis wrote a book in 2007 called The Spider-Man Chronicles: The Art & Making of Spider-Man 3.

The Siege of Namur, 25 May–30 June 1692, was a major engagement of the Nine Years' War, and was part of the French grand plan (devised over the winter of 1691–92) to defeat the forces of the Grand Alliance and bring a swift conclusion to the war. Namur, sitting on the confluence of the Meuse and Sambre rivers, was a considerable fortress, and was a significant political and military asset. French forces, guided by Vauban, forced the town's surrender on 5 June, but the citadel, staunchly defended by Menno van Coehoorn, managed to hold on until 30 June before capitulating, bringing an end to the 36-day siege. Concerned that King William III planned to recapture the stronghold, King Louis XIV subsequently ordered his commander-in-chief, the duc de Luxembourg, to join battle with the Allies in the field, resulting in the bloody Battle of Steenkerque on 3 August.

Margherita Durastanti (active 1700–1734) was an Italian singer of the 18th century. Vocally, she is best described as a soprano, though later in her career her tessitura descended to that of a mezzo-soprano. First heard of professionally in Mantua in 1700-01, she later appeared in Bologna and Reggio Emilia (1710), Milan and Reggio (1713) and Florence (1715). Today she is particularly remembered for her association with the composer George Frideric Handel: indeed she enjoyed a longer personal association with the composer than any other musician.
As well as performing many of his early Italian solo cantatas, Durastanti's first roles for Handel included Mary Magdalene in his oratorio La Resurrezione (1709) and the title role in Agrippina later in the same year, in her capacity as prima donna of the S Giovanni Grisostomo Theatre in Venice, where she sang from 1709 to 1712. After singing at Parma, Florence, Naples (where she appeared in operas by Scarlatti), and, in 1719, Dresden, she came to London in 1720. News of her imminent arrival evinced the following unflattering comment from the librettist Rolli: [tpl]cquote|It is said for certain that Durastanti will be coming for the operas. Oh! What a bad choice for England! I shall not enter into her singing merits, but she really is an Elephant![/tpl]
However, she received a strong recommendation from Steffan Benedetto Pallavicini, court poet at Dresden: [tpl]cquote|You will find my recommendation not only trustworthy, but even superfluous, because this worthy virtuosa will recommend herself, for she is among the most excellent actresses who have appeared in the theatre here in recent years.[/tpl] 
Nonetheless, she was offered her contract in Handel's Royal Academy company rather late in the day, so was probably not his first choice as a member of it. The roles Handel wrote for her during the next five years demonstrate her considerable abilities as a musician and actress, displaying a wide range of characters, both male and female, and an ability to cope with wide dissonant leaps in vocal lines and other difficulties, such as chromaticism and dramatic pauses.

[[DIRECT]]
CATEGORIES: Shuttle-derived space launch vehicles, Human spaceflight

DIRECT was a late-2000s proposed alternative heavy lift launch vehicle architecture supporting NASA's Vision for Space Exploration, which would replace the space agency's planned Ares I and Ares V rockets. The family of Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicles are named "Jupiter".
DIRECT was advocated by a group of space enthusiasts that asserts it represents a broader team of dozens of NASA and space industry engineers who actively work on the proposal on an anonymous, voluntary basis in their spare time. 
, the DIRECT Team was said to consist of 69 members,<ref>

[/ref] 62 of whom were NASA engineers, NASA-contractor engineers, and managers from the Constellation Program.  A small number of non-NASA members of the team publicly represent the group.[tpl]who|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The project name "DIRECT" refers to a philosophy of maximizing the re-use of hardware and facilities already in place for the Space Shuttle program (STS), hence a "direct" transition. The DIRECT Team asserts that using this approach to develop and operate a family of high-commonality rockets would reduce costs and the gap between retirement of the Space Shuttle and the first launch of Orion, shorten schedules, and simplify technical requirements for future US human space efforts.
Three major versions of the DIRECT proposal have been released with the last, Version 3.0, having been unveiled in May 2009.  On 17 June 2009, the group presented its proposal at a public hearing of the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee, a panel reviewing US space efforts, in Washington D.C.
With the October 11th signing of the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 (S. 3729) by President Obama mandating work on the Space Launch System Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle, the DIRECT Team has declared success of their effort. They have since announced the formation of a new space technology company: C-Star Aerospace, LLC.NASA Has New Authorization but Future Remains Uncertain | SpaceNews.comhttp://www.launchcomplexmodels.org/Direct/documents/Direct-Team-Declares-Success-PR-101310.pdf

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the meaning of life.
The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or allegorical meaning within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of "Also sprach Zarathustra" (1896) by composer Richard Strauss, made famous in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.

[[Fosmid]]

Fosmids are similar to cosmids but are based on the bacterial F-plasmid. The cloning vector is limited, as a host (usually E. coli) can only contain one fosmid molecule. Fosmids can hold DNA inserts of up to 40 kb in size; often the source of the insert is random genomic DNA. A fosmid library is prepared by extracting the genomic DNA from the target organism and cloning it into the fosmid vector.[tpl]cite journal | author = Barry G.

The low copy number offers higher stability than vectors with relatively higher copy numbers, including cosmids. Fosmids may be useful for constructing stable libraries from complex genomes.

The Battle of Zagonara was fought on July 28, 1424 at Zagonara (Lugo di Romagna) between the armies of the Republic of Florence and that of Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan, an episode of the Wars in Lombardy. A number of famous Italian condottieri of the 15th century took part in the battle.  The only condottiero who died in the battle was Lodovico degli Obizzi, who fell off his horse and suffocated in the mud.
The battle occurred when Carlo I Malatesta, lord of Rimini, intervened in support of Alberico Novello da Barbiano, whose troops were under siege in the castle of Zagonara  by Milanese mercenaries under Angelo della Pergola. Pergola had about 4,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry. Malatesta's troops (amounting to some 8,000 cavalry) abandoned the siege of Forlì and attacked the Visconti, led by Secco da Montagnana.
Soon the initial attack of the Florentine cavalry waned. After several hours of fighting, they were routed by Pergola's counterattack. Malatesta himself was captured, together with about 3,000 men-at-arms and 2,000 infantrymen, and the castle was destroyed.

The Lapworth Museum of Geology is a major geological museum run by the University of Birmingham in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England.
The museum is located within the Grade II listed, Aston Webb Building, which retains the original Edwardian features. The museum has a history which dates back 1880. Named after Charles Lapworth, an English geologist, the museum houses over 250,000 specimens as well as geological maps, equipment, models, photographic material, and also zoological specimens and stone axes. Also in Lapworth's name is the Lapworth Archive, a detailed and extensive archive of his work housed within the Lapworth museum. The museum materials provide an invaluable teaching aid for the university's geology students.
Many specimens are from the Midlands as well as the rest of the United Kingdom. Among the collections is Wenlock Limestone of the Wenlock Group from Dudley including fossils dating to 420 million years. Solnholfen Limestone from Germany are also on show to the public which includes fish, dragonflies, crabs, lobsters and pterosaurs. Within the fish collections are fish from Brazil, Italy, Lebanon and USA. Samples from the Burgess Shale of British Columbia consist of 510 million year old animals.
Many specimens that are taken from the UK were from old coal mining fields where minerals were accessed. As a result of this collection, there are over 15,000 minerals documented. Minerals from the collection of William Murdoch, an engineer who worked at Soho House with James Watt and Matthew Boulton.
In 2008 the museum was officially designated as possessing collections of outstanding national and international importance by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council.
In 2009, the entire natural history collection of the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery was relocated to the Lapworth Museum with plans underway to drastically increase the amount of exhibition space to allow the collection to be displayed.
In 2012 the Lapworth Museum was awarded a HLF development award of £130,000 to plan for an expansion and modernisation of the facilities.

Since 1961 the Italian Democratic Party of Monarchist Unity (Partito Democratico Italiano di Unità Monarchica, PDIUM) was the continuation of the Italian Democratic Party (Partito Democratico Italiano) as they continued to call the PDIUM. It was founded in 1959 by the union of the People's Monarchist Party and the National Monarchist Party.
The new party, like its predecessors, was hampered by provisions in the Italian Constitution of 1946 making it all but impossible to restore the monarchy short of adopting a new constitution.  The document not only specifically foreclosed a referendum on changing the republican form of government, but (until 2002) barred male members of the House of Savoy from ever returning to Italy.  It was never able to repeat the results of its predecessors and saw electoral support for the monarchist cause shrink in the 1963 general election (1.8%) and in those of 1968 (1.3%), due to the successes of the Italian Liberal Party (respectively 7.0 and 5.8%).
In 1972 PDIUM merged in the post-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) and so ceased to exist. Alfredo Covelli, long-time monarchist leader, was elected president of MSI. In 1976 Covelli led a moderate split of MSI and established National Democracy.

Saint Joseph of Leonessa, O.F.M. Cap., ([tpl]lang-it|Giuseppe da Leonessa[/tpl])
(1556 – February 4, 1612) is a saint of the Catholic Church.  He was born Eufranio Desiderio at Leonessa, a small town then in Umbria, now in the Lazio.  It is said that from his infancy he showed a remarkably religious bent of mind; he used to erect little altars and spend much time in prayer before them, and often he would gather his companions and induce them to pray with him.
Whilst yet a boy he used to take the discipline on Fridays in company with the Confraternity of the Holy Savior. He was educated by his uncle, who had planned a suitable marriage for him, but in his sixteenth year he fell sick of a fever, and upon his recovery, without consulting his guardian, he joined the Capuchin reform of the Franciscan Order. He made his novitiate at the friary of the Carcerelle near Assisi.
As a friar he was remarkable for his great abstinence. "Brother Ass", he would say to his body, "there is no need to feed thee as a noble horse would be fed: thou must be content to be a poor ass." In 1599, the year before the Jubilee year, he fasted the whole year by way of preparation for gaining the indulgence.

[[Joanna (typeface)]]
CATEGORIES: Monotype typefaces, Old style serif typefaces, Transitional serif typefaces, Lowercase numerals typefaces

Joanna is a transitional serif typeface designed by Eric Gill (1882–1940) in the period 1930–31, and named for one of his daughters. The typeface was originally designed for proprietary use by Gill's printing shop Hague & Gill. The type was first produced in a small quantity by the Caslon Foundry for hand composition. It was eventually licensed for public release by the Monotype foundry in 1937. 
In designing Joanna, Gill took inspiration from the types of Robert Granjon (1513–1589). The underlying armature of both the roman and italics bear strong similarities with Granjon's type, yet the spare, sharp squared serifs and moderate contrast of strokes, have a 20th-century modernist feeling. The italics are more vertical than Granjon's with only a 3° slope. The face is, as Gill described it himself "a book face free from all fancy business." Similarities can be seen with Gill's earlier typefaces Cockerel and Perpetua. A more recent face, FF Scala designed in 1990 by the Dutch type designer Martin Majoor (born 1960) is similar in its geometric simplicity combined with the old style letterform. Gill chose Joanna for setting An Essay on Typography, a book by Gill on his thoughts on typography, typesetting, and page design.

[[Compensation principle]]
CATEGORIES: Welfare economics

In welfare economics, the compensation principle refers to a decision rule used to select between pairs of alternative feasible social states. One of these states is the hypothetical point of departure ("the original state").  According to the compensation principle, if the prospective gainers could compensate (any) prospective losers and leave no one worse off, the alternate state is to be selected (Chipman, 1987, p. 524).  An example of a compensation principle is the Pareto criterion in which a change in states entails that such compensation is not merely feasible but required.  Two variants are:
In non-hypothetical contexts such that the compensation occurs (say in the marketplace), invoking the compensation principle is unnecessary to effect the change.  But its use is more controversial and complex with some losers (where full compensation is feasible but not made) and in selecting among more than two feasible social states.  In its specifics, it is also more controversial where the range of the decision rule itself is at issue.  
Uses for the compensation principle include:

A garpon is historically a local or regional  leader in Tibet and parts of Ladakh who has command and prominence over a district or area. He is highly regarded by the people and respected as a governor although his power and authority is informal in a given area. Ultimate leadership and spiritual leadership in Tibet was always given centrally to the Dalai Lama in the capital of Lhasa. Garpons were usually regarded as localized ministers to maintain district order.  However with the Chinese invasion of 1949 with Tibet now under the control of the People's Republic of China, the rulership of local district garpons has diminished somewhat in the Tibet Autonomous Region. Sir Edward Birkbeck Wakefield has cited that in Ladakh there was often a Senior Garpon and a Junior Garpon.Sir Edward Birkbeck Wakefield, Past Imperative (1966)
In the film Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film), a garpon in western Tibet was played by Samdup Dhargyal and was cited as being the eminent ruler of the province.

The Impossibles ([tpl]lang-th|ดิ อิมพอสซิเบิ้ล[/tpl]) was a well known Thai music or String (Thai pop) band that was active in the 1970s. 
The group's hits included "O Rak Kan Nhor" ("Come to love"), "Nai Wa Ja Jam" ("Who says this would be remembered"), "Chuen Rak" ("Cherish love"), "Thalay Mai Khoey Lap" ("Seas never sleep"), "Rak Chua Niran" ("Love forever"), "Khoy Nhong" ("Waiting for you"), "Nueng Nai Duang Jai" ("Only one in my heart") and "Penpai Mai Dai" ("Impossible").
The group was also known for its covers of Western rock songs. The Impossibles were among the first Thai pop bands to cover English-language songs and were the first Thai rock band to record an English-language album overseas, during a tour of Europe.
In addition to rock and pop, the band's sound frequently crossed over into funk, R&B, country and folk. They did two covers of Kool and the Gang tracks ("Give it up" and Love the life you live") in their 1975 album "Hot Pepper", an all-English lyrics recording. The band also performed in Thai films.
The band broke up in 1977, but it has frequently performed at reunions over the years, and its members remain active in music in Thailand.
Setha Sirichaya and other members of the band appeared in The Possible, a 2006 Thai film about a fictional musical group from 1969 called The Possible who supposedly were rivals of The Impossibles.

Saint Coloman of Stockerau (died  October 18, 1012), is a saint of the Catholic Church.
Originally known as Colmán (variously rendered Koloman, Kálmán, Colman, and Colomannus), he was an Irish pilgrim en route to the Holy Land "was mistaken for a spy because of his strange appearance, tortured, and hanged at Stockerau, near Vienna, Austria, on 16 July 1012. Later tradition has it that he was a son of Máel-Sechnaill (d. 1022), high king of Ireland." (Breen, 2009)
At the time of his death, there were continual skirmishes among Austria, Moravia, and Bohemia. Coloman spoke no German, so he could not give an understandable account of himself. He was hanged alongside several robbers.
According to Aidan Breen, "He was made a saint by the local people, possibly out of remorse for the deed and because of his endurance under torture and the many miracle reported from where his body was buried." (Breen, 2009)

The National Bloc ([tpl]lang-it|Blocco Nazionale[/tpl]) was a right-wing political coalition formed for the 1948 Italian general election formed by:
The alliance scored a poor 3.8% in the election for the House, while a 5.4% was reached for the Senate where the single-man constituencies and the age-restricted suffrage gave an advantage to this list formed by old pre-fascist politicians. The list generally suffered the concurrence of Christian Democracy, which was seen by centrist and right-wing electors as the sole shield against the Soviet-aligned Popular Democratic Front.
The alliance so disappeared soon, leaving only the Italian Liberal Party as party with some electoral support.

François Nodot (c. 1650-1710) was a mercenary soldier and author of works in Latin and French. He is best known as author of spurious supplements to the text of the Satyricon of Petronius.
In 1692 he announced to the French academies that he had a copy of previously unknown sections of the Satyricon. The copy had been made from a manuscript found by his friend Du Pin during the siege of Belgrade in 1688.
Nodot published a new edition of the Satyricon at Paris in 1693. The forgery was soon suspected, but texts and translations of the Satyricon continued to incorporate Nodot's supplements until the early 20th century.

Nicochares ([tpl]lang-el|Νικοχάρης[/tpl], died ca. 345 BC) was an Athenian poet of the Old Comedy, son of Philonides and contemporary with Aristophanes. The titles of  Nicochares' plays, as enumerated by Suidas, are, Αμυμωνη (Amymone), Πελοψ (Pelops), Γαλατεια (Galatea), Ηρακληs Γαμων (Hercules Getting Married), Ηρακληs Χορηγος (Hercules the Play-Producer), Κρητες (Cretans), Λακωνες (The Laconians), Λημνιαι (Lemnian Women), Κενταυροι (Centaurs), and Χειρογαστορες (Those Living Hand-to-Mouth). Although, as Augustus Meineke had ingeniously conjectured, the two first titles may merely be two different names from the same comedy, considering the fact that Πελοψ does not occur in its alphabetical place, and, in reference to the latter, the name "Oenomaüs" occurs in quotations from Αμυμωνη mentioned by Athenaeus.
From the extant fragments of Nicochares' work, one can only infer that he treated in the style of the Old Comedy—occasionally rising into tragic dignity. It is also evident that his comedies were influenced by the legends and local traditions of his country, and, undoubtedly, served to ridicule the peculiarities of the neighboring states.

He is particularly remembered for his defiance of the authorities over the creation of FK Sarajevo. When this team was created (as SD Torpedo) in 1946 by the merge of FK Udarnik and OFK Sloboda, several of the best players at FK Željezničar were ordered to play for the new club, to represent Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina at a national level. Despite the tough attitude of the new communist government towards dissent, Domorocki refused (even after the offer of a flat and two new suits, which was a serious incentive at that time), and continued to play for Željezničar, where he stayed for six years as a player, and then worked subsequently.
He was killed in a car accident in Split in 1992.

[[Pyrolant]]
CATEGORIES: Military technology, Pyrotechnic compositions

A pyrolant (from Greek pyros, fire) is an energetic material that generates hot flames upon combustion. Pyrolants are metal-based pyrotechnic compositions containing virtually any oxidizer.
The term was originally coined by Kuwahara in 1992,T. Kuwahara, T. Ochiachi, Burning Rate of Mg/TF Pyrolants, Proceedings of the 18th Int. Pyrotechnics Seminar, 1992, p. 539. in a paper on magnesium/Teflon/Viton, to distinguish between compositions that serve as propellants and those yielding hot flames which are not necessarily suitable for propellant purposes.  
The word thermite also refers to metal-oxidizer mixtures, and is used interchangeably with, and more commonly than, "pyrolant".  
A similar common term is propellant, which describes either a homogeneous or composite material that generates thrust upon combustion, but which may contain fuels instead of or in addition to the metals contained in thermites.
Metal-based pyrotechnic compositions, that is to say thermites or pyrolants, are generally characterized by high combustion temperatures (> 2000 K) and high amounts of condensed reaction products at equilibrium conditions such as metal oxides, fluorides and soot.

Jeff Goodwin is a professor of sociology at New York University. He holds a BA, MA (Sociology) and PhD (Sociology) from Harvard University.
His research interests include visual sociology, social movements, revolutions, political violence, and terrorism.  He is a past chair of the Comparative and Historical Sociology Section of the American Sociological Association (ASA).
The underlying argument of his most known book, No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991, is that revolutionary movements are not only a response to economic inequality or exploitation, but are also a response to political repression and violence.
Goodwin has written and edited a number of works with his friend and former NYU colleague James M. Jasper. They wrote a famous critique of the political-opportunity theory developed by Charles Tilly and Doug McAdam, republished in Rethinking Social Movements, which Goodwin and Jasper edited. They also edited The Contexts Reader (New York: W. W. Norton), Social Movements (Routledge), The Social Movements Reader (Wiley-Blackwell), and (with Francesca Polletta) Passionate Politics (University of Chicago Press), a leading work in the sociology of emotions.
In October 2011, Goodwin was one of 132 New York University (NYU) faculty and staff members who signed a statement calling for disinvestment in several American companies that do business in Israel. In response to sharp criticism from Congressman Gary Ackerman, Goodwin accused Ackerman of "moral blindness" and stated that "Ackerman's apparent denial that Israel is occupying Palestinian territories and systematically violating basic Palestinian rights is simply shocking."Rep.

The Haka Bowl was a proposed American college football game scheduled to be played in New Zealand in 1996. 
Named for the traditional Māori haka, and promoted by NFL linebacker Riki Ellison (who was born in New Zealand), the Haka Bowl was planned to be the first post-season bowl game to be played outside the United States in half a century, since the Bacardi Bowl in Cuba in 1946. The game (which also would be the first NCAA football game played in the Southern Hemisphere), was to have been held at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand, matching up the third place teams from the then Pacific-10 Conference (now the Pacific-12 Conference) and Western Athletic Conference (stopped playing football after the 2012-13 season).[tpl]cite news | last =Arace  | first =Joe  | title =College bowl lineup adds New Zealand | work =USA Today  | page =9C  | date =17 May 1995[/tpl] The payout for participating teams was set at $1.5 million, double the NCAA's standard minimum at that time, and the minimum payout set for an international game.
However the contest, scheduled for 27 December 1996, was never played: when the Haka Bowl committee could not come up with financial guarantees, the NCAA revoked the license for the game, and the idea died.[ref]

Often referred to as the "Poor Man's Magnum" the round has the unusual characteristic of having a rebated rim, one that is smaller in diameter than the case body.  This allowed it to be used in converted Mauser 98 magazine rifles with a standard (.30-06 size) magazine length and bolt face.

The team with the tipit can gain a point if they successfully hide the tipit from the other team. The team guessing where it is gains a point if they successfully find the tipit. There are three members of each team and each team has a captain, named the King or Queen. The guessing team can call "away" and point at a hand they think does not contain the tipit, or say "tipit" and point at a hand they think is hiding it.
The successful team retains or gains control of the tipit. The television version is played until one team has seven points.

In the TV version, the guessing team have three tactical choices, each can only be used once in the game:

The party became one of the six members of the National Liberation Committee which governed Italy during the war against Fascism from 1944 to 1946. After having fought the 1946 general election within the National Democratic Union, composed basically by Benedetto Croce's Italian Liberal Party and by pre-Fascist leading Liberal politicians, such as Vittorio Emanuele Orlando and Francesco Saverio Nitti, some members joined the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, of which Bonomi was honorary chairman from 1947 until his death in 1951, but also the Italian Socialist Party and, as independents, the Italian Communist Party and the Italian Liberal Party.

[[Mikhail Skorodumov]]
CATEGORIES: 1892 births, 1963 deaths, Russian generals, White Russian emigrants to the United States, Russian Corps personnel, White Russians (movement), Russian anti-communists

Mikhail Skorodumov ([tpl]lang-ru|Михаил Федорович Скородумов; 1892[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]15 November 1963, Los Angeles[/tpl]) was a Russian general who participated in World War I, the White movement, and founded the Nazi-allied Russian Corps in Serbia during World War II.
Skorodumov was born in 1892. He graduated the 1st Cadet Corps and the Pavlovsk Military Academy in 1912, as a sub-lieutenant of the Pavlovsk detachment. In 1914 with his detachment he was sent to the front. He was awarded the St. Vladimir order for bravery in battle, during which he was heavily wounded and consequently placed off duty. Skorodumov lobbied strongly to return to the front, and in 1915 was taken prisoner by the Germans. He unsuccessfully tried to escape three times, and after seven months of imprisonment returned to St. Petersburg in a prisoner exchange agreement (thanks partly to the lobbying of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna). He was awarded the Cross of St. George for bravery.
In the wake of the October Revolution Skorodumov joined an underground anti-Bolshevik officer's organization. Upon its discovery by the Reds, he fled to join the Volunteer Army in the south of Russia. He served in the army as an invalid wearing a prosthesis, and was additionally wounded in the leg during the siege of Kiev in 1919. After being interred in Poland he left for the army of General Pyotr Wrangel in the Crimea.
After Wrangel's defeat, Skorodumov evacuated with the army to Gallipoli, after which he moved to Bulgaria. As a commandant in the city of Lobech, he left with General Alexander Kutepov to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. There in Yugoslavia, Skorodumov built a memorial for the fallen Russian veterans of World War I.
In 1941, Skorodumov offered the German occupying forces in Yugoslavia to form the Russian Corps, an independent armed outfit of Russian white emigres with the purpose of defending the local Russian populace from the atrocities of communist guerillas. Skorodumov hoped that the Germans would agree to deploy the Corps on the Eastern front, where it would become the centre of a Russian anti-communist liberation movement. The German forces agreed to work with Skorodumov and appointed him as the head of the Russian Corps, only to be arrested by the Gestapo three days later for proclaiming the corps as an "independent" armed force. Skorodumov passed on command to Boris Shteifon, whom the Germans approved of.
After leaving jail, Skorodumov demonstratively refused to join the Corps and worked for three years as a cobbler. In 1944, Skorodumov decided to enlist in the Corps as a private, then went to Austria to save his family from the advancing communist armies. He moved to the United States and pleaded with the "Humanity Calls" organization to help the veterans of the Corps receive displaced person status, thus enabling them to seek refuge in the United States.
Skorodumov died in Los Angeles on November 15, 1963, and was buried in the Hollywood cemetery.

CATEGORIES: Anarcho-syndicalism, 1918 establishments in Germany, 1933 disestablishments in Germany, Anarchist organisations in Germany, National trade union centers of Germany, Trade unions established in the 1910s, Defunct trade unions of Germany

The Free Workers' Union of Germany ([tpl]Lang-de|Freie Arbeiter Union Deutschlands[/tpl]; FAUD) was an anarcho-syndicalist trade union in Germany.  It stemmed from the Free Association of German Trade Unions (FDVG) which combined with the Ruhr region's Freie Arbeiter Union on September 15, 1919.  The FAUD was involved in the revolution in Germany from 1918–1923, and continued to be involved in the German labor movement after the FAUD began to decline in 1923.  After 1921, the FAUD added an "AS" to their name, signifying a full transition from simple syndicalism to anarcho-syndicalism.  This also led to further difficulties between the intellectual elites of the FAUD (AS), such as Rudolf Rocker, and the rank and file workers, mostly in the Ruhr, who were more worried about "bread and butter" issues than political activities.  These workers, the majority of the FAUD-(AS) members, formed the :Gelsenkircherichtung (Gelsenkirche tendency) within the movement, and given the movements federalist structure, began to drift away from the FAUD-(AS) intellectually and organizationally.  Eventually, those workers who had joined during the revolution left the movement and the remaining FAUD-(AS) members came from the FDVG's original constituencies of the building trades and specialized textile workers. The Nazis suppressed the FAUD in January 1933 after coming to power.  However, many of its members continued to do political work illegally and organized resistance against the Nazi regime, both in Germany and elsewhere (see: Gruppe DAS and the revolution in Spain, 1936–1939). The International Workers Association, of which the FAUD was a member, was founded upon the initiative of the German organization in 1922. The Free Workers' Union (FAU), which was founded in 1977, sees itself in the tradition of the FAUD. At its peak, the FAUD had 150,000 members.  The primary organ of the FAUD was the newspaper Der Syndikalist, which was first published in December 1918, and continued until the groups suppression by the Nazis.Hans Manfred Bock, “Anarchosyndicalism in the German Labour Movement: a Rediscovered Minority Tradition.” In Revolutionary Syndicalism: An International Perspective, translated by Wayne Thorpe, 59–80 (Aldershot, England: Scolar Press, 1990) pp. 59-80; This text gives a general overview of the topic in English.

[[PJ & Duncan discography]]
CATEGORIES: Discographies of British artists, Ant & Dec, Pop music group discographies

This is a discography of official releases by the pop duo PJ & Duncan, who were later rebranded as Ant & Dec.
PJ & Duncan began their musical career in 1993 with the release of the single "Tonight I'm Free". This was followed in 1994 by their successful debut album Psyche, which included the single "Let's Get Ready to Rhumble". Their second album Top Katz (1995) was less commercially successful than Psyche although all its singles reached the UK Top 20. PJ & Duncan were rebranded as Ant & Dec in 1996, resulting in 1997's The Cult of Ant & Dec, their final album, which reached 15 in the UK charts. Their label, Telstar Records, decided not to renew their recording contract in 1997, and their career in music ended there. They reunited for live performances in 2000 and 2013 and for a single, "We're on the Ball", in 2002.

The Chickamauga Wars (1776–1794) were a series of raids, campaigns, ambushes, minor skirmishes, and several full-scale frontier battles which were a continuation of the Cherokee (Ani-Yunwiya, Ani-Kituwa, Tsalagi, Talligewi) struggle during and after the American Revolutionary War against encroachment by American frontiersmen from the former British colonies. Until the end of the Revolution, the Cherokee fought in part as British allies. After 1786, they also fought along with and as members of the Western Confederacy, organized by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, in an effort to repulse European-American settlers from the area west of the Appalachian Mountains.
Open warfare broke out in the summer of 1776 between the Cherokee led by Dragging Canoe  and frontier settlers along the Watauga, Holston, Nolichucky, and Doe rivers in East Tennessee.  (The colonials first referred to these Cherokee as the "Chickamauga" or "Chickamauga-Cherokee," and later as the "Lower Cherokee".)  The warfare spread to settlers along the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee and in Kentucky, as well as to the colonies (later states) of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.
The earliest phase of the conflicts, ending with the treaties of 1777, is sometimes called the "Second Cherokee War", a reference to the earlier Anglo-Cherokee War. Since Dragging Canoe was the dominant leader in both phases of the conflict, the period is sometimes called "Dragging Canoe's War." 
Dragging Canoe and his forces fought alongside with American Indians from several other tribes, both in the South and in the Northwest: Muscogee Creek and Shawnee, respectively.  They had the support of, first, the British (often with participation of British agents and regular soldiers) and, second, the Spanish. The Cherokee were among the founding members of the Native Americans' Western Confederacy.
Though the Americans identified the followers of Dragging Canoe as "Chickamauga" as distinct from Cherokee who abided by the peace treaties of 1777, there was no separate tribe or band known as "Chickamauga".  They identified as Cherokee.Allen Manuscript. Note: Richard Fields, a mixed-race Cherokee, explained this to the Moravian missionary Brother Steiner, when they met at Tellico Blockhouse.

Its first leaders were rector Barbu Lăzăreanu, a literature professor, and secretary Constantin Ionescu-Gulian, a Stalinist philosopher. The name Ştefan Gheorghiu was added on February 10, 1946, in memory of an early 20th-century Romanian social-democrat.
Another school with much the same purpose, Şcoala Superioară de Ştiinţe Sociale  A. A. Jdanov (A. A. Jdanov Upper School of Social Sciences), was created separately; the two eventually merged.

[[Architype Renner]]
CATEGORIES: Geometric sans-serif typefaces, Lowercase numerals typefaces

Architype Renner is a geometric sans-serif typeface reproducing the experimental alternate characters of Paul Renner's 1927–29 typeface Futura for the Bauer foundry. Renner's original design for Futura shows the influence of Herbert Bayer's experimental "Universal" alphabet. The alternate characters Renner proposed for Futura were mostly deleted from the face's character set, resulting in a more conventional, and perhaps more economically successful typeface. 
Alternate characters were drawn for lowercase a, g, and r, and for some punctuation, and uppercase characters including German accents. Both lining and text figures were produced. The Renner Architype typeface is one of a collection of several revivals of early twentieth century typographic experimentation designed by Freda Sack and David Quay of The Foundry.

The Italian Reform Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Riformista Italiano, PSRI) was a social-democratic political party in Italy.
It was formed in 1912 by those leading reformists who had been expelled from the Italian Socialist Party because of their desire of entering in the majority supporting Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti. Leading members of the PSRI were Leonida Bissolati, Giacomo Matteotti, Ivanoe Bonomi and Meuccio Ruini.Massimo L. Salvadori, Enciclopedia storica, Zanichelli, Bologna 2000 In the 1913 general election the party won 2.6% of the vote and 21 seats in single-seat constituencies spread in almost all the Italian regions (some others such as Ruini were elected for the RadicalsDavid Busato, Il Partito Radicale in Italia da Mario Pannunzio a Marco Pannella, 1996), while in 1919 they stopped at 1.5% and gained only 15 seats under the new proportional system.Piergiorgio Corbetta; Maria Serena Piretti, Atlante storico-elettorale d'Italia, Zanichelli, Bologna 2009
After World War II Bonomi and Ruini launched the Labour Democratic Party as the continuation of the PSRI and positioned it within the National Democratic Union, that comprised the Liberals and some former Radicals.

Chaos Days (German: Chaos-Tage) was an annual punk manifestation, often violent, held in Hanover, Germany starting in 1982 and reviving in the mid-1990s.[tpl]cite news|title=German Punks turn 'Chaos Days' into an orgy of violence|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/german-punks-turn-chaos-days-into-an-orgy-of-violence-1595163.html|accessdate=5 June 2010 | location=London | work=The Independent | date=7 August 1995[/tpl]
Chaos-Tage was a West German punk scene phenomenon which began in the mid-1980s in Hanover and Wuppertal and consisted of meetings of punks from all over the country. The reason for these meetings were a plan of the Police to register and build up reference data of everyone who was deemed a 'Punk'. This included taking pictures of each individual.
The most well-known "chaos days" took place in Hanover in 1994 and 1995[tpl]cite news|title=Chaos Days|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19950805&id=wwASAAAAIBAJ&sjid=seoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1246,887696|accessdate=5 June 2010|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|date=5 August 1995[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and resulted in huge riots and the destruction of cars and buildings. A whole supermarket was damaged and alcoholic beverages were stolen by punks. These "chaos days" were the main topic of TV debates and newspapers for several weeks. Popular bands like WIZO spontaneously played a show there, and Terrorgruppe wrote a now-classic song about it ("Wochenendticket", named after a train ticket that most punks used in order to get to Hanover from all across the country).
Chaos Days USA
Chaos Days were organized in the United States in 1995 and 1996, to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area during the same period of time as the German Chaos Days.

[[Margareth Menezes]]

CATEGORIES: 1962 births, Living people, Brazilian female singers, People from Salvador, Bahia, Brazilian Candomblés

Margareth Menezes (born October 13, 1962) is a Brazilian singer from Salvador, Bahia. 
Her style is considered axé but her music also steers into samba and MPB territory, at times drawing on African rhythms and reggae.
Menezes is best known in Brazil for her song "Me Abraça e Me Beija", a major hit in 1990. She also scored another hit with "Dandalunda", a song which became the unofficial anthem of the 2003 Salvador carnival.
Menezes has achieved superstardom in her native Bahia but only moderate success in wider Brazil. She is famed for her energetic live performances and regularly tours and performs at carnival celebrations.
In 1990, one of Menezes's tracks "Elegibô (Uma Historia De Ifa)" was used in the Mickey Rourke film Wild Orchid. This prompted Island Records in the US to release a compilation album of some of her older material from Brazil on their subsidiary label, Mango. The album, simply titled Elegibô, was an instant hit, reaching # 1 on the Billboard World Music chart at a time when David Byrne was championing Brazilian music in the US. The title track itself became a regular staple at clubs playing so-called world music throughout the US and Europe. The album also received a full release in the UK, Germany and France. A single, "Tenda do Amor", was also released from the album in some European territories. Menezes toured internationally on the back of this album, generating a lot of press in the process. A second US-released follow-up album Kindala, released late 1991, but repackaged in some territories from the Brazilian version of the same name, also achieved some success. This release also gave Menezes a minor hit album in France too.
In 2001, Menezes released the highly acclaimed Afropopbrasileiro (also known as "Maga") showcasing her trademark fusion of afro-Brazilian beats. The album was produced by Carlinhos Brown of Tribalistas fame and was well received in Brazil and internationally.
Menezes also co-wrote and performed on the 2003 Tribalistas hit "Passe Em Casa", from the million-selling Tribalistas album.
Her 2005 single, "Como Tu", a duet with Brazilian superstar Ivete Sangalo was released amidst much hype because Sangalo was achieving platinum album sales at the time. The track reached the lower reaches of the airplay Top 30 in Brazil but failed to emulate the success of recent Sangalo hits. The hit single was lifted from Menezes' 2005 album release Pra Você; the album received lukewarm reviews, possibly owing to a more poppier sound than previous releases. A second single, the reggae-tinged "Miragem na esquina" performed poorly at radio.
In 2006, the album Pra Você received a Grammy nomination for "Best Brazilian Contemporary Pop Album".
More recently, Menezes participated on the track "Beijo Descarado" by Timbalada which achieved some airplay success in Brazil during the 2007 Carnival celebrations.
In 2010, an acoustic version of her 2008 album Naturalmente was released. The album was recorded at Ilha dos Sapos and featured guests like Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown and Portuguese singer Luis Represas.
Menezes remains one of the most dynamic and popular of the contemporary Brazilian artists achieving international recognition.

[[Couch Flambeau]]

CATEGORIES: American punk rock groups, Musical groups from Wisconsin

Couch Flambeau is an American punk rock band, formed in 1981 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The band is known for the biting wit of their lyrics.  They have released four full length albums: Mammal Insect Marriage (1983) (on Ludwig Van Ear Records), The Day the Music Died (1985) and Ghostride (1989) (both on  It's Only a Record Records), and a self-titled CD (1998). They have also released two tapes, Curiosity Rocks (1982 - allegedly recorded in only 6 hours) and Rock With Your Sock On (1987), as well as an EP, Models (1987). And, finally, a 37 song career overview entitled I Did a Power Slide in the Taco Stand: Anthology 1982-2001 was released in 2004.
Steve Albini, the famed punk rock musician and recording engineer, said the group played "good funny music".  Albini also played with Tiller in the band Army.
The band line-up as of 2004 was Jay Tiller on vocals and guitar, Neil Socol on bass, and Rusty on drums.
Couch Flambeau was formed by two Greendale, WI High School friends, guitarist Jay Tiller and drummer Ron Faiola (aka Ron Ford/Giant Wow) in 1980. Their first shows were in the fall of 1981 at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee's dormitories under the name Couch Potatoes. For these shows, Tiller and Faiola would wear pyjamas and paper bags over their heads while playing early versions of songs that ended up on the first Couch Potatoes release, Curiosity Rocks.
By the spring of 1982, bassist Neil Socol was added to the lineup and the Couch Potatoes played an early gig at the Starship, one of only two Milwaukee punk clubs. Two songs ("Mobile Home" and "I'm a Waiter") recorded at that show became DJ favorites on the fledgling college radio station WMSE. Constant airplay earned the Couch Potatoes a large cult following in Milwaukee, which led to more local shows and the recording of the "Curiosity Rocks" cassette release in the fall of 1982.
Eventually the band decided to replace the name Couch Potatoes (based on characters in a Robert Armstrong "Mickey Rat" comic book) with a more "original" name.  Faiola came up with Couch Flambeau after seeing a Canadian fire prevention movie where a cat goes looking for "mouse flambeau."
1982 to 1986 were the band's most active years in Milwaukee, which found them headlining clubs and opening concerts for the Violent Femmes, The Replacements, The Damned, and the Butthole Surfers.   They also introduced Evanston, Illinois's Big Black to Milwaukee audiences at the legendary Cafe Voltaire.
During the Models sessions in 1986, Faiola left the band to pursue a film career and Madison, Wisconsin drummer Meredith Young (Appliances SFB) played a few shows with Couch Flambeau until Tiller's art school friend Joe Hausch joined in late 1986. While Hausch played the live Flambeau shows, Tiller played the drums on studio recordings. Hausch left the band in late 1994 and current drummer Rusty has been with Flambeau since then.
Eventually, Tiller became a State Sheriff for the state of Wisconsin.

Martin Reynolds (Martin Edward Reynolds; born 22 February 1949) is a former British athlete who competed mainly in the 200 metres. He had to switch to the 400 metres in the Olympic year which was also the year of his final exams at university. He found trying to combine training and studying for exams too much and lost a little of his speed in trying to compress his final training into the period after exams. He actually completed more 400 metres events at Munich than he had done in his entire career up to that point. There should be some stats available on the previous 2 years which will show he dominated the UK 200 metres rankings in several years prior to 1972.
He competed for Great Britain at the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich, Germany where he won the silver medal with his team mates Alan Pascoe, David Hemery and David Jenkins in the men's 4x400 metres relay event.

Cornell successfully marketed Hyde Park as an affluent suburb and resort area.  Hyde Park retained this image until the 1930s.Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 The Encyclopedia of Chicago, p. 404. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9  The hotel not only served as host to affluent Chicagoans with leisure time and discretionary income, but also served as host to visiting dignitaries.  Mary Todd Lincoln brought her sons, Robert and Tad, there after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln where they stayed for two and half months before moving downtown.Host, William R. and Brooke Ahne Portmann, "Early Chicago Hotels," Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 98., ISBN 0-7385-4041-2.  It also served as host to Prince of Wales, Albert Edward during his 1860 visit to Chicago.
The hotel also served as lodging for those studying new home sites in the region and for those overseeing new residential construction.

Berthold (died 12 August 1204)Berthold IV von Andechs (c.1159 - 1204), accessed 2 November 2011 was the Count of Andechs (as Berthold IV, from 1172) and first Duke of Merania (from 1183), that is, the seacoast of Dalmatia and Istria. In 1188 he was appointed as margrave of Istria and from 1180 to 1182 he was duke of Croatia and Dalmatia.
In 1175, he was raised to the margraviate of Istria and then years later (1185) made the duke of the region called "Merania" after the Adriatic Sea (mare is Latin for "sea"). Merania encompassed the same area as the old margraviate, but its ruler now gained much prestige from his new title.
In 1186, he accompanied the Emperor Henry VI to the Kingdom of Sicily.  In 1189, he led the third division of the imperial army and was its standard-bearer on the Third Crusade. In 1195, he appeared as the advocate of Tegernsee Abbey. After Henry's death in 1197, he sided with the claimant Philip of Swabia. At this juncture, the duke of Merania was at the height of his power and influence. He possessed lands from Franconia to the Adriatic.
Berthold died in 1204 and was buried in Diessen.

Burston is a village in Norfolk, England, 3 miles (4.5 km) north of Diss. It covers an area of [tpl]convert|9.17|km2[/tpl] and had a population of 538 in 206 households at the 2001 census.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.south-norfolk.gov.uk/democracy/burston_parish.asp|title=Burston & Shimpling parish information|date=23 July 2008|accessdate=20 June 2009[/tpl] Burston is famous as the site of the Burston Strike School, the longest strike in British history.
In 1949 the Strike School building was registered as an educational charity. There are 4 self-perpetuating trustees who manage the school and try to develop it as a museum, visitor centre, educational archive and village amenity.  A rally to commemorate the school and the longest strike in UK history has been organised on the first Sunday in September every year since 1984 by the Transport and General Workers' Union and supported by other unions.
St Mary's church, though recognised as not the most exciting or interesting church in Norfolk,http://www.norfolkchurches.co.uk/burston/burston.htm is notable for the role played in the Burston strike by its rector, the Reverend Charles Tucker Eland.  The tower collapsed in the 18th century, and with the nave and chancel altered in Victorian times, it has something of the appearance of a barn. The church stands in a tree shaded graveyard, in which are the graves of Kitty Higdon and Tom Higdon, the teachers at the centre of the school strike.  With a declining congregation, St Mary is now used partly as a school hall.  The modern chance is housed in the chancel, behind an iron screen separating it from the nave. The church is a grade II* listed building  [tpl]cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1305672| title=  Name: CHURCH OF ST MARY List entry Number: 1305672 |publisher= English Heritage|accessdate = 25 March 2014[/tpl]

[[System high mode]]

CATEGORIES: Computer security procedures

System high mode, or simply system high, is a security mode of using an automated information system (AIS) that pertains to an environment that contains restricted data that is classified in a hierarchical scheme, such as Top Secret, Secret and Unclassified.  System high pertains to the IA features of information processed, and specifically not to the strength or trustworthiness of the system.  
System high mode is distinguished from other modes (such as multilevel security) by its lack of need for the system to contribute to the protection or separation unequal security classifications.  In particular, this precludes use of the features of objects (e.g. content or format) produced by or exposed to an IAS operating in system high mode as criteria to securely downgrade those objects.  As a result, all information in a system high AIS is treated as if it were classified at the highest security level of any data in the AIS. For example, Unclassified information can exist in a secret system high computer but it must be treated as secret, therefore it can never be shared with unclassified destinations (unless downgraded by reliable human review, which itself is risky because of lack of omniscient humans.) There is no known technology to securely declassify system high information by automated means because no reliable features of the data can be trusted after having been potentially corrupted by the system high host. When unreliable means are used (including cross-domain solutions and bypass guards) a serious risk of system exploitation via the bypass is introduced. Nevertheless, it has been done where the resulting risk is overlooked or accepted.

St. George Rathborne Prolific American dime novelist and series book author.  Likely produced in excess of 330 volumes of fiction in the course of a 60 year career.  He had a strong proclivity for and obvious skill in producing outdoor adventure stories, and his best works fall within that category. 
Born Covington, Kentucky, December 26, 1854 to Gorges Lowther Rathborne and Margaret H. Robertson Rathborne.  Graduate of Woodward High School, Cincinnati, Ohio, the oldest public high school in the United States.  Married the former Jessie Fremont Conn in 1879, and with her fathered 4 children.  Resided in northern New Jersey for most of his adult life.  Died Newark, New Jersey, December 16, 1938.
Affiliated with various dime novel publishers over the course of four decades, but most strongly associated with Street & Smith, with whom he spent 20 years as author and editor.  After 1910, he wrote almost exclusively in the juvenile series book genre.  Frequently wrote under pseudonyms, and such works account for the bulk of his literary output.  His pseudonyms are many and poorly documented, and some remain unidentified.  He likely utilized at least 30 different pen names in his career as a dime novelist, and more than 20 others during his years of series book writing.  Poor documentation of his pseudonyms makes the attribution of his works occasionally difficult, and the full extent of his published writings may never be known.  There are more liberal estimates of his output, and it is possible that he produced as many as 450 novels.http://www.ulib.niu.edu/badndp/rathborne_george.html

frame|right|The arms as used in the Council's former logothumb|left|200px|The arms as used prior to 1921The Coat of arms of Leeds City Council derives its design from the seventeenth century. In 1662 the Borough of Leeds received a new charter which created the office of mayor, and the arms (the shield alone) seems to date from about this time as they incorporate part of the arms of the first mayor. These arms were recorded at the heraldic visitation of Yorkshire in 1666. By the time that the borough was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, silver owls had been added both as crest above the shield, and as supporters on either side. These additions were not authorised, however, and in 1920 application was made by Leeds County Borough Council to the College of Arms to have these additions officially granted. In the following year the grant of crest and supporters was made, with the colouring of the owls altered to "proper", or natural colourings. Gold ducal coronets were added to the supporters for further heraldic difference.Letters patent dated November 7, 1921
In 1974, the county borough was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of a much larger Metropolitan District of Leeds. The new Leeds City Council continues to use the arms of its predecessor, but to date no application has been made for the formal transfer of the armorial bearings.

[[Active suspension]]
CATEGORIES: Automotive suspension technologies

The active suspension and adaptive suspension/semi-active suspension are types of automotive suspensions that controls the vertical movement of the wheels with an onboard system, rather than in passive suspensions where the movement is being determined entirely by the road surface. Active suspensions can be generally divided into two main classes: pure active suspensions and adaptive/semi-active suspensions. While adaptive suspensions only vary shock absorber firmness to match changing road or dynamic conditions, active suspensions uses some type of actuator to literally raise and lower the chassis independently at each wheel. 
These technologies allows car manufacturers to achieve a greater degree of ride quality and car handling by keeping the tires perpendicular to the road in corners, allowing better traction and control. An onboard computer detects body movement from sensors throughout the vehicle and, using data calculated by opportune control techniques, controls the action of the active and semi-active suspensions. The system virtually eliminates body roll and pitch variation in many driving situations including cornering, accelerating, and braking.

Riley, who grew up on the south side of Chicago, was moved along with his brother to the peaceful, predominately white suburb of Woodcrest in Baltimore, Maryland  by their granddad. In some episodes, Riley and Huey would have a single storyline and in others, the two would each have their own in a single episode. Riley, like Huey, is voiced by Regina King. It is strongly suggested that Huey and Riley's birth parents are deceased. This is, in part, based on Robert's dialog from the first episode stating that he spent the boys' "inheritance" on their new house in Woodcrest. In "Riley Wuz Here", a later episode in season one, his parents being deceased is further hinted at when Riley spray-paints the Freeman house with a picture of his parents after his art teacher suggests that he "...paint someone you love. Maybe someone who's not with us anymore.".

[[Shared resource]]

CATEGORIES: Application layer protocols, Computer storage, Local area networks, Network file systems

In computing, a shared resource, or network share, is a computer resource made available from one host to other hosts on a computer network. Some examples of shareable resources are computer programs, data, storage devices, and printers. Network sharing is made possible by inter-process communication over the network.
In computing, a shared resource or network share is a device or piece of information on a computer that can be remotely accessed from another computer, typically via a local area network or an enterprise Intranet, transparently as if it were a resource in the local machine.
Examples are shared file access (also known as disk sharing and folder sharing), shared printer access (printer sharing), shared scanner access, etc. The shared resource is called a shared disk (also known as mounted disk), shared drive volume, shared folder, shared file, shared document, shared printer or shared scanner.
The term file sharing traditionally means shared file access, especially in the context of operating systems and LAN and Intranet services, for example in Microsoft Windows documentation.Microsoft Technet, File and Printer Sharing in Windows Vista, May 14, 2007 Though, as BitTorrent and similar applications became available in the early 2000s, the term file sharing increasingly has become associated with peer-to-peer file sharing over the Internet.

[[Situationism (psychology)]]

CATEGORIES: Personality theories

Situationism is a theory in psychology that began in 1968 when a Person-situation debate was triggered by the publication of a monograph by Walter Mischel.Andrew Colman, What is Psychology?, p.98
It refers to an approach to behavior which holds that general traits do not exist (perhaps apart from Intelligence). Behavior, then, is seen as being influenced by external, situational factors rather than internal traits or motivations. It therefore challenged the position of trait theorists, such as Hans Eysenck or Raymond B. Cattell.
Situationists based their claims on experiments in which traits such as extraversion were estimated based on behavior in different situations. They found that a particular person's ratings in one situation were not highly predictive of that person's score in another situation. However, in response to such evidence, Hans Eysenck has pointed out that the correlations, while low, are typically still high enough to reach statistical significance. A midrange position, which holds that personality is best understood as resulting from "subtle interplay" of internal and external factors, is known as "interactionism".
Some notable situationist studies include: Zimbardo's Stanford prison experiment, bystander experiments, obedience experiments like Milgram experiment and heat and aggression experiments. The term is popularly associated with Walter Mischel, although he himself does not appear to like the term.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

[[United States cities by crime rate (60,000–100,000)]]
CATEGORIES: Crime rates in the United States

The following table is based on Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports statistics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010|publisher=FBI|title=Crime in the United States by Metropolitan Statistical Area, 2010 (Table 6)|accessdate=20 September 2011[/tpl]   
The population numbers are based on U.S. Census estimates for the year end.  The number of murders includes nonnegligent manslaughter.  This list is based on the reporting agency.  In most cases the city and the reporting agency are identical.  However, in some cases such as Charlotte, Honolulu and Las Vegas, the reporting agency as more than one city.
Murder is the only statistic that all agencies are required to report.  Consequently some agencies do not report all the crimes.  If components are missing the total is adjusted to "0."

Tom Clay (August 20, 1929 – November 22, 1995) was an American radio personality and disc jockey.
Clay was born Thomas Clague in New York, and in the 1950s he was popular in the Detroit area on WJBK-AM both as a DJ, and for his on-air comic characterizations; he became a local celebrity.  In the mid-1950s he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and was equally popular.
He was caught up in the payola scandal of late 1950s, and admitted to having accepted thousands of dollars for playing certain records. After being fired from WJBK, Clay worked at the short-lived Detroit Top 40 station WQTE (now WRDT) only to be fired again when the station changed format to easy listening music in 1961. After moving to Los Angeles and becoming a popular personality on KDAY and KRLA, Clay returned to the Detroit area and found work at CKLW in neighboring Windsor, Ontario, at the time one of the foremost Top 40 AM stations in North America.
According to the book Rockin' Down the Dial, a history of Detroit Top 40 radio of the 1950s and 1960s by David Carson, Clay became friendly with Marilyn Monroe during his time in Los Angeles working for KRLA. Clay's daughter, Kimberly, told Carson that her father never revealed much about his friendship with Monroe, but would only say that she seemed very lonely.
Riding the wave of early Beatlemania he again rose in popularity, met and interviewed The Beatles. He was fired over a scheme in which he invited listeners to send in one dollar for membership in a "Beatles Booster Club", an essentially non-existent organization which had no benefits beyond a promised membership card or decal. According to fellow CKLW DJ Dave Shafer (also now deceased), Clay also promised each listener who sent in a dollar a personal item used by one of the Beatles; these "personal items" turned out to be items such as cigarette butts and used tissues, and other listeners claimed to have received nothing.  However, since over 80,000 fans responded, Clay was able to live comfortably for a time on the cash that appeared in his personal post office box. Dave Shafer told David Carson in Rockin' Down the Dial that Clay skipped town in the wake of the Beatles Booster fiasco, leading to Shafer's being briefly jailed on charges of international fraud. Clay eventually returned to work at other Detroit area radio stations, including WWWW-FM, and also worked at WCBS-FM in New York. In 1984, he played pop standards at KPRZ, Los Angeles.
Clay is best remembered for his single on Motown's MoWest label "What the World Needs Now Is Love"/"Abraham, Martin and John" (MoWest MW5002F), a compilation of clips from the two popular records, interviews, and speeches of Jack and Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King emphasizing tolerance and civil rights. It went to #8 on the Billboard Hot 100. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.
A follow-up album had respectable sales, but another single, "Whatever Happened To Love" (MoWest MW5007F), flopped, and Clay found himself unemployed.  Both songs were featured on the MoWest album What The World Needs Now (MS 103-L, released August 1971). Clay finished his career doing voiceover work.
Clay died of stomach and lung cancer at the age of 66, in Valley Village, Los Angeles, California in 1995.

</ref> Only described as a separate species in 2001, they are thought to have originated from isolation of individuals of the mainland population of [[brown-throated three-toed sloth]]s. The population became a distinct species through [[insular dwarfism]] on the island.
Studies suggest an inverse, linear relationship between mean body sizes and age of the island for island populations of sloths in this region.

CATEGORIES: Graph families

In the mathematical area of graph theory, a triangle-free graph is an undirected graph in which no three vertices form a triangle of edges. Triangle-free graphs may be equivalently defined as graphs with clique number ≤ 2, graphs with girth ≥ 4, graphs with no induced 3-cycle, or locally independent graphs.
By Turán's theorem, the n-vertex triangle-free graph with the maximum number of edges is a complete bipartite graph in which the numbers of vertices on each side of the bipartition are as equal as possible.

Grace Methodist Episcopal Church was formed for English speaking Methodists in Newport to worship. It is located at 111 East 6th Street in Newport, Kentucky.
In 1806, a small class of Methodists was formed in Newport at the house of Jonathan Huling, the tavern located at the southeast corner of Fourth and Columbia streets.  The members were:  Dr. Thomas Hinde, Mary Todd Hinde, Patsey Hinde, Ann Winston Hinde Southgate, Maria Lindsey, Clarissa Hulin, Eliza Butler, Susanna Butler, Rachel Ritterhouse, Margaret Martin, Ann R S Martin and Susanna W Martin. Out of this meeting grew the first Methodist Church in Newport.

The time given for the completion of the building "on or before August next".  This became the first Methodist Episcopal Church in Newport, built on the lot where Saint Paul's Episcopal Church now stands, 7 Court Place, opposite the Campbell County Court House.

[tpl]MedalCountry|[tpl]USA[/tpl][/tpl]
Clarence Darrow Hooper (born 30 January 1932) is an American athlete who competed mainly in the shot put.
In 1949 he graduated from North Side High School in Fort Worth, Texas, and went on to attend Texas A&M University. He won the NCAA shot put title in 1951. By the time he graduated from college, he had a wife and two children. He competed for the United States in the 1952 Summer Olympics held in Helsinki, Finland in the shot put. Hooper's last throw was just two centimeters away from winning the gold medal: Parry O’Brien's shot put measured 17.41 (57' 1 1/2"), while Hooper's measured 17.39m (57' 3/4") Hooper won the silver medal.http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1952/ATH/mens-shot-put.html
In the Olympic trials, Hooper had beaten O'Brien with an almost mirror image of the Olympics, 17.41m listed as (57' 1 3/8")  while O'Brien shot putted 17.38 (57' 1/2").  It was O'Brien's last defeat before an unprecedented 116 straight victories over the next 3 years, 364 days.http://www.usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdfhttp://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/23/local/me-obrien23  Both athletes left Jim Fuchs, the World Record holder at the time, relegated to third place with a 17.36m.  That ended Fuchs' string of 88 consecutive victories that dated back to 1949.

[[Amadori rearrangement]]
CATEGORIES: Rearrangement reactions, Posttranslational modification, Name reactions

The Amadori rearrangement is an organic reaction describing the acid or base catalyzed isomerization or rearrangement reaction of the N-glycoside of an aldose or the glycosylamine to the corresponding 1-amino-1-deoxy-ketose.M. Amadori, Atti. reale accad. nazl. Lincei, 6 2, 337 (1925); 6 9, 68, 226 (1929); 6 13, 72 (1931)Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis (Paperback) by Laszlo Kurti,  BN 0-12-429785-4  The reaction is important in carbohydrate chemistry.
The reaction mechanism is demonstrated starting from the reaction of D-mannose in its closed (1) and open-form (2) with ammonia to produce the 1,1-amino-alcohol (3), which is unstable and loses water to the glycosylamine (again the open imine (5) and the closed form hemiaminal (4)), which is the starting point for the actual Amadori rearrangement.Mutarotation, Hydrolysis, and Rearrangement Reactions of Glycosylamines HORACE S. ISBELL and HARRIET L. FRUSH J. Org. Chem. 1958, 23(9), 1309 - 1319. ([tpl]DOI|10.1021/jo01103a019[/tpl])
By treatment of the glycosylamine with pyridine and acetic anhydride, the imine group rearranges and the intermediate enol, in turn, rearranges to the ketone. In this particular reaction, all the alcohol and amino groups are acylated as well.
The reaction is associated with the Maillard reaction in which the reagents are naturally occurring sugars and amino acids.

Merrill Denison (23 June 1893 — 13 June 1975) was a Canadian playwright.
Born in Detroit and raised in Ontario, Denison was the son of an American mother (who was described as a United Empire Loyalist), and his father was of American Revolutionary stock.Inferiority Complex: An Address by Merrill Denison, F.R.S.A.''
In 1921, after pursuing studies in architecture, he became Art Director of Hart House Theatre, Toronto. In 1926 he married Jessie Muriel Goggin. Denison soon began to write comedies, some of which were conceived at his summer home in Bon Echo and performed in the Tweed Playhouse in Tweed, Ontario. As author of The Romance of Canada, a highly successful series of historical plays broadcast in 1931 and 1932, he received wide acclaim as a pioneer in radio drama. During the decades that followed he devoted his energies to this field, preparing numerous plays for broadcast in the United States.
Increasingly interested in business history, during the 1950s and 60s Denison wrote several popular histories of Canadian corporations, including Harvest Triumphant: The Story of Massey-Harris.

Kuksu, also called the Kuksu Cult, was a religion in Northern California practiced by members within several Indigenous peoples of California before and during contact with the arriving European settlers. The religious belief system was held by several tribes in Central California and Northern California, from the Sacramento Valley west to the Pacific Ocean.
The practice of Kuksu religion included elaborate narrative ceremonial dances and specific regalia. The men of the tribe practiced rituals to ensure good health, bountiful harvests, hunts, fertility, and good weather. Ceremonies included an annual mourning ceremony, rites of passage, and intervention with the spirit world. A male secret society met in underground dance rooms and danced in disguises at the public dances.Kroeber, Alfred L. The Religion of the Indians of California, 1907.The Kuksu Cult paraphrased from Kroeber. 
Kuksu has been identified archaeologically by the discovery of underground dance rooms and wooden dance drums.

CATEGORIES: Native Americans in art, Photographic collections and books

The Indian Picture Opera is a magic lantern slide show by photographer Edward S. Curtis. In the early 1900s, Curtis published the renowned 20-volume book subscription entitled "The North American Indian". He compiled about 2400 photographs with detailed ethnological and language studies of tribes of the American West.
In 1911, in an effort to promote his book sales, Curtis created a traveling Magic Lantern slide show "The Indian Picture Opera".
Stereo-Opticon projectors put Curtis's stunning images on screens in America's largest cities.... one scene dissolving into another. A small orchestra played music derived from Indian chants and rhythms, and Edward Curtis lectured on the intimate stories of tribal life. 
This Magic Lantern show played to breathless audiences, stunned by the humanity, fascinated by the imagery, and shamed by the destruction of Indian cultures. The shows received standing ovations, and generous reviews.
Curtis went on to Produce and Direct "In the Land of the Head Hunters" in 1914. This production was a full length documentary motion picture of aboriginal North Americans.
In 2006 there was a contemporary remake of the Picture Opera, published on DVD. Following the original script, images and music were reconstituted into a modern day multi-media production of The Indian Picture Opera.

Nazko Cone is a small potentially active basaltic cinder cone in central British Columbia, Canada, located 75 km west of Quesnel and 150 kilometers southwest of Prince George. It is considered the easternmost volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt. The small tree-covered cone rises 120 m above the Chilcotin-Nechako Plateau and rests on glacial till. It was formed in three episodes of activity, the first of which took place during the Pleistocene interglacial stage about 340,000 years ago. The second stage produced a large hyaloclastite scoria mound erupted beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Pleistocene. Its last eruption produced two small lava flows that traveled 1 km to the west, along with a blanket of volcanic ash that extends several km to the north and east of the cone.

All first-class cricket was cancelled in the 1940 to 1944 English cricket seasons because of the Second World War; no first-class matches were played in England after Friday, 1 September 1939 until Saturday, 19 May 1945. 
Ten matches were cancelled at the end of the 1939 English cricket season due to the German invasion of Poland on 1 September and the British government's declaration of war against Germany on Sunday 3 September.  
Although eleven first-class matches were arranged during the 1945 season, following the final defeat of Germany in early May, it was not until the 1946 season that normal fixtures, including the County Championship and Minor Counties Championship, could resume. In contrast with much of the First World War, it was realised in the 1940s that cricket had its part to play in terms of raising both public morale and funds for charity. Efforts were made to stage matches whenever opportunity arose, especially if a suitable number of top players could be assembled. From the summer of 1941 onwards, teams such as the British Empire Eleven toured the country raising money for war charities.
At league cricket level, playing one-day matches, many competitions continued throughout the war: e.g., the Birmingham League, the Bradford League and the Lancashire League.Birley, pp.267–268.
Successful wartime players included Laurie Fishlock, Eric Hollies and Eddie Paynter.Andrews, pp.57, 157, 160.

Lazarus Laughed is a play by Eugene O'Neill written in 1925. Its sub-title was A Play for Imaginative Theatre. It is a long theo-philosophical meditation with more than a hundred actors making up a masked chorus. In theatrical format, Lazarus Laughed appears to be a Greek tragedy. But the underlying message is similar to the mystery plays from the Middle Ages. O'Neill's play, The Great God Brown, can be considered as an introduction to this play.Winther, Sophus Keith, "Eugene O'Neill: A Critical Study", cf. chapter IV, "The Pagan Way of Life", pp. 95-113.

[[World Elephant]]

CATEGORIES: World-bearing animals, Hindu legendary creatures, Legendary mammals, Fictional elephants

Classical Sanskrit literature has references to World Elephants as mythical animals supporting the world in Hindu cosmology. This image augments the stock of mythological world-bearers over the earlier World Turtle (Kurmaraja) and World Serpent (Nagaraja or Shesha).
Indeed, Wilhelm von Humboldt suggested that the idea of a world-elephant was due to a confusion, caused by the 
Sanskrit noun N%C4%81ga having the dual meaning of "serpent" and "elephant" (named for its serpent-like trunk), thus representing a corrupted account of the world-serpent. Sadashiv Ambadas Dange, Glimpses of purāṇic myth and culture (1987), p. 70.[tpl]cite web|url=http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1004&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=PP&P=2344 |title=INDOLOGY archives - April 2010 (#17) |publisher=Listserv.liv.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1004&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=PP&P=4475 |title=INDOLOGY archives - April 2010 (#33) |publisher=Listserv.liv.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl] The various Hindu myths of the world being carried or enclosed by either a tortoise, a serpent or an elephant were referred to by Taylor (1878:339).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/researchesintoea00tyloiala#page/340/mode/2up |title=Researches into the early history of mankind and the development of civilization |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl] In the epics and major Puranas, there "is no myth of a world-upholding elephant",[tpl]cite web|url=http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1004&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=PP&P=1127 |title=J L Brockington, Indology mailing list |publisher=Listserv.liv.ac.uk |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl] and Al Biruni makes no mention of it, only quoting Brahmagupta who states "the earth is the only low thing".[tpl]cite web|url=http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1004&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=PP&P=1253 |title=INDOLOGY archives - April 2010 (#8) |publisher=Listserv.liv.ac.uk |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl]
The elephants are supposed to be guarding (and supporting) the earth at the compass points of the cardinal directions, and they cause earthquakes when shaking their bodies. Thus there are four, eight, or sixteen of them. The Amarakosha (5th century) lists the names of eight male elephants bearing the world (along with eight unnamed female elephants). The names listed are:
Airavata, Pundarika, Vamana, Kumunda, Anjana, Pushpa-danta, Sarva-bhauma, Supratika. Four names are given in Ramayana 1.41: Viru-paksha, Maha-padma, Saumanas, Bhadra.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uZBqVjGuZxYC&pg=PA430&dq=elephants |title=Monier-Williams, Indian Wisdom, p. 430f |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl]
Mahapadma also appears as the name of a treasure-guarding naga (serpent, dragon) in Harivamsa and Vishnu Purana. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable lists Maha-pudma and Chukwa are names from a "popular rendition of a Hindu myth in which the tortoise Chukwa supports the elephant Maha-pudma, which in turn supports the world".[ref]Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, 15th ed., revised by Adrian Room, HarperCollins (1995), p. 1087.

The spelling Mahapudma originates as a misprint of Mahapadma in Sri Aurobindo's 1921 retelling of a story of the  Mahabharata,

Arms had been granted to the district's constituent city and towns, (Wakefield, Castleford, Horbury, Knottingley, Ossett and Pontefract) but an application to the College of Arms was made for a unifying achievement.
The shield of the arms has a background of black and gold. The black represents the coal mining industry that was once widespread and important to the district. In the top, left of the shield is the arms of the city of Wakefield.The mural crowns signify Wakefield's important role in governance for the surrounding area.
The compartment shows thirteen acorns which represent the thirteen former local government areas of the West Riding of Yorkshire that merged to form the metropolitan district in 1974. Beneath the compartment is a motto, "Persevere and prosper".

Norviliškės Castle (a former monastery, also called Norviliškės Manor) is a Renaissance style castle in Norviliškės, Lithuania. The Norviliškės Castle is first mentioned in 1586. In 1617 the owners donated part of the real estate land to Franciscans. Around 1745 they built a monastery and a church in Renaissance style. The monastery was reconstructed at the end of the 18th century by Kazimieras Kaminskis.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book|editor=Klemensas Čerbulėnas, et al. |title= Lietuvos architektūros istorija: Nuo XVII a. pradžios iki XIX a. vidurio |edition=Vol. II |year=1994 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidykla |location=Vilnius|isbn=5-420-00583-3  |page=292[/tpl][tpl]Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (3) does not correspond to calculated figure.[/tpl] After the November Uprising of 1831, Russian authorities closed the monastery and turned it into barracks for soldiers, and later to a boarding school for girls. The Church of St. Mary Compassionate Mother was closed at the same time as the monastery. A new wooden church was built in 1929.
For a long time the former manor stood abandoned. In 2005, reconstruction was started by an entrepreneur, Giedrius Klimkevičius, from Vilnius. The project is supported by funds from the PHARE program. The hopes are that the Norviliškės Castle will become a tourist attraction. It offers hosting for business conferences or weddings, hunting, shooting practices, and other activities, including music festivals.

CATEGORIES: Trogonidae, Monotypic bird genera, Sierra Madre Occidental, Endemic birds of Southwestern North America, Endemic birds of Western Mexico, Birds of Mexico, Animals described in 1838, Birds of Cordillera Neovolcanica Mexico, Native birds of the Southwestern United States

The Eared Quetzal (Euptilotis neoxenus), also known as the Eared Trogon, is a near passerine bird in the trogon  family, Trogonidae. It breeds in streamside pine-oak forests and canyons in the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico south to western Michoacán.  It is sometimes seen as a vagrant to southeasternmost Arizona in the United States and has bred there. This range includes part of the Madrean sky islands region of southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and northern Sonora.
It is a resident of the middle to upper levels of pine-oak woodlands and oak-conifer forests, frequently along streams.  It nests [tpl]convert|5|–|9|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high in an unlined shallow tree cavity, usually selecting an old woodpecker hole.  Nests have been observed in pine, fir, maple, and aspen trees.  Limited excavation of the cavity is accomplished using the bill to dig into the rotten wood of the walls and opening.
Quetzals differ from typical New World trogons in having iridescent wing coverts, less extensive fusion between the two forward-facing toes of their heterodactyl foot, broad tails with distinctly convex (rather than straight or concave) sides, and eggs with pale blue shells.  They also average larger in body size than typical trogons, and the eggs and young develop more slowly.  The Eared Quetzal is a seemingly primitive form, lacking the impressively long iridescent upper tail and wing coverts of members of the genus Pharomachrus (including the Resplendent Quetzal).
Body length is [tpl]convert|33|–|36|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl].  Both sexes have iridescent green backs, iridescent dark blue central tail feathers, and outer tail feathers that are predominantly white terminally with a band of black at the base (sometimes partially barred black and white in females). The bill is dull gray with a slightly darker band at the tip. The adult male has a blackish head, iridescent green breast, and geranium red belly and undertail coverts. The adult female has a gray head, breast, and upper belly and less extensive (though equally bright) red on the lower belly. Both sexes bear the wispy hair-like auricular plumes that give the species its name, though these are rarely apparent in the field. Both head and bill appear rather small and narrow in comparison to those of typical trogons.
The male's song (tremolo call) is a series of whistled notes increasing in volume.  Calls include low-intensity squeals rising in pitch, a loud squeal ending with a sharp "chuck," and a strident cackle given mostly in flight.
Eared Quetzals feed on insects, small vertebrates, and fruit, including the warty red fruits of madrone trees.  Caterpillars, moths, katydids, cicadas, small lizards, and other prey are fed to the young. Like other trogons, Eared Quetzals often pluck prey and fruit while hovering.
Members of this species have been observed to exhibit aversion to large areas of conspicuous color on and near human observers (negative chromotropic responses), including white, red, orange, and blue. This suggests that the species-confidence hypothesis, which states that birds tend to be attracted to colors that match those found in their species and repelled by colors not found in their species, does not apply to Eared Quetzals.

[[Purple Heart Lane]]
CATEGORIES: Roads in France

Purple Heart Lane is a nickname for Highway N13 near Carentan, France, used by American soldiers and historians to denote a battlefield on which Lt. Col. Robert G. Cole and his troops of the 101st Airborne Division fought during the Battle of Normandy in World War II. The name arose because Cole's troops sustained many casualties in the advance on June 10, 1944, along the causeway of N13 supporting four bridges that spanned the Douve River between Carentan and Saint Come-du-Mont, and in the battle on the morning of June 11 that resulted in a skirmish known popularly as "Cole's Charge". The Purple Heart is an American military decoration awarded for sustaining wounds in combat.
Cole and his unit of 400 men - 3rd Battalion, 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment- were part of D-Day mission Albany. They were called from reserve into action to attack four bridges on highway N13 to Carentan. On June 10 and 11, 1944, Cole and his battalion fought an intense battle on this causeway for nearly two days under intense German machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire. In the morning of D+5, with the Germans resisting Cole's attempts to take the bridges, Cole ordered heavy artillery on the German strongholds. 
The artillery failed to suppress the German fire, so Cole, faced with the destruction of his battalion, immediately decided to assault the Germans head-on. Cole ordered his men to affix bayonets to their rifles and ordered a smoke screen to conceal the attack. At 6:15 AM, Cole blew his whistle and led his surviving men across the ground towards the German positions. At first Cole fired his pistol at the Germans, and along the way he picked up a fallen soldier's M1 Garand and bayonet. His attack, while successful, resulted in the deaths of many of his men; only 132 of the initial 250 men in his battalion remained after the assault and later defense of the captured position. This assault became known as "Cole's Charge", and the following defense against the 6th Fallschirmjager Regiment (supported by the 1st Battalion, 502nd PIR) as the "Cabbage Patch".
Cole was recommended for a Medal of Honor for his actions on June 11, 1944. However he would not live to receive it, as he was killed by a sniper during Operation Market Garden on September 18, 1944 in Best, Netherlands. His mother received his posthumous Medal of Honor. Lt. Colonel Robert G. Cole was buried at American Battlefields Monuments Cemetery in the Netherlands.

The Unistat computer program is a statistical data analysis tool featuring two modes of operation: The stand-alone user interface is a complete workbench for data input, analysis and visualization while the Microsoft Excel add-in mode extends the features of the mainstream spreadsheet application with powerful analytical capabilities.
With its first release in 1984, Unistat soon differentiated itself by targeting the new generation of microcomputers that were becoming commonplace in offices and homes at a time when data analysis was largely the domain of big iron mainframe and minicomputers. Since then, the product has gone through several major revisions targeting various desktop computing platforms, but its development has always been focused on user interaction and dynamic visualization.
As desktop computing has continued to proliferate throughout the 1990s and onwards, Unistat's end-user oriented interface has attracted a following amongst biomedicine researchers, social scientists, market researchers, government departments and students, enabling them to perform complex data analysis without the need for large manuals and scripting languages.

[[Cryptobotany]]
CATEGORIES: Cryptozoology, Pseudoscience

Cryptobotany is the study of various exotic plants which are not believed to exist by the scientific community, but which exist in myth, literature or unsubstantiated reports.
Folk legend and ethnic usage of plants, often as interdisciplinary research, is presented and developed for an unknown species, in the hope of allowing those species to be collected or adequately identified. Any researcher or writer can identify himself or herself as a cryptobotanist; the field is surveyed within cryptozoological or other journals, or with varying degrees of skepticism as a protoscience.[tpl]cite web | url = http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/criticalcz.html | title = Taking a Hard Look at Cryptozoology: A Critical Approach to Cryptozoology | accessdate = 2007-07-03 | author = Roesch, Ben S. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | date =  | year = 1999 | work =  Author's On-Line Cryptozoology Archives| publisher =   | quote = Thus the argument goes: in order to ensure accuracy in cryptozoology, research on sasquatch should be done by a primatologist or physical anthropologist, and research on sea serpents should be done by a marine biologist, preferably one who has good knowledge of both invertebrate and vertebrate marine organisms. [/tpl]
Many plants remain undiscovered or are yet to be classified, however cryptobotany usually focuses on fantastical plants believed to have harmful or therapeutic interactions with people. Sources of data may be secondary or scant; reports may be plausible or outlandish.
Man eating plants, most frequently inhabiting the jungles of Africa in popular fiction, may have been based[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] on initial reports of plants that could trap and kill mammals, such as Nepenthes rajah.Phillipps, A. 1988.

[[Bonnet Carré Crevasse]]

CATEGORIES: 1871 in Louisiana, Floods in the United States, History of New Orleans, Louisiana, 1871 natural disasters

The Bonnet Carré Crevasse was an 1871 breach in the Mississippi River levees some [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] upriver of New Orleans, Louisiana which resulted in substantial flooding. It was the worst flooding much of New Orleans had experienced since Sauvé's Crevasse in 1849.
Bonnet Carré was an area in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. The East Bank river levee collapsed here at high water so dramatically that attempts to quickly staunch the breach were soon abandoned in the face of the huge and powerful flow of water. The flood eventually spread through most of the East Bank of the Parish all the way to Lake Pontchartrain. The river water increased the water level in the lake and in the system connecting Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico, its eventual outlet. Lake Pontchartrain overflowed its banks, with the water spreading into surrounding communities including the Lake and "Back of Town" sections of New Orleans.
The river levee was not restored at Bonnet Carré until 1883.
The area is now the site of the Bonnet Carré Spillway.

The Thomas Jefferson Hour is a syndicated public radio program produced in Bismarck, North Dakota.  It features author-historian Clay S. Jenkinson in a first-person portrayal of Thomas Jefferson, the third US President, and is co-hosted by David Swenson.  Jenkinson remains in-character as Jefferson throughout the first half of the program, delivering monologues and answering listener questions regarding  Jefferson's personal and political life and the history of early America.  The character of Jefferson generally confines his discussion to matters of history, politics, and philosophy as indirect context for modern times, but at times provides a limited analysis of current events (carefully attempting to limit his analysis to matters on which the actual Jefferson's view might be meaningfully determined).  In the second portion of the program, Jenkinson steps out of character to discuss his in-character answers during the first half of the show and also to talk generally about the topic of the episode.

Padraic Pearse "Paddy" McGuinness AO (27 October 1938 – 26 January 2008) was an Australian journalist, activist, and commentator.  He was notable for the evolution over his lifetime of his political beliefs.  Beginning his career on the far left, he subsequently worked as a policy assistant to the more moderate (but still leftist) Labor parliamentarian Bill Hayden (future governor-general).  Later he found fame as a right-wing contrarian and finished his career as the editor of the conservative journal, Quadrant.  He had also worked as a columnist for The Australian and The Sydney Morning Herald and as the editor of The Australian Financial Review.[tpl]cite news |first=John |last=Stapleton |title=McGuinness, voice of dissent, dies, 69 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23118732-7582,00.html |publisher=The Australian |date=28 January 2008 |accessdate=28 January 2008 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
McGuinness, named after Patrick Pearse, was the son of Frank McGuinness (b1900 d1949) who was the inaugural editor of Ezra Norton's Sydney newspaper The Daily Mirror in 1941. Padraic attended, first, St Ignatius' College, Riverview (from his time there he dated the atheist attitudes which remained constant in his adult life, whatever his changes of ideological allegiance) and then obtained a scholarship to attend Sydney Boys' High School.   He studied economics at the University of Sydney (B.Ec., Hons, 1960), where he became a prominent member of the Sydney Push in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  At this time he identified as an anarchist but also joined the Labor Party.[tpl]cite news |first= Damien|last= Murphy|coauthors= |title= He argued his way into papers and mags|work= Sydney Morning Herald|page= |date= 28 January 2008|accessdate=26 March 2009 |quote= |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/he-argued-his-way-into-papers-and-mags/2008/01/27/1201368943636.html[/tpl]
After a short career as an economics lecturer at the N.S.W. University of Technology (now the University of New South Wales), McGuinness moved to London where he worked with the Moscow Narodny People's Bank, an arm of the Soviet Government, from 1966 to 1967.Henderson G ''Knees-up in Balmain The Sydney Institute, 'Media Watch' (and Sydney Morning Herald, 23 September 2000) Continuing his studies at the London School of Economics, he acquired a master's degree.[ref]H. R. Nicholls Society 
Personal profile[/ref] He later worked for the OECD in Paris, and there he observed personally the Paris demonstrations of 1968.  Having returned to Sydney in 1971, he began what would be a long tenure at The Australian Financial Review, by writing economics articles.
In 1973-74, he served the Whitlam Labor Government as an economic advisor to the Minister for Social Security, Bill Hayden, who was engaged in establishing Medibank and framing restrictive regulation for private hospitals and nursing homes. During this time McGuinness advocated the introduction of Medibank, against the interests of doctors who wanted health care to remain private.  Three decades later, in a Quadrant editorial, he poured scorn on the Whitlam government and the "plague of locusts" who worked for it, omitting to disclose his own central participation.McGuinness P. P. The Whitlam Schemozzle Quadrant editorial, January–February 2003 After working for Hayden, McGuinness's career was chiefly in journalism, including senior editorial positions at The Australian Financial Review (1974–87), where he became editor-in-chief in 1982. He also did column-writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Australian and in 1997 took over as editor of Quadrant, a position he held for a further ten years.  In 2004, he had also stood as an independent on Leichhardt Council.

According to journalist colleague Frank Devine, "Paddy was the quintessential independent thinker, scorning humbug and stupidity. He was a bloodthirsty predator among those he identified as members of the chattering classes". However, he was himself frequently criticised for pomposity and hypocrisy when, for instance, he accepted an Order of Australia award in 2003 despite a long-held, vocal contempt for such honours.Sir Paddy ABC MediaWatch item, 10 February 2003

[[Pamid]]

CATEGORIES: Red wine grape varieties, Bulgarian wine

Pamid is an old grape variety used for red wine. It has been cultivated in Bulgaria since the times of the ancient Thracians. In the past, it was the most widely spread Bulgarian variety, but today its plantations are highly limited. Pamid is also cultivated in Yugoslavia, Albania, Turkey, Greece, Hungary and Romania. The bunch is medium-sized (10–16 cm), and the grape is small (14–15 mm) and juicy. The skin is thin, red or sometimes dark red. It has excellent fertility, and its vintage is around the middle of September. Its yield is about 4–5 kg. It does not need any particular kind of soil, but the grapes with best quality are cultivated in hilly areas with light drained soils.
This grape accumulates sufficient sugar – from 18 to 24% – but its acidity is low: 4–5 g/dm3. The wines are red, light table wines for mass consumption. They have low acidity and low extract and that is why they are not appropriate for maturing and should be consumed young, right after fermentation and clarification.

[[Wahumpura]]

CATEGORIES: Sinhalese castes

Deva Tribe (not to be confused as a single caste) is the Royal Tribe which provided Sinhalese Monarchs, Statesmen, Military Leaders (Kshatriya) and Learned Men and Priests (Brahmins) in Ceylon until the Nayakkar Kings of South Indian origin snatched power during the Kandyan era. Sri Lanka's Deva tribes (Naga / Raksha) who were the traditional ruling class of the island later became the Kshatriya and Brahmin castes of the classic Aryan Varnas of North India in the Middle Ages.
All the recorded Sinhalese Monarchs starting from King Pandukhabhaya (474 BC) down to King Mayadunne (1581 AD) and final king of sri lanka sri Srisiddhipathi(Gongalegoda banda 1848AD )  were members of the Deva tribes. Kings were given the royal title of Deio (Deviyo / Deyyo) / Devayan Wahansa / Bandara Deyyo (a local version of "His Royal Highness") showing their Deva Royalty. Many Kings who had done good deeds during their reign are elevated to Devahood (Deity status) after their deaths as in e.g. : Mahasen Deyyo ( King Mahasen) / Minneriye Deviyo with Devale (Shrine) dedicated in his name. 
Ancient Deva tribes of Ceylon consisted of the order of Nagas (order of the Serpent) . Deva tribes of Ceylon also have their roots in the ancient Royal houses of Europe through Royal blood lineage (Rome, England, France, Germany, Greece, Scandinavia, Spain, Portugal, Romania) even reaching the Khazars of Turkey, king Saul of Israel, Monarchs of Siam, China, Korea, Japan and even in ancient ruling classes of Persia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, Nepal, Northern & Western India. Deva Tribe  has been a part of the Global Monarchy from time immemorial keeping links with their ancestors by sending emissaries from Ceylon to Mediterranean Europe  and vice versa during the ancient times.  The name Deva (Godly) implies their status as descendants of God or Divine Beings a title reserved for Emperors and Monarchs. 
The Sri Lankan caste system is a division of society into strata, influenced by the classic Aryan Varnas of North India and the Dravida Jāti system found in South India. Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy Raja / Deva (Royalty), Bamunu / Giri (Priests, teachers, doctors), Vaishya / Radala (Aristocrats, Herdsmen, Traders), Shudra / Govi (Farmers, laborers, slaves, servants)even as recently as the 18th century, in the British / Kandyan period Kadayimpoth - Boundary books as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy. 
Ancient texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya list the four caste categories as Raja Kshatriya, Bamunu Brahmana, Velanda Vaishya and Govi in descending order, where the Govi caste is the 4th caste.
Other ancient texts such as the Gavaratnakaraya and Sarpothpaththiya (Sarpavedakama vi, 5 & 123) respectively classify even Sri Lankan cattle and snakes into the same four caste categories as Raja, Bamunu, Velanda & Govi, where again Govi is the 4th form. Ballads sung to-date at ancient Gammaduva rituals also refer to the above four castes categories in the same sequence and also describes the limits and privileges of each. The domestic utensils of the Raja, category are described as made of gold; silver and copper for the next two and finally earthenware for the Govi caste which is last in the hierarchy (Gammaduwa 13). Govigama caste today is considered as the highest caste in Sri Lanka only because of numerical superiority, in India similar castes such as govigama are considered as "Shudras" the lowest caste in Indian Caste System.
King Nissanka Malla who managed to chase outneeded the Indians who destroyedneeded the Raja, Bamunu, Welanda, and Govi castes by forced intermarriages authored a stone inscription "Gal Potha" in Polonnaruwa which clearly states that people of "Govi" caste should not even think of becoming the King of Ceylon.
Losing their Royal power and influence after the death of the last Sinhalese King, Royal Deva Tribes (Raja) were later maliciously  made in to an obscure artificially invented caste named Wahumpura  by the influence of lower castes Goy / Govigama Mudliyars who came to prominence during the colonial period, hence people mixed up the Deva tribes with Wahumpura caste systematically obliterating the actual history of the Deva tribe.
Members of rural Deva tribes are today found predominantly in the Sabaragamuwa Province, North Western province(Wayambha province), Western province and North Central province, Raja Rata (Valley of Kings). The traditional occupation of this caste was the Governance of the Island and serve in the Military. In addition their tributary tribes functioned as trusted military reserve of the Sinhalese Kings. 
During the early Colonial era Deva (Raja /Bamunu) tribesmen never converted to Christianity nor changed their surnames nor did they join the newly amalgamated Govigama / Goy caste of agricultural laborers and slaves because the Devas were of highest standing coming from the Raja (Royalty) and Bamunu (Priests) upper castes or Kshatriya and Brahmins and did not see any need to create themselves a new identity or caste status in the then Sinhalese society by joining the low caste Govigama caste. 
However due to the large population of members in the newly formed Govigama caste reduced the Royal Deva tribes to the second influential and significant Sri Lankan caste. 
It is noteworthy to point that the amalgamation of the Shudra low castes laborers and slaves into one large Govigama caste was incorporated by the Colonial British Administrators in Ceylon at the request of a one Mudliyar De Seram, a Mudliyar of Malay origin who schemed to create himself a majority following to gain the leadership in Ceylon. De Saram family of Dutch and Malay ancestry had Sinhalised itself in the late 18th century by posing as the representatives of the masses and subsequently convincing the British rulers that they were from the numerous agricultural laborer shudra castes Govigama. This was a strategic move as it gave the British masters the impression that the De Saram family had the backing of a large body of natives. It was also the easiest route to Sinhalisation as the peasant community was widely dispersed, still unstructured and without inter-community networks or leaders.
The newly formed Govigama caste which came to prominence in the colonial period tarnished, ridiculed and obscured the identity of the Royal Deva Tribes, due to envy that the Deva tribe having the exclusive Kshatriya and Brahmin status in the social hierarchy. Thence low caste Govigamas launched a campaign to rename and identify the Deva tribe with an obscure and an invented caste called Wahumpura.

CATEGORIES: American sociologists, University at Buffalo faculty, Washington University in St. Louis faculty, 1920 births, 1980 deaths

Alvin Ward Gouldner (July 29, 1920 – December 15th, 1980) taught sociology at Antioch College (1952-1954) Antioch College per Archivist S. Sanders 2013 and was professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis (1959–1967[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]), at the University at Buffalo (1967–1972), President of the Society for the Study of Social Problems (1962), professor of sociology at the University of Amsterdam (1972–1976) and Max Weber Professor of Sociology at Washington University (from 1967). He was born in New York City.
His early works such as Patterns in Industrial Bureaucracy can be seen as important as they worked within the existing fields of sociology but adopted the principles of a critical intellectual. This can be seen more clearly in his 1964 work, Anti-Minotaur: The Myth of Value Free Sociology, where he claimed the sociology could not be objective and that Max Weber had never intended to make such a claim.
He is probably most remembered for his 1970 work The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology. This work argued that sociology must turn away from producing objective truths and understand the subjective nature of sociology and knowledge in general and how it is bound up with the context of the times. This book was used by many schools of sociology as analysis of their own theory and methods. Gouldner, however, was not the first sociologist to be critical of objective knowledge of society; see, for example, Adorno's Negative Dialectics.
Subsequently, much of Gouldner's work was concerned with critiquing modern sociology and the nature of the intellectual. He argued that ideology often produced false premises and was used as a tool by a ruling elite and that, therefore, critical subjective thought is much more important than objective thought.

[[Great Fire of London]]
CATEGORIES: Great Fire of London

[tpl]pp-semi-protected|small=yes[/tpl][tpl]pp-move-indef[/tpl]
The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of the English city of London, from Sunday, 2 September to Wednesday, 5 September 1666.All dates are given according to the Julian calendar. Note that when recording British history it is usual to use the dates recorded at the time of the event. Any dates between 1 January and 25 March have their year adjusted to start on the 1 January according to the New Style. The fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall. It threatened, but did not reach, the aristocratic district of Westminster, Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, and most of the suburban slums.Porter, 69–80. It consumed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St. Paul's Cathedral and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.Tinniswood, 4, 101. The death toll is unknown but traditionally thought to have been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded. This reasoning has recently been challenged on the grounds that the deaths of poor and middle-class people were not recorded, while the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims leaving no recognisable remains.
The Great Fire started at the bakery of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane, shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September, and spread rapidly west across the City of London. The use of the major firefighting technique of the time, the creation of firebreaks by means of demolition, was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm which defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday into the heart of the City. Order in the streets broke down as rumours arose of suspicious foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread over most of the City, destroying St. Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.
The social and economic problems created by the disaster were overwhelming. Evacuation from London and resettlement elsewhere were strongly encouraged by Charles II, who feared a London rebellion amongst the dispossessed refugees. Despite numerous radical proposals, London was reconstructed on essentially the same street plan used before the fire.Reddaway, 27.

[[Uncle Green]]
CATEGORIES: American rock music groups, Musical groups from Georgia (U.S. state), Musical groups established in 1986, Daemon Records artists, Music of Atlanta, Georgia, Jangle pop groups, 1986 establishments in New Jersey

Formed in Basking Ridge, New Jersey in 1980, the band Uncle Green consisted of Matt Brown (guitar and vocals), Jeff Jensen (guitar and vocals), Bill Decker (bass and keyboards), Pete McDade (drums), and Danny Giordano (tambourine and vocals). Brown and Jensen were the principal songwriters and vocalists for the group.
After relocating to Atlanta, the band recorded a single, "Holes" b/w "Heaven", in 1986, and two independent records, Get It Together and 15 Dryden, for New Vision Records in 1987 and 1988. Creative differences led Giordano to leave Atlanta for New York after the first LP, where he formed the band Humbolts. Uncle Green soon met an ascendant Brendan O'Brien, near the beginning of his producing career, with whom they recorded the albums You and What An Experiment His Head Was for DB Records.  After establishing themselves as a well-known regional college-rock band, they signed a contract with Atlantic Records in 1992 and recorded Book of Bad Thoughts. Like all of their efforts, the album was lauded by critics, but establishing commercial viability proved more difficult. Subsequent tours supporting The Reivers, Semisonic, The Black Crowes, Matthew Sweet, They Might Be Giants, Robyn Hitchcock and Ben Folds Five helped increased their visibility.
In 1994, the band took part in the Indigo Girls project  Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection and appear on the studio cast album. In 1995 part of a solo Matt Brown set recorded at Eddie's Attic in Decatur, Georgia, was included on the album Solo, Volume I, released by the independent label Sister Ruby. The album included original songs that do not appear on any of the group's albums, as well as a cover of Big Star's "Nighttime". The same year, Uncle Green contributed a version of "Ballad of a Thin Man" to A Tribute to Bob Dylan, Vol. 2, also on the Sister Ruby label.
Disappointed with their limited success, the band renamed themselves 3 lb. Thrill (the weight of the human brain) and recorded the harder-edged Vulture for O'Brien's new label, 57 Records, a subsidiary of Epic. This spawned a minor radio hit, "Diana", which examined the uncomfortable subject of child molestation and suffered commercially as a result. A video was recorded for the single "Something Will Come", directed by Peter Christopherson. 3 lb. Thrill's second album, Rycopa, was recorded in 1997 with engineer Caram Costanzo but remained unavailable until December 2011, when fans supported a Kickstarter fundraising campaign for its release after the missing master tapes were found and acquired from Sony. They also used the opportunity to release a collection of outtakes called Scrapple. A very prolific band, numerous other compilations of unreleased recordings circulate among fans.
Matt Brown's solo album Morning After Medicine Show, recorded with producer Rick Neigher, drummers Pete Thomas and Dan McCarroll, and keyboardist Rami Jaffee, was recorded in 1999 and also saw limited release in 2011. Several other unreleased solo projects circulate. Brown toured as a musician for Brad in 1997, and produced the album Eleven Emergency Lessons for indie-rock band Amphibian Skin in 2003, on which Jensen and McDade also perform. McDade's drums can also be heard on Atlanta musician Paul Melançon's album, Camera Obscura, released by Daemon Records in 2002.
In 2005 and in 2006, as 3 lb. Thrill and Uncle Green respectively, the band reunited for special performances at Smith's Olde Bar in Atlanta and Eddie's Attic in Decatur, Georgia. In 2009, Brown played a rare solo set, opening for Jon Auer at Eddie's Attic. McDade played percussion and Jensen provided occasional backing vocals. In February 2012, performing simultaneously as both Uncle Green and 3 lb. Thrill, the band came together for  a show at Smith's Olde Bar to celebrate the release of Rycopa.
In April 2012, Matt Brown created the Facebook Theme Music Group, which quickly grew from a handful of musicians to over 800 members by its one-year anniversary in April 2013.  Members include Jeff Jensen and Pete McDade of Uncle Green as well as professional and amateur musicians from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

[[The Order of Release]]
CATEGORIES: Paintings by John Everett Millais, 1853 paintings, Jacobite rising of 1745

The Order of Release, 1746 is a painting by John Everett Millais exhibited in 1853. It is notable for marking the beginnings of Millais's move away from the highly detailed Pre-Raphaelitism of his early years. Effie Gray, who later left her husband for the artist, modelled for the principal figure. 
The painting depicts the wife of a rebel Scottish soldier, who has been imprisoned after the Jacobite rising of 1745, arriving with an order securing his release. She holds her child, showing the order to a guard, while her husband embraces her. 
The Illustrated London News reviewed the painting as follows:
The dark, generalised background is a departure from the highly detailed backgrounds of earlier works such as Ophelia, as is the emphatic chiaroscuro. However, the portrayal of tense relationships disrupted by historical dramas was a continuation of the theme of A Huguenot and The Proscribed Royalist, 1651.
While working on the painting, Millais fell in love with Effie, the wife of his principal supporter, the critic John Ruskin. A study for the painting has a drawing of her head on one side and an image of a man kneeling in supplication to a woman on the other, labelled "accepted".

[[KKOW (AM)]]
CATEGORIES: Radio stations in Kansas, Classic country radio stations in the United States

KKOW is a radio station in Pittsburg, Kansas. It broadcasts classic country music.
It began on October 11, 1937 as KOAM, owned by E. Victor Baxter and Lester L. Cox on 790 kHz. It later moved to 810 kHz. It traded off 810 kHz with KCMO (AM) in Kansas City, Missouri (now on 710 kHz) for its current location on 860 kHz.
KOAM originally was an NBC affiliate, carrying programming from both the Red and Blue networks. Cox and Baxter also founded KOAM-TV in 1953, an NBC affiliate carrying secondary affiliations with CBS, ABC, and DuMont.
By the end of the 1970s, KOAM adopted a country music format.
It was sold to American Media Investments on May 11, 1981 . Due to the ownership split of KOAM AM-FM from KOAM-TV, its callsign changed from KOAM to KKOW on May 18, 1981.
Bridging KOAM with KKOW, Dan Willis http://www.kkowradio.com/page.php?page_id=86 hosted the morning slot 6 days a week from 1964-2004, administering the Community Calendar (reading obituaries and local events), the morning polka (7:30 daily with birthday dedications, sponsored by Grimaldi's Cash Grain feedstore in Pittsburg), farm commodity reports, and "Trading Post", a live call-in show for individual buyers and sellers at 9:00). Willis also oversaw many of the live remote broadcasts and emceed events, and he promoted an annual drive to buy Christmas gifts for developmentally-disabled children that were patients in a local care facility.
At its peak in the mid-1980s, KKOW-AM was known in the Pittsburg, Kansas/Joplin, Missouri-area for gimmicks such as 30/30 news and 20/20 weather, the daily Grand Lake fishing report with elderly Oklahoma fisherman/storyteller Lee Jeffries, the giant fiberglass cow on a trailer for remote broadcasts (Burford the Hereford), and the K-Cowboy of the Day. KKOW also sponsored the "Four-State Farm Show" yearly at Pittsburg, and covering the annual Little Balkan Days Celebration.
During the mid-1980s, the staff (in addition to Dan Willis) included disc jockeys Steve "Pazz" Passeri, Tim "Bones" Wallace, Vance Lewis, Jeff Freeman (Program Director), Gwen Freeman, Randy Davis, Jeff Trout, and Carla Castle. The farm director was Hugh Robinson, and Rob Strand was the sports reporter.Freeman, Gwen. "KKOW 86 AM Four State Regional Recipes", 1984; w/ staff photo
The station was run by the Freeman family through the 1980s, with Bob Freeman (a prominent outdoor sports promoter) as the General Manager. Being a CBS affiliate, KKOW-AM aired hourly live updates from CBS' New York bureau (typically done by Douglas Edwards during weekdays), "Reporter's Notebook" with Dan Rather weekday evenings, "The Osgood Files" with humorist Charles Osgood on weekday mornings, and other network programming. KKOW-AM was among the first stations in the area to broadcast 24 hours a day in the early 1980s, a rarity in the market. Typical 1980s sponsors included area businesses such as Cash Grain, Heidrich TV & Appliance, Castagno's, Chicken Annie's, Jim's Steak House, Colaw RV, Bowlus Sporting Goods, Lindberg Pharmacy, and Pittsburg Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, and various funeral homes.
KKOW exercised a Top 40 country format in the 1980s, and heavily promoted popular acts such as the Judds that would come to Pittsburg's Memorial Auditorium to perform. AM radio stations of that era were expected to provide full-service programming as a community service, and programming unrelated to the country format aired in blocks on weekends. Prominent weekend programming included the third-party-produced "The Waxworks Show with Gary Hannes", a multi-hour big-band show on Sunday afternoons that appealed to KKOW's older audience; this aired through the '80s.http://www.thebillmillershow.com/pages/history.php A bluegrass show followed "The Waxworks Show", and various syndicated shows aired on Sunday nights.
When KKOW-FM was founded in 1986, most of the younger deejays on the AM station shifted to the FM station (notably Tim "Bones" Wallace and Rob Strand "the Singing Newsman", who co-hosted the weekday morning shift) for handling its album-oriented rock format; from there, the staff dispersed by the late '80s/early '90s, with the Freemans' management eventually ending.
KKOW-AM continued on with turnover of employees through the 1990s, but retained a similar contemporary country music format. Dan Willis remained on the morning show. Notable on-air talent included Tom Van Hoy (sports), Don Capps (news), and Southeast Kansas agricultural extension agent Jake Weber ("Gardening with Jake", a Saturday morning call-in show co-hosted with Dan Willis). KKOW had over the years been modestly successful in Joplin, Missouri, but never dominated the market and remained (to an extent), a station more known for rural listership geared more for the Pittsburg-Frontenac area of southeast Kansas. In the '90s, KKOW was being eclipsed by other competing FM stations of superior sound fidelity such as KIXQ in Joplin (KIX 94).
By the early 2000s, Pizza Hut entrepreneur Gene Bicknell owned American Media Investments along with KOAM-TV (reversing the 1981 split between KOAM TV and radio), and AMI acquired a number of radio stations in the Joplin-Pittsburg market with the newly relaxed ownership rules. Dan Willis retired due to a terminal illness in 2004, and he was succeeded by Dalton Windsor. The station's country music format ebbed in general, and conservative-leaning agribusiness programming was more prominent. An experiment at abandoning music altogether was attempted for approximately a year in favor of an all-talk format; this was abandoned, and a classic country (1950s-early '90s) format was introduced in addition to the agribusiness programming and mainstays such as "Trading Post". In 2009, KKOW's newly hired general manager fired for stealing a reported sum of over $87,000 from the station to cover complusive gambling, and was convicted of embezzlement.http://www.joplinglobe.com/local/x546214081/Convicted-embezzler-to-forfeit-state-lottery-prize
KKOW is the flagship station for Pittsburg State University football and basketball games. Those broadcasts also air on sister station KBZI.
Programming heard on KKOW includes Coast to Coast AM, America in the Morning with Jim Bohannon, Orion Samuelson's National Farm Report, Mornings with Dalton, Trading Post, Agritalk with Mike Adams and The Sports Drive with Eddie Lomshek. Farm reports and classic country music are broadcast throughout the day.

Food carts come in two basic styles. One allows the vendor to sit or stand inside and serve food through a window. Another uses all of the room inside the cart for storage and to house the cooking machinery, usually some type of grilling surface. The cart style is determined principally by the type of food served at the cart.
Food carts are different from food trucks because they do not travel under their own power. Some food carts are towed by another vehicle, while some alternatively are pushed by a human or animal.

CATEGORIES: Books about military history, Works about battles and military operations, 1976 books, Jonathan Cape books, Viking Press books

The Face of Battle is a 1976 non-fiction book on military history by the English military historian John Keegan. It deals first with the structure of historical writing about battles, the strengths and weaknesses of the "battle piece," and then with the structure of warfare in three time periods—medieval Europe, the Napoleonic Era, and World War I—by analyzing three battles: Agincourt, Waterloo, and the Somme, all three of which involved English soldiers and occurred in approximately the same geographical area.
The work was groundbreaking in that it does not examine the battles only from the point of view of the generals nor does it simply accumulate quotes from ordinary soldiers. Instead, it focuses on the practical mechanics of battle and critically examines popular myths about warfare.  For instance, Keegan disputes the effectiveness of cavalry charges in the Middle Ages.  At Agincourt, the lightly armored archers dug stakes into the ground to impede horses, while heavy infantry who stood their ground had little to fear from cavalry.  Focusing on the mechanics of battle, Keegan discusses troop spacing, the effectiveness of weapons and formations, and other measures of tactical importance.  He also examines on the experience of the individual soldier of the time.  This is particularly evident in the 1988 illustrated edition, whose frontispiece is a photograph of a weeping "Vietnamese soldier holding the body of his dead child".
The book was originally published in United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by the Viking Press.  A new edition was published by Viking in 1988 titled, The Illustrated Face of Battle, with additional maps, diagrams, paintings, and photographs. The Folio Society issued an edition in 2009.The Face of Battle by the Folio Society

Nikolaus Friedreich (July 1, 1825, Würzburg – 6 July 1882, Heidelberg) was a German pathologist and neurologist, and a third generation physician in the Friedreich family. His father was psychiatrist Johann Baptist Friedreich (1796-1862), and his grandfather was pathologist Nicolaus Anton Friedreich (1761-1836), who is remembered for his early description of idiopathic facial paralysis, which would later be known as Bell's palsy.Bell's paralysis @ Who Named It
In the early part of his career he studied and practiced medicine at the University of Würzburg under the tutelage of noted men such as physiologist Albert von Kölliker and pathologist Rudolf Virchow. He later became a professor of pathological anatomy at the University of Würzburg, and in 1858 he was appointed professor of pathology and therapy at the University of Heidelberg, where he remained for the rest of his career. Some of his better known students and assistants included Adolf Kussmaul, Wilhelm Heinrich Erb and Friedrich Schultze.
Friedreich was involved in the establishment of pathological correlations, notably in research of muscular dystrophy, spinal ataxia and brain tumors. He is remembered today for "Friedreich's ataxia", which he identified in 1863. It is a degenerative disease with sclerosis of the spinal cord which affects a person's speech, balance and coordination.

[[Analog models of gravity]]

CATEGORIES: General relativity, Physical systems

Analog models of gravity are attempts to model various phenomena of general relativity (e.g., black holes or cosmological geometries) using other physical systems such as acoustics in a moving fluid, superfluid helium, or Bose–Einstein condensate; gravity waves in water; and propagation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium. These analogs (or analogies) serve to provide new ways of looking at problems, permit ideas from other realms of science to be applied, and may create opportunities for practical experiments within the analogue that can be applied back to the source phenomena.

[[Steven C. Hackett]]
CATEGORIES: American economists, American academics, Texas A&M University alumni, Montana State University alumni, Indiana University faculty, Humboldt State University faculty, Living people, People from Arcata, California

Professor Steven C. Hackett began his career at the rank of Assistant Professor at Indiana University in Bloomington in 1989. He currently holds the rank of Professor of Economics at Humboldt State University (HSU).
Early on his research was focused on the economic performance of contractual relationships, such as the social dilemmas associated with common-pool resources like oil and gas fields, groundwater basins or marine fisheries. Self-interested or opportunistic behavior in these circumstances can result in inferior economic outcomes. This work began at Texas A&M and was further cultivated by his affiliation with Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom's Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis while a member of the graduate faculty at Indiana University in Bloomington.Workshop publications. He was particularly interested in the challenges of structuring successful agreements capable of preventing opportunistic behavior when stakeholders are heterogeneous, or have made prior relationship-specific investments (research influenced by the work of Nobel Laureate Oliver Williamson).JLEO 10(2). Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization. His research approaches involved developing theoretical models and evaluating testable hypotheses through the use of laboratory experimental methods.Economic Inquiry 31(2). Economic Inquiry. Another line of his research involved the use of economic modeling approaches to understand the political economy of environmental regulation. In several papers Hackett and collaborators investigated how voluntary actions by firms to limit pollution can have strategic value relative to competitors, or as a way of shaping future regulatory policy. In another line of research Hackett and colleagues developed a model for the partial deregulation of critical energy markets, such as for natural gas, and identified some of the hazards associated with applying that model to electricity deregulation.Journal of Law and Economics 43(2). University of Chicago Journals -- Journal of Law and Economics. Hackett's curiosity about contracting problems also resulted in papers on diverse topics such as revenue-sharing problems in medical group practices, and factors that influence foreign direct investment decisions by multinational firms.
More recently Hackett has worked collaboratively on a number of projects addressing marine fishery economics and policy and renewable energy. In various projects he has analyzed California’s wetfish industry complex, California’s Dungeness crab fishery and associated processing sector, and the California and Oregon salmon fisheries.CSC wetfish report. California Seafood Council. URL accessed 06 December 2008.California Agriculture 58(4). California Agriculture.CDFG salmon report. California Department of Fish and Game. URL accessed 01 June 2009. In 2009 his research team released the COFHE model for assessing economic impact in each of California's commercial marine fisheries. Unique models were developed to function at county, regional, and statewide scales.COFHE economic impact model for California marine fisheries. California Department of Fish and Game. URL accessed 29 May 2009. Hackett has also returned to energy economics, with a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency. He recently contributed a chapter to California's wave energy white paper.California's wave energy white paper California Energy CommissionHSU Marketing and Communications HSU Press Release 8 December 2008 He is collaborating with the Schatz Energy Research Center and the Redwood Coast Energy Authority on a California Energy Commission-funded project that will identify ways to create a renewable energy secure community by managing the Humboldt micro-grid with 75 to 100 percent of energy supplies derived from renewable sources.California Energy Commission. California Energy Commission PIER grants 2009. URL accessed 29 May 2009. In recognition of his research into regional economic issues, and what HSU President Rollin Richmond described as "the clarity and significance his work brings to global questions of environmental economics," Hackett was selected as Humboldt State University's Scholar of the Year for 2005.HSU Scholar of the Year Recipients.

The population numbers are based on U.S. Census estimates for the year end.  The number of murders includes nonnegligent manslaughter.  This list is based on the reporting agency.  In most cases the city and the reporting agency are identical.  However, in some cases such as Charlotte, Honolulu and Las Vegas, the reporting agency as more than one city.
Murder is the only statistic that all agencies are required to report.  Consequently some agencies particularly in Illinois do not report all the crimes.  If components are missing the total is adjusted to "0."

[[Congress of German Economists]]

CATEGORIES: Liberal organisations

The Congress of German Economists ([tpl]Lang-de|Volkswirtschaftliche Kongress[/tpl] or Kongress deutscher Volkswirte) was an association of German economists founded in Gotha, in 1858. The model for the association was the British Anti-Corn Law League, founded in 1838 by Richard Cobden.
The Congress' main cause was to promote free trade and the cooperative movement. Important members of the Congress were John Prince-Smith, Julius Faucher, Wilhelm Adolf Lette, Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch, Heinrich Bernhard Oppenheim and Karl Braun, who would chair most of the meetings.
With the increase of international protectionism at the end of the 19th century, the Congress lost most of its influence. The year 1879 was a disaster year for the German pro-free-trade movement, when Bismarck enacted the iron and rye tariffs and broke with the National Liberal Party.

The disease is most likely caused by a malfunctioning lymphatic system and a compromised immune system. There is quite possibly a genetic component. There is no cure at this point, only treatment that has helped keep it under control for some.
Scientists at UC Davis Center for Equine Health are continuing research on the disease with the interest, cooperation and financial support from Ayrshire Farms of Upperville, Virginia.

[[Shelby Farms]]

CATEGORIES: Parks in Memphis, Tennessee, Protected areas of Shelby County, Tennessee

Shelby Farms, located in Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee, is one of the twenty largest urban parks in the United States. At a size of [tpl]convert|4500|acre|km2[/tpl], it covers more than five times the area of Central Park in New York City with [tpl]convert|843|acre|km2[/tpl].
Lakes, natural forests, and wetlands provide natural habitats for many smaller species close to an urban metropolitan area. Wildlife can be observed in their natural environment from the many trails in the park. Shelby Farms park is home to a bison herd.
The land that forms Shelby Farms park was derived from property that had been privately owned in the 19th century. In 1825, humanist reformer Frances Wright founded the Nashoba Commune on parts of what is modern-day Shelby Farms. The purpose of the commune was to emancipate slaves by providing education in practical and cultural skills. Remains of a settlement from the late 19th century are still present in the modern-day park.
From 1929 until 1964 Shelby Farms was used as a penal farm associated with the Shelby County jail.
Shelby Farms was opened for recreational purposes in the 1970s. In 2007, a public and private non-profit partnership was established to provide for the daily operation of the park and to plan for its future use.
In 2008, a masterplan was put in place for the redesign of the park. The re-design would provide additional hiking and biking trails as well as more opportunities for boating in a much enlarged Patriot Lake.

[[L'art pompier]]
CATEGORIES: French words and phrases, French art, French art movements

L'art pompier, literally "Fireman Art", is a derisive late-nineteenth-century French term for large "official" academic art paintings of the time, especially historical or allegorical ones. It derives from the helmets with horse-hair tails, worn at the time by French firemen, which are similar to the Greek-style helmets often worn in such works by allegorical personifications, classical warriors, or Napoleonic cavalry.Harding, 7, quoting the definition of Pompier in the Dictionnaire Larousse  It also suggests half-puns in French with Pompéin ("from Pompeii"), and pompeux ("pompous").  Pompier art was seen by those who used the term as the epitome of the values of the bourgeoisie, and as insincere and overblown.
L'art Pompier (a term supporters mostly avoid) has enjoyed something of a critical revival in the last twenty years, partly caused by the new Musée d'Orsay in Paris, where it is displayed on more equal terms with the Impressionists and Realist painters of the period.Harding, 14-22
The Manifeste Pompier (Fireman Manifesto) by Louis-Marie Lecharny, was published in Paris in 1990. He also wrote L'art Pompier (1998).
William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Paul-Jacques-Aimé Baudry, Alfred Agache, Alexandre Cabanel and Thomas Couture are among the classic Pompier artists.

He was signed by the St. Louis Browns as an amateur free agent before the 1946 season.  After pitching in the Browns, Cincinnati Reds, and New York Yankees organizations, he was drafted by the Boston Braves from the Yankees in the 1952 rule V draft (December 1).  He played for the Milwaukee Braves from 1953 to 1957.   
Jolly made his major league debut in relief on May 9, 1953 against the Chicago Cubs at Milwaukee County Stadium.

The track "Travelin' Man" is the first studio recording of a song from the original band's 1976 live album One More From The Road. Making use of modern technology, the band were able to use original singer Ronnie Van Zant's vocal tracks on parts of the song, in order to create a duet between Johnny and Ronnie. The Album Cover is a fictional drawing of Monument Valley on the Navajo reservation.

[[Gelastic seizure]]
CATEGORIES: Seizure types, Laughter

A gelastic seizure, also known as "gelastic epilepsy" is a rare type of seizure that involves a sudden burst of energy, usually in the form of laughing or crying.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epilepsy.org.au/sites/default/files/PDFS/E360/Sep_2009/EA_360_2009_Sep_p6.pdf |title=Not your everyday epilepsy |publisher=Epilepsy Action Australia |date= |accessdate=2011-07-04[/tpl] This syndrome usually occurs for no obvious reason and is uncontrollable. It is slightly more common in males than females. The term Gelastic originates from the Greek word "Gelos" which means laughter. This syndrome can go for very long periods of time without a diagnosis, as it may appear to be much like normal laughing or crying, if it occurs infrequently. It has been associated with several different conditions such as temporal and frontal lobe lesions, tumors, atrophy, tuberous sclerosis, hemangiomas, and post infectious foci, but mainly hypothalamic hamartomas.

[[Protectors]]
CATEGORIES: Malibu Comics titles

The Protectors was a 20-issue comic book series published by Malibu Comics from 1992 until 1994.  Originally meant to be a six-issue series, response was positive enough that Malibu decided to make the series ongoing.  The series was cancelled (along with the rest of the "Genesis" titles) so that, according to Malibu, they could focus more on the "Ultraverse" line.Letters page, The Protectors #20, 1994.
Many of the characters included in the series were taken from heroes created by Centaur Publications, and had fallen into the Public Domain.  Some heroes were given new names, such as: Gravestone (formerly Fantom of the Fair, Fantom or Fantoman), Nightmask (Masked Marvel), Thresher (aka Shark), and Midnight Blue (formerly Blue Lady).  In the case of Gravestone, the name was changed to avoid confusion with Lee Falk's Phantom (although there were a few instances when the hero was referred to as "Fantom" within the pages of the first few issues).   Nightmask was changed from Masked Marvel to avoid any potential legal problems with Marvel Comics (both explanations appeared in the letter column page of the first issue of The Protectors).  Many of Centaur's heroes received updated costumes but retained their original names, including Zardi The Eternal Man, Amazing Man, Mighty Man, Man of War, Iron Skull, Mantoka, Arrow, Witch and Airman, along with the villains The Great Question and Conqueror.
Malibu also made use of the Rocket Ranger (a character created by the video game company Cinemaware) within the pages of Man of War's series and Miss Fury, who they had licensed for a previous series.
With the 13th issue of the series, Malibu started the "Genesis" cross-over, which incorporated the books "Dinosaurs for Hire" and "Ex-Mutants" as part of the six-issue story.  At the end of the cross-over, characters from the Protectors would appear in the pages of Ex-Mutants (and vice-versa).
The Protectors was cancelled with issue 20 in 1994 (the year Malibu was purchased by Marvel Comics), with readers witnessing the destruction of the Earth, making any type of continuation of the heroes' story highly unlikely.

Elizabeth Sterling Haynes (December 7, 1897 – April 26, 1957) was an Alberta theatre activist.
Born in Seaham, County Durham, England in 1897, her family emigrated to Ontario, Canada in 1905. As a young woman, she studied at the University of Toronto. In 1921, she married Nelson Willard Haynes, a dentist, and they moved to Edmonton, where she soon established herself as a director, actor and teacher. In 1928, she helped organize the Alberta Drama League (which became a model for the Dominion Drama Festival).
In 1933, she became provincial drama specialist at the Department of Extension of the University of Alberta, and it was from this post that she began to recreate much of Alberta's theatre scene. She wrote technical works and broadcast her reviews and lessons on radio. She travelled the province, to school and community groups, coaching them, demonstrating and adjudicating competitions. 1933 was also the year she co-founded the Banff Centre for the Arts. Failing health began to play a role in her life soon after, though she continued to stay as active as physically possible until her death in 1957.
Said Gwen Pharis Ringwood of her:  Elizabeth was a force; a creative energy unleashed at a time when creativity was suspect and in a place where creativity was often ignored in the hope that it would go away. 
Edmonton's Sterling Awards are named in her honour.

The group began work in January 1998 and issued their unanimous final report on July 15, 1998, within the six-month mandate. The report warned of a growing threat of ballistic missiles and the inability for US intelligence to keep track of developments.  This contrasted with the views of previous US intelligence estimates, which stated that the threat of ballistic missiles was still 10 to 20 years away. The commission further fueled the debate over a national missile defense system, and may have contributed to the coining of the phrase axis of evil.

Maryhill Museum of Art is a small museum with an eclectic collection, located [tpl]coord|45|40|40.11|N|120|51|50.15|W|display=inline,title[/tpl] near Maryhill in the U.S. state of Washington.
The museum is situated on a bluff overlooking the eastern end of the Columbia River Gorge. The structure was originally intended as a mansion for entrepreneur Samuel Hill (1857-1931). The unfinished museum building was dedicated on November 3, 1926, and opened to the public on Hill's birthday (May 13) in 1940. The museum's first physical expansion was completed when the Mary and Bruce Stevenson Wing opened to the public in May 2012. It includes a plaza that overlooks the Columbia River, an education center, a collections suite and a café.
Notable in the Maryhill Museum collection are: 
The Maryhill Museum building was designed as a private residence for Sam Hill by Washington, D.C., architects Hornblower & Marshall. It was designed in a Beaux-Arts style and built of steel-reinforced concrete beginning in 1914. Hill imagined the structure as a ranch building amidst a 5,300-acre agricultural community that he was developing at the eastern end of the Columbia River Gorge. During a 1917 visit by his friend Loïe Fuller, he decided to turn his unfinished home into “a museum for the public good, and for the betterment of French art in the far Northwest of America.” Hill’s contribution to the new museum included almost 90 American Indian baskets, more than 70 Rodin sculptures and watercolors, and many personal items.
Fuller herself provided the museum with plaster casts of the hands of more than a dozen period celebrities. She gave the museum numerous small, carved ivory crucifix figures that were originally given to her by Désiré-Joseph Mercier, Cardinal Archbishop of Mechelen. She also convinced some of her many friends to make their own donations to the fledgling museum.
During her 1926 visit for the museum's dedication, Queen Marie of Romania gave Maryhill more than 100 objects. These included personal items, Romanian folk objects, Russian icons and diverse textiles. That same year, Queen Marie’s oldest daughter Elisabetha, the former Queen Consort of Greece, gave the museum a collection of small Tanagra figurines and a number of ancient Cypriot amphorae. A year earlier, the museum had received its very first donation—three silver filigree objects—from Queen Marie’s second daughter, Marie, Queen Consort of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.
Maryhill Museum owes a profound debt to its fourth great patron, Alma de Bretteville Spreckels. Following the deaths of Hill (1931), Fuller (1928) and Queen Marie (1938), she worked tirelessly to turn Sam Hill’s unfinished mansion into an art museum. Over the years, Spreckels had acquired many objects from Queen Marie that were intended for a “Romanian Room” in San Francisco’s California Palace of the Legion of Honor. She instead donated this material to Maryhill Museum in 1938. It included Queen Marie’s gold throne and other unique pieces of Byzantine-inspired furniture, a replica of her coronation crown, and other objects. Spreckels also gave Maryhill a collection of art glass by artists such as Émile Gallé and René Lalique, some Art Deco ceramics by Seraphine Soudbinine, European paintings, and ecclesiastical textiles from the Armenian Apostolic Church.
Spreckels’ efforts also helped bring the Théâtre de la Mode to Maryhill. After being displayed in Paris in 1945–1946, the mannequins toured Europe and the United States. Their final American venue was the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. Organizers then attempted to return them to Paris, but the Théâtre de la Mode originator, the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, was unwilling to pay custom charges. The mannequins were stored in San Francisco’s City of Paris department store while a decision was made about their future. Spreckels suggested that the mannequins be sent to Maryhill, and they arrived at the museum in time for the 1952 season.
Others also contributed to the early growth of Maryhill’s art collection. Clifford Dolph, who served as the museum’s first director (1938–1972), had a passion for chess. With the encouragement of the museum's Board of Trustees, he began collecting chess sets in 1957. Dolph was also an astute admirer of realist painting and many of the museum’s most important works of art were acquired during his tenure. He exhibited, purchased and promoted the work of American artists associated with Classical Realism. In 2000, the R. H. Ives Gammell Studios Trust gave the museum a 23-panel series titled A Pictorial Sequence Painted by R. H. Ives Gammell Based on The Hound of Heaven. The paintings had premiered at Maryhill in 1957 and the museum’s relationship with Gammell and the artists in his circle can be directly linked to the decision to permanently place the works at the museum.
American Indian art has always been an important part of Maryhill Museum's mission. Beginning with Sam Hill’s own collection, the Indian basketry holdings now total more than 900 items. A particularly important Indian art donation was made in 1940 by Mary Underwood Lane. She was the granddaughter of Cascade chief Welawa, also known as Chief Chenoweth. Lane’s gift included fur trade-era objects and many carved, woven and beaded items from the Middle Columbia River region. A large collection of Arctic material was given to the museum in 1979 by the heirs of Harvey T. Harding, who had operated a store in Nome, Alaska, from 1899 to 1907. Harding kept a journal of his Arctic experiences and a careful record of the objects that he collected—many of which are identified by place and date of collection.
The museum collection also includes numerous historic photographs, archival materials and reference texts.
A concrete replica Stonehenge is located at the eastern end of Maryhill Museum's property. It was commissioned by Sam Hill and dedicated in 1918 as a memorial to local World War I dead. It was completed in 1929.

[[Obsessive love]]

CATEGORIES: Love, Interpersonal relationships, Intimate relationships

Obsessive love  is a hypothetical state in which one person feels an overwhelming obsessive desire to possess another person toward whom they feel a strong attraction, with an inability to accept failure or rejection. Such a state should be differentiated from relationship obsessive–compulsive disorder (ROCD) that commonly includes doubts regarding one's own feelings towards an intimate partner, preoccupation with the partner’s feelings towards oneself, doubts about the “rightness” of the relationship and preoccupation with the perceived flaws of the partner. For most of history, "obsessive love" was called perseverance, but in the late 20th century, love simpliciter was suggested to be a mental disorder. Although not categorized specifically under any specific mental diagnosis by the DSM IV, some people argue that obsessive love is considered to be a mental illness similar to "attachment disorder, borderline personality disorder, and erotomania." Peabody[tpl]citation needed|reason= many people?? maybe a few laymen...|date=April 2013[/tpl] Obsessive lovers may feel entirely unable to restrain themselves from extreme behaviors such as acts of violence toward themselves.  They may be entirely convinced that their feelings are love, and may reject the idea that their severe obsession is not love.

[[Hybrid train]]

CATEGORIES: Hybrid locomotives

A hybrid train is a locomotive, railcar or train that uses an onboard rechargeable energy storage system (RESS), placed between the power source (often a diesel engine prime mover) and the traction transmission system connected to the wheels. Since most diesel locomotives are diesel-electric, they have all the components of a series hybrid transmission except the storage battery, making this a relatively simple prospect.
Surplus energy from the power source, or energy derived from regenerative braking, charges the storage system.  During acceleration, stored energy is directed to the transmission system, boosting that available from the main power source.  In existing designs, the storage system can be electric traction batteries, or a flywheel.  The energy source is diesel, liquified petroleum gas, or hydrogen (for fuel cells) and transmission is direct mechanical, electric or [tpl]citation needed span|hydrostatic|date=February 2014|reason=a Hydrokinetic transmission is more likely[/tpl].
Diesel electric locomotives have high potential for energy savings when using dynamic braking, which use the traction motors as generators to stop the train. Without a way to recover and store the braking energy, these engines currently have no option other than to transfer it into the atmosphere as heat, using large electric heating elements and high velocity cooling fans.
Using a storage system means that a non-fully electric train can use dynamic braking, and even shut down the main power source whilst idling or stationary.  Reducing energy consumption provides environmental benefits and economic savings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/development/tech/pdf_4/Tech-no.4-62-70.pdf |title=Technical Review NO.04(E |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-30[/tpl]  A smaller scale version of the concept is found in hybrid automobiles, such as the Toyota Prius.

[[Real estate owned]]

CATEGORIES: Real estate terminology

Real estate owned or REO is a class of property owned by a lender—typically a bank, government agency, or government loan insurer—after an unsuccessful sale at a foreclosure auction.[ref]
William Roark (2006), Concise Encyclopedia of Real Estate Business Terms
ISBN 0-7890-2341-5[/ref] A foreclosing beneficiary will typically set the opening bid at a foreclosure auction for at least the outstanding loan amount. If there are no bidders that are interested, then the beneficiary will legally repossess the property. This is commonly the case when the amount owed on the home is higher than the current market value of this foreclosure property, such as with a high loan-to-value mortgage following a real estate bubble. As soon as the beneficiary repossesses the property it is listed on their books as REO and categorized as an asset (non-performing asset).

The Breeders' Cup Grand National Steeplechase is an American Grade I NSA sanctioned steeplechase race run each fall over the rolling hills of Moorland Farms in Far Hills, New Jersey.  Set over a 2⅝ mile course during the one day Far Hills Races, it has 14 national fences, and a purse of $300,000.  This new purse, increased in 2006, makes it the richest event in American steeplechase racing.
The race dates back to 1899 and was long the premier stakes in U.S. jump racing.  Past winners include 11 of the 14 steeplechasers inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame: Flatterer (also a close second in the 1987 Champion Hurdle), Zaccio, Café Prince, Bon Nouvel, Neji, Oedipus, Elkridge, Bushranger, Battleship (in 1938 became the only winner of this race and the Aintree Grand National), Jolly Roger and Good and Plenty. 
The race has been held at Belmont Park, at Saratoga Race Course, and at Morris Park racetracks, as well as the steeplechase meets at Fair Hill, Maryland and Charlottesville, Virginia.
The Grand National (once called the American Grand National) is one of the oldest races in steeplechasing and one of the most important outside Europe.  It has been brought back from oblivion by the dedication of a combination of steeplechase enthusiasts.  Run in 2006 for the 14th time in its latest incarnation, the day of steeplechasing at Far Hills includes seven races, the most important of which is the Grand National.

Lawrence C. Kolb (June 16, 1911 – October 20, 2006) was an American psychiatrist who played a prominent role in mental health administration, research and community mental health.
Lawrence C. Kolb was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Because his family lived in Ireland from 1928 to 1931, he attended Trinity College in Dublin. He returned to the United States to medical school at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Following graduation, he did residency training in psychiatry and neurology (then considered one specialty) at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York. During World War II, he went into the Navy and was stationed aboard hospital ships and then put in charge of a clinic for "battle fatigue" in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. After the Navy, Kolb worked at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland (where a collection of his papers are held) [tpl]cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/kolb|title= Lawrence Kolb Papers 1912-1972|publisher= National Library of Medicine[/tpl] and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
In 1954 Dr. Kolb was appointed chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and director of the affiliated New York State Psychiatric Institute. Kolb oversaw numerous clinical and research advances during his 21-year tenure, the longest of any director. In 1975 Kolb left his posts at Columbia to become the New York State Commissioner of Mental Hygiene and correct abuses in the state system of mental health.[ref]
</ref>
Dr. Kolb was strongly committed to research in psychiatry. Early in his career he did a seminal study of phantom limb pain (see the reference below). Many years later he led a significant study on "battle fatigue" in Vietnam veterans, finding that post-traumatic stress disorder could cause physical signs and symptoms. The research facility at New York State Psychiatric Institute is called the Lawrence C. Kolb Research Building.

Valentine Harris (Irish: Vailintín Ó hEarchaí, born 23 June 1884,  Ringsend, Dublin, Republic of Ireland), commonly referred to as Val Harris, was an Irish footballer who played Gaelic football for Dublin and soccer for, among others Shelbourne, Everton and Ireland. Harris was regarded as one of the finest soccer players of his generation and in 1906 became the first Shelbourne player capped by Ireland. He still remains the club's most capped player. In 1913 he captained the first Ireland team to beat England and in 1914 he was a member of the Ireland team that won the British Home Championship. Harris has been described as an extremely hard player in the mode of Kevin Moran or Paul McGrath and like his Shelbourne, Everton and Ireland team mate, Bill Lacey, he was also very versatile, covering just about every outfield position during his career.

Arzberg is the trademark of a German manufacturer of porcelain, founded in 1887 in Arzberg, Bavaria. Its fame is largely based on designs by Hermann Gretsch, whose Form 1382, conceived in 1931 and based on Bauhaus principles, marks a milestone in modern design; Form 1382 is still produced today, and sold worldwide.  Hutschenreuther AG, holder of the Arzberg trademark since 1972, was dissolved in 2000 and the trademark was taken over by SKV-Porzellan-Union GmbH, founded in 1993 by the porcelain companies Schirnding, Kronester and Johann Seltmann Vohenstrauß. In 2004, SKV-Porzellan-Union GmbH was renamed Arzberg-Porzellan GmbH. In 2003, the company had approximately 250 employees. Since 2000, however, the headquarters of the company holding the trademark Arzberg (and Schirnding as well) are located in Schirnding, where production took place. After 10 years Arzberg GmbH announced its insolvency. Today the trademark is owned by Rosenthal porcelain.

Project: Funk Da World is the debut studio album by rapper Craig Mack, released September 20, 1994. The album was the second release on Bad Boy Records, following The Notorious B.I.G.'s classic Ready to Die by one week. Propelled by the success of the Platinum-selling smash hit single "Flava In Ya Ear", the album reached Gold sales status on February 22, 1995. "Flava In Ya Ear" also featured a successful remix (not included on the album), featuring guest verses from The Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes, Rampage and LL Cool J. The album's second single, "Get Down", was the rapper's second Top 40 hit in 1994, and achieved Gold sales status in April 1995.
Though moderately successful and acclaimed at the time of its release, the album was overshadowed by the massive success of Ready to Die, and Craig Mack quickly lost public image, releasing only one other album, the commercially unsuccessful Operation: Get Down, in 1997.

Sarangadeva (1210–1247) was a 13th-century Indian musicologist, who was the author of the classical Sanskrit text on music, Sangita Ratnakara, the first modern book on Indian music. The book is considered by many to be the most important work on music, after Bharata's Natya Shastra. This is the last text in the Indian musicology that is referred to by both Carnatic and Hindustani Classical Music traditions, and is therefore thought by some scholars to mark the point after which these two streams diverged. It was written before the Muslim conquest of the region, thus is noted for its absence of Muslim influence of Indian music, which deeply effected the North Indian music.[tpl]cite book|author=Vijaya Moorthy|title=Romance Of The Raga|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2s2xJetsy0wC&pg=PA18|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-382-3|pages=18–[/tpl]

James Jamieson (1920 – December 25, 1993) was a specialist in Highland dancing, best remembered for both performing in and restaging Agnes de Mille's Brigadoon.
Jamieson (also known as Jamie Jamieson) was a native of Evanston, Illinois and studied at Northwestern University.  He began his career in ballet, but by the mid-1940s was an internationally-recognized Scottish dance champion.  In 1947, de Mille hired Jamieson to coach the cast of Brigadoon in traditional Scottish dancing, which inaugurated a decades-long association with the musical.  (He had earlier worked with de Mille on the first national tour of Oklahoma!)  Jamieson replaced James Mitchell as Harry Beaton, then went on to play Harry  on tour, overseas, and in assorted stock productions.  In New York, he recreated de Mille's choreography for Brigadoon at City Center in 1957, on Broadway in 1980, and at New York City Opera in 1986 and 1991; in addition, he was de Mille's assistant for the 1963 City Center revival, which starred Edward Villella as Harry.  De Mille also featured Jamieson in the Agnes de Mille Dance Theatre and the Heritage Dance Theatre, as well as in television specials.  
Besides his various productions of Brigadoon, Jamieson choreographed for a number of regional and stock theatres, working with such stars as Judy Holliday.  He had considerably greater influence, however, as a dance teacher.  With Helena Antonova, he opened the Academy of the Dance in 1956 in Wilmington, Delaware; his students there included modern dancer Tina Fehlandt, Scottish dancer Victor Wesley, and choreographer Susan Stroman.  
In 1967, he began his celebrated productions of Tchaikovsky’s “The Nutcracker Ballet” and for 27 consecutive years, produced, directed and performed various roles in the work.The Scottish-American History Club Newsletter, July, 1996, Page 3http://www.chicago-scots.org/clubs/History/Newsletters/1996/July96-3.htm  Mr. Jamieson died on Christmas Day, 1993, nine days after he appeared as the grandmother in the opening night presentation of the Academy of the Dance's 27th production of "The Nutcracker".Highland Highlights, by Loraine Ritcheyhttp://lritch7.tripod.com/JJ.html

Derek Keenan (born October 2, 1961 in Oshawa, Ontario) is a former lacrosse player, and current head coach and General Manager of the Edmonton Rush of the National Lacrosse League.
After a long amateur career, (with the Oshawa Green Gaels and the Brooklin Redmen of the Ontario Junior and Senior Leagues respectively, and Ithaca College where he made All-American), and appearances with the Canadian National Field team at several world championships, Keenan began professional play in 1992 with the Buffalo Bandits, where he won the 1992 Rookie of the Year Award. The Bandits won the Champions Cup in both of Keenan's seasons with the team. After a five year break, he played six games with the Toronto Rock in 1999, before becoming an assistant coach under Les Bartley. The Rock won the 1999 NLL Championship, and with Bartley at the helm and Keenan and Ed Comeau as assistant coaches, the Rock went to the championship game in each of the next four seasons, winning three times, in 2000, 2002, and 2003.
In November 2003, Bartley stepped down due to his battle with colon cancer, and Keenan was promoted to interim general manager, while Comeau was given the job of interim head coach.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lacrosse-network.com/outsidersguide/news031105.htm|title=Les Bartley sidelined by cancer|work=Outsider's Guide to the NLL|date=2003-11-05|accessdate=2006-11-08[/tpl] However, less than four months later, after a 2-4 start, both Keenan and Comeau were fired by the Rock,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lacrosse-network.com/outsidersguide/news040217.htm|title=Rock cans Ed Comeau, Derek Keenan|work=Outsider's Guide to the NLL|date=2004-02-17|accessdate=2006-11-08[/tpl] replaced by Terry Sanderson.

Patrica Parsons (June 9, 1931 – October 26, 2006), better known as Patsy Parsons, sometimes credited as Patsy Lee Parsons, was an American character actress who appeared in about a dozen films beginning in 1937 at the age of six. Ms. Parsons was born in Parkersburg, W.Va,. but moved to Hollywood at age 5. She is best remembered for her 1954 TV role as the evil space tyrant "Cleolanthe" in Rocky Jones, Space Ranger.
Like many child stars, she experienced great difficulty in graduating to adult roles, with a typical appearance being an uncredited bit part in a Martin and Lewis film. One of her bigger child parts was in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) starring James Cagney.
Parsons retired shortly after leaving Rocky Jones, Space Ranger, making one last TV appearance on Science Fiction Theater in 1956.
However, life did not end for Ms. Parsons as she began a new career as the wife of banker and community activist Solon Soteras. As Pat Soteras, she worked at Pepperdine University and raised three children, Alexander, Nickoletta and Anthony. She also wrote a weekly column for the Malibu Times. However, in her later years, Pat is most remembered for her extraordinary work with the Agoura/Oak Park/ Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce where, as the Chamber's executive director, she increased membership eightfold.
In memory of Pat's work with the Chamber, the Patricia Soteras scholarship fund was established.

[[Chlorine bomb]]

CATEGORIES: Improvised explosive devices

A chlorine bomb is a small explosive device which uses the pressure of chemically produced chlorine gas or other chlorine-containing gases such as hydrogen chloride to produce an explosion. It is made with an airtight container part-filled with different types of chlorine tablet and other reagents. The reaction produces an expansive increase in pressure, eventually rupturing the container. Usually, such a device is not made on a large scale, often being manufactured from common house objects.
Such a device is a more toxic and acidic alternative to a dry ice bomb, but likewise typically made by young people for amusement and recreational use rather than with any intent to harm.Snopes report on an attempted assault with a similar device However, exposure to chlorinous gases and the reactive substances involved can cause respiratory problems from inhalation and also cause injury to other mucous membranes, similar to tear gas. Most injuries relating to these devices involve bruised hands, blinding and other eye injuries - generally to the bomb makers themselves.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]. 
Pastor's Terrorism and Public Safety Policing outlines how Cprogram is emphasizing lessons learned in Iraq regarding chlorine bomb use on American soldiers.  This exposure has provided Western police departments like the NYPD with incentive to amend current policing models from Community Policing to a Public Safety Policing model that emphasizes risk aversion via public/private policing partnerships through metropolitan arenas.[tpl]Clarify|date=December 2011[/tpl]  Moreover, the chlorine bomb and other weapons systems in its class achieve this because they are easy to manufacture and thus represent a more fluid weapons delivery model for domestic and international terrorists.Pastor, James F.

[[Almidae]]
CATEGORIES: Clitellata

The animal family Almidae includes about six genera of segmented worms. 
A notable peculiarity of some species in this family is a tendency to extensions of the body wall in the vicinity of or including the male pores. These extensions may be mere protuberances, as in some species of Drilocrius; or involve a greater extent of the body wall, as in genus Glyphidrilocrius. They take the form of wing or keel-like structures called alae in Glyphidrilus species and paddle-shaped claspers in Drilocrius alfari. 
All species of genus Alma have claspers. The male pores are near the tips of these claspers, and they are furnished with genital chaetae and sucker-like structures.
Most members of this family have one pair of male pores on segment 15 through 30. Female pores are located on segment 14. Glyphidrilus kukenthali is one of only three ‘earthworm’ species known to have two pairs of female pores, in 13 and 14.
A possibly related family, Criodrilidae, contains genera Criodrilus and Biwadrilus with male pores in 15 and 13, respectively. Spermathecae are absent (a rare condition in oligochaetes) and one to several spermatophores containing the sperm are transferred between partners and attached near the genital field.

CATEGORIES: Asian diaspora in the Netherlands, Assyrian people, Assyrian diaspora, Assyrian ethnic groups, Ethnic groups in the Netherlands, Dutch people of Assyrian/Syriac descent

The Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac community of the Netherlands comprises migrants of Assyrian ancestry and their descendants born in the Netherlands. They mainly live in the east of the country, in the province of Overijssel, in such cities as Enschede, Hengelo, Almelo and Borne. The main reason that the Assyrians are concentrated there is because it is an industrial area which lies at the border with Germany, where a large German Assyrian population resides (many Assyrians in the Netherlands have relatives in Germany.)
The Assyrians have integrated well into the Dutch culture, and thus do not attract negative press coverage like other immigrant groups. While the Netherlands does not take an ethnic census, the number of Assyrians is estimated to be between the 25,000 and 35,000.

Janet Collins (March 7, 1917 in New Orleans, Louisiana – May 28, 2003 in Fort Worth, Texas) was a ballet dancer, choreographer, and teacher. She performed on Broadway, in films, and appeared frequently on television.
After moving to Los Angeles at the age of 4, Collins, received her first dance training at a Catholic community center. Collins studied primarily with Carmelita Maracci, Lester Horton, and Adolph Bolm, who were a few ballet teachers who accepted black students.Dunning, Jennifer. "Janet Collins, 86: Ballerina Was First Black Artist at Met Opera." The New York Times, May 31, 2003. 
Janet Collins was one of the few classically trained Black dancers of her generation. In 1951 she won the Donaldson Award for best dancer on Broadway for her work in Cole Porter's Out of This World. She also performed in Aida, Carmen, and was the first Black ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera. She could not tour in parts of the Deep South due to her race. In later life she taught dance.CBC obituary
Janet Collins was among the pioneers of black ballet dancing and paved the way for others to follow. (Arthur Mitchell, for example, joined the New York City Ballet in the year Collins retired.) In 1932, aged 15, she auditioned with success, for the prestigious Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, but as she was required to paint her face and skin white in order to be able to perform. She did not join the company. In 1948, she moved to New York and got the chance to dance her own choreography on a shared program at the 92nd Street YMHA.Janet Collins. Pocantico Hills School. 
Janet Collins struggled time and again against racism, which did not spare the world of professional ballet dancing. Not many African-American dancers and performers achieved the successful career she was able to attain. In 1951, Janet Collins became the first African American to be hired full-time by the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Marian Anderson, the first to sing there, did not perform until 1955.
Janet Collins' dance reputation today resides primarily in her role in breaking the colour barrier; the constraints on Black classical dancers were too strong for her to have a vibrant performing career. However, her original choreography, which she performed in solo tours, was clearly of note, although few records survive. In her late forties she retired, turning to religion and finding comfort as an oblate in the Benedictine order. She was also an accomplished painter.Yael Tamar Lewin, Night's Dancer, The Life of Janet Collins, Wesleyan University Press, 2011
Janet Collins died in 2003 at the age of 86, in Fort Worth, Texas. In recognition of her great work and dedication, her renowned cousin Carmen De Lavallade established the Janet Collins Fellowship which would honor aspiring talented ballet dancers.

Club de Fútbol Fraigcomar is a Puerto Rican association football club, that mainly hosts an intramural tournament, in which occasionally the best players in each age group are chosen to compete abroad and against other Puerto Rican clubs.
The organization was founded in 1985 when a group of parents decided to improve a park in San Ignacio de Río Piedras to teach football to children. After some time that park became one of the most notable in the country. In 1990 Fraigcomar finally converted into a football club and started showing their potential in the youth squads, especially in under 10. During the nineties Fraigcomar became a Puerto Rican powerhouse in the youth divisions, thanks to the coaching of Antonio Pirillo, which later became the club's president. During Pirillo's coaching years, he had the first teams to win former youth powerhouses; Quintana and Don Bosco.
In 1993 the club started to play in senior level and a few years later with their women's team. In 2005 the team finally established as the best football team in Puerto Rico, winning the senior championship in three successive years from 2005–07 while also winning five of the seven youth categories.
Now the Club is the largest in Puerto Rico with more than 800 football players and more than 10 men's and women's football teams.

CATEGORIES: Divorce, Women in history, English culture, Social history of England, 17th century in England, 18th century in England, 19th century in England, 20th century in England, Marriage, unions and partnerships in England

Wife selling in England was a way of ending an unsatisfactory marriage by mutual agreement that probably began in the late 17th century, when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a halter around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly auction her to the highest bidder. Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife at the beginning of the story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.
Although the custom had no basis in law and frequently resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, the attitude of the authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather than having to maintain the family in workhouses.
Wife selling persisted in England in some form until the early 20th century; according to the jurist and historian James Bryce, writing in 1901, wife sales were still occasionally taking place during his time. In one of the last reported instances of a wife sale in England, a woman giving evidence in a Leeds police court in 1913 claimed that she had been sold to one of her husband's workmates for £1.

[[List of fatal Formula One accidents]]
CATEGORIES: Formula One-related lists, Lists of motorsport fatalities, Racing drivers killed while racing

Formula One (F1) is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/the-fia/about-fia/Pages/AboutFIA.aspx |title=About FIA |publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) |accessdate=31 October 2008 [/tpl] The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform. The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The results of each race are combined to determine two annual Championships, one for drivers and one for constructors.
Safety standards have improved since the first World Championship Grand Prix at Silverstone in [tpl]F1|1950[/tpl], where there was no medical back-up or safety measures in case of an accident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/safety/a_history_of_safety_in_formula_one/7423.html |title=The fifties and sixties |publisher=Formula 1 |accessdate=19 August 2012 [/tpl] In the 1960s helmets and overalls became mandatory and the FIA assumed responsibility for safety at the circuits. Further steps were taken to improve the safety of the Formula One car in the 1970s: the cockpit opening was enlarged allowing the driver quicker escape in the event of an accident and outside mirrors became mandatory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/safety/a_history_of_safety_in_formula_one/7425.html |title=The seventies |publisher=Formula 1 |accessdate=19 August 2012 [/tpl] In the 1980s the carbon fibre monocoque replaced aluminium, increasing protection upon impact.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/safety/a_history_of_safety_in_formula_one/7426.html |title=The eighties |publisher=Formula 1 |accessdate=19 August 2012 [/tpl] Following the death of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in [tpl]F1|1994[/tpl], a number of measures were introduced in an attempt to slow the cars down, including a wooden undertray.

This list includes drivers who have died during a FIA World Championship race weekend, and those who have died while driving a Formula One car  outside of the World Championship. Track marshals and other race attendees who have died as a result of these accidents are not included in the list. Fifty drivers have died driving a Formula One car, with Cameron Earl being the first in [tpl]F1|1952[/tpl].

Assyrian/Chaldo-Assyrian/Syriac Americans are American citizens of Non-Arab Semitic Mesopotamian descent. The United States constitutes the largest population of Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people in the diaspora. They are an Eastern Aramaic speaking Christian ethnic group who descend from the ancient Assyrians. Almost all are followers of the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Syriac Orthodox Church (15,700),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hartfordinstitute.org/research/2010-USOrthodox-Census.pdf |title=Standing Conference of the Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas |author=Alexei Krindatch |publisher=Hartfordinstitute.org |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl] and the Syriac Catholic Church, the remainder are members of various Assyrian Protestant.
Differing names are often accepted for this ethnic group. They are historically indigenous to northern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran, and northeast Syria, a region encompassing what was ancient Assyria from the 25th century BC through to the 7th century AD. The earliest term used to describe them was Assyrian, but others have come in to play due to largely theological differences. The term Syriac (an Indo-European derivative of the earlier term Assyrian) is commonplace, but is often used as a catch all term to describe all Eastern Rite Christians from the Near East, regardless of ethnicity. It is acceptable to Assyrians, as it historically and originally meant Assyrian.
The terms Chaldean, Chaldean Catholic and Chaldo-Assyrian originated in the 18th century, and are also used for those Assyrians who split from the Assyrian Church of the East and entered communion with the Roman Catholic Church between the 16th and 18th centuries AD.

The album was Necro's quickest selling release at the time. Featured guests on the album include Mr. Hyde, Goretex, Ill Bill, Captain Carnage and Kid Joe. The track "Circle of Tyrants" features all four members of the then-non-existent hip hop supergroup Circle of Tyrants who named their group after the title of this collaboration. Band members of the group include Necro, Mr. Hyde, Goretex and  Ill Bill.
The single "Bury You with Satan" was subsequently remixed twice since this release; once in 2003 for Street Villains Vol. 1, with a new verse recorded exclusively for the remix, and again in 2005 for Street Villains Vol. 2. The songs "Dead Body Disposal" and "Poetry in the Streets" were subsequently remixed only once since this release for Street Villains Vol. 1, with a new verse recorded exclusively for both remixes.

M-71 is a state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It serves as a connector between M-21 in Owosso to Interstate 69 (I-69) southwest of Flint. The highway runs along a rail line in a northwest-to-southeast direction in rural Shiawassee County connecting a few small towns along its path.
The highway dates back to the start of the state highway system in 1919. There were some changes made to the routing in the 1930s which increased its length. Two adjacent highways have been rerouted which affected the locations of M-71's termini. The last such change was made in the 1960s when the M-78 freeway (now I-69) was completed near Durand.

[[Williamsburg Charter]]

The Williamsburg Charter is a document that was drafted in 1986 by several Americans, each a member of a prominent religious community and/or non-religious philosophy in the United States.  The Charter was signed by 100 nationally prominent figures on June 22, 1988, in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Virginia's call for a Bill of Rights.  Among the signers were Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter; the late Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court William Rehnquist; the late activist Coretta Scott King (wife of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Junior) and Focus on the Family founder James Dobson. The lead drafter was Os Guinness
The document is an affirmation for a lively and reasoned debate on the role of religion in the public life of the United States.  Its primary focus is on the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause, contained within the first amendment of the United States Constitution, and the goal of the writers is to "affirm both their cardinal assumptions and the reasons for their crucial national importance".THE 1988 WILLIAMSBURG CHARTER ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT  The writers believe that the problems surrounding the religion clauses can only be solved by first understanding the nature of the clauses.  Among the points raised in the charter is that non-religious hostility towards religion is just as dangerous to a democracy as religious hostility towards non-religion or to other religions.

[[Sagar Pawan]]
CATEGORIES: Aerobatic teams, Indian Navy

Sagar Pawan (Sanskrit: sea breeze) is the aerobatic demonstration team of the Indian Navy's Aviation Arm. It is one of the only two naval aerobatic teams in the world, the other being the Blue Angels of the US Navy. 
The team uses 4 Hindustan Aeronautics HJT-16 Kiran Mk.2 trainer aircraft, and is based at the Naval Air Station INS Hansa in Dabolim, Southern India. The colour scheme used by the aircraft is dark blue on white. 
The team started training for aerobatics in late 2001.  The Squadron Commander of INAS 551, then, was Cdr J.S. Tewatia.  The work-up at that time was, however, informal.  The drive gained formal momentum in the latter half of 2002. The paint scheme of the aircraft was changed to the current one and the aircraft were modified for smoke emission with the inboard stations modified for carriage of kerosene tanks mixed with colour dyes (without a dye, kerosene puts out white smoke). The Team was initially called as Sagar Kiran  and it is under this name that the team made its formal inaugural debut display (then with only three aircraft) in Kochi, India on 11 May 2003 for the Golden Jubilee of the Indian Naval Aviation. The founding Leader of the Team was Cdr. Surendra Ahuja.
The formation of the Team gave the Indian Naval Air Squadron 551 a new role. The squadron had on some occasions in the past also attempted to set up an aerobatic team and but the attempts were informal and were not sustained for long enough to assume any significant formality.  The other members of the inaugural Team in 2003 were Lt. Cdr. Yogesh Garud (who himself later, as a Commander, led the Team) and Lt. Cdr. N. Thiagarajan. The Team's name was later changed to the present name of Sagar Pawan.  The new name was selected from among a few others that were suggested by the then Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command Vice Admiral Arun Prakash (later Admiral and CNS). The Team is also fondly referred to as INSPAT - Indian Navy Sagar Pawan Aerobatic Team or simply SPAT. Since then the other team leaders have been Cdr. Sameer Mehra, Cdr. Yogesh Garud and Cdr. Satyen Vartak.
The Team is presently being led by Cdr Yashwant Hemant Karkare.  Since inception the Team has performed in Kochi, Visakhapatnam, Mumbai (Gateway of India), Pune (NDA, Khadakvasla), Lonavala (INS Shivaji) and a number of other locations as also at their home location in Goa. They have also  performed for the International Film Festival of India.  The Team members use every opportunity to interact with their Air Force counterparts, Surya Kirans, who also fly the same aircraft, and the Royal Air Force's Red Arrows who have performed in Goa on a couple of occasions. INAS 551 was awarded the Chief of the Naval Staff's Unit Citation for its contribution to the Navy as a training squadron and for its contribution in setting up an aerobatic team.
On March 3, 2010, an aircraft of the Sagar Pawan team crashed in Hyderabad while performing in an airshow.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8546735.stm Pilot Commander Suresh Kumar Maurya and co-pilot Lt Cdr Rahul Nair were killed in the crash.

[[Argument from desire]]
CATEGORIES: Arguments for the existence of God

The argument from desire is an argument for the existence of God. It is most known in recent times through the writings of C. S. Lewis, for whom it played pivotal role in his own conversion to theism and thence to Christianity. 
As a syllogism it can be expressed as follows.
The argument is not meant to be a proof. The conclusion may not necessarily be the only possibility satisfying the premises. Yet the argument from desire can be persuasive because the premises and conclusion can be not merely understood but "seen" in a much more direct way than similar arguments, such as the Ontological Argument. It is more directly applicable to the human experience.

Neruda became known as a poet while still a teenager. He wrote in a variety of styles including surrealist poems, historical epics, overtly political manifestos, a prose autobiography, and erotically-charged love poems such as the ones in his 1924 collection Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair. He often wrote in green ink, which was his personal symbol for desire and hope.

When President González Videla outlawed communism in Chile in 1948, a warrant was issued for Neruda's arrest. Friends hid him for months in the basement of a house in the Chilean port of Valparaíso. Later, Neruda escaped through a mountain pass near Maihue Lake into Argentina. Years later, Neruda was a close advisor to Chile's socialist President Salvador Allende.

[[Michel Colombe]]

CATEGORIES: 1430s births, 1520s deaths, French sculptors, People from Bourges

Michel Colombe (c. 1430 – c. 1513) was a French sculptor whose work bridged the late Gothic and Renaissance styles.
Born in Bourges into a family of artisans, he was active in Tours. Colombe's surviving works all date from his old age. He created the gisant figures of the two deceased children of Charles VIII of France on their monument (1506) in Tours Cathedral. However, his most important surviving works were for the magnificent tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany, in Nantes Cathedral (1502–07), and for the mausoleum of Philibert II of Savoy, at Notre-Dame de Brou, his masterwork.
The Francis II monument was designed by Jean Perréal; it was disassembled and buried for safekeeping during the French Revolution.(Nantes Cathedral) Le tombeau de François II
An Entombment at the Abbey of Solesmes (1494–98) is attributed to him.  A bas-relief commissioned in 1508 by Georges d'Amboise for the Château de Gaillon is conserved in the Musée du Louvre.
His brother Jean Colombe was an important miniature painter and illuminator who worked on the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. His nephew Guillaume Regnault appears to have trained in his atelier.

Also, the animation style bears a strong resemblance to that of Jackie Chan Adventures, since Jeff Matsuda was the chief character designer for both shows. The designs of many supervillains, like the characters Joker, Penguin and Riddler, are very different from those of their comic counterparts.
A total of 65 episodes were produced and aired over the series' three-and-a-half year run.
The first five seasons are available on DVD.

Kino ([tpl]lang-ru|Кино[/tpl]), known by fans as Chorny albom ([tpl]lang-ru|Чёрный альбом[/tpl], meaning "The Black Album") is the seventh and final studio album of the Soviet rock group Kino. It was released in December 1990 by Metadigital on vinyl. The rough demo version was recorded in the Latvian village Plieņciems shortly before the death of the frontman Viktor Tsoi in a car crash. The remaining members of Kino decided to complete the album as the tribute to Tsoi.

The Communist Bulletin Group was a small left communist organisation based in Scotland.  It was founded in 1981 by groups in Edinburgh and Aberdeen which split from World Revolution (WR).  Many of its founders had originally been members of the Communist Workers Organisation but had left to join WR in 1977.
The split from WR was bitter, and WR accused the Communist Bulletin Group of theft.  The Communist Bulletin Group denied this, and published several harsh criticisms of WR and its international organisation, the International Communist Current.  In return, WR accused the Group of "parasitism".
In the early 1990s, the Communist Bulletin Group began co-operating with the Communist Workers Organisation, and contributed to its paper, Workers' Voice.  However, this came to an end in 1993 when the Communist Bulletin Group disbanded.

[[Kyoho (grape)]]

CATEGORIES: Hybrid grape varieties, Japanese fruit

[tpl]nihongo|Kyoho grapes|巨峰ぶどう|Kyohō budō|literally "giant mountain grapes"[/tpl]   are a Concord-like cross (Vitis vinifera x Vitis labrusca) between Ishiharawase and Centennial grape varieties. Like Concord, Kyoho is a slip-skin variety, meaning that the skin is easily separated from the fruit. Kyoho grapes are blackish-purple, or almost black, with large seeds. While the seeds are bitter and the skin is not traditionally eaten, the flesh is juicy with high sugar content and mild acidity.
Kyoho grapes were first produced in 1937 in Shizuoka Prefecture, but were not so named until 1946. They are popular in Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea for their size and very sweet flesh. They are traditionally served peeled as a dessert, and the juice is used in making chūhai cocktails. Areas of production include Nagano Prefecture, Yamanashi Prefecture, California's Central Valley, Changhua County in Taiwan, and Chile.

The El Diario de El Paso is the primary Spanish-language newspaper for the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas. The paper was founded on May 16, 2005 by El Diario de Juárez. It originally started out as a Mexican newspaper circulated throughout Ciudad Juárez under the name Diario de Juárez. In 1982 Diario de Juárez entered into the El Paso business community by opening a small sales and circulation office. The company became incorporated in Texas as Editora Paso del Norte, Inc..
The newspaper has a daily circulation of over 20,000 copies (100,000 readers) throughout El Paso. The paper is intended to reach young, active adults (target audience 18- 35) of Hispanic descent in El Paso.
Founded in February 1976, Diario de Juárez has grown from a 1,000-copy per day newspaper in Ciudad Juárez to now over 100,000 copies daily in Cd. Juárez, in the city of Chihuahua and throughout the state of Chihuahua. Today, El Diario is the fourth largest newspaper in Mexico.
In 1985 Diario de Chihuahua was established, and a modern five-story office building was constructed.
In 1999 the newspapers changed the name and banner from Diario de Juarez and Diario de Chihuahua to El Diario to better serve the readers in the State of Chihuahua and in El Paso.  Also in 1999, a new press facility was completed in Chihuahua with the latest and most modern newspaper production equipment. Today, the Chihuahua edition of El Diario publishes daily editions for the central communities of Delicias, Cuauhtemoc and Parral.
In 2000 El Diario began publishing a weekly Mexico section, which covers the news of Mexico, somewhat like USA Today does for the US.
The Juárez edition of El Diario, which publishes a daily edition for Nuevo Casas Grandes, also produces an El Paso edition of El Diario on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
On May 29, 2001, Editora Paso del Norte, Inc. purchased the historic 7-story Southern Pacific Railroad building in downtown El Paso. Bank of America is a tenant on the first two floors, and the corporate offices of Editora are on the seventh floor.

[[Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]]

CATEGORIES: Cardiac dysrhythmia, Medical emergencies

Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) is a rhythm disorder of the ventricles of the heart that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. Synonyms: Familial Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (FPVT), Catecholamine-Induced Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia. Thought to affect as many as one in ten thousand people, it is estimated to cause 15% of all unexplained sudden cardiac deaths in young people.
First recognized in 1975, this condition is due to mutations in genes encoding a voltage gated calcium channel or proteins related to this channel. All mutated proteins participate in the regulation of calcium ion flow in and out of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum of cardiac cells. Therefore reduced electrical stability of cardiomyocytes may cause the heart to enter a life threatening state of ventricular arrhythmia as response to the natural release of catecholamines from nerve endings on the heart muscle and from the adrenal glands into the circulation. This rhythm disturbance prevents the heart from pumping blood appropriately. Ventricular tachycardia may self-terminate or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, causing sudden death unless immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation is applied.

[[Great Falls (Catawba River)]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Chester County, South Carolina, Geography of Lancaster County, South Carolina, Rivers of South Carolina, Waterfalls of South Carolina

The Great Falls of the Catawba River mark the point at which the river encounters a series of rapids while coursing across the Piedmont Plateau on the border of Lancaster County, South Carolina, and Chester County, South Carolina, near the town of Great Falls. Prior to the creation of the Fishing Creek Reservoir and other artificial lakes by Duke Power, the falls were a major landmark on the river. The rapids could be heard from long distances away, while a major pre-Columbian trading path ran near the left bank. Historically the Great Falls of the Catawba were approximately 4 miles long, with a total elevation drop of 121 feet. (The word "falls" was an 18th-century appellation, when any river rapids and vertical waterfalls alike were both referred to as falls.) The creation of the dams at Great Falls, South Carolina has resulted in the top 2 miles of it being completely dry (dewatered) except during times of very high flow. The bottom portion of historical Great Falls is drowned by Cedar Creek dam, another hydroelectric project. As of 2006, interest groups have formed in the Carolinas to restore the Great Falls by altering the dam and restoring flow to the dewatered stretch of Great Falls as part of a major restoration project of the Catawba River. As of 2007, a new licensing arrangement has been agreed to by Duke Energy and several interested parties.
Below the Great Falls, the river flows into Lake Wateree where it becomes the Wateree River.

Moser is best known for her 1987 novel Counterpoint, which won her the eighth New Alberta Novel Competition in 1986, and a prize of $4,000 given by Alberta Culture and Irwin Publishers. Although it was originally published in English (Irwin, 1987), it has since been published in two editions in the French language (under the title Courtepointe) (Éditions Québec/Amérique, 1991 and Edition du Club Québec loisirs, 1991). Counterpoint is a story of three generations of French Canadian women and the manner in which their lives interweave in imperceptible and yet intrinsic ways. Despite winning an award, Counterpoint also received a negative review in the Toronto Star, which said that Moser's first novel lacked "narrative skill".
Moser's short stories have been published in a wide array of collections, magazines, and compendiums, and some have been broadcast on the radio.

Gordon Bassett Jones (April 2, 1930 – April 25, 1994) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher.  The [tpl]convert|6|ft[/tpl], [tpl]convert|190|lb[/tpl] right-hander was a native of Portland, Oregon.  He was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as an amateur free agent before the 1949 season, and played for the Cardinals (1954–1956), New York Giants (1957), San Francisco Giants (1958–1959), Baltimore Orioles (1960–1961), Kansas City Athletics (1962), Houston Colt .45s (1964), and Houston Astros (1965).
Jones made his major league debut on August 6, 1954,  starting game 1 of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field.  The Cardinals lost by a score of 7–3.  His rookie year of 1954 turned out to be his most successful season, as he was 4–4 with an earned run average of 2.00.  Jones pitched two shutouts (August 25 against the Pirates and September 18 against the Milwaukee Braves) and allowed 18 earned runs in 81 innings.
In 1955 he started in 9 of his 15 appearances for St. Louis, but with much less success.  His record was 1–4 with a 5.84 ERA.  After that season, he pitched almost exclusively in relief.  His best season after 1954 was for the original San Francisco Giants of 1958, going 3–1 with a 2.37 ERA in 11 games.
Career totals for 171 games include a record of 15–18, 21 games started, 4 complete games, 2 shutouts, 63 games finished, 12 saves, and an earned run average of 4.16.  He had exceptional control during his MLB career, with a strikeout to walk ratio of almost 2-to-1, exceptional for his era.  He walked only 120 batters in 378.2 innings for a BB/9IP of 2.85.
Jones handled 72 of 74 chances successfully for a fielding percentage of .973, and participating in 4 double plays.  He made no errors during his last six major league seasons (119 games).
After his playing career, Jones served for 1[tpl]fraction|1|2[/tpl] seasons as the Major League pitching coach of the Astros — the full [tpl]by|1966[/tpl] season and the first three months of the [tpl]by|1967[/tpl] campaign.  He was fired on July 8, 1967, by manager Grady Hatton after a rift developed between Jones and some members of his pitching staff.The Associated Press, 9 July 1967  Veteran relief pitcher Jim Owens took Jones' place and remained the Astros' mound tutor through 1972.Retrosheet

[[Yanmaodao]]
CATEGORIES: Chinese swords, Blade weapons

The Yanmaodao ([tpl]zh|c=雁毛刀|l=goose-quill saber[/tpl]) is a type of dao used as a standard military weapon during the Ming Dynasty and middle Qing Dynasty (1368–1800). The blade is straight until the curve begins around the center of percussion along the last 1/4 or so of the blade approaching the tip. The center of percussion is the point on the blade with the least vibration on hard contact, the spot on the blade that transmits the most power to the target in a hard chop. This allows for thrusting attacks and overall handling similar to that of the jian, while still preserving much of the dao's strengths in cutting and slashing.Tom 2005, p. 77 This type of sword seems to have lost its popularity with military and martial arts practitioners alike by the end of the 18th century.
Yanmaodao almost invariably have straight grips, although downward-curved handles are depicted in Ming artwork. During the last century of Qing rule, curved grips became far more prevalent than straight.Chinese Martial Arts Swords

[[The Complete Compleat Enchanter]]

CATEGORIES: 1988 short story collections, Fantasy short story collections by L. Sprague de Camp, Works by Fletcher Pratt, Literary collaborations

The Complete Compleat Enchanter is an omnibus collection of five classic fantasy stories by science fiction and fantasy authors L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, gathering material previously published in three volumes as The Incomplete Enchanter (1941), The Castle of Iron (1950), and Wall of Serpents (1960), and represents an expansion of the earlier omnibus The Compleat Enchanter, which contained only the material in the first two volumes. The expanded version also differs from the previous omnibus by omitting its afterword, de Camp's essay "Fletcher and I". The omnibus is the first edition of the authors' Harold Shea series to be complete in one volume. It has appeared under three different titles.  It was first published in the UK in paperback by Sphere Books in 1988 under the title The Intrepid Enchanter and with a foreword by Catherine Crook de Camp.  The first US edition appeared under the title The Complete Compleat Enchanter, and replaces the foreword with a preface by David Drake.  That edition was published by Baen Books in 1989, and has been reprinted a number of times since.  Orion Books published an edition in the UK under the title The Compleat Enchanter in 2000 as volume 10 of their Fantasy Masterworks series.  The stories in the collection were originally published in magazine form in the May 1940, August 1940 and April 1941 issues of Unknown, the June 1953 issue of Beyond Fantasy, and the October 1954 issue of Fantasy Magazine.
The Harold Shea stories are parallel world tales in which universes where magic works coexist with our own, and in which those based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world and can be reached by aligning one's mind to them by a system of symbolic logic. Psychologist Harold Shea and his colleagues Reed Chalmers, Walter Bayard, and Vaclav Polacek (Votsy), travel to several such worlds, joined in the course of their adventures by Belphebe and Florimel of Faerie, who become the wives of Shea and Chalmers, and Pete Brodsky, a policeman who is accidentally swept up into  the chaos. The five stories collected in The Complete Compleat Enchanter explore the worlds of Norse mythology in "The Roaring Trumpet," Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in "The Mathematics of Magic," Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (with a brief stop in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Kubla Khan) in "The Castle of Iron," the Kalevala in "The Wall of Serpents," and Irish mythology in "The Green Magician."

Copperfields Mine, originally known as Temagami Mine, is an abandoned copper and silver mine on Temagami Island in Lake Temagami, Ontario, Canada. The mine opened in 1954 and comprises both underground and surface workings within a sulfide ore body. Situated in Phyllis Township, the mine produced 34,000,000 dollars Canadian with 80 million pounds of copper, 230,028 ounces of silver and 13,271 ounces of gold.[tpl]cite journal|author= |year= |title=Ground Geophysical Surveys: Niemetz Property |journal= |id=[tpl]Afri|31M04SW2038[/tpl] [/tpl] It was considered to produce the purest copper ore in Canada.[tpl]cn|date=November 2012[/tpl] The mine closed in 1972 and is now flooded by water. Ruins of the Copperfields mill are present as fountains. It is possible to find mineral specimens in the spoil heaps of the old mine, such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite, malachite, dolomite, hessite, merenskyite, millerite, palladium, quartz and others. The Lake Temagami Access Road was created to ship ore from the mine site.
Copper-nickel mineralization at the mine is associated with semi-massive to disseminated pyrite at the lower contact between altered gabbro and rhyolite of the Temagami greenstone belt. The gabbro is steeply dipping, approximately 250 m thick and has a strike extent of at least 5 km. The intensity of mineralization varies greatly but is present over most of the defined strike length of the gabbro. Copper is associated with chalcopyrite. Nickel is associated with millerite, gersdorffite, linnaeite and cobalt-nickel sulfarsenides.
Copperfields Mine is the discovery site of a bright white mineral called temagamite.Temagamite: Temagamite mineral information and data. Retrieved on 2007-08-30 It was discovered in 1973.

Miyeok guk is a Korean soup made from the sea vegetable known as wakame or "sea mustard" in English. It comprises two words: miyeok, the Korean word for wakame; and guk, meaning "soup"."
Miyeok guk is typically consumed by women after giving birth as wakame contains a high content of calcium and iodine, nutrients that are important for nursing mothers.[tpl]ko[/tpl] Miyeokguk at Doosan Encyclopedia Many women consume it during the pregnancy phase as well. It is also traditionally eaten on birthdays for this reason, a reminder of the first food that the mother has eaten and passed on to her newborn through her milk, thus bringing good fortune for the rest of the year.
Because it is known as a highly nutritious soup, it is widely consumed in homes and restaurants in Korea.
There are various methods of making miyeok guk, but it is usually made by soaking dried wakame in water until it softens and adding the seaweed in soup stock. The stock may be made from beef and/or seafood such as mussels, clams and dried fish. The soup is seasoned with soy sauce or salt, additional flavoring added with minced garlic and sesame oil.

"Batman and Son"Batman and Son - Trailer is a 2006 comic book story arc featuring the DC Comics character Batman. Written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Andy Kubert, the story was published in four parts in the comic book Batman starting in #655 and ending in #658. The story was the beginning of Morrison's run in the Batman comic as well as his long-term take on the character of Batman through multiple titles over the next seven years. The arc told the story of the introduction of Batman's son, Damian Wayne, into the mainstream continuity of the DC Universe.
Morrison was hired by DC editors to give his take on Batman after having recently given his definitive take on the character of Superman in All Star Superman. In writing the arc, he took ideas from past Batman stories, especially the Elseworlds tale Batman: Son of the Demon. Morrison brought back the idea of a son, Damian, being born from a love affair between Batman and Talia al Ghul, the daughter of his nemesis, Ra's al Ghul. The boy had been trained from birth by the League of Assassins and was sent by Talia to live with Batman in a plot to disrupt his crime-fighting and distract him. It also includes the use of sometime Batman adversary, Dr. Kirk Langstrom and the serum he uses to become the creature Man-Bat.
The arc served as the beginning of Morrison's Batman run and was followed by a prose story about the Joker in Batman #663 and then fan-named story arc The Three Ghosts of Batman (Batman #664–666). These two arcs and the Joker story were ultimately collected together in trade paperback form since many elements introduced in the first arc were used and expanded upon in the second arc. The story had a lasting impact on the DC Universe, introducing the character of Damian who would go on to co-star in two on-going monthly series for DC and appear in other comic books frequently.

"Rhiannon" is a song written by Stevie Nicks and originally recorded by Fleetwood Mac. First released on their self-titled album in 1975, it was subsequently issued as a single the following year.
"Rhiannon" was voted #488 in The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine. Its US chart peak was in June 1976, when it hit #11.Rock Movers & Shakers by Dafydd Rees & Luke Crampton, 1991 Billboard Books. It peaked at #46 in the UK singles chart for three weeks after re-release in February 1978.The Great Rock Discography. Martin C.Strong.. Page 378. ISBN 1-84195-312-1
The song is always referred to as simply "Rhiannon" on Fleetwood Mac albums. The suffixed title "Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win)" was only used on singles in certain territories.
Live performances of the song were sometimes prefaced with Nicks saying, "This is a song about an old Welsh witch."[tpl]YouTube|tR_i0sKWKEA[/tpl]  During 1975–1980, Fleetwood Mac's live performances of "Rhiannon" took on a theatrical intensity not present on the FM-radio single.  The song built to a climax in which Nicks' vocals were so impassioned that, as drummer and band co-founder Mick Fleetwood said, "her Rhiannon in those days was like an exorcism."Stevie Nicks - Behind the Music

After a string of commercially overlooked albums through the late 1970s and early 1980s Reputation finally managed to resurrect Springfield's career and belatedly resulted in her being re-evaluated and recognised by both music critics and the general public as Britain's foremost 'blue-eyed soul' singer. Mainly produced by Pet Shop Boys and Julian Mendelsohn and recorded in the UK over a period of some eighteen months, Reputation became her highest charting and best-selling album in Britain since 1970's From Dusty with Love, peaking at No. 18 and selling 60,000 copies within two weeks of its release.

[[Chief Hunter Jack]]

CATEGORIES: Aboriginal leaders in British Columbia, St'at'imc, Lillooet Country, Bridge River Country, 1905 deaths, Year of birth missing, People from Lillooet

Chief Hunter Jack (died 1905) was a 19th-century chief of the Lakes Lillooet (today's N'quatqua and Seton Lake bands).  His name in St'at'imcets, the Lillooet language, is cited in one source as In-Kick-Tee.
A celebrated guide-outfitter, his hunting territory was the basin of the Bridge River above its Big Canyon, a region which had been the focus of a brutal war the Lillooet and Chilcotin peoples earlier in the 19th century.  According to tradition it was Hunter Jack who negotiated an end to this war in 1845, learning the Chilcotin language to achieve this end; it may also have been him who led the last battle against the Chilcotins at a location named "many roots", believed to at a place known as Graveyard Valley just over the divide between the Bridge and Chilcotin River basins.
As guide-outfitter he had many prominent clients including British Rear-Admiral Michael Culme-Seymour, who on their hunting expedition had gestured over the broad basin of the upper Bridge River and said "Jack, you are the hyas tyee (king) of all this country"  and afterwards sent Jack a Royal Navy officer's uniform,.  Jack took the admiral at his word and became the effective ruler of that region (although as chief of the Lakes Lillooet by tradition he already was the ruler of the area in question).  His protégé as hunting guide was W.G.C. "Billy" Manson, Métis grandson of HBC Chief Trader Donald Manson, whose own sons would continue to work the hunting territory into the 20th century.
Jack's control over the Bridge River was unofficial but very real.  He would choose which prospectors he would allow into the area and at other times chasing out large parties of Italians and Chinese which had penetrated the difficult-to-get-to upper valley in search of gold.  Somewhere in the upper Bridge River Country, perhaps up Tyaughton Creek - it is believed - he had his own extremely rich placer find - so rich that at potlatches at Shalalth he would dispense handfuls of nuggets to band members and guests alike.  As the prospecting population grew in the Bridge River Jack also operated a fresh fish business to supply the miners with food, and also ran a ferry over the Bridge River from which he could monitor the comings and goings of everyone in the valley.
Jack died in what official records describe as a "boating accident" on Seton Lake, where he is supposed to have fallen as he stepped from his boat "hitting his head on an oarlock".  St'at'imc and others in the region contend that Jack was murdered by men seeking to force from him the secret of his hidden gold mine (which remains lost today).  
He was succeeded as chief of the N'quatqua or Anderson Lake Band of the St'at'imc by his son Thomas Jack, who led an unsuccessful campaign for redress for the gold of the Bridge River Country (40 million ounces of gold from the Bralorne mine alone).

[[List of submissions to the 75th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]
CATEGORIES: Submissions for Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award (by year)

The following 54 films, all from different countries, were submitted for the 75th Academy Awards in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (release at the country of origin November 1, 2001 – October 31, 2002, ceremony March 2003). The bolded titles were the five nominated films.
Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Chad submitted films for the first time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
The announcement of the submitted films was delayed when the Academy was presented with four films that did not quite conform to the rules, as written:
The film from Hong Kong was quickly eliminated, but the film from Afghanistan (whose director had been brutally murdered before post-production was finished) was accepted, probably as much for symbolic reasons as anything else.
The United Kingdom was asked to submit another film since AMPAS rules stated that all films had to be in a language indigenous to the submitting country. "The Warrior" was not acceptable, AMPAS argued, because Hindi was not a language indigenous to the United Kingdom, and the film was not about, nor set among British people. Had the film been set among the Hindi-speaking community in the UK, it would have been approved. BAFTA appealed to the Academy to reconsider, but to no avail. Ironically, the film won Best British Film at the BAFTA awards the following year.  Britain ended up choosing Eldra, a film in Welsh. In 2006, AMPAS changed the rules to allow countries to choose films which were not in the language of the submitting country. Canada was the first to take advantage of this new rule by submitting Water, which was also in Hindi.
AMPAS determined that Palestine was not a country, and therefore could not submit a film. They also said that there had been no "national selection committee" that chose Divine Intervention, as required by the rules. It was also unclear how the film would be released in its home country according to the rules, since Palestine had no internationally recognized boundaries. This decision was much criticized, especially since countries like Taiwan, Puerto Rico and Hong Kong, none of which recognized as sovereign nations by the United Nations, had been submitting movies for years. AMPAS reversed its decision the following year, and allowed Divine Intervention to compete.
The previous year's winner Bosnia & Herzegovina did not submit a film.  The Islamic world was better represented in this category than any previous year on record, with ten films in competition, not including Divine Intervention.
The Brazilian submission, City of God was considered as one of the favorites, but it did not receive a nomination in the Best Foreign Film category. When the film was released the following year in the USA, it garnered nominations in four mainstream categories including Best Screenplay and Best Director. Ironically, if the film had been nominated in the Best Foreign Film category, it would have been ineligible for all the mainstream awards the following year because you cannot receive Oscar nominations in two different ceremonies.

It was created by member Hawk, an ex-Tech Support worker, in March 2000, originally as a web comic, but quickly grew into a bulletin board for reader submissions, and soon added the ability for members to comment on the submissions.  Since then, the site has grown in both membership and content daily, with over 9,000 members and more than 60,000 story submissions.  To date, TSC is the largest online community of IT workers found anywhere on the web.
Submissions to TSC include Tech Stories, Customer Misconceptions, Tech Support Rules, Customer Types, Co-worker Types, Customer E-mails, End User Phrase of the Day (or "EUPOTD"), Tech Songs, Cool Links, SoapBox, and finally Tech Calls, where actual calls to tech support can be heard. Also, an IRC chatroom exists: channel #TSC on the Nightstar IRC network. Membership in the IRC channel is open to all; it is not restricted to members of the site.
Access to most TSC content is unrestricted. Everyone may view it, but only members may add comments, or submit content.  What you can submit, and how you can submit it is determined by your level of membership, which is separated into two levels. These levels are Regular Membership (a free membership), and Star Membership (given to members who have made a monetary donation to the site).  While all members may post stories, tech support rules, customer misconceptions, customer and co-worker types, e-mails, EUPOTD's (End User Phrase of the Day), and cool links (see below for further details on each type) only Star Members may use HTML formatting when doing so.  Star members also gain the ability to post Tech Songs, full access to the complete archive of Tech Calls and ability to post to the SoapBox, a specific area on the main page that everyone can see.

[[Interchange fee]]

CATEGORIES: Merchant services, Credit card terminology

Interchange fee is a term used in the payment card industry to describe a fee paid between banks for the acceptance of card based transactions. Usually it is a fee that a merchant's bank (the "acquiring bank") pays a customer's bank (the "issuing bank") however there are instances where the interchange fee is paid from the issuer to acquirer, often called reverse interchange.
In a credit card or debit card transaction, the card-issuing bank in a payment transaction deducts the interchange fee from the amount it pays the acquiring bank that handles a credit or debit card transaction for a merchant. The acquiring bank then pays the merchant the amount of the transaction minus both the interchange fee and an additional, usually smaller, fee for the acquiring bank or ISO, which is often referred to as a discount rate, an add-on rate, or passthru. For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card-issuing bank to the acquiring bank (for the maintenance of the machine).
These fees are set by the credit card networks,United States Securities and Exchange Commission FORM S-1, November 9, 2007. and are the largest component of the various fees that most merchants pay for the privilege of accepting credit cards, representing 70% to 90% of these fees by some estimates, although larger merchants typically pay less as a percentage. Interchange fees have a complex pricing structure, which is based on the card brand, regions or jurisdictions, the type of credit or debit card, the type and size of the accepting merchant, and the type of transaction (e.g. online, in-store, phone order, whether the card is present for the transaction, etc.). Further complicating the rate schedules, interchange fees are typically a flat fee plus a percentage of the total purchase price (including taxes). In the United States, the fee averages approximately 2% of transaction value.[tpl]cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=How Visa, Using Card Fees, Dominates a Market |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/05visa.html?em=&pagewanted=all |quote=The fees, roughly 1 to 3 percent of each purchase, are forwarded to the cardholder's bank to cover costs and promote the issuance of more Visa cards. |work=New York Times |date=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-06 | first=Andrew | last=Martin[/tpl]
In recent years, interchange fees have become a controversial issue, the subject of regulatory and antitrust investigations.  Many large merchants such as Wal-Mart have the ability to negotiate fee prices,The Interchange Debate: Issues and Economics James Lyon, Jan. 19, 2006. and while some merchants prefer cash or PIN-based debit cards, most believe they cannot realistically refuse to accept the major card network-branded cards. This holds true even when their interchange-driven fees exceed their profit margins.A Puzzle of Card Payment Pricing: Why Are Merchants Still Accepting Card Payments? Fumiko Hayashi, March 2006. Some countries, such as Australia, have established significantly lower interchange fees, although according to a U.S. Government Accountability study, the savings enjoyed by merchants were not passed along to consumers."Rising Interchange Fees Have Increased Costs for Merchants, but Options for Reducing Fees Pose Challenges", U.S. Government Accountability Office, November 2009 The fees are also the subject of several ongoing lawsuits in the United States.

[[Canyon Records]]
CATEGORIES: American record labels, Record labels established in 1951, Native American music, Record labels based in Arizona

Canyon Records of Phoenix, Arizona has produced and distributed Native American music for 56 years. Canyon was founded in 1951 by Ray and Mary Boley, who had opened the first recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona Recording Productions, in 1948. The Boley's involvement with Native American music began when Ray was asked by the Phoenix Little Theater to record a Navajo singer named Ed Lee Natay. Boley was so taken with what he heard that he recorded a collection of songs titled Natay, Navajo Singer, an album still in active release (and earning royalties for Natay's family). 
To promote the album, the Boleys took a booth at the 1951 Arizona State Fair. For most of the fairgoers, the recording was only a curiosity, but for Native Americans it was a revelation. They had never seen any of their music available on record before, and the album was well received within the Native community. Before the close of the fair, a Hopi jeweler at a booth next to the Boleys suggested they record Hopi music. 
The Boleys took the idea to heart and soon began recording music from tribes throughout the southwest. Their new label, Canyon Records, was a sister company to Canyon Films, a company also founded in 1951 specializing in documentaries and commercial work.
From the beginning Canyon Records had a different focus from the few other record labels releasing Native American music. Prior to the Boleys' efforts most recordings were produced and released for the benefit of scholars and academics. The Boleys saw their Native American neighbors as customers and tailored their releases to fit the needs and requests of the Native community. In an era when Native Americans were a little-understood, often ignored, and a frequently oppressed minority, Canyon Records served as an important validation of the music, artists, culture, and community.
In 1971, the Boleys sold Canyon Films and expanded the efforts of Canyon Records. They opened a retail operation in Phoenix, and began building a distribution network. This development was laborious, and involved extensive travel by motor home across the country. Many store owners didn't see the potential of selling Native American music. One shopkeeper in Bemidji, Minnesota (adjacent to a significant reservation) responded with, "Indian music...who wants it?" and thus ignoring the potential customers passing his door. Despite this resistance, the Boleys persevered and a built a distribution network throughout the western United States and Canada to sell Canyon titles as well those of other Native American music producers.
In 1984, in an attempt to semi-retire, the Boleys sold their store and distribution company (which still operates under the name Drumbeat Indian Arts) to focus solely on production. Semi-retirement didn't happen. At this time Boley made contact with a Native American flutist named R. Carlos Nakai (Boley had known Nakai's father, Raymond Nakai, who played Canyon music on his Navajo language radio program before becoming Navajo tribal chairman). R. Carlos Nakai had produced a recording of solo flute music called Changes, and Boley asked to distribute it. Nakai, who had been turned down by several record labels, agreed and a new era in Native American music began.
Prior to Changes, most of Canyon's sales were to the Native American community. With the release of Changes Canyon began to place this recording in gift shops, art galleries, and new age oriented retailers. As it became clear that Nakai's music had significant cross-over potential in the gift/tourist and new age markets, Canyon began to build new distribution. The soothing, transporting quality of Nakai's flute music was instantly attractive, and for non-Native listeners, his recordings quickly defined Native American music. Nakai's music would lead the expansion of Native American music into mainstream retailing in the 1990s and Nakai would release more than thirty-five albums and publish a book with Canyon.
The 1980s and 1990s also saw the growth of other styles of Native American music such as Pow-wow, peyote song, and contemporary fusions (rock, rap, new age) as the Native American community increased in population and acculturation. The non-Native community began to share greater interest in Native American culture, fueled by major media productions like Dances with Wolves, Geronimo: An American Legend, 500 Nations, and others.
In 1992, Boley sold Canyon to his long-time executive assistant, Robert Doyle and retired (Mary died in 1991, Ray would die in 2002). Canyon continued to develop its relationship with Nakai and both traditional and contemporary artists. In 2000, Canyon, needing more warehouse space, purchased its present location as well as acquiring a commercial recording studio (Jack Miller Productions) and adding a website management and graphic design company (Nile Graphics).
Canyon has earned the only two gold records for Native American music, both by Nakai, for Canyon Trilogy and Earth Spirit. Additionally, Canyon albums have received twenty-two Grammy nominations with one win for Primeaux & Mike's Bless the People. Canyon has won four INDIE Awards (the Grammy for independent record labels) as well as twenty-five Native American Music Awards (Nammies).
Canyon is at the forefront of developing new forms of Native American music by such artists as Louie Gonnie; Cheevers Toppah, Alex Smith & Kit Landry; Randy Wood; Jay & Tiinesha Begaye among many talented performers. Canyon also continues to work with the very top artists of Pow-Wow music (Black Lodge, Northern Cree, Tha Tribe, Elk Soldier, Warscout) Native Church Music (Verdell Primeaux, Kevin Yazzie, Louie Gonnie, Gerald Primeaux) and chicken scratch (Thee Express, Southern Scratch).

Kansuigyo begin with another interpretation of above-mentioned successful song, which features more rock-oriented arrangement and her listless vocals. Rest of the album mainly consists of the ballads that used strings effectively . "Utahime (Diva)", 8-minute long track included at the end of the album has been one of her fan favorites and also included on her later "greatest hits". Lyrics of "Keisha (The Incline)", the song which described melancholy of a solitary elderly woman who are walking on steep slope, was evaluated literarily and had been listed in a textbook on the Japanese language around the 1990s. When Nakajima recorded the Ima no Kimochi album that were constituted by new interpretations of the past materials in 2004, those two songs were picked out from Kansuigyo.
The album spent the number-one spot on the Japanese Oricon chart for six week, and became the country's best-selling LP of that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamag/album/nenkan1982_a.html|title= Yamachan Land (Archives of the Japanese record charts) - Albums Chart Daijiten - 1982 Oricon Year-end Albums |language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl] It has also been her album that gained biggest commercial success to date, eventually selling about 770,000 units.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamag/album/al_nakajima.html|title= Yamachan Land (Archives of the Japanese record charts) - Albums Chart Daijiten - Miyuki Nakajima|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl]

Pierre de Rosteguy de Lancre or Pierre de l'Ancre, Lord of De Lancre (1553–1631), was the French judge of Bordeaux who conducted a massive witch-hunt in Labourd in 1609. In 1582 he was named judge in Bordeaux, and in 1608 King Henry IV commanded him to put an end to the practice of witchcraft in Labourd, in the French part of the Basque Country, where over four months he sentenced to death several dozen persons.Jonathan L. Pearl, 'French Catholic Demonologists and Their Enemies in the Late Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries,' Church History, Vol. 52, No. 4, 1983, p. 461.
He wrote three books on witchcraft, analysing the Sabbath, lycanthropy, and sexual relationships during the Sabbath. In his opinion, Satan had little sexual intercourse with single women, because he preferred married women for that implied also adultery, and the incest between mothers and sons at the end of the Sabbath was essential to give birth to demonic children, as well as a sexual act between a witch and a he-goat (believed to be Satan present at the reunion). He also thought that Satan was pleased with a clean body but not a clean (or pure) soul, inducing people to wash their bodies and embellish themselves with ornaments.

The band recorded only one album and charted two singles, "Walkin' the Country" and "Just Some Love," on the country charts before disbanding in 1998. Besides its two singles, The Ranch included a song entitled "Some Days You Gotta Dance", which was later released as a single by the Dixie Chicks from their 1999 album Fly, and which also featured Urban on guitar. Urban later started a solo career on Capitol Records. Due to Urban's solo success, The Ranch's album was re-issued in 2004 on Capitol/EMI as Keith Urban in The Ranch with the added inclusion of two bonus tracks.

[[Network tomography]]
CATEGORIES: Networks, Electrical engineering

Network tomography is the study of a network's internal characteristics using information derived from end point data. The word tomography is used to link the field, in concept, to other processes that infer the internal characteristics of an object from external observation, as is done in magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography (even though the term tomography strictly refers to imaging by slicing). The field is a recent development in electrical engineering and computer science, founded in 1996.[tpl]cite journal | last =Vardi | first =Y. | title =Network Tomography: estimating source-destination traffic intensities from link data | journal =Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume =91  | pages =365–377 | year =1996 | doi =10.2307/2291416 | issue =433 | publisher = American Statistical Association | jstor =2291416 [/tpl] Network tomography advocates that it is possible to map the path data takes through the Internet by examining information from "edge nodes," the computers where data is originated and requested from.
The field is useful for engineers attempting to develop more efficient computer networks. Data derived from network tomography studies can be used to increase quality of service by limiting link packet loss and increasing routing optimization.

[[Educating Archie]]
CATEGORIES: 1950 radio programme debuts, BBC Radio comedy programmes, ITV sitcoms

Educating Archie was a BBC Light Programme comedy show broadcast from June 1950 to February 1958 on Sunday lunchtimes featuring ventriloquist Peter Brough and his doll Archie Andrews. The programme was popular despite a ventriloquist act on radio seeming quite illogical. Educating Archie averaged 15 million listeners, and a fan club boasted 250,000 members. It was so successful that in 1950, after only four months on the air, it won the Daily Mail[tpl]'[/tpl]s Variety Award.[tpl]sfnp|Briggs|1979|p=714|ps=[/tpl]
The show introduced comedians who became well known including Tony Hancock as Archie's tutor, who would greet Archie with a weary "Oh, it's you again" and always replied to a put down by him with "flipping kids".  Other "tutors" included Benny Hill, Harry Secombe, Dick Emery, Bernard Bresslaw, Hattie Jacques and Bruce Forsyth together with a young Julie Andrews as Archie's girlfriend. Later, Beryl Reid took this role, playing the St. Trinian-esque Monica with catch-phrases, "jolly hockey-stick" and "as the art-mistress said to the gardener". Reid also played a young Brummie girl, catch-phrase: "Evening each, moy noyme's Mar-leen".
Max Bygraves later played Archie's tutor with catch-phrases, "I've arrived , and to prove it, I'm here" and "That's a good idea ... son!". The duo recorded songs from the show on the HMV label namely "The Dummy Song" and "Lovely Dollar Lolly".

[[The Adventures of Harry Nile]]
CATEGORIES: American radio drama

The Adventures of Harry Nile is a radio drama series created by veteran radio writer and producer Jim French. It has been in continuous production since 1991 and is syndicated nationally as part of the Imagination Theater package. The series made its original debut on January 1, 1976 over Seattle radio station KVI and continued for 24 episodes before French left the station to pursue other interests. In the late 1980s, Jim returned to broadcasting joining the staff of the local CBS affiliate KIRO. In 1990 he was asked if he knew who owned the rights to the Nile shows. Through a bit of foresight in the 1970s, Jim retained the rights to all of his scripts and characters, and it wasn't long before the original 24 episodes along with two that had been produced but never aired were running on Sunday nights. In 1991 Jim began writing and producing new Nile shows with one new episode playing every month, first only locally and then in 1996 nationally. As of this writing, over 190 installments have been done.
From his 1976 debut until his death in October 2004 the part of Harry Nile was played by Phil Harper. Since Harper's passing, the show has starred Larry Albert.

[[Langli]]

CATEGORIES: Halligen

{{Blacklisted-links|1=
 Langli  is a small marsh island in the Ho Bugt near Esbjerg on the Danish North Sea Coast.
It is 0.8 km long and is accessible from Ho over a 3 km long causeway at low tide. Langli (original “Langeleje” = long camp) was up to the flood of 1634 part of a peninsula. Afterwards sea-laterally a second peninsula (today Skallingen) began to develop itself, which from now on protected Langli.
The island was used for agriculture from the 16th century, but was not permanently settled until 1840 when two families moved there. They diked the island and successfully operated agriculture. In 1911 there were 38 inhabitants and even one school. The destruction by two floods and the refusal of the state to support the reconstruction of the dikes led to all inhabitants leaving the island in 1915. A later owner built himself a mansion on Langli. In 1982 the Danish state took the island over. Today, a scientific station is placed in the mansion.
Langli is accessible to the public, by foot, between 16 July and 15 September each year. A multiplicity of different kinds of bird breed on Langli, e.g. seagulls, black-fronted terns etc.

Yuan Zhongdao 袁中道(Yüan Chung-tao), (1570–1624), Chinese poet, essayist, travel diarist and official was born in Kung-an in Hukuang. He shares his fame with two other brothers, Yuan Zongdao (1560–1600) and Yuan Hongdao (1568–1610). The three brothers dominated the literature of the period. From a family of financial means, they printed and distributed their own works. The youngest of the brothers, Yüan Zhongdao, took years in his pursuit of a civil-service examination degree. The brothers were all openly ambivalent about social position. Yuan Zhongdao spent quantities of money on boats for his extended excursions. His brothers and their families were haunted by disease. Yuan Zhongdao’s own life was a story of breakdown at the cumulative stress of family deaths and repeated failure at the civil service examination. Yuan Zhongdao’s principal health problem was perhaps tuberculosis. Yuan Zhongdao would record extremes of mood within even a daily period suggesting perhaps bipolar disorder. Yuan Zhongdao was denied the complete rest he needed for such a condition due to pressing family needs. Yuan’s diary, Yu chü-fei lu (Travels on Board a Boat) is his literary monument. Yuan’s precarious physical and psychological condition provided the background for his preoccupation with longevity and stress avoidance. He avoided a Buddhistic vegetarian diet, perceiving a need for protein in his diet. Excessive drinking and too many wives were other perceived impediments. His travel diary is full of such detail. Yuan records an early reading of the celebrated novel Jin Ping Mei (Golden Lotus). He was likewise associated with the radical philosopher Li Zhi  李贄 (1527–1602) and his espousals of popular literature. Likewise Yuan Zhongdao had the acquaintance of the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci (1552–1610).  In 1616 he passed the Imperial examination and obtained a succession of official posts.

[[Black Cherry (Kumi Koda album)]]

CATEGORIES: Kumi Koda albums, 2006 albums, Avex Group albums, Albums certified million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan

Black Cherry is Kumi Koda's 5th studio album. Much like the two best collections before it, this album came in three editions; a CD only, a CD+DVD and a CD+2DVD version. The first DVD included all but one of Koda's post: second session solo PVs (Futari de…) and the second DVD featured a drama called Cherry Girl, which starred Koda in her first acting role as a main character. This drama was produced by the team who created the drama Busu no Hitomi ni Koishiteru (the drama for which Koi no Tsubomi was the themesong for). On top of all this, the first press versions of these albums featured three bonus tracks: "Twinkle" (from the "Amazing Nuts!" single), "GO WAY!!" (the theme song for the 2006 Crayon Shin-chan anime movie) and "Won't Be Long: Cherry Version" (a different version of the collaboration single "Won't Be Long" Kumi performed with Exile). The first press versions also included an access code to a special Koda website, the chance to win original Koda "Black Cherry" goods (only if purchased alongside the Cherry Girl / Unmei single) and a bonus making feature on the PV DVD. 'Milk Tea' (Track 14) was Koda's first composition that was released on a CD. The "Introduction" track was produced into a full length song and included as a bonus track on Koda's "Kingdom" album.
This album claimed the number one spot for the week the first day of its release and on its first week of release, the album sold 502,426 units. The album remained on the top spot for another three consecutive weeks for a total of four weeks at the number one position. To date, the album has sold 1,031,408 units and has charted on the Oricon Top 300 albums chart for 60 weeks. Black Cherry is Kumi's highest selling studio album and is her only studio album to be certified million.

Floods in Saint Petersburg refer to a rise of water on the territory of St. Petersburg, a major city in Russia and its former capital. They are usually caused by the overflow of the delta of Neva River and surging water in the eastern part of Neva Bay but sometimes caused by melting snow. Floods are registered when the water rises above 160 cm with respect to a gauge at the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute.

[[Water salute]]

CATEGORIES: Firefighting, Greetings, Salutes, Fire service awards and honors

A water salute occurs for ceremonial purposes when a vehicle travels under plumes of water expelled by one or more fire fighting vehicles. 
At an airport, typically an even number of vehicles will line up perpendicular on the sides of the taxiway or apron, and the plumes of water will form a series of arches.  Symbolically the procession would look similar to a bridal party walking under a wedding arch or the Arch of Sabres at a military wedding.
Water salutes are also used for ships and other watercraft, with water being delivered by fireboats.   
Water salutes have been used to mark the retirement of a senior pilot, air traffic controller or the first or last flight of an airline to an airport, or for other notable events.  When the Concorde flew its last flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport blue, white and red coloured plumes were used.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3211053.stm

[[Retention election]]

CATEGORIES: Elections in the United States, State court systems of the United States, Selection of judges in the United States

A judicial retention election (or retention referendum) is a periodic process in some jurisdictions where judges are elected whereby a judge is subject to a referendum held at the same time as a general election. A judge is removed from office if a majority of votes are cast against retention.
A judicial retention vote differs from a regular election in that voters are not asked to choose from a list of candidates — the judges on the ballot do not have opponents.  Rather, the voter chooses between electing the incumbent judge to a further term in office (i.e. voting in favor of "retention") or voting against. In addition, the judge's party affiliation is not listed on the ballot.[tpl]cite journal|author=Larry Aspin, William K. Hall, Jean Bax, Celeste Montoya|title=Thirty Years of Judicial Retention Elections: An Update|journal=Social Science Journal|year=2000|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–17|accessdate=2011-02-24[/tpl] A judge is deemed to have been retained if ballots cast in favor of retention outnumber those against.

[[Cyathium]]

CATEGORIES: Plant morphology, Euphorbia

A cyathium (plural: cyathia) is one of the specialised pseudanthia ("false flowers") forming the inflorescence of plants in the genus Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae). A cyathium consists of:
The flower-like characteristics of the cyathia are underlined by brightly coloured nectar glands and often by petal-like appendages to the nectar glands, or brightly coloured, petal-like bracts positioned under the cyathia. The paired petal-like bracts of Euphorbia section Goniostema are called cyathophylls. here female to male flower ratio is 1:α
The cyathia are sometimes solitary, but are usually in cymes, inflorescences of the second order, in pseudumbels, on dichotomously branched stalks or in so-called simple cymes which consist of one central and two lateral cyathia.
In one group of Madagascan species in the sub-family Euphorbia section Goniostema (E. aueoviridiflora, E. capmanambatoensis, E. iharanae, E. leuconeura, E. neohumbertii, E. viguieri) there is a tendency for a further pseudanthium to grow from the cyme. Probably as an adaptation to pollination by birds, the cyathia have become specialised: Most cyathia have upright cyathophylles which surround them protectively, but render the nectar glands inaccessible. To compensate, between them are naked sterile cyathia whose only job is to produce nectar.

[[Zipper storage bag]]

CATEGORIES: American inventions, Bags, Food storage containers, Packaging, Plastics applications, Food packaging

A zipper storage bag or slider storage bag is an inexpensive flexible rectangular storage bag, usually mainly transparent, made of PVC or similar plastic, which can be sealed and opened many times by a slider which works in a similar way to a zip fastener.  The bags are made in many sizes; a typical small size is [tpl]convert|1.5|x|2.5|in|cm[/tpl] suitable for a few buttons, a large size is [tpl]convert|9|x|12|in|cm[/tpl]. Material thickness (gauge) varies; smaller bags are typically 40 to 45 µm.
Many such bags are of food grade, suitable for foodstuffs such as sandwiches, and freezer storage. Single and multiple small items for sale are often packed in small zipper bags for convenience and visibility.
Sometimes other types of bag, such as a cloth bag for toiletries fitted with a conventional zip fastener, are described as zipper bags.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hoorayblog.com/2011/08/ten-minute-zipper-bag.html |title=Ten minute zipper bag |publisher=Hooray Design Blog |date=August 1, 2011[/tpl]
The bag was patented by Robert W. Vergobbi on May 18, 1954. In the same year, Minigrip licensed them  as pencil bags. The zipper storage bag's most recognized function was not realized until 1957, when a fifth-grader named Robert Lejeune demonstrated that the bag could also be used safely as a food storage device. Eleven years later, in 1968, Dow Chemical Company began marketing them under the name Ziploc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discountplasticbags.com/categories/Ziplock-Bags/ |title=Ziplock Bag History |publisher=Discount Plastic Bags and Packaging |date=May 8, 2012[/tpl]

It was his second film as director and first film as a screenwriter. While Boiling Point is regarded by some American online reviewers as one of the weaker efforts from "Beat" Takeshi, it is seen as an important first step in his development as a director.Review of Boiling Point by Mike Bracken at CultureCartel.com

CATEGORIES: Furniture, Couches

A canapé is a piece of furniture similar to a couch, and is meant to describe an elegant sofa made out of elaborately carved wood with wooden legs, and upholstered seats, back and armrests that seats three, that emerged from France in the 18th century. A style created during the Louis XV and Louis XVI periods, similar yet different from designs used by Thomas Chippendale, it later became popular in the United States during the 19th century.
Its shape is distinct from other sofas of the period, including the divan and chaise longue, but does include several forms. Frequently matching chairs were made to go with it. Precious hardwoods such as walnut, cherry and mahogany were often used in its construction.
Currently the term is used in world furniture design and retail as a variation on "sofa", except when antiques or reproductions of 18th Century designs are concerned.

Khaled Habib El-Kebich (born January 24, 1970 in Tiaret, Algeria) is an Algerian singer-songwriter, composer and an actor. He composes and performs a genre of music which is both traditional and modern. He has developed a personal musical mix in which he blends different musical styles as well as music from all over the world and creates an exciting and unique musical style which is both innovative and captivating. His music could be described as having influences of funk, jazz, reggae, blues, soul, Latin rhythms as well as folk music from various corners of the world. The same applies to the mix of instruments with everything ranging from traditional drums to electronic sounds-capes. 
The fact that his style has its roots in Algerian music mixed with a variety of different musical directions partly because he has written and performed  with a number of bands of different ethnic background, such as Down By Law from Italy, New Phases from South Africa, Aquarius from France, Hada Raïna from Sweden, and others. 
He has also participated at major European festivals such as: Falun Folkmusik Festival, Roskilde Festival, ArtGenda Festival, Stockholm Water Festival, Re:Orient Festival , Folk o Folk Festival, Verlden i Norden Festival, 550 Fatih Istanbul Festival and many others.
Khaled Habib’s artistic field extends into the domains of performing and directing his shows, as well as composing music for films and theatre plays, such as La Celestina set up at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater (Dramaten) under the direction of Robert Lepage (1998), and the film Nattbok by Carl Henrik Svenstedt, “Vingar av glas” and “Cappricciosa” directed by Reza Bagher,”Huvudrollen” by Leyla Assaf-Tangroth. From wild brash orchestral sounds to subliminal moody underscore and shimmering textures, Khaled Habib film-music and scoring is contemporary with emotional sounds-capes that enhance a film work whilst adhering to a consistent musical personality.

M-81 is a state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. The trunkline travels from the city of Saginaw at the junction with M-13 to the junction with M-53 east of Cass City over the county line in Greenleaf Township in northwestern Sanilac County in The Thumb area of the state. Outside of the cities and villages along its route, M-81 passes through mostly rural farm country. Near Saginaw it intersects the freeway that carries both Interstate 75 (I-75) and US Highway 23 (US 23) in an industrial area.
A road bearing the M-81 designation has existed since at least July 1, 1919, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it has been extended, rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 was reversed in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s. The last change was the construction of a pair of roundabouts at the I-75/US 23 interchange in 2006.

[[Song plugger]]

CATEGORIES: Occupations in music, Musical terminology

A song plugger or song demonstrator was a vocalist or piano player employed by department and music stores and song publishers in the early 20th century to promote and help sell new sheet music, which is how hits were advertised before quality recordings were widely available. Music publisher Frank Harding has been credited with innovating the sales method. Tin Pan Alley  Typically, the pianist sat on the mezzanine level of a store and played whatever music was sent up to him by the clerk of the store selling the sheet music. Patrons could select any title, have it delivered to the song plugger, and get a preview of the tune before buying it.
Although the terms are often used interchangeably, those who worked in department and music stores were most often known as "song demonstrators", while those who worked directly for music publishers were called "song pluggers."
Musicians and  composers who had worked as song pluggers included George Gershwin,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gershwinfan.com/George.html | title = George Gershwin Biography | accessdate = 6 Jun 2013 | author = ComposerFan.com[/tpl] Ron Roker, Jerome Kern and Lil Hardin Armstrong.
Later, the term was used to describe individuals who would pitch new music to performers, with The New York Times describing such examples as Freddy Bienstock performing a job in which he was "pitching new material to bandleaders and singers".Sisario, Ben. "Freddy Bienstock, Who Published Elvis Presley Hits, Dies at 86", The New York Times, September 24, 2009. Accessed September 26, 2009. In 1952 Ernest Havemann wrote:  There are about 600 song-pluggers in the U.S.; they have their own union; they are powerful enough to bar all outsiders; and they command fees up to $35,000 a year (worth $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|35000|1952[/tpl][/tpl] today) plus unlimited expense accounts. Their job is to persuade the record companies to use songs, put out by their publishing houses, and the radio station disk jockeys to play the records."[tpl]cite journal|title=The Fine Art of the Hit Tune|journal=LIFE Magazine|date=Dec 8, 1952|volume=33|issue=23|author=Ernest Havemann|page=163[/tpl] 
Song plugging remains an important part of the industry. Record labels and managers will actively search for songs that their artist can record, release and perform, especially those who don't write their own material.

CATEGORIES: Publishing companies of the United States, Educational publishing companies, Publishing companies established in 1983, Database companies, 1983 establishments in the United Kingdom, 1986 establishments in Massachusetts

SilverPlatter Information, Inc. was one of the first companies to produce commercial reference databases on CD-ROMs. It was founded in 1983 in the United Kingdom by Bela Hatvany and Walt Winshall with the explicit intention of using CD technology to publish data.  Ron Rietdyk was the company's first President; it was he, with Pete Ciufetti, Jane Niemi and Chris Pooley, who launched the company in the United States in 1986 from a small building in Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts.
The company began experimenting with four databases: ERIC, LISA, PsycLIT, and EMBASE.  In 1987 the company had 12 databases and revenues of approximately $6m. Competing with CD Plus (now Ovid Technologies), Aries, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts and Dialog, the company offered libraries a wide range of CD-ROMs. Over the next few year the company grew quickly, expanding from its academic base into medical, business and health and safety CD publishing.
In 1989 SilverPlatter launched MultiPlatter, a system for networking CD-ROMs across local area networks, followed in 1991 by ERL (the electronic reference library), a system for providing hard disk access to its databases via the DXP protocol. This last proved successful with more than 500 sites using the technology by 1997. In that year the company had grown to $75m in revenues and had over 250 databases.
In 2001 SilverPlatter was sold to Wolters Kluwer at a reputed price of $113m, and now forms part of Ovid Technologies, the Wolters Kluwer subsidiary.

[[M-83 (Michigan highway)]]
CATEGORIES: State highways in Michigan, Transportation in Saginaw County, Michigan

M-83 is a state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan primarily serving as a link between Interstate 75/US Highway 23 (I-75/US 23) in Birch Run and the Bavarian-themed town of Frankenmuth. M-83 is primarily a north–south trunkline that passes by such landmarks as Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, Zehnder's and the Bavarian Inn before leaving town. The landscape in the remainder of the area is composed of farm fields between Frankenmuth and the northern terminus at M-15 near Richville.
Previously, the M-83 designation was used for a highway in the Upper Peninsula between 1919 and 1926. Immediately after that, the moniker was used to supplant the M-31 designation in The Thumb area. A disconnected segment of highway was given the M-83 name in 1929 in the Frankenmuth area. The gap between the two roads was eliminated within a year. By the end of the 1930s, the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus in the Richville area, removing the The Thumb area segments. The last changes rerouted the southern end to connect with I-75 after that freeway was opened in 1962.

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in New Orleans, Louisiana, National Historic Landmarks in Louisiana, Government buildings completed in 1853, Visitor attractions in New Orleans, Louisiana

Gallier Hall is a historic building on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is the former New Orleans city hall, and continues in civic use. 
Gallier Hall is located on St. Charles Avenue at Lafeyette Square in the Central Business District.  The building was originally designed to be the city hall of New Orleans by the noted architect, James Gallier, Sr..  Construction began in 1845, and the building was dedicated on 10 May 1853.  Gallier Hall is a three-story marble structure fronted by two rows of fluted Ionic columns in the Neoclassical style.  It is one of the most important structures built during the ante-bellum period of the city.  
After its dedication in 1853, Gallier Hall remained the city hall for just over a century.  Many important events during the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the era of Louisiana governor Huey Long took place at Gallier Hall.  
After the City Hall was moved to the modern complex at Duncan Plaza in the 1950s, old Gallier Hall nonetheless continued its traditional place of honor during Mardi Gras.  Viewing galleries in front of the hall are reserved for Mardi Gras royalty, and parades on the St. Charles route pause in front of them.  Marching bands typically perform shows here during the parades. On Mardi Gras Day the mayor of New Orleans toasts the kings of the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club and Rex Parade here. 
Gallier Hall is currently a convention center, reception hall, and home of The Ty Tracy Theatre, named for the late Artistic Director who ran the New Orleans Recreational Department Theatre.  Today, The Ty Tracy Theatre is home to Julie Condy's Crescent City Lights Youth Theatre.  
It also serves special civic functions, including inaugurations of mayors, and particularly distinguished New Orleanians are sometimes laid in state here after their deaths as a sign of deep citywide respect.

CATEGORIES: 2004 films, American documentary films, Genetic engineering and agriculture, Independent films, Anti-modernist films, Documentary films about agriculture

The Future of Food is a 2004 American documentary film which describes an investigation into unlabelled, patented, genetically engineered foods that have been sold in grocery stores in the United States for the past decade. In addition to the US, there is a focus on Canada and Mexico.
It voices the opinions of farmers in disagreement with the food industry, and details the impacts on their lives and livelihoods from this new technology, and the market and political forces that are changing what people eat. The farmers state that they are held legally responsible for their crops being invaded by "company-owned" genes. The film generally opposes the patenting of living organisms, and describes the disappearance of traditional cultural practices.
The film criticizes the cost of a globalised food industry on human lives around the world. It states that international companies are gradually driving farmers off their land in many countries, that monoculture farming might lead to global dependence of the human race on food corporations, and that there is an increased risk of ecological disasters caused by a reduction of biological diversity. For example, the local varieties of Mexican corn are being replaced by subsidized US corn.
It describes a fear of major losses to local food systems and states that these gene banks will no longer be available to save global industrial agriculture when a new pest arises, and that terminator genes could lead to a widespread catastrophe affecting the food supply, if they spread to plants in the wild. Legal stories reported by the film related how a number of farmers in North America have been sued by the Monsanto Company.
The film was written and directed by Deborah Koons Garcia, produced by Catherine Butler and Koons Garcia, and premiered on September 14, 2005 at Film Forum in New York City to a full house. It has since been released on DVD in both NTSC and PAL formats.  The film is currently available on Netflix, and at Hulu.com where viewers can watch the film for free with a few advertisements placed throughout the film.

CATEGORIES: English businesspeople

Jack Olding of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England had a company (Jack Olding & Co. Ltd), which specialised in the import and modification of tanks and tractors during the Second World War (notably being the sole importer into the UK of Caterpillars).
He had a factory on the A1 just to the north of Hatfield, at a site now known as Oldings Corner.
After the war, partly because of government pressure caused by a shortage of dollars, he made an ultimately unsuccessful gamble by relinquishing the Caterpillar agency for what proved to be the less successful Vickers VR tractor. Indeed, the company is recognised as the only Caterpillar dealer to voluntarily give up the franchise. 
On his death the company passed to Scottish Land Development.Maurice H. Sanders, Earth and Tree Moving in War and Peace: 60 golden years, Volume I, Cortney Publications, Ashwell (1999).

The Battle of Ségou was a decisive point in the growth of the Toucouleur Empire (1850-1890), which spread throughout the upper Niger River and Senegal River bassins in the late 19th century.  It marked the destruction of the last of the Songhay successor states, the beginning of El Hadj Umar Tall's conflict with fellow Fula Jihad leader of Macina, and a Toucouleur movement to the east under pressure from French Colonial expansion in the Senegambia.
El Hadj Umar Tall, a Toucouleur conqueror who swept across West Africa from Fouta Djallon, invaded Segou and found an already shaken Bambara Empire. Well trained, regimented, and equipped with modern firearms, Umar Tall's mujahideen readily and easily defeated the Bambara, seizing Ségou itself on March 10, 1861.  Umar made his son Ahmadu Tall king or "Faama", and declared an end to the Bambara Empire.  The Niger River city of Ségou became the center of the Toucouleur Jihad state, and the base for its further expansion to the  east.

CATEGORIES: Ageing, Gerontology, Death, Biology terminology, Senescence

Catabiosis is the process of growing older, aging and physical degradation.
The word comes from Greek "kata"—down, against, reverse and "biosis"—way of life and is generally used to describe senescence and degeneration in living organisms and biophysics of aging in general.
One of the popular catabiotic theories is the entropy theory of aging, where aging is characterized by thermodynamically favourable increase in structural disorder. Living organisms are open systems that take free energy from the environment and offload their entropy as waste. However, basic components of living systems—DNA, proteins, lipids and sugars—tend towards the state of maximum entropy while continuously accumulating damages causing catabiosis of the living structure. 
Catabiotic force on the contrary is the influence exerted by living structures on adjoining cells, by which the latter are developed in harmony with the primary structures.

The First Matabele War was fought between 1893 and 1894 in the country today called Zimbabwe. It pitted the British South Africa Company against the Ndebele (Matabele) Kingdom. Lobengula, king of the Ndebele, had tried to avoid outright war with the company's pioneers because he and his advisors were mindful of the destructive power of European-produced weapons on traditional Matabele impis (units of Zulu warriors) attacking in massed ranks. Lobengula had 80,000 spearmen and 20,000 riflemen, armed with nine-pound Martini-Henrys, which were modern arms at that time. However, poor training meant that these were not used effectively. The British South Africa Company had no more than 750 troops in the British South Africa Company's Police, with an undetermined number of possible colonial volunteers and an additional 700 Tswana (Bechuana) allies. Cecil Rhodes, who was Prime Minister of the Cape Colony and Leander Starr Jameson, the Administrator of Mashonaland also tried to avoid war to prevent loss of confidence in the future of the territory. Matters came to a head when Lobengula approved a raid to forcibly extract tribute from a Mashona chief in the district of the town of Fort Victoria, which inevitably led to a clash with the Company.

The Second Matabele War, also known as the Matabeleland Rebellion and in Zimbabwe as the First ''Chimurenga'', was fought between 1896 and 1897 in the country today called Zimbabwe. It pitted the British South Africa Company against the Ndebele (Matabele) people.
In March 1896, the Ndebele revolted against the authority of the British South Africa Company in what is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First Chimurenga.  The Mlimo (or M'limo, or Umlimo) the Ndebele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. He convinced the Ndebele and the Shona that the settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were responsible for the drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time.
The Mlimo's call to battle was well-timed. Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company's Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the ill-fated Jameson Raid. This left the country nearly defenceless. The British immediately sent troops to suppress the Ndebele and the Shona, but it cost the lives of many on both sides. Months passed before the amount of British forces were adequate to break the sieges and defend the major settlements, and war raged on until October of the following year.

He was selected for the post by Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who was a fellow Cretan.  He is considered[tpl]who|date=January 2013[/tpl] one of the darkest figures in modern Greek history.[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] Stergiadis was arguably[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] possessed of a strict sense of justice and a high ideal of duty, he lived as a hermit, accepting no invitations and never appearing in society. According to George Horton, Stergiadis informed him that he wished "to accept no favors and to form no ties, so that he might administer equal justice to all, high and low alike." It soon became known that when he issued an order he expected it to be obeyed.
He abandoned Smyrna on 25 September 1922 on a British ship, and was transported to Britain. Later the same year he moved to Nice,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl] where he lived until the end of his life, on 22 June 1949, under British protection, leading to wide spread rumors[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] that he had been a Secret Intelligence Service spy. His family's property probably allowed him to live in wealth until the beginning of the Second World War, when most of the companies related to him were destroyed.

On a letter to the then young member of the Greek Parliament, Georgios Papandreou, shortly before the capture of Smyrna by the Turkish forces, Stergiadis writes, referring to the Asia Minor Greeks:The Blight of Asia, An Account of the Systematic Extermination of Christian Populations by Mohammedans and of the Culpability of Certain Great Powers; with the True Story of the Burning of Smyrna; George Horton, 1926.

His Herakleion residence houses the Public Archives and Library of Nicolas Kitsikis (1887-1978), the father of Dimitri Kitsikis. Stergiadis was the stepfather of Beata Petychakis, Dimitri Kitsikis's mother.

[[The Cost of Loving]]

CATEGORIES: 1987 albums, The Style Council albums, Polydor Records albums

The Cost of Loving is the third album by the band The Style Council, released in 1987. This album saw the group concentrating on the R&B styles that had been growing in America during the eighties. Its urban contemporary feel was a jolt to listeners who had grown accustomed to the continental mix of soul music, jazz, and European folk styles that the band had displayed on their previous two albums. United States label Geffen Records heard the tracks and promptly dropped The Style Council from their roster. Polygram records would eventually issue the album Stateside without its much-maligned International Orange jacket design.  Socially conscious soul music pioneer Curtis Mayfield was asked to mix some of the material on the album, which displays hints of being influenced by house music and the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis sound. The initial British pressings of the album were conceived and issued as two 12" EPs in a gatefold sleeve (designed by Simon Halfon with ideas from Paul Weller). Tracks from the album were included in a 37 minute film, Jerusalem, about the band.
Due to the famous original album cover, the album gained the nickname The Orange Album. Today, the album is generally seen as a turning point in the band's career, giving to the sounds later explored on Confessions of a Pop Group and Modernism: A New Decade, whilst the start of the band's declining commercial and critical success. The album received mixed reviews.

[[Pseudanthium]]
CATEGORIES: Plant morphology

thumb|right|200px|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) pseudanthiumA pseudanthium (Greek for "false flower") or flower head is a special type of inflorescence,[tpl]cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=John|title=The genera of flowering plants (Angiospermae)|year=1964|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|lccn=65676[/tpl] in which anything from a small cluster to hundreds or sometimes thousands of flowers are grouped together to form a single flower-like structure. Pseudanthia take various forms. The individual flowers of a pseudanthium commonly are called florets.[tpl]cite web |  title = calflora Botanical Terms | url = http://www.calflora.net/botanicalnames/botanicalterms.html | accessdate = 2012-02-26 [/tpl] The real flowers (the florets) are generally small and often greatly reduced, but the pseudanthium itself can sometimes be quite large (as in the heads of some varieties of sunflower). 
Pseudanthia are characteristic of the daisy and sunflower family (Asteraceae), whose flowers are differentiated into ray and disk flowers, unique to this family. The disk flowers in the center of the pseudanthium are actinomorphic and the corolla is fused into a tube. Flowers on the periphery are zygomorphic and the corolla has one large lobe (the so-called "petals" of a daisy are individual ray flowers, for example). Either ray or disk flowers may be absent in some plants: Senecio vulgaris lacks ray flowers[tpl]cite web | last= | first= | title=Senecio vulgaris L.| publisher=Missouri Plants| date=| url=http://www.missouriplants.com/Yellowalt/Senecio_vulgaris_page.html| accessdate = 2 December 2012[/tpl] and Taraxacum officinale lacks disk flowers.[tpl]cite web | last= | first= | title=Taraxacum Officinale| publisher=Florida Data| date=| url=http://www.floridata.com/ref/T/tara_off.cfm| accessdate = 2 December 2012[/tpl] The pseudanthium has a whorl of bracts below the flowers, forming an involucre.
In all cases, a pseudanthium (inflorescence) is superficially indistinguishable from a flower, but closer inspection of its anatomy will reveal that it is composed of multiple flowers. Thus, the pseudanthium represents an evolutionary convergence of the inflorescence to a reduced reproductive unit that may function in pollination like a single flower, at least in plants that are animal pollinated.

[[Louise Bertin]]
CATEGORIES: 1805 births, 1877 deaths, French composers, Opera composers, Romantic composers, Women classical composers, French women poets

Louise-Angélique Bertin (Les Roches, Essonne, 15 January 1805[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Paris, 26 April 1877) was a French composer and poet.Hugh Macdonald. "Bertin, Louise." In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/02913 (accessed December 30, 2010).
Louise Bertin lived her entire life in France.  Her father, Louis-François Bertin, and also her brother later on, were the editors of Journal des débats, an influential newspaper.  As encouraged by her family, Bertin pursued music.  She received lessons from François-Joseph Fétis, who directed a private family performance of Guy Mannering, Bertin's first opera, in 1825.  This opera, never formally produced, took its story line from the book of the same name, written by Sir Walter Scott.  Two years later, Bertin's second opera, Le Loup-garou, was produced at the Opéra-Comique.
At the age of 21, Bertin began working on an opera semiseria, Fausto to her own libretto in Italian, based on Goethe's  Faust, a subject "almost certainly suggested" by her father.Eric Blom, ed. Everyman's Dictionary of Music, (1946; 1954) s.v. "Fausto". A performance of the completed opera was scheduled for 1830.  However, due to many unforeseen complications, Fausto did not actually reach the stage until a full year later.  It was not well received and only saw three performances.
Shortly before this, Bertin became friends with Victor Hugo.  Hugo himself had sketched out an operatic version of his book Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) and between the two of them, the opera La Esmeralda was born, Hugo providing the libretto.  Bertin was the only composer to have collaborated directly with Hugo on an opera.  However, as the opera’s run began in 1836, there were accusations against Bertin and her family, claiming she had special privileges due to her brother Armand's connection to the government's opera administration. During the seventh performance, a riot ensued and the run of La Esmeralda was forced to end, though a version of the opera continued to be performed over the next three years. The composer Hector Berlioz, who helped Bertin with the staging and production of La Esmeralda, was also accused of providing the better music of this work, a charge he vehemently denied. In frustration, Bertin refused to write any more operas.  In 1837, Franz Liszt transcribed the orchestral score for solo piano (S.476), and made a piano transcription of the "Air chanté par Massol" (S.477).
Bertin did however continue to compose in many different genres.  Her later compositions include twelve cantatas, six piano ballades, five chamber symphonies, a few string quartets, a piano trio (which includes themes from both her early Fausto and La Esmeralda), and many vocal selections.  Of these, only the ballades and the trio were published.
Bertin also wrote and published two volumes of poetry, Les Glanes in 1842 and Nouvelles Glanes in 1876.  The former of these received a prize from the Académie française.  Bertin died the year after the publication of Nouvelles Glanes.

[tpl]MedalCountry | the [tpl]USA[/tpl][/tpl]
Bob Van Osdel (Robert Logan Van Osdel; April 1, 1910 – April 6, 1987) was an American athlete who competed mainly in the high jump.
He competed for the United States in the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, United States in the high jump where he won the silver medal.  A teammate from the University of Southern California, Duncan McNaughton, won the gold medal representing Canada.  According to the International Olympic Committee's website:
 
 In the Olympic final, the battle for gold came down to a duel between the two friends. With the bar at 1.97m, Van Osdel approached McNaughton and advised him on improving his technique. "Get your kick working," he concluded, "and you will be over". That piece of advice and encouragement did the trick. McNaughton cleared the bar and won the gold medal, while Van Osdel missed and won the silver medal. In 1933, McNaughton's gold medal was stolen from his car. Van Osdel, now a dentist, made a mold from his own silver medal, poured gold into the mold, and sent the replica gold medal to McNaughton.  Van Osdel and McNaughton remained friends for life.

Van Osdel served in Europe in World War II in the Army Corps of Dentists.  He and his wife, Ruth, had two daughters, the elder of whom, Virginia, now owns the dentistry practice.

In 2012, the tiny township was selected as the Most Outstanding Community in New South Wales and the ACT (with a population of 15,000 or less) in a competition organised by the Bank of New South Wales.  The town sealed its local airstrip, installed kangaroo-proof fences around the perimeter, and put in night lighting, with half of the costs coming from private donations. Locals had been upset that the Royal Flying Doctor Service had not been able to land there for a medical emergency involving one of the leading members of the local population.  The town also successfully searched the world to recruit its own doctor, when the Health Department had said that no suitable doctor could be found.  And five locals came forward to form a team of local volunteer ambulance officers, in support of the one full-time paramedic that is provided by the NSW Ambulance Service.  Finally, the town constructed a spacious sports centre in a dollar for dollar agreement with the local Shire.  All of these projects in the one year contributed to Tottenham's selection as Community of the Year for NSW.

Universal is the tenth album by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, released in 1996. It features songwriting contributions from co-founder Paul Humphreys, who departed the band in 1989, and Karl Bartos (formerly of Kraftwerk). The album spawned the band's first Top 20 hit in the UK for over five years with the track "Walking on the Milky Way". However, follow-up single "Universal" and the album itself performed poorly and this lack of success prompted singer Andy McCluskey to disband the group. It would remain their final album for over a decade until the band's reunion.

CATEGORIES: Canoeing and kayaking equipment, Inuit clothing

A Tuilik is a traditional Greenland paddling jacket, used when paddling a kayak. It is a jacket and a spray shirt integrated into one piece of clothing, which is sealed at the face, at the wrists and around the cockpit coaming. In this way the paddler can do an eskimo roll without getting wet, and without getting any water into his kayak. The tuilik is also well insulated, to protect against cold weather.[tpl]cite web|last=Carroll|first=Tom|title=THE TUILIK - THEN and NOW|url=http://www.seacanoe.org/tuilik.htm|work=Seacanoe.org|accessdate=26 June 2012[/tpl] Traditionally, a tuilik was made from seal-skin, although, outside Greenland, the modern tuilik is made from neoprene or from waterproof, breathable fabric.
In summer months, an akuilisaq may be used instead.

[[United States Christian Commission]]

CATEGORIES: Union Army, American religious leaders

The United States Christian Commission (USCC) was an organization that furnished supplies, medical services, and religious literature to Union troops during the American Civil War. It combined religious support with social services and recreational activities. It supplied Protestant chaplains and social workers and collaborated with the U.S. Sanitary Commission in providing medical services.
The Christian Commission was created in response to what the troops suffered in the First Battle of Bull Run. On November 14, 1861, the National Committee of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) called a convention which met in New York City. Leaders outlined the work needed to support the soldiers, the design for the United States Christian Commission, whose organization was completed next day. Two of the founding members were Vincent Colyer, who was appalled by the aftermath of the battle of Bull Run, and George Stuart, a well-to-do businessman.
The YMCA and Protestant ministers formed the USCC. Its volunteers were called delegates. Some were seminary students but many were just concerned Christians. As civilians on the battlefield, they did not carry weapons. Five thousand volunteer delegates served during the war. They distributed more than $6 million worth of goods and supplies in hospitals, camps, prisons and battlefields.Stories of the U.S. Christian Commission, Faith at Gettysburg, accessed 3 Mar 2009  The original plan of the USCC was to help the clergy of the armed services in their daily work, as the chaplaincy program was in its infancy, with only some 30 members, who were quickly overwhelmed by the scale of battles and casualties, and especially by the rapidly increasing number of deaths due to wounds and more so to disease.
John Calhoun Chamberlain, brother of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Thomas Chamberlain, heroes of Little Round Top, served with the USCC during the Battle of Gettysburg. During the evening of July 2, John assisted at the medical field station set up for his brothers' regiment, the 20th Maine. John filed a report to the central office, describing the activities of the USCC at Gettysburg. This report[tpl]cite web|last=Chamberlain|first=John|title=John C. Chamberlain and the Christian Commission|url=http://www.edinborough.com/Learn/Commission/Chamberlain.htm|publisher=Edinborough Press|accessdate=24 March 2011[/tpl] is found in Chamberlain's Christian Commission diary, kept during the battle of Gettysburg and is recorded in Edinborough Press' book, Gettysburg and the Christian Commission.[tpl]cite web|last=Hoisington|first=Daniel J.|title=Gettysburg and the Christian Commission|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1889020052|work=2002|publisher=Edinborough Press|accessdate=24 March 2011[/tpl]
Women also participated. A national movement started in May 1864 with a view to organizing a Ladies Christian Commission in each evangelical congregation of the North as an auxiliary to the USCC. Increasing the network of collection, fundraising and support was the way the organization responded to meet a growing demand to serve the soldiers.Official U.S. Christian Commission website, accessed 3 Mar 2009
The USCC continued to grow. More than three-quarters of the value of what it collected was distributed during 1864 and the four months of 1865. It represented both citizens' recognition of need and a more efficient organization. The Ladies Christian Commission (LCC) played a critical role in this success.Official U.S. Christian Commission website, accessed 3 Mar 2009 Louisa May Alcott was among many women who worked with the Commission. Others included Georgia McClellan,[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] the sister of Jenny Wade, the only civilian killed during the Battle of Gettysburg, and Sarah Emma Edmonds, who worked as a nurse after serving with the Union Army as a soldier, spy, and as a male nurse under the name "Franklin Thompson."

[[Marie Antoinette (soundtrack)]]
CATEGORIES: Albums produced by Brian Reitzell, 2006 soundtracks, Film soundtracks, Verve Records soundtracks, Polydor Records soundtracks, Works about Marie Antoinette

Marie Antoinette is the soundtrack to the 2006 Sofia Coppola film of the same name. The soundtrack is composed heavily of atmospheric guitar-based rock music and electronic music, a trend established in previous Coppola films such as Lost in Translation and The Virgin Suicides which were also produced by music director Brian Reitzell.
1980s New Wave and post-punk artists such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, New Order, The Cure, and Bow Wow Wow represent the music that accounts for the bulk of the soundtrack. Coppola's choice of modern music for use in the film's soundtrack is unusual, as the film itself is set in 18th century France. The soundtrack also contains several period baroque pieces, including works by Antonio Vivaldi, Jean-Philippe Rameau and Domenico Scarlatti.
The two-disc soundtrack album was released by Verve Forecast and Polydor Records on October 10, 2006.
The album has been quite successful. It debuted at number 154 on the US Billboard 200. In its second week it jumped to number 97 and was named that week's "pace setter".
It was nominated for "Best Soundtrack" at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards. http://imdb.com/title/tt0422720/awards
The version of "Ceremony" by New Order that appears on the album is the 12" version that appeared in the film, while the trailer featured the original 7" version.

In 1876 the settlement at Tooleybuc was described in the following terms: 
 Tooley Buc is on the New South Wales side of the river, and is on the mail road between Swan-hill and Balranald, being nearly equidistant between the two places.  There is no township there, unless a large public-house and a small and comical-looking wooden chapel, which, by the bye, appeared to be unused, can be held to constitute one, but there is a good deal of settlement in the neighbourhood.  A store and post-office are attached to the public-house.  Tooley Buc is a crossing-place for sheep and cattle.'The Riverine Trade (No. III): Down the Murray', The Argus (newspaper), 29 January 1876, p. 5. 
Tooleybuc is home to a historic bridge over the Murray River.  Constructed in 1907, the bridge is designed to rise to let paddle steamers through. In 1974, the paddle steamer "Pevensey" collided with the bridge after passing through the open bridge heading upstream. The steamer attempted to move to the south bank after clearing the bridge, but was caught in the strong current and swept sideways into the east side of the bridge. The bridge sustained no noticeable damage, but the "Pevensey" suffered some damage to her upper works. After being pulled off by a team of locals who were gathered to see her come through the bridge, the "Pevensey" refueled and made minor repairs, before heading upstream to Echuca.

His Daz Gedeones wollenvluis is a Minnelied on the subject of the mystic love (Minne) of God for the Virgin Mary.
He is also known to have composed songs about the death by murder of the king Erik V of Denmark, also called Glipping, and for praising the new king Eric VI of Denmark; another famous song is Got In Vier Elementen Sich Erscheynet.

This gun proved successful in North Africa against British cruiser tanks and light American M3 Stuart tanks.Rottman, Gordon L. p.4-5 However, it was not sufficient against Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks. Rottman says, that for this reason it was phased out in favour of shorter 7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24 gun that could fire HEAT rounds. Nevertheless, the first gun considered fully effective against these Soviet tanks was 7.5 cm KwK 40 L/43 mounted on Panzer IV Ausf. F2.
This 50 mm gun was mounted as a defensive armament for reconnaissance vehicles like the Puma.

For an item to be material by value many different measures can be used, one of the most common is to use 0.5 - 1% of turnover. Adjustments that would not move profit by more than this will not be put through the accounts as they would not change a user's understanding of the accounts.

The Burlington Northern Railroad, now part of the BNSF Railway, took over the line in the 1990s, and expanded and rebuilt the it to serve a coal-fired power plant at the Thomas Hill Reservoir.

CATEGORIES: Jazz accordionists, Dutch jazz musicians, Musicians from Amsterdam, Dutch accordionists, 1912 births, 1992 deaths

Johnny Meijer (born 'Jan Cornelis Meijer' 1 October 1912 in Amsterdam; died 8 January 1992 in Amsterdam) was an accordionist who played classical, folk, and swing.
For a time he was known as a jazz accordionist and his 75th birthday was celebrated at the North Sea Jazz Festival. He was also the subject of a film.Jura Film  He is the grandfather of pop singer Eva Simons.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
From the 1950s onwards Johnny Meijer frequently toured abroad and earned the title King of the Accordion.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Although the accordion is often associated with folk music, Meyer was versatile enough to play jazz and classical music. Twice he was accordion world champion in 1953 and 1954.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Besides the popular songs he also played fast swing numbers, Romanian music and classical pieces and was widely recognized as a virtuoso jazz accordionist. In 1974 he recorded the Dutch Swing College Band Johnny Goes Dixie LP, which went gold.
He will be remembered primarily as a live performer of folk music in Amsterdam. He was typically seen during performances with a cigar in his mouth, and his accordion (which can be seen at the Gert Nijkamp Muziekhuis in Apeldoorn) shows several burn marks as a result of this. In the last years of his life, Johnny Meyer was rarely invited to play large performances, mainly in connection with his short temper and his drinking, and thus the  King of the Accordion saw out his final days mostly in silence, occasionally playing at weddings and parties.

Barthélemy Joliette (September 9, 1789 – June 21, 1850) was a notary, businessman, seigneur and political figure in Lower Canada and Canada East.
He was born Barthélemy Jolliet at Montmagny in 1789, a descendant of the explorer Louis Jolliet. After his father's death, his mother remarried and he grew up in L'Assomption. He articled as a notary with his uncle, Joseph-Édouard Faribault, was qualified to practice in 1810 and set up practice in L'Assomption. Joliette served as a captain in the local militia during the War of 1812. In 1813, he married Charlotte Lanaudière, daughter of Charles-Gaspard Tarieu de Lanaudière and received as dowry part of the seigneury of Lavaltrie. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Leinster in March 1820; however, parliament was dissoved shortly afterwards and he did not run in the election that followed later that year. 
After his mother-in-law died in 1822, Joliette took on much of the running of the family seigneuries. He had a sawmill built to convert the pine forests into lumber for export to Great Britain. Joliette also established a new village, Industrie, that was later to become Joliette. He was named justice of the peace in 1826 and promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the militia the following year. In 1830, he was elected to the legislative assembly for the newly formed riding of L'Assomption, formerly part of Leinster but only served until 1832, when he was appointed to the Legislative Council. In the meantime, he had expanded his lumber operations, although it was necessary to go further afield in such of timber. Joliette also built a distillery at Industrie and built a railroad to link it to Lanoraie. He also built a church and the Collège de Joliette, run by the Clerics of St Viator. He remained loyal to the government during the Lower Canada Rebellion and served on the Special Council that administered the province afterwards.
He appears to have been opposed to the union of Upper and Lower Canada. He was named to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada in 1841, but attempted to organize support for a motion contesting the legality of the union.
He died in Industrie in 1850.
Besides the town of Joliette, rue Joliette and Joliette metro station in Montreal were named for him.

[[Chamois grip]]
CATEGORIES: Field hockey

Chamois grip or Shammy is popularly used by field hockey players to enhance the grip on their hockey stick. Chamois grips are "overgrips" which means they do not have adhesives on them, instead they are merely wrapped around the hockey stick handle. 
They are very good at preventing the hands from slipping off the stick and are especially useful when wet, this is because they are designed to absorb moisture. Most internationals will use chamois grips over their existing grips for extra feel and grip in the wet.
The chamois grip for field hockey gets its name from the chamois leather but is not related to it now. Most of the grips available are now produced in Pakistan and India, not in the original town in France.

Telemarksavisa is a Norwegian newspaper, published in Skien in Telemark county.
Telemark Arbeiderblad was started on 1 October 1921 as a reaction to the perceived moderate stance of Skien's labour newspaper Bratsberg Demokraten. However, Telemark Arbeiderblad was not published out of Telemark, but out of Larvik, Vestfold. From 1 January 1922 it was published out of Drammen, Buskerud under the auspices of Fremtiden. It changed its name to Telemark Social-Demokrat in August 1922, went defunct in March 1923 but was revived in November 1923—this time in Notodden in Telemark. For a short time the Labour Party had no newspaper in Telemark, as Bratsberg Demokraten had been taken over by Communists in 1923. The name Telemark Social-Demokrat was given up for Telemark Arbeiderblad in November 1926, when it merged with another newspaper also named Telemark Social-Demokrat, owned by the Social Democratic Labour Party. It also moved from Notodden to Skien.[tpl]cite book|last=Øvrum|first=Thor|editor=Flo, Idar|title=Norske aviser fra A til Å|series=Volume four of Norsk presses historie 1660–2010|year=2010|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=978-82-15-01604-7|page=335|chapter=Telemarksavisa[/tpl]
Its editor from 1928 to 1940 was Olav Vegheim. In 1940, when the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany started, the newspaper was usurped by Nasjonal Samling and from September to October 1940 published as Telemark Blad. It was stopped on 30 November, and not revived until after the Second World War, on 11 May 1945.
It had a circulation of about 3,000 in 1932, which rose gradually until its heyday came in 1983 with a circulation of 27,750. It then declined to 25,447 in 1990. It retained its Labour Party connection until 1994, when it became independent, but still owned by A-pressen. It also changed its name to the less labour-inspired Telemarksavisa at the same time. Since 1996 it's had an online newspaper, and the paper edition is published from Monday to Saturday. In addition to Skien, it has offices in Notodden, Porsgrunn, Bamble, Bø i Telemark and Kragerø.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Telemarksavisa|encyclopedia=Store norske leksikon|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Telemarksavisa|language=Norwegian|accessdate=6 July 2010[/tpl] It has stabilized its circulation at about 22,000.

CATEGORIES: High school radio stations in the United States, Radio stations in Illinois, Radio stations established in 1959

WMTH-FM, located in Park Ridge, Illinois, was among the first high school radio stations in the United States when it was licensed in 1959. Established by the Student Council at Maine Township High School, now Maine East High School, the station went on the air during December 1959.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.wmthalumni.com/firstcast.html |work=Park Ridge Herald |title=Maine FM Station In Operation |date=December 1959[/tpl]  The station became known as "The Voice of Maine Township".
The radio station was built by electronics teacher, Theron Whitfield, and electronics students in the school. The first student voice on the station was that of class of 1960 senior, Harrison Ford, who went on to become a major film actor in movies such as Star Wars and the "Indiana Jones" series.
WMTH-FM has studios at all three existing Maine Township High Schools; Maine West High School in Des Plaines and Maine East High School and Maine South High School in Park Ridge. There was also a studio at the former Maine North High School in Des Plaines.
The call letters were chosen "MTH" as in Maine Township High (school). The WMTH-FM antenna is located on the highest point of the school building at Dempster and Potter Roads in Park Ridge. The studio from 1959 through 1970 was located in room 147B, across the hall from the auditorium. When the center courtyard building opened in the fall of 1970, the radio station relocated and the first WMTH-TV television studio was built.
The original power of the station was 16 watts effective radiated power at a frequency of 88.5 MHz. This continued from 1960 until 1983 when the frequency was changed to 90.5 MHz and the power reduced to 8.9 watts. This leaves it as one of the lowest powered FM stations in the United States, and one of few remaining under the now-discontinued Class D license.
WMTH broadcasts between the hours on 9am-5pm on Weekdays only, with each Maine Township school broadcasting on a different day. A full calendar schedule can be found on the station website. WMTH also broadcasts online.
WMTH-FM continues to broadcast a mixture of music, school sports events, and other programs of local interest.

Adapted and directed by Bryan Forbes (Newman's husband), this 'romance in wheelchairs' was considered unusual in its time owing to the sexual nature of the relationship between McDowell and Newman, who play disabled people. It may have been the first film in which a person in a wheelchair is shown having sex.
The film received two Golden Globe nominations, for Best Foreign Film (English Language), and Best Song, "Long Ago Tomorrow".

It requests the auditor to obtain 'sufficient' and 'appropriate' audit evidence in order to draw reasonable conclusions on which to base the audit opinion.
The auditor considers reliability of audit evidence collected. For instance, audit evidence is more reliable when it exists in documentary form rather than subsequent oral representation of the matters. Auditors consider reliability of information but involve little authentication of evidence.

Michigan's At-large congressional district may refer to a few different occasions when a statewide at-large district was used for elections to the United States House of Representatives from Michigan. 
Prior to Michigan's admittance as a state of the Union in 1837, congressional delegates for Michigan Territory were elected from Michigan Territory's At-large congressional district.  The first elected U.S. representative from the state was elected October 5 and 6, 1835. However, due to Michigan’s dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip, Congress refused to accept his credentials until it admitted Michigan to the Union as a state on January 26, 1837.
In 1912, Patrick H. Kelley was elected congressman at-large after Michigan gained one seat due to reapportionment following the 1910 census, but Michigan did not redraw its congressional districts until 1913.
In 1962, Neil Staebler was elected as an at-large candidate after the 1960 census indicated Michigan would gain a seat in the House of Representatives, but the 19th district had not been created at the time of the election.

Stuart Gray (born 18 December 1973, Harrogate, England) is an English-born Scottish footballer and actor.
Gray represented Celtic and Reading as a fullback and won seven Scotland U21 international caps.  He comes from a footballing family as his father Eddie, uncle Frank and cousin Andy have all represented Scotland.
Stuart Gray is the son of former Scottish International Eddie Gray. Stuart was signed to the club as a schoolboy S-Former in 1989 and followed the route of many on to the groundstaff at 16 in 1990. He played Youth and Reserve team football and was released to play for Giffnock Park North AFC. He ended the 91/92 season close to a first team call up and won a new two year contract.  The next season marked his debut with one appearance against Aberdeen 92/93 but a groin strain in October really put pay to his time in 92/93. In the 93/94 season he lost his edge playing with the Premier Reserves and asked for a loan move south of the border. He spent some time on loan with Bournemouth in February before returning to more Reserve team action. At the end of the season he went to Canada on the post-season tournament with the senior team.
Out of contract at the start of the 94/95 season, he was wanted by Sunderland and Blackburn Rovers and signing month-to-month deals. He eventually signed a new deal on 27 January 1995 with the stated intention of leaving if he did not get more first team football. He had a reasonable run of games and was on the verge of the full-time first team inclusion.
In the 95/96 season he won starting appearances in the latter part of the season but an ankle ligament injury proved troubling and curtailed full involvement. The 96/97 Season was troubled by a knee injury and he ended playing most of the season with the Reserves. Out of contract again his future looked uncertain. A deal to take him to Lille fell through in the closed season and he began the 97/98 season on month-to-month deals. In October he was loaned to Morton till January '98, being recalled from Greenock to play against them in the Scottish Cup tie on 24 January. He played a few more Reserve games before being sold to Tommy Burns at Reading on 26 March 1998. 
He was loaned to Rushden & Diamonds and joined them full-time in January 2001 and released at the end of the 04/05 season. He joined Oxford Utd making 10 appearances with them. He has since been associated with non-League Guiseley AFC and he currently coaches the reserve team there along with Vince Brockie.
He has three sons, Sam, Adam and Sean with his wife Angela.
In the 2009 film The Damned United, Gray portrays his father Eddie.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/tv-showbiz-news/entertainment-news/2009/03/15/pundit-gordon-mcqueen-comes-face-to-face-with-old-self-in-football-film-78057-21199055/ |title=Pundit Gordon McQueen comes face to face with old self in football film - The Daily Record |publisher=Sundaymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24[/tpl]

[tpl]Sexual orientation[/tpl]Against Nature? is an exhibition on homosexuality in animals made by the Natural History Museum, University of Oslo, Norway. The exhibition focuses on occurrence and function of homosexuality in animals, and is the first of its kind.
The exhibit contains pictures, animals and models of species known to engage in homosexuality, showing among other things southern right whales and giraffes engaged in same-sex pairing. The museum says one of its aims is to "help to de-mystify homosexuality among people... we hope to reject the all too well known argument that homosexual behaviour is a crime against nature." Most of the exhibition is based on the works of Bruce Bagemihl and Joan Roughgarden.
The exhibition was initiated by the Norwegian Archive, Library and Museum Authority (ABM) as part of their "Break" program, encouraging museums, libraries and archives to do research and exhibitions of controversial and taboo subjects. The exhibition is a direct answer to this challenge, and has received financial support from ABM.
The exhibition ran from September 2006 to August 2007. It was well received, including by the museum's regular visiting groups, mainly families.Europe | Oslo gay animal show draws crowds.

[[Chuck Wein]]
CATEGORIES: American film directors, Harvard University alumni, 1939 births, 2008 deaths, Place of birth missing

Chuck Wein (March 24, 1939[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]March 18, 2008) was an American promoter and manager of entertainment acts whose celebrity stemmed from his five-year (1964–1969) association with Andy Warhol and from his discovery of Edie Sedgwick who became Warhol Superstar of 1965.
Wein graduated from Pittsburgh's Taylor Allderdice High School in 1957 and lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts where he attended Harvard, graduating in 1961. A thesis he had written, centering on Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, remained as a particular source of pride for him. Continuing to reside in Cambridge, he affected the appearance of a 1795 Edwardian dandy, similar to that of the British Teddy Boys, was a successful racetrack bettor and lived what was described as a Bohemian lifestyle. In 1963, while at his therapist's office, he met Radcliffe student Edie Sedgwick and when, upon turning 21 in 1964, she moved to New York, he went with her and began acting as her promoter. Gifted with a glib vocabulary and blonde good looks, he insinuated himself into Andy Warhol's circle of intimates and, by January 1965, had introduced Edie Sedgwick to Warhol and began regularly taking her to Warhol's studio, The Factory.
The celebrity-obsessed Warhol and Sedgwick quickly became fascinated with each other and, by the time Warhol invited Wein and Sedgwick to accompany him to Paris in April 1965 for the opening of an exhibition of his paintings, he announced that Edie Sedgwick would be his new "superstar" and the "Queen of The Factory". Wein wrote and became Warhol's assistant director on Beauty No. 2, a 65-minute feature which presents a barely dressed Sedgwick in bed with Warhol regular Gino Piserchio, reacting and responding to the off-screen voice of the never-shown Wein who harasses her with intimate and annoying questions and comments which Piserchio does not seem to hear or be aware of. The film premiered at the Paris Cinémathèque in July 1965, making Warhol and Sedgwick darlings of the international celebrity circuit, with Wein and Piserchio also basking in the spotlight.
The years 1965 and early 1966 represented the peak period for the Warhol-Sedgwick-Wein collaboration, resulting in nine films, but before the end of the year, a disillusioned Edie Sedgwick left Warhol, never to return. Little more than two years later, in the wake of Warhol's diminished activity following his near-fatal shooting by Valerie Solanas on June 3, 1968, Wein also departed and began traveling the world, with particular emphasis on the Far East, and managing fringe nightclub acts which usually had some unusual, strange or whimsical characteristics, as well as focusing on the occult. He can be seen in the 1967 documentary short about Warhol, Superartist and, in 1972, was credited as director of the Jimi Hendrix concert film Rainbow Bridge. 
Although the day and month of his birth have remained elusive (although see the IMDb entry below), Wein would have marked his 68th birthday in 2008, the year he died in Del Mar, California, fifteen months after the release of Factory Girl, director George Hickenlooper's cinematic retelling of Edie Sedgwick's (Sienna Miller) brief life, with particular emphasis on her time with Warhol (Guy Pearce) and Wein, whose portrayal by Jimmy Fallon was tepidly noted by critics as being "convincing" and "adequate".

Tulpar (Kazakh: Тұлпар, Bashkort: Толпар, Tatar: Тулпар, Kyrgyz: Тулпар, Russian: Тулпа́р, Turkish: Tulpar) is a winged or swift horse in Turkic mythology (for example, Kazakh and Tatar mythology), corresponding to Pegasus. Tulpar is also in state emblems of Kazakhstan and Mongolia
Tulpar came to be was due[tpl]What|date=May 2013[/tpl] to the nature of the people in Central Asia: focused around a hunting life. The people hunted with horses, with the company of a bird of prey. These two animals, with the human imagination, formed into one creating the winged horse known as Tulpar. 
This mythical creature has also been used as state symbols of Kazakhstan – the emblem of which is decorated with two golden Tulpars, the top of the yurt (the yurt is a traditional tent where the Kazakhs lived) and the sun rays. The blue background represents the sky where the Tulpars run. 
Tulpar is the legendary horse that appears in culture of Turkish-speaking nations (Turks, Usbaks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, etc.).  
The association of a bird with a horse can also be changed to that of a sight hound. A picture of a sight hound coming together with a picture of a legendary horse allowed for the word Tulpar to form, which is the kennel name.
The wings were not necessarily for flight but to emphasize their speed. This is the case for the Tulpar. These horses shared their lives with their masters.

The 2004 Football League Cup Final (known as the Carling Cup final for sponsorship reasons) was played between Bolton Wanderers and Middlesbrough at the Millennium Stadium on 29 February 2004. Middlesbrough won the game 2–1 to clinch their first major trophy. Middlesbrough forward Joseph-Désiré Job put Middlesbrough ahead inside two minutes from a tap-in after a Boudewijn Zenden cross. The goal was the fastest ever scored in a League Cup final, but this record would be broken a year later by Liverpool's John Arne Riise. Five minutes after Job's goal, Middlesbrough won a penalty when Job was tripped in the Bolton box by Emerson Thome. Boudewijn Zenden stepped up to take the spot kick and beat Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen.
Kevin Davies scored for Bolton on 21 minutes when an error by Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer allowed Davies' shot to squirm inside his near post, but it proved to be a consolation as the match finished 2–1 to Middlesbrough.

[[Abbott Mysteries]]
CATEGORIES: American radio drama, 1940s American radio programs, 1950s American radio programs

Abbott Mysteries was a comedy-mystery radio program adapted from the novels of Frances Crane (1896-1981). Initially a summer replacement for Quick As a Flash, the series was heard on Mutual and NBC between the years 1945 and 1955.
The Mutual series, sponsored by Helbros Watches, debuted June 10, 1945, airing Sundays at 6pm. The scripts by Howard Merrill and Ed Adamson were in the lighthearted tradition of Mr. and Mrs. North. Julie Stevens and Charles Webster starred as Jean and Pat Abbott, a San Francisco married couple who solved murder mysteries. In the supporting cast were Jean Ellyn, Sydney Slon and Luis van Rooten.
Moving to 5:30pm in 1946, Les Tremayne and Alice Reinheart took over the roles until the end of the series on August 31, 1947.
Seven years later, the characters returned October 3, 1954, on NBC in The Adventures of the Abbotts, broadcast on NBC Sunday evenings at 8:30pm. In this series, the Abbotts were portrayed by Claudia Morgan and Les Damon. The NBC series ran until June 12, 1955.
"The series was resurrected by NBC in 1955 under the new title of The Adventures of the Abbotts and this nudged Mutual into producing a copycat show under the title It's A Crime, Mr. Collins.""The Copycat Shows of Old Time Radio", by Jack French, The Old Radio Times, official publication of the Old-Time Radio Researchers, #26, January, 2008, accessed March 18, 2010 "Many programs in the Golden Age of Radio were flattered by their competitors. ... The Abbotts on NBC were copied exactly in Mutual's It's A Crime, Mr. Collins, including paraphrasing (the original author's) words.""Radio's Clumsy Counterfeits", by Jack French, from Radio Recall magazine, February, 2004, a publication of the Metropolitan Washington Old Time Radio Club, accessed March 18, 2010 "Mutual even used ... the habit of putting a color in the title of every story."

The Ringed Kingfisher (Megaceryle torquata) is a large, conspicuous and noisy kingfisher, commonly found along the lower Rio Grande valley in southeasternmost Texas in the United States through Central America to Tierra del Fuego in South America.
The breeding habitat is areas near large bodies of water, usually in heavily wooded areas where it finds a perch to hunt from. It is mostly a sedentary species, remaining in territories all year long.
It is 40–41 cm long, with deep blue or bluish-gray plumage with white markings, a shaggy crest and a broad white collar around the neck. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the entire rufous belly, which also covers the entire breast of the male. Females are more colorful than the male (i.e., reverse sexual dimorphism) and have a bluish-gray breast and a narrow white stripe separating the breast from the belly.
These birds nest in a horizontal tunnel made in a river bank or sand bank. The female lays 3 to 6 eggs. Both parents excavate the tunnel, incubate the eggs and feed the young.
It is often seen perched prominently on trees, posts, or other suitable "watchpoints" close to water before plunging in head first after its fish prey. They also eat insects and small amphibians.
Their voice is a loud, penetrating rattle given on the wing and when perched.
The Megaceryle kingfishers were formerly placed in the genus Ceryle with the Pied Kingfisher, but the latter is genetically closer to the American green kingfishers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

[[Paik system]]

CATEGORIES: History of Assam, Social history of India, Economic history of India, Ahom kingdom

The ''Paik'' system was a type of corvee labor system on which the Ahom kingdom of medieval Assam was based.  The origin of the word paik is unknown and it is believed that the system is based on the South-East Asian legacy the Ahoms brought with them in 1228. The mature structure was designed by Momai Tamuli Borbarua in 1609. The system continued to evolve over time to meet the needs of the Ahom state and in time began to accumulate contradictions.  Scholars believe that a major reason for the collapse of the Ahom kingdom was that the Paik system had outlived itself by the 18th century. 
Every male in the Ahom kingdom between the ages of fifteen and fifty who was not a noble, a priest, a high caste or a slave was a paik.  According to Guha (1991), about 90% of the population belonged to this class at the time of Rudra Singha, around 1714.  The top landed aristocracy was about 1% and the rest constituted the servile class.

In particular, Lloyd Webber was (and still is) more widely known as a composer of musical theatre.
"Tetris" itself was an early 1990s Eurodance cover version of the most famous tune in the Game Boy version of the game Tetris (which was in turn an instrumental version of the Russian folk song, "Korobeiniki"). Tetris was the free game bundled with the Game Boy.
"Tetris" was popular at the time, and the single reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. Doctor Spin itself may be considered a one-hit wonder ("Tetris" was their sole entry on the UK Singles Chart, and there is no evidence of any other releases under that name). However, Lloyd Webber and Wright themselves have worked together on many other successful projects.IMDB entry on Nigel WrightIMDB entry on Andrew Lloyd Webber Wright produced Bombalurina's 1990 hit cover of "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini"chartwatch.co.uk, article retrieved 29 October 2006swisscharts.com, article retrieved 29 October 2006 (which Lloyd Webber was also involved with), and has subsequently worked on a number of Lloyd Webber's cast albums.

Marike Jager (born February 4, 1979 in Amersfoort) is a Dutch singer-songwriter,[tpl]cite book|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Karla|last2=Sieg|first2=Caroline|last3=Berkmoes|first3=Ryan Ver|title=Amsterdam|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9ZU3Ybd3mHkC&pg=PA37|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=2010-02-05|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781741793123|pages=37–[/tpl] guitarist and television presenter. 
She grew up in Leusden and learned to play the guitar while backpacking through Australia, New Zealand, Asia and South Africa. There she wrote her first song 'Lizzy'. When she got back in the Netherlands she went to the stages, quickly winning the 'Studenten Songfestival in Maastricht (songfestival for students in Maastricht). Soon after she also won the Sky Radio Talentenjacht (Sky Radio Talenthunt), the demopoll by the Brussels Studio and the prestigious 'Grote Prijs van Nederland' 2003 (Grand Prix of the Netherlands) in the category singer/songwriter.
After winning the Grote Prijs, she meets Henk Jan Heuvelink. He plays the wurlitzer, harmonium and the piano. Together they regularly play at festivals, in theaters and on the radio. In 2008 drummer Nicky Hustinx joins the band.
The Beauty Around (2006)
In the summer of 2005, Marike records her first album The Beauty Around. It was released on 15 May 2006, on her own record label, Morning Coffee Records. It is distributed by V2Records. The debut lives up to everyone’s expectations. Marike is awarded the Essent Award for young musical talent, and the album spends many weeks in the charts. She supports the Canadian artist Feist when on tour in the Netherlands. Feist leaves her a personal message: ‘It was very inspiring to share the stage with you.’ 
Celia Trigger (2008)
In 2008, after the band has been joined by drummer Nicky Hustinx, the band releases its second album, Celia Trigger, which receives good reviews and is nominated for the Dutch Edison Awards in two categories: best female artist and best album.
A recording of a concert in Nijmegen, part of the band's first theater tour, is released on a DVD in 2010. The Magic Live Box contains the DVD, a cd containing a selection of the songs, and a bonus cd containing piano versions of some of the songs, played by Henk Jan Heuvelink.
Here Comes The Night (2011)
Marikes third album is something different, something special. The recordings were done by engineer Staf Verbeeck in the Jet Studio, the oldest studio in Belgium and a musical monument where both Edith Piaf and The Rolling Stones have set foot. Soundwise she chooses a new path. ‘Here comes the night’ was mixed by multiple Grammy Award winner Tchad Blake, an idiosyncratic producer who has worked with such artists as The Black Keys, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello and Suzanne Vega.
Marike’s newest album is very distinctive, with cinematic underpinnings. The band is bursting with energy and Marike’s guitar playing is compelling. The recordings were done in the Jet Studio, the oldest studio in Belgium and a musical monument where both Edith Piaf and The Rolling Stones have set foot. In September 2011 Marike is again nominated for two Edisons: 'Best Album' and 'Best Female Artist'.

In December 1987 he took all ten wickets in the second innings a Castle Currie Cup game for Western Province against Orange Free State, the only man to do so in that season's competition.1987-88 Castle Currie Cup - all innings of five wickets or more for a single bowler
Jefferies returned to England for 1988, playing for Hampshire, who finished third-bottom of the 1988 County Championship, the year's highlight being another of Jefferies' career total of four ten-wicket match hauls. He continued to play for Western Province and Hampshire until 1992. Jefferies' career concluded in 1993 when he played for Boland B in the 1993/4 UCB Bowl tournament.
Jefferies coached the Habsani Royals in the 2012 edition of the Wembley Super 8 Cricket Festival in Rylands, Cape Town.

In Worthing Rebecca designed St. Paul's Chapel of Ease (now St. Paul's Church), Beach House and 19-20 Marine Parade, which housed Stafford's Marine Library in the 19th century. 19 Marine Parade was known as Rebecca House as it was believed that the architect himself stayed in the building.[tpl]sfn|Elleray|1998|p=not cited[/tpl] Rebecca was also the architect of Worthing's Royal Baths (now demolished) and several other buildings around the town.[tpl]sfn|Hudson|1980|pp=105–108[/tpl] The Royal Sea House in Worthing, later the Royal Hotel, with Ionic columns and pilasters was rebuilt to Rebecca's designs in 1829 (and destroyed by fire in 1901).[tpl]sfn|Hudson|1980|pp=105–108[/tpl]
Rebecca designed Castle Goring at Goring-by-Sea for Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet. Howard Colvin called the house "an extraordinary fantasy, suavely neo-classical on one side and romantically castellated on the other".[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Around 1813–16Colvin noted a contract at Knebworth dated 18 September 1813.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Rebecca designed the facade of Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, for Mrs Bulwer-Lytton.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Also in the 1820s he restored Penshurst Place, Kent, in Tudor Gothic style, and it was probably to Rebecca's designs that Sir John Shelley Sidney rebuilt the Sidney Chapel.[tpl]sfn|Colvin|1954|p=not cited[/tpl]
Around 1820 Buckingham House (originally 'Buckinghams' or 'Buckingham Place') in Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex was rebuilt to John Rebecca's designs.[tpl]sfn|Hudson|1980|pp=149–154[/tpl] Its grounds are now Buckingham Park but the house itself lies in ruins.[tpl]cite web |url= http://shoreham.adur.org.uk/buckingham_house.htm |work=Shoreham by Sea |title=Shoreham – Buckingham House |publisher=Pastfinder |date=17 December 2006 |accessdate=11 December 2011[/tpl]

[[Roof coating]]
CATEGORIES: Roofs, Building materials

A roof coating is a monolithic, fully adhered, fluid applied roofing membrane. It has elastic properties that allows it to stretch and return to their original shape without damage.
Typical roof coating dry film thickness vary from paint film thickness (plus or minus 3 dry mils) to more than 40 dry mils. This means a roof coating actually becomes the top layer of a composite roof membrane and underlying system. As such, the roof coating is the topmost layer of protection for the membrane, receiving the impact of sunlight (both infrared and ultraviolet (UV), rain, hail and physical damage.
Roof Coatings should not be confused with deck coatings. Deck coatings are traffic bearing - designed for waterproofing areas where pedestrian (and in some cases vehicular) traffic is expected. Roof coatings will only waterproof the substrates but will not withstand any kind of on going use by people or vehicles (such as walkways, patios, sundecks, restaurants, etc.).

Castle Goring is a grade one listed country house  in Worthing, in Sussex, England.
The building to some extent defies categorisation, being neither fully a castle, nor is it fully in Goring.  The word is often used for English country houses constructed after the castle-building era (c.1500) and not intended for a military function.  One of Worthing's two Grade I listed buildings (deemed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport to be of exceptional interest), this is without doubt Worthing's most important building in terms of its architecture.  It has been described by Ian Nairn as reflecting "the equivocal taste of the 1790s as well as anywhere in the country."Nairn, Ian and Pevsner, Nikolaus(1965), "Sussex: Buildings of England" ISBN 0-14-071028-0

Norway Airlines A/S was a Norwegian airline which operated between 1988 and 1992. Focusing on charter, the airline operated two Boeing 737-300 aircraft from 1988 to 1992, after which it operated two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft, one MD-83 and one MD-87. The airline flew a single scheduled route, between Oslo Airport, Fornebu and London Gatwick Airport, at first on contract with Air Europe and from 1991 at its own expense. At its peak, Norway Airlines had 196 employees. The company struggled financially and lost more than 100 million Norwegian krone (NOK) before terminating operations, having never  made a profit.
The airline was established by Trøndelag-based investors on 2 April 1987, having been originally intended to operate charter flights to the Mediterranean area. Ansett Australia was an early investor, but soon sold out. The company suffered with its main contractor, Sun Tours, going bankrupt in 1988, after which the airline moved to the British charter market. Air Europe's holding company bought a third of Norway Airlines in October 1989; this allowed the Norwegian company to start flying Air Europe's route between Oslo and Gatwick as a wet lease operation, in addition to several international destinations from London. Air Europe went bankrupt in March 1991, causing Norway Airlines to temporarily halt operations.
Sterling Airways came in as a new strategic minority owner, and the two airlines started an alliance along with Transwede. Their key goal was to secure concessions to fly between the Scandinavian capital cities of Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen, but no permission was ever granted. Instead Norway Airlines started its own service between Oslo and London. Operations ceased on 14 October 1992 after the board had filed for bankruptcy.

Before the First World War, Painvin taught paleontology and geology as well as playing the cello as a hobby.David Kahn, The Codebreakers - The Story of Secret Writing, 1967, ISBN 978-0-684-83130-5, Ch. 9. He performed cryptanalytic work for the French army after a chance encounter with a member of the French Bureau de Chiffre.
In June 1918, the German army was preparing for a final push to cover the 100 kilometres that separated it from Paris. The Allies needed to know where the German attack would come. Painvin managed to break an ADFGVX enciphered message, which read: "Rush munitions. Even by day if not seen." This message indicated where the German offensive was to take place, and the allies managed to defeat the German attack. In attempting to break the ADFGVX cipher Painvin lost 15 kg in weight.
After the war, he returned to teaching and became president of several companies, as well as of the Paris Chamber of Commerce.David Kahn, The Codebreakers - The Story of Secret Writing, 1967, ISBN 978-0-684-83130-5, Ch. 9. He was made a chevalier of the Légion d'honneur, but was unable to speak about it for many years because of the secrecy that surrounded his work. He died in 1980.

A non-graded stakes event raced on dirt, since 2004 it has been contested at a distance of one and one-sixteenth miles (8.5 furlongs).
The Blue Hen is named for the horse breeding term "Blue Hen,"  meaning a mare who has proved herself exceptional in producing high quality foals, almost regardless of which stallion might be the sire.  These sons and daughters would also have an impact on the breed.  An example of the highest sort of Blue Hen mare would be La Troienne.

HMS ''Foudroyant was an 80-gun third rate of the Royal Navy, one of only two British-built 80-gun ships of the period (the other was HMS Caesar (1793)). Foudroyant was built in the dockyard at Plymouth Dock (aka Devonport) and launched on 31 March 1798.Goodwin (p.179) gives the launch date for Foudroyant as 31 March, 25 May, and 31 August. The text highlights this discrepancy and attributes the August date to Lyon's Sailing Navy List, published in 1993. Dates given for commissioning and other movements, which are taken from the ship's logs, indicate that the March date is correct. A painting depicting the launch, dated 25 May 1798, adds further confusion, though it is not clear from the text if the date represents the launching or the date the painting was finished. Foudroyant'' served Nelson as his flagship from 6 June 1799 until the end of June 1801.
Foudroyant had a long and successful career, and although she was not involved in any major fleet action, she did provide invaluable service to numerous admirals throughout her 17 years on active service. In her last years she became a training vessel for boys.

[[Brabham BT52]]
CATEGORIES: Brabham Formula One cars, 1983 Formula One season cars

The Brabham BT52 was a Formula One car designed for the Brabham team by longtime Brabham designer Gordon Murray for the [tpl]f1|1983[/tpl] season. The car ran on Michelin tyres and was powered by the massively powerful BMW M12/13 turbocharged engine which in 1983 produced about [tpl]Convert|850|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] in qualifying trim, detuned to around [tpl]Convert|640|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] for the races proper. Its drivers were [tpl]f1|1981[/tpl] World Champion Nelson Piquet and Riccardo Patrese.
After the ground effect cars were banned at the end of the previous season, the FIA mandated that all F1 cars be designed with flat undersides for safety reasons. The previously crucial sidepods were now generating lift rather than suction and so the BT52 had short, angular sidepods to keep lift at a minimum. The car featured a distinctive dart-shaped profile and oversized rear wing in an effort to claw back as much downforce as possible, while the monocoque was built from aluminium and carbon fibre composite to keep weight as low as possible. The 1983 season saw refueling stops reintroduced after successful experiments in [tpl]f1|1982[/tpl] so the BT52's fuel system was designed with this in mind and had a small fuel tank positioned high up behind the driver.
The car was easy to drive and Piquet used it to good effect that season. Fighting with Alain Prost in the Renault and René Arnoux of Ferrari, it seemed he would lose out on the title after a run of mid season bad luck. But after German company Wintershall developed a special batch of fuel and further development to the car was done, he became the first driver to win the world championship with a turbo engine after winning three races (Brazil (Rd.1), Italy (Rd.13) and European (Rd.14)), and scoring consistently with three 2nd and two 3rd places. Patrese on the other hand seemed to corner the market on Brabham's bad luck and while often as quick or quicker than Piquet (including leading the San Marino Grand Prix before crashing out with only 6 laps remaining, and grabbing pole at Monza) he didn't score a point until his third in Round 10 at the German Grand Prix. His only other points finish being his win at the season ending South African Grand Prix at Kyalami.
With Piquet winning his second World Drivers' Championship with 59 points, and Patrese finishing 9th on 13 points, Brabham finished third in the Constructors' Championship with 72 points, 7 behind second placed Renault and 17 behind winners Ferrari.
The BT52 was updated after the Canadian Grand Prix to the BT52B and proceeded to win three of the remaining seven races of the season. A further update came later in the season when Brabham adopted the Ferrari style 'winglets' on the rear wing in order to generate more downforce. The BT52 was replaced for the [tpl]f1|1984[/tpl] Formula One season by the Brabham BT53.

The Nun's Story is a 1959 Warner Brothers film directed by Fred Zinnemann and starring Audrey Hepburn, Peter Finch, Edith Evans and Peggy Ashcroft. Based upon the 1956 novel of the same title by Kathryn Hulme, the story tells of the life of Sister Luke (Hepburn), a young Belgian woman who decides to enter a convent and make the many sacrifices required by her choice. However, at the outset of World War II, she finds that she cannot remain neutral in the face of the abject evil of Hitler's Germany.
The book was based upon the life of Marie Louise Habets, a Belgian nurse who similarly spent time as a nun. The film follows the book fairly closely, although some critics believe the film shows sexual tension in the relationship between Dr. Fortunati (Peter Finch) and Sister Luke that is absent from the novel.
A major portion of the film takes place in the Belgian Congo, site of location shooting,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16107/The-Nun-s-Story/articles.html |title=The Nun's Story (1959) |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=October 15, 2011[/tpl] where Sister Luke assists Dr. Fortunati in surgical procedures at a mission hospital.

The Siege of Cuneo was fought on 28 June 1691 during Nine Years' War in Piedmont-Savoy, modern-day northern Italy. The siege was part of King Louis XIV’s campaign against Victor Amadeus, the Duke of Savoy, who had sided with the Grand Alliance the previous year. The siege was an attempt to gain a foothold on the Piedmont Plain, thus ensuring Marshal Catinat's army could winter east of the Alps. Yet due to the incompetence of the two French commanders (in fact, General Vivien de Bulonde, because of decoded messages from Louis XIV to Catinat authorizing his punishment, has been proposed by some to have been the Man in the Iron Mask) – and a timely arrival of Imperial reinforcements – the siege proved a disaster, resulting in the loss of between 700 and 800 men. Although French forces had taken Nice in the west, and Montmélian in the north, Catinat’s small, ill-equipped army was forced onto the defensive. Louis XIV subsequently offered Amadeus generous peace terms but the Duke, who had by now received substantial Imperial reinforcements from the Empire, considered himself strong enough to continue hostilities.

Walter Hieber was an inorganic chemist, known as the father of metal carbonyl chemistry.[ref]
</ref><ref>
</ref>   He was born 18 December 1895 and died 29 November 1976.  Hieber's father was Johannes Hieber, an influential evangelical minister and politician.  
Hieber was educated at Tübingen,Über Komplexverbindungen des dreiwertigen Eisens mit unterphosphoriger Säure, Dissertation, Tübingen 1919. Würzburg,Zur Kenntnis der chemischen Reaktionen des Eisencarbonyls, Habil.-Schrift, Würzburg 1929. and Heidelberg.  In 1935 he was appointed Director of the Inorganic Chemical Institute at the Technical University in Münich.  
Among his numerous research findings, Hieber prepared the first metal carbonyl hydrides such as H2Fe(CO)4 and HMn(CO)5.  He discovered that metal carbonyls undergo nucleophilic attack by hydroxide, the “Hieber base reaction.”Hieber, W.; Leutert, F. “Uber Metallcarbonyle. XlI.

Commissioned to the Swiss architect Hermann Mayer, designed in the eclectic style (with prominent elements of Neo-Baroque and Neoclassicism) and opened in 1897, the mausoleum measures 11 metres in height and 80 square metres in area. The interior was painted by the noted Bulgarian artist Haralampi Tachev. The Battenberg Mausoleum is located at 81 Vasil Levski Boulevard. It was partially restored in 2005.
When Alexander died in exile in Graz, Austria in 1893, he was initially buried there. However, in accordance with his wish, his remains were transferred to the Bulgarian capital. He was given a state funeral attended by the new prince, Ferdinand of Bulgaria, Alexander's widow Johanna Loisinger, and a great number of Bulgarians. Following a service in the St Nedelya Church his body was moved to the Church of St George and subsequently to the newly constructed mausoleum in the centre of the city.
The mausoleum was closed between 1947 and 1991, during the period of Communist rule in Bulgaria, but was subsequently reopened for the public. Today it also exhibits some of Alexander's private possessions and papers, donated by his wife in 1937.[tpl]-[/tpl]

[[Together in Song]]

CATEGORIES: Hymnals, 1999 books, 1999 in religion, 1999 in music, Christianity in Australia

Together in Song: Australian Hymn Book II (ISBN 1-86371-762-5) was published in 1999. It is a book of 783 psalms, hymns and spiritual songs for use in Christian worship in Australia and elsewhere. It is a significant revision of The Australian Hymn Book published 22 years earlier.
It was created by an ecumenical editorial committee chaired by Canon Dr. Lawrence Bartlett and containing representatives from the Anglican, Churches of Christ, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic and Uniting churches.
Major changes include modernising the texts (using inclusive language and reducing archaic language), removing hymns that had fallen out of use, emphasising psalms, and adding of more modern musical settings and worship songs. The book also reflects changes agreed by the English Language Liturgical Consultation in 1988.
Canon Dr. Lawrence Bartlett describes the book as "Ecumenical in that it represents the liturgical insights of those churches represented on the Editorial Committee" and "Contemporary in that all the material, whether old or new, is presented so that today's worshippers can use it without embarrassment or confusion."
The collection of hymns is intentionally international with material drawn from 48 countries. The addition of new songs has broadened the range of musical styles represented, spanning from plainsong to worship songs composed at Hillsong. The most represented hymnwriter is Charles Wesley with 41 hymns, while contemporary hymnwriters like Brian Wren has 24 hymns included, John L. Bell has 27 and Shirley E. Murray has 5. In some circumstances, where the editorial committee could not find a song that adequately fulfilled a need they wrote their own such as Shirley Ludgater's hymn about marriage as an act of creation: "When the light of first creation". 
One criticism of the book is that the use of inclusive language (noted by alt. after the author's name) has ruined the flow of many older hymns.
The hymns are divided into sections reflecting theological themes or liturgical uses and are arranged chronologically within each section. The hymn book contains multiple indexes of tunes, metres, composers and arrangers, authors and translators, texts based on scripture passages, subjects, the church year, first lines and common titles. It is available in harmony, melody line (with guitar chords), large print, software and audio CD editions.

SS ''Timothy Bloodworth'' was a standard Liberty ship built for the United States Maritime Commission during World War II. The vessel was built by Delta Shipbuilding Company of New Orleans in 1943. She was named in honor of Timothy Bloodworth, an American teacher who made muskets and bayonets during the American Revolutionary War, then went on to become a statesman in North Carolina.
The ship was laid down in February 1943, launched in March, and delivered in April. Powered by a triple expansion steam engine manufactured by the Hamilton Engine Company, she was capable of a speed of 11 knots.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.miramarshipindex.org.nz/ship/show/136347| title = Timothy Bloodworth | work = Miramar Ship Index | publisher = R.B.Haworth | accessdate =30 December 2008 [/tpl]  She served in many transatlantic convoys supporting the buildup for and supply of the Allied invasion of Western Europe.  On 24 December 1944, SS Timothy Bloodworth became the first ship to be damaged by a German V-2 rocket.King and Kutta, p. 279.Cressman, p. 283.

The 2004 Lakeside World Darts Championship was the first World Darts Championship held after Imperial Tobacco were forced to withdraw their sponsorship. UK government legislation had banned tobacco companies from attaching their brands to sporting events from 2003.
The tournament had been previously known as the Embassy World Championship for 26 years since its inception in 1978. Bob Potter, owner of the Lakeside Country Club which hosts the event, stepped in to become the new title sponsor of the event. The prize fund for 2004 matched the previous year, with the exception of the non-qualifiers payments which were removed.
The championship was staged between 3–11 January. Andy Fordham became a new name on the trophy after defeating defending champion, Raymond van Barneveld in the semi-final and Mervyn King in the final. Fordham hit the highest 3-dart average in the final (97.08) since the PDC/BDO split in 1993 - although Phil Taylor and Eric Bristow had each surpassed that figure twice in their previous BDO title wins.

[[Temporary equilibrium method]]
CATEGORIES: Microeconomics

The temporary equilibrium method has been devised by Alfred Marshall for analyzing economic systems that comprise interdependent variables of different speed.
For example: Assume an industry with a certain capacity that produces a certain commodity. Given this capacity, the supply offered by the industry will depend on the prevailing price. The corresponding supply schedule gives short-run supply. The demand depends on the market price. The price in the market declines if supply exceeds demand, and it increases, if supply is less than demand. The price mechanism leads to market clearing in the short run. 
However, if this short-run equilibrium price is sufficiently high, production will be very profitable, and capacity will increase. This shifts the short-run supply schedule to the right, and a new short-run equilibrium price will be obtained. The resulting sequence of short-run equilibria are termed temporary equilibria. 
The overall system involves two state variables: price and capacity. Using the temporary equilibrium method, it can be reduced to a system involving only state variable. This is possible because each short-run equilibrium price will be a function of the prevailing capacity, and the change of capacity will be determined by the prevailing price. Hence the change of capacity will be determined by the prevailing capacity. The method works if the price adjusts fast and capacity adjustment is comparatively slow. The mathematical background is provided by the Moving equilibrium theorem.

[[Overcharge]]
CATEGORIES: Legal terms, Economics terminology

[tpl]Other uses|Overcharging (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Overcharging[/tpl]
Overcharge is an economic term that refers to the difference between an observed market price and a price that would have been observed in the absence of collusion. The latter is often called a "but-for price" or a competitive "benchmark price". When collusion is not in use, such as by privately owned businesses, overcharge is considered as a markup of the observed market price for the sole profit of the business and in some states is considered illegal, similar to profiteering and price gouging.
An overcharge may be expressed as a mark-up on the benchmark price, or it may be divided by the observed market price.  When the benchmark price is equal to the marginal cost of production, as it is in perfect competition, then ratio of the overcharge to market price is the Lerner Index of market power.
When the overcharge is multiplied by the quantity purchased, it becomes the monetary injury or damages incurred by a buyer of goods sold by a cartel.
The word is also used (as verb and noun) to describe cases where more than an agreed or standard price is charged for goods or services in a transaction, as when a lawyer bills for more hours than actually worked, a restaurant bill includes items not ordered or is added incorrectly, a builder charges an unreasonable amount for repair work, and so on. Overcharging in this sense may in some cases be a criminal offence (charging for work not done), in others not (a high charge when a price was not agreed).
The term is used in a different sense in US legal circles; overcharging  in this context is a practice whereby the District Attorney's office in a county initially makes criminal charges against a suspect that exceed what is actually justified by the facts to establish a strong plea bargaining position, with the intention of persuading the suspect to plead guilty to a lesser offence to avoid the perceived risk of being convicted of a more serious crime than was actually committed, with more severe penalty.

[[Doctor of Geneva]]

CATEGORIES: Poetry by Wallace Stevens

"The Doctor of Geneva" is a poem from Wallace Stevens's first book of poetry, Harmonium (1923). The poem was first published in 1921,Buttel, p. 162 so it is free of copyright. 

The doctor of Geneva, perhaps a doctor like John Calvin used to plumbing
the depths of religious doctrine, is shaken by his encounter with the
raw power of the Pacific Ocean. A native of Geneva used to its landlocked
lakes, he is also more familiar with Racine's tragedies or Bossuet's
rhetoric than the high-rolling waves that pound the shore where he
stands.  Though professing no awe, he finds that his old European mind suffers an
"unburgherly apocalypse" by his encounter with the art of the New
World. Stevens is self-consciously contributing experiments towards a burgeoning 
American art that may cause traditionalists to use their handkerchiefs and sigh. Vendler sees this as one of Stevens's major themes.Vendler, p. 3
On this reading the poem bears special comparison to The Paltry Nude Starts on a Spring Voyage and Ploughing on Sunday.
A letter from Stevens to an Austrian visitor to America returning to his home in Vienna, may be compared to the poem. 
 
 I was tempted to improvise a reply to the question regarding food for the imagination in this country. It is what it is in any country: reality. It is true that reality over here is different from the reality to which you are accustomed. It is also true that it not only changes from place to place, but from time to time and that in every place and at every time the imagination makes its way by reason of it. This is a simple and unrhetorical answer to your question. A man is not bothered by the reality to which he is accustomed, that is to say, in the midst of which he has been born. He may be very much disturbed by reality elsewhere, but even as to that it would be only a question of time. You are just as likely as not when you return to Vienna to be horrified by what you may consider to be extraordinary change or series of changes.Stevens, pp. 576-7. letter to Victor Hammer, 1948.

Hector Harold Whitlock (16 December 1903 – 27 December 1985) was an English athlete who competed mainly in the 50 kilometre walk. He attended Hendon School, then Hendon County School, in North London, where he planted in 1936 an oak tree sapling presented to him, along with his Gold Medal, by Adolf Hitler at the Olympic Games.
Whitlock won his first national title in 1933. Two years later, he set a new world record for a 30-mile walk, finishing in 4 hours, 29 minutes, 31.8 seconds. In the same year, he also became the first recorded man to walk between London and Brighton in under eight hours.[tpl]cite news|title=Mr Harold Whitlock: Distinguished Olympic walker|newspaper=The Times|date=31 December 1985[/tpl] 
His main achievement came in 1936, where he won the gold medal in the 50 kilometre walk at the Summer Olympics held in Berlin, Germany, representing Great Britain, finishing in a time of 4 hours, 30 minutes, 41.4 seconds. He gained this victory despite being affected by sickness about 38 kilometres into the race. This sickness, apparently food-related, also affected his fellow British competitors Tebbs Lloyd Johnson and Joe Hopkins. 
During the 1936 Olympics, oak saplings were given to gold medallists. Rather than planting the oak in his garden, Whitlock offered his as a gift to his former school, Hendon School. The oak remained at the school until 2007, when it had to be removed due to a dangerous amount of rot.[tpl]cite book|last=Laffaye|first=Horace A.|title=The Evolution of Polo|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9i-bgOjaVysC&pg=PA126|year=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5415-0|page=126[/tpl]
He continued to represent Britain at an international level until 1952, when he came 11th at the Helsinki Olympics. Competing at the age of 48, he was Britain's oldest ever international athlete.
After this, Whitlock continued as a coach and judge. Notably, he coached Don Thompson, who won gold in the 50 kilometre walking event at the 1960 Olympics.  Whitlock served as an official at those same Olympics.
He died on 27 December 1985 at the age of 82.
In 2011, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.

Mark Phillip Dixie (born 24 September 1970) is a British chef who was convicted on 22 February 2008 of murdering eighteen-year-old model Sally Anne Bowman on 25 September 2005 in South Croydon, London.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579460/Mark-Dixie-guilty-of-Sally-Anne-Bowman-murder.html |title=Mark Dixie guilty of Sally Anne Bowman murder |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |first=Emma |last=Henry |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
Dixie was born in Streatham, London. His parents separated when he was 18 months old. When he was eight, his mother remarried; she had two sons by her new husband. He admits to having been a heavy drinker and user of cannabis and cocaine for years.The killer on the doorstep He has a long criminal record. His first conviction was for robbery - he mugged a woman at knifepoint, for which he was sentenced to six weeks' detention.
Sally Anne Bowman had been stabbed to death yards from her home after a night out with friends. Dixie worked at the Ye Old Six Bells in Horley, Surrey.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7257415.stm |title=Killer kept friends at a distance |first=Rachel |last=Grant |publisher=BBC News |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] His DNA was taken when he was arrested in neighbouring town Crawley, West Sussex,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579461/Mark-Dixie-20-years-of-sexual-violence.html |title=Mark Dixie: 20 years of sexual violence |first=Caroline |last=Gammell |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] after being involved in a fight while watching a World Cup football match, and matched with that of Bowman's killer.
Dixie is also accused of a sexual assault in 2001, where it is believed he masturbated in front of a woman in a telephone booth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/garyhughes/index.php/theaustralian/comments/uk_link_in_wa_serial_murders/ |title=UK link in WA serial murders? | date=2 October 2006 | first=Gary |last=Hughes |newspaper=The Australian |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
In October 2006, Dixie's DNA was sent to Western Australia to be tested against that of the DNA evidence in the Claremont serial killer case between 1996 and 1997, as it is believed he was in the area at the time of the killings, and may have committed them. At his trial for the murder of Sally Anne Bowman, an unnamed Thai woman gave evidence that Dixie had stabbed and raped her in Australia in 1998; Dixie has yet to be formally charged with this attack, though a DNA sample from the woman's underwear has been matched to him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7250896.stm |title=Woman 'stabbed by murder suspect' |publisher=BBC News |date=18 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl] Dixie denied the murder but, as part of his defence, claimed that he had spent the night on drink and drugs and had gone out to buy more cocaine. He claimed to have come across the body of Bowman, murdered, he said, by a third party, and had sex with her after she was killed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7228325.stm |title=Man 'had sex with victim's body' |publisher=BBC News |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
Dixie was found guilty of Bowman's murder on 22 February 2008 and was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey, where the trial judge recommended that Dixie should not be released for a minimum of 34 years, by which time he will be 70 years old. This is among the longest minimum terms ever imposed upon a single murderer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7254628.stm |title=Man gets life for model's murder |publisher=BBC News |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
Following Dixie's conviction, Detective Superintendent Stuart Cundy, who had led the Bowman investigation, said: "It is my opinion that a national DNA register – with all its appropriate safeguards – could have identified Sally Anne's murderer within 24 hours. Instead it took nearly nine months before Mark Dixie was identified, and almost two-and-a-half years for justice to be done." The calls for a such a register were, however, turned down by ministers and other politicians who claimed that it would raise practical as well as civil liberties issues.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7260164.stm |title=Mandatory DNA database rejected |publisher=BBC News |date=23 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]

[[Xanthopsia]]

CATEGORIES: Vision

Xanthopsia is a color vision deficiency in which there is a predominance of yellow in vision due to a yellowing of the optical media of the eye. The most common cause is digoxin's inhibitory action on the Sodium pump, and the development of cataracts which can cause a yellow filtering effect. 
It has been suggested that Digitalis-derived digoxin, used to treat heart failure, induced xanthopsia responsible for the yellow tinting exhibited by many of Van Gogh's  works. http://www.psych.ucalgary.ca/PACE/VA-Lab/AVDE-Website/VanGogh.html
Xanthopsia is also a rare side-effect of jaundice, in which bilirubin may be deposited into the eye in sufficient quantity to produce a yellow tint to the vision.Weatherall, D. J.; Ledingham, J. G.

[[Benetton B194]]

CATEGORIES: 1994 Formula One season cars, Benetton Formula One cars

The Benetton B194 was designed by Rory Byrne for the 1994 Formula One season. The car was closely based on the previous Benetton B192/3 and powered by a Ford Zetec-R V8 engine (produced by Cosworth but badged as a Ford). The electronic driver aids that had had such an effect on F1 over the previous seasons were banned, so the car had to be redesigned with the new rules in mind. The B194 was a light and nimble car that handled well and was most competitive in the hands of Schumacher on twisty tracks unlike the early Williams FW16 which proved difficult to drive thanks to Williams' dependence on electronic driving aids in the previous season. Michael Schumacher's B194 remained the most competitive driver/car combination until Williams introduced a B-spec car at the German Grand Prix.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
The car was very competitive in the hands of Michael Schumacher, for whom the B194 was specifically designed to suit his driving style.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Schumacher won six of the first seven races of the season after his main rival, Ayrton Senna was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix.
Other teams suspected the B194 was not legal, due to the high competitiveness of such a comparatively underpowered car. The FIA launched an investigation and a start sequence (launch control) system was discovered in the cars' onboard computer systems but no traction control. In the end, the governing body could not prove the systems had been used so the complaints were dropped. Schumacher himself was subject to controversy, after being disqualified from the British Grand Prix and then the Belgian Grand Prix which allowed Damon Hill to cut into the German's points lead and as they came to the final race in Australia, Hill and Schumacher were separated by one point. Schumacher commented years later that the B194 was actually quite a handful to drive, being twitchy at the rear end.
Schumacher had three team-mates—JJ Lehto, Jos Verstappen and Johnny Herbert—during the course of the season.  All found the B194 difficult to drive; Verstappen said in 1996 that "I must have a little the same driving style as Johnny because he said basically the same things about that car that I did and seems to have had the same feelings. It was a very difficult car. You could not feel the limit and so you were pushing and pushing and then suddenly it would have oversteer. Normally when you get oversteer you can control it but the Benetton would go very suddenly and so you ended up having a spin. I had big problems with that car."[tpl]cite web|last=Saward|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Saward|title=Interview – The Flying Dutchman: Jos Verstappen|publisher=Inside F1|work=grandprix.com|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00225.html|date=1996-05-01|accessdate=2009-11-15[/tpl]
A contentious collision between Hill and Schumacher ended the 1994 drivers' title in Schumacher's favour, and the B194 was retired at the end of the season with eight wins and second place in the constructors' championship. The car was replaced by the Benetton B195 for 1995.

[[Hierarchical modulation]]

CATEGORIES: Quantized radio modulation modes, Radio resource management

Hierarchical modulation, also called layered modulation, is one of the signal processing techniques for multiplexing and modulating multiple data streams into one single symbol stream, where base-layer symbols and enhancement-layer symbols are synchronously overplayed before transmission. 
Hierarchical modulation is particularly used to mitigate the cliff effect in digital television broadcast, particularly mobile TV, by providing a (lower quality) fallback signal in case of weak signals, allowing graceful degradation instead of complete signal loss. It has been widely proven and included in various standards, such as DVB-T, MediaFLO, UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband, a new 3.5th generation mobile network standard developed by 3GPP2), and is under study for DVB-H.
Hierarchical modulation is also taken as one of the practical implementations of superposition precoding, which can help achieve the maximum sum rate of broadcast channels. When hierarchical-modulated signals are transmitted, users with good reception and advanced receivers can demodulate multiple layers. For a user with a conventional receiver or poor reception, it may only demodulate the data stream embedded in the base layer. With hierarchical modulation, a network operator can target users of different types with different services or QoS. 
However, traditional hierarchical modulation suffers from serious inter-layer interference (ILI) with impact on the achievable symbol rate.

Brian Manning (21 May 1927 – 24 April 2004) was a leading British Marxist historian, particularly of the English Civil War of the 17th century.  A student of Christopher Hill, his best known work was The English People and the English Revolution.
Manning himself went to Lancing College, winning the Brackenbury Scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. He was appointed to a lectureship at Manchester in 1959, and, in 1980, became professor at the University of Ulster, becoming emeritus upon his retirement in 1992.
From its foundation until his move to Manchester, Manning served on the editorial board of the journal Past & Present, which been set up in 1952, largely by the Communist Party Historians Group, to elaborate "history from below" - the past as the story of generations of workers and peasants, women and men, struggling to make themselves and their world.Obituary in The Guardian.
Manning's work drew largely on the Thomason collection of pamphlets held in the British Library and, ironically, on Royalist propaganda about the social origins of their opponents in the English Civil War. Many of the themes that appeared in his work in the 1950s continued to dominate his publications even though the focus of historians' work had moved elsewhere. The rise of 'revisionist' historiography in the 1970s with its dismissal of Marxist approaches was a development he deplored, but which he was unable to overturn. His own work, as a result, became increasingly out of tune with the do minant themes of historical research from the mid-1970s onwards. Manning nevertheless remained prominent as a vigorous Marxist polemicist and political activist until the end of his life.
In a group dominated by Hill and his fellow Communists, Manning was an odd man out, eschewing the CP and embracing instead the emerging New Left. After moving to Ireland he joined the Irish Socialist Workers Party.Obituary in Socialist Worker.  He was later a supporter of the London Socialist Historians Group, which now holds an annual memorial lecture in his honour.

Muhammed al-Maghout (1934- April 3, 2006) ([tpl]lang-ar|محمد الماغوط[/tpl]) was a Syrian Ismaili writer and poet. He was born in Salamiya, Syria.
Muhammad Maghout was credited as the father of the Arabic free verse poetry, liberating the Arabic poems from the traditional form and revolutionizing the structure of the poem.
He wrote for theater, TV and cinema. Maghout's work combined satire with descriptions of social misery and malaise, illustrating what he viewed as an ethical decline among rulers in the region. Some of his themes included the problems of injustice and totalitarian governments. He co-operated with Syrian actors Dureid Lahham and Nihad Qal'i to produce some of the region's most popular and acclaimed theatrical works, such as Kasak ya Watan (Toast to the homeland) and Ghorbeh (Estrangement).
Al-Maghout was also known for his book "I will betray my homeland", a collection of essays.
Al-Maghout died at the age of 72 in April 2006.

It is sometimes considered to be conspecific with the Long-eared Owl, Asio otus.[tpl]cite book |title=Distribution and Taxonomy of Birds of the World |first1=Charles Gald |last1=Sibley |first2=Burt Leavelle |last2=Monroe |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=182 |isbn=0-300-04969-2[/tpl]  It ranges from [tpl]convert|40|–|50|cm|in[/tpl] in length, making it the largest of the country's owls; females are larger than males.[tpl]cite book |title=Birds of Madagascar: A Photographic Guide |last1=Morris |first1=Pete |last2=Hawkins |first2=Frank |year=1998 |publisher=Pica Press |location=Mountfield, East Sussex, UK |isbn=1-873403-45-3 |page=204[/tpl]
Its upperparts, crown and nape are brownish-black while its underparts are buff with black streaking. It has a brown facial disk, black bill and orange eyes. Its long ear tufts are dark brown, flecked with tan, matching the head.
Its call is usually a series of barks, varying in pitch and volume, but sometimes it will utter a series of more hoot-like notes, described by some as ulooh.
It is generally found at elevations ranging from sea level to [tpl]convert|1600|m|ft[/tpl], though it occasionally ranges as high as [tpl]convert|1800|m|ft[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |title=Owls of the World: Their Lives, Behavior and Survival |first=James R. |last=Duncan |year=2003 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Richmond Hill, Ontario |isbn=1-55297-845-1 |page=287[/tpl]  It inhabits a variety of woodland habitats.
Like most owls, the Madagascan Owl is nocturnal, roosting by day in dense foliage.  It feeds mainly on small mammals, hunting either in the forest or in open areas nearby.
Little is known about its breeding biology. It is thought to lay its eggs in stick nests created by other animals.

[[Benetton B195]]

CATEGORIES: Benetton Formula One cars, 1995 Formula One season cars

The Benetton B195 was a Formula One car designed by Rory Byrne and Ross Brawn for use by Benetton in the 1995 Formula One season. The B195 was almost identical to the Benetton B194 but a change of engine supplier from Ford to Renault caused a redesign of the engine installation, gearbox and rear suspension. The car was now powered by a Renault V10 engine of the same type the rival Williams team was using. The B195 was not as stable as the Williams FW17 and was seen by most paddock insiders as inferior to its rival. When Berger came from Ferrari to Benetton in late 1995 during winter testing, he found the balance of the car very poor, and Schumacher made the comment: "If he had driven the car at the beginning of the season, he would have spun in the pit-lane!".[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
The car was designed with the aerodynamic limitations the FIA imposed for the season including smaller wings, better crash protection and the reduction of engine size from 3.5 to 3.0 litres.
After an initial disqualification and subsequent re-instatement of victory in Brazil, Michael Schumacher carried on from where he had left off in 1994, and battled Damon Hill for the world championship. The two drivers had several collisions and near misses just as in 1994, the most notable was at the British Grand Prix that year when Hill attempted to pass and took both him and Schumacher out of the race. Schumacher capitalised on further mistakes by Williams and Hill and took nine victories, easily retaining his championship, whilst Johnny Herbert took victory at Silverstone and Monza, another race where Hill and Schumacher had a crash.
Benetton won their first constructors' championship that season, but most of their key technical staff defected to Ferrari when Schumacher signed for them for the 1996 season.

[[Normal coordinates]]
CATEGORIES: Riemannian geometry, Coordinate systems in differential geometry

In differential geometry, normal coordinates at a point p in a differentiable manifold equipped with a symmetric affine connection are a local coordinate system in a neighborhood of p obtained by applying the exponential map to the tangent space at p.  In a normal coordinate system, the Christoffel symbols of the connection vanish at the point p, thus often simplifying local calculations.  In normal coordinates associated to the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian manifold, one can additionally arrange that the metric tensor is the Kronecker delta at the point p, and that the first partial derivatives of the metric at p vanish.
A basic result of differential geometry states that normal coordinates at a point always exist on a manifold with a symmetric affine connection.  In such coordinates the covariant derivative reduces to a partial derivative (at p only), and the geodesics through p are locally linear functions of t (the affine parameter). This idea was implemented in a fundamental way by Albert Einstein in the general theory of relativity: the  equivalence principle uses normal coordinates via inertial frames.  Normal coordinates always exist for the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian or Pseudo-Riemannian manifold. By contrast, there is no way to define normal coordinates for Finsler manifolds [tpl]harv|Busemann|1955[/tpl].

[[Ötztal]]
CATEGORIES: Valleys of Tyrol (state)

The Ötztal is an alpine valley located in Tyrol, Austria. The Ötztaler Ache river flows through the valley in a northern direction. The Ötztal separates the Stubai Alps in the east from the Ötztal Alps in the west. The valley is 65 km (40 mi) long. The northern end of the valley is at the confluence of the Ötztaler Ache and Inn rivers, 8 km east of Imst and 50 km west of Innsbruck. The only railway station of the valley, Ötztal railway station, is located here and connects the Ötztal with the Arlberg railway (Innsbruck-Bludenz) and also a motorway interchange to the A12 (E60). 
The southern end of the valley, also called the Gurglertal, terminates at the border with Italy. The valley is formed by the main chain of the Alps, with many glaciers and high peaks, including the Weißkugel and the Similaun. The village of Obergurgl at the southern end of the Ötztal is the highest parish in Austria.
The Ötztal consists of five municipalities (from north to south): Sautens, Oetz, Umhausen, Längenfeld, and Sölden. The main industry in the valley is tourism. The mountains around the valley are popular with both mountaineers and skiers. There are ski resorts in the upper part of the valley at Sölden, Hochsölden, and Hochgurgl. The Timmelsjoch mountain pass connects the Ötztal with the Passeier Valley and Merano in the province of South Tyrol, Italy.
The Ötztal Glacier Road is the highest paved road in the Alps. It is the access road from Sölden to the Rettenbach glacier and the Tiefenbachferner glacier. The highest point of the glacier road is at southern end of the ski tunnel ([tpl]Coord|46|55|29|N|10|56|40|E|display=inline[/tpl]).
In 1991, Ötzi the Iceman, a well-preserved natural mummy from about 3300 BC, was found in the nearby Schnalstal glacier near the Fineilspitze and the Similaun. The Ötzi monument is located about an hour's walk from the Similaun Hut.

His usual position is [tpl]rlp|SR[/tpl], although he can also play in the [tpl]rlp|CE[/tpl]s. Nero leaves the Bulls at the end of the 2010 season to play for Salford City Reds.
Since joining the Giants in 2004, he has been a consistent try scorer for the club.
Nero played for Huddersfield in the 2006 Challenge Cup final at centre but the Giants lost 12-42 against St Helens RFC.
It was announced in August 2007 that he will leave the Giants.
Chris joined the Bulls in September 2007 after spending three years at the Giants. Last season he was voted 'Player's' Player of the Year and will be a great addition to the Bulls side. His direct running and combination of speed and power means he is equally effective in the second row or in the centres, and he has been a consistent try scorer in both positions. He is also a tremendous tackler and will quickly become a favourite with the Bulls fans.
After recent sparkling form, Centre Nero (28) has been linked with a move to fellow Super League club Wigan Warriors as a replacement for George Carmont.

CATEGORIES: 1827 in cricket, 1827 in England, English cricket seasons from 1816 to 1863

The roundarm controversy came to a head before the 1827 English cricket season and MCC agreed to the staging of three trial matches between Sussex and All-England.  Roundarm's supporters made the grandiose claim that their campaign was a march of intellect. What the bowlers were really after was of course to claim an advantage over the batsmen.
No firm conclusions were drawn in the immediate aftermath of the trials and it was many years before roundarm was formally legalised.  But, in practice, roundarm was adopted in 1827 as its practitioners, especially William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge of Sussex, continued to use it with little, if any, opposition from the umpires.
Underarm bowling did not cease, even if it had been superseded. In fact, underarm survived roundarm. Underarm as a tactical alternative to overarm continued into the twentieth century with George Simpson-Hayward being the last major exponent.
On 4 June, Cambridge University versus Oxford University at Lord's was the first University Match. It became an annual fixture in 1838.
On 22 August, George Rawlins playing for Sheffield against NottinghamNottingham v Sheffield in 1827 became the first batsman to be out hit the ball twice in a first-class game.Wynne-Thomas, Peter; The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records; p. 93 ISBN 072701868X This has since occurred only six more times in English first-class cricket, and not since 1906.

[[Priestly divisions]]
CATEGORIES: Priesthood (Judaism), Hebrew Bible topics, Jewish sacrificial law, Tabernacle and Jerusalem Temples

The priestly divisions or sacerdotal courses (Hebrew: mishmar (מִשְׁמָר)) are ritual work groups in Judaism originally formed during the reign of King David in the 10th century BCE as documented in the biblical passage of 1 Chronicles 24. These priests were all descendants of Aaron, known also as Aaronites. Aaron  had four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. However, Nadab and Abihu died before Aaron and only Eleazar and Ithamar had sons. One priest, Zadok, from Eleazar's descendants and another priest, Ahimelech, from Ithamar's descendants, were designated by King David to help create the various priestly work groups. Sixteen of Eleazar's descendants were selected to head priestly orders while only eight of Ithamar's descendants were so chosen. The passage states that this was done because of the greater number of leaders among Eleazar's descendants. Lots were drawn to designate the order of ministering for the heads of the priestly orders when they entered the temple in Jerusalem.  Each order was responsible for ministering during a different week and shabbat, and were stationed as a watch at the Tabernacle. All of the orders were present during biblical festivals. See also Kohen. Their duties involved offering the daily and Jewish holy day sacrifices (korbanot in Hebrew), and blessing the people in a ceremony known as nesiat kapayim ("raising of the hands"), the ceremony of the Priestly Blessing.

After time at Santa Barbara City College and University of the Pacific, Cindy migrated to Anchorage, Alaska in 1994, where she finished her degree in psychology, became a professional fly fishing guide, worked as a heli-ski guide, and opened Garrison Adventures International, specializing in booking travel to fishing, hunting, and skiing destinations worldwide.  She’d just moved to Denver, Colorado in 1998 when she went with her father on her first African safari in Botswana. She enjoyed the experience so much Cindy ended up staying until 2003, where she ran camps for the largest hunting safari operator in Botswana, Africa as well as founding her own safari company, and then founding Safari Anglers, guiding fly-casters in pursuit of Africa’s famed Tiger Fish in Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia. She still occasionally leads safaris.
In 2003, Garrison became co-host of ESPN2’s In Search of Fly Water, which ran for two seasons.  Her stint on this show led her current job as host of Get Wild!  Garrison’s current show is probably most notable for its exotic locations and her “extreme” approach to outdoor pursuits.
In September 2006, she became an official spokeswoman for Women in the Outdoors.

[tpl]MedalCountry | the [tpl]USA[/tpl] [/tpl]
George Anthony Stanich (born 4 November 1928) was an American athlete who was a collegiate all-American in one sport, and Olympian in another and a professional in still another.
As a basketball player at UCLA, Stanich was a 2-time all-conference guard and in 1950, he led his team to its first NCAA tournament appearance.  He scored 9 points in the East-West All-Star Game and was a first-team all-American (as named by Converse), the first of 24 Bruins who would earn this honor under John Wooden. As a Bruin baseball player, he was a pitcher for 3 seasons, including throwing a 5-hit shutout as a sophomore as UCLA beat USC for the first time in five years. He would become a professional baseball player after graduation, pitching for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, as well as Idaho Falls Russets and Stockton.
But it was a high jumper that George soared highest.  According to the an unpublished thesis at CSU-Sacramento, "In the summer of 1948, George, a 19-year old having just completed his sophomore year of college, traveled to Chicago to compete at the collegiate tryouts to qualify for the Olympic track and field trials.  UCLA paid for the trip, but George, who competed in the high jump, was not one of the six athletes to qualify.  The Los Angeles Athletic Club paid for George to stay in Chicago for two weeks so that he could participate in the AAU meet from which the other six tryout qualifiers would be chosen.  George finished in eighth place, but because two of the AAU qualifiers had already made the trials in the college competition, he became the final high jumper to qualify for the trials (G. Stanich, personal communication, September 10, 1997).  Stanich moved on to the Olympic trials, where he barely cleared [tpl]height|ft=6|in=6[/tpl] on his last attempt, but then was the first to clear [tpl]height|ft=6|in=7[/tpl] and placed second with a jump of [tpl]height|ft=6|in=8.25[/tpl].
On the morning of July 30, 1948, George Stanich, representing the Los Angeles Athletic Club, was one of 26 participants in the high jump trials at the 1948 Olympic Games in London.  Twenty men qualified for the finals, and 18 participated in the finals in the rain later that day.  The gold medal was won with a jump of [tpl]height|ft=6|in=6[/tpl]; Stanich was one of four competitors who cleared [tpl]height|ft=6|in=4.75[/tpl]. While he thought he had cleared the bar on his last attempt at [tpl]height|ft=6|in=6[/tpl], his trail leg hit the bar ("Stanich," July 30, 1948).  Officials from the International Amateur Athletic Federation initially announced that fewer misses would be used to determine the finishing places of the four tied jumpers; the IAAF then announced all four would share second place and the silver medal.  Days later they reversed themselves again, and George Stanich became the bronze medal winner (Bushell, 1948)."

[[Hiram T. Smith]]

CATEGORIES: 1839 deaths, American military personnel, Year of birth unknown, History of Maine

Private Hiram T. Smith is a legendary casualty of the bloodless Maine Aroostook War, having died in 1839.  Although one of roughly 38 men killed (all were non-combat deaths), he is the most famous because many locals consider him the only casualty of the war. A memorial placed in the middle of the Haynesville Woods along U.S. Route 2 that also added to his fame. In 1930, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) placed a wooden marker at the site and later updated it with a granite marker that still stands today.
It is unknown how exactly Smith died or why he stands out from the rest of the men who died, as there is no official reason for his death.  There are several ongoing theories:Dick Eastman Online 7/18/2001 Ancestry.Com
1) He froze to death.  Temperatures in that area of Maine during the winter of 1839 reached negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit. However, many believe he died in the summer of 1839. 
2) Run over by an army supply wagon. 
3) Killed by a horse when he went to feed them. 
4) Falling through the ice of Lake St. Clair. While he may have died from falling through the ice, there has never been a Lake St. Clair in Maine. 
5) Shot for desertion.  Probably also not true, as this would have had a record of some type. 
6) Fell into a pond and drowned.In the Beginning There Was a Sign Wired A pond now called Soldier's Pond has a marker stating "Soldier's Grave Aroostook War 1838" which is attributed to Smith but the year would be inconsistent with reports he died in 1839, and is not the same marker the DAR erected.

[[House of Flowers (musical)]]
CATEGORIES: Broadway musicals, 1954 musicals, Musicals by Harold Arlen, Musicals by Truman Capote, Musicals based on short fiction

House of Flowers is a musical by Harold Arlen (music and lyrics) and Truman Capote (lyrics and book), based on his own short story, first published in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1958) as one of three extra pieces besides the titular novella. This was Capote's only musical, and is the first theatrical production outside of Trinidad and Tobago to feature the new Caribbean instrument - the steel pan.
After a Philadelphia try-out, the show opened on Broadway on December 30, 1954 at the Alvin Theatre and played for 165 performances. The director was Peter Brook. The cast included Pearl Bailey, Diahann Carroll, Juanita Hall, Ray Walston, Carmen de Lavallade, Alvin Ailey and Geoffrey Holder (who also provided a section of choreography). Although the show received generally poor reviews, the dance-rhythm infused score has been praised for its mix of blues and calypso. Most of the original orchestral score by Ted Royal has been lost, but the piano score survives.NY Times review of the Encores! production Oliver Messel won the Tony Award for Best Scenic Design, the show's only nomination.
The story concerns two neighboring bordellos that battle for business in an idealized Haitian setting. One of the prostitutes, Ottilie, turns down a rich lord to marry a poor mountain boy named Royal. Her madam plots to keep her by having Royal sealed in a barrel and tossed into the ocean. Royal escapes the watery death by taking refuge on the back of a turtle. The lovers are eventually married and live happily ever after.
There was an unsuccessful Off-Broadway revival in 1968 at Theater de Lys. In 2003, there was an Encores! production, starring Tonya Pinkins and Armelia McQueen as the battling bordello madams and Maurice Hines as Captain Jonas, the smuggler. The virginal Ottilie was played by Nikki M. James, and the mountain boy, Royal, was played by Brandon Victor Dixon. Roscoe Lee Browne played the voodoo priest, Houngan.
In 2003, Columbia Masterworks reissued the original cast recording. In addition to such tunes as “A Sleepin' Bee” and “Don’t Like Goodbyes,” the CD also included bonus tracks of “Mardis Gras Waltz” (Percy Faith and His Orchestra), “Two Ladies in the Shade” (Enid Mosier), “Ottilie and the Bee” (Truman Capote) and “A Sleepin’ Bee” (a demo recording by Harold Arlen).

Elizabeth Finch, née Heneage, 1st Countess of Winchilsea (9 July 1556 – 23 March 1634) was an English peeress.
Elizabeth was the daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Heneage, who was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in the latter years of the reign of Elizabeth I. At 16 years old, she was married to Moyle Finch on 14 November 1572 and they had six children:
Her husband became a politician soon after their marriage and was knighted in 1584 and given a baronetcy in 1611. When Sir Moyle died in 1614, Elizabeth and her sons made considerable efforts to have the family's status elevated and almost nine years later, James I created her Viscountess Maidstone, with a remainder to her heirs male. In 1628, she was further elevated by Charles I as Countess of Winchilsea. On her death in 1634, her titles passed to her eldest surviving son, Sir Thomas (who had already inherited his elder brother's baronetcy in 1619).
Elizabeth and Sir Moyle are depicted in repose in a monument commemorating members of the Finch family, sculpted by Nicolas Stone c. 1630. The piece was created after Sir Moyle's death during Elizabeth's lifetime, and is now displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. It was originally in the church of St Mary, Eastwell, Kent, which became a ruin in the 1950s and is now owned by the Friends of Friendless Churches.

CATEGORIES: Canadian children's television series, TVOntario shows, 1989 Canadian television series debuts, 1995 Canadian television series endings

Join In! was a Canadian educational children's television show which aired on TVOntario between 1989 and 1995. It was created and produced by Jed MacKay, who also wrote all of the show's original songs. The first two seasons were directed by Doug Williams. The next four seasons were directed by Wayne Moss. It won the Alliance for Children and Television's Best Pre-school Program Award and was also a finalist three times for the Gemini Award for Best Pre-school Program[tpl]fact|date= May 2011[/tpl]. Join In! continued TVOntario's leadership through the 1980s in developing educational television shows for children that were plot-centered instead of magazine-style. The show was ground-breaking in a number of ways; it was designed to combat "passive" viewing and to reflect the ethnically diverse world that was rapidly evolving. Although the cast was racially integrated, with two "minority" cast members and one "majority" member, this fact was never mentioned by the characters. Their shared humanity was the implicit focus. Every program had a number of elements woven into the plot line that invited its audience to "Join In!"; in games, songs, puzzles, or stories. The cast also broke the fourth wall, talking to the camera, and thus the audience, as if they were right there on set. The songs broke away from the usual children's format, offering a wide variety of rhythm and styles. The cast also sang live on each show.
The series revolved around three adults named Jacob Bennett, Nikki, and Zack, who shared a studio loft together. After the second season, Nikki moved away and was replaced by Kia. In a typical episode, the three would be planning for some kind of play or production that would usually involve Nikki being in charge of music and sound, and Jacob and Zack would be in charge of the set, lighting, costumes, etc. when some form of problem would arise. The show also featured a toy wizard named Winston, his wife Emmelina, and their dog Abra, who lived on a windowsill in the loft. The show was filmed in Lindsay, Ontario.

[[Arrows A19]]
CATEGORIES: Arrows Formula One cars, 1998 Formula One season cars

The Arrows A19 was the car with which the Arrows Formula One team used to compete in the 1998 Formula One season.  It was driven by Pedro Diniz, who was in his second season with the team, and Mika Salo, who had moved from Tyrrell to replace Jordan-bound Damon Hill.
[tpl]F1|1998[/tpl] was a year of unfulfilled promise from Arrows.  The cars were designed by the renowned John Barnard, and looked highly distinctive with an almost completely black livery.  The car's main weakness was its engine.  Tom Walkinshaw, the Team Principal of Arrows, had bought into Brian Hart's engine company and thus Arrows became the first British F1 team to produce their own engines since BRM in [tpl]F1|1977[/tpl].  However, Hart's budget was not enough to compete with the major car manufacturers who supplied most of the other teams, and the problems were exacerbated by the car not being completed on time.
The car therefore proved to be quite unreliable throughout the season, particularly in the first few Grands Prix, culminating in an embarrassing simultaneous engine failure at the 1998 Spanish Grand Prix.  However, the next race at Monaco proved the effectiveness of the chassis: on a circuit where engine power is not so vital, the cars were competitive and scored a double-points finish.  Thereafter, the cars were too slow and unreliable to be serious contenders, although Diniz salvaged fifth place at the chaotic 1998 Belgian Grand Prix.
The team eventually finished a respectable seventh in the Constructors' Championship, with six points.

The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne is a 1987 drama film made by  HandMade Films Ltd. and United British Artists (UBA) starring Maggie Smith and Bob Hoskins. It was directed by Jack Clayton (his final theatrical film) and produced by Richard Johnson and Peter Nelson, with George Harrison and Denis O'Brien as executive producers.
The screenplay was by Peter Nelson from the novel Judith Hearne by Northern Irish-Canadian writer Brian Moore. The music score was by Georges Delerue and the cinematography by Peter Hannan.
The novel was written after Moore had left Ireland, partly because of the religious stranglehold on the country, and was living in Canada. The book was published in 1955 and began to be optioned for the stage and screen almost immediately. John Huston optioned it, intending to film it with Katharine Hepburn; director Irvin Kershner planned on Deborah Kerr. When finally somebody had the rights and the financing at the same time, Jack Clayton, a Catholic himself, was chosen to direct.
The cast also features Wendy Hiller, Marie Kean, Ian McNeice, Alan Devlin, Prunella Scales, Sheila Reid and Aidan Gillen in his first film appearance. Although the novel is set in Belfast, filming took place in Dublin.
A radio drama adaptation was produced by BBC Radio 4 in 1995, directed by Michael Quinn.

[tpl]MedalCountry | the [tpl]USA[/tpl] [/tpl]
Stephen ("Steve") Andrew Seymour (October 4, 1920 in New York City – June 18, 1973 in Los Angeles) was an American track and field athlete who competed in the javelin throw; he is regarded by track and field historians as America's original javelin technician. 
Following the Second World War, performance levels of elite U.S. javelin throwers lagged well behind the Europeans. Seeking to refine his skills, Seymour spent 1946 in Finland, training with that nation's world-class throwers. It didn't take long for Steve Seymour's meticulous research to pay dividends. In 1947, Steve established an American Record of 75.80 meters (248' 8") at the U.S. AAU Championships; his mark was within ten-feet of the global standard set by Finland's Yrjo Nikkanen in 1938.
1948 was a memorable year in Seymour's relatively short career; he won a second consecutive national AAU title, and a silver medal at the Summer Olympics in London. In 1950, Steve Seymour added a third national championship to his collection; and in 1951 he was the silver medalist at the Pan American Games.

Peter Dixon, in his syndicated column "Inside the Studios," reported in 1934 that Lyman directed his orchestra from the control booth instead of standing in front of the musicians.Newspaper Archive  
The orchestra of Seymour Simon was also heard on Accordiana. Different orchestras were heard across the country in the same timeslots, as indicated by this July 17, 1934 entry in a newspaper radio listing:
Lyman's orchestra and Segal were both on many other CBS radio programs during the 1930s, and Lyman later settled in as the regular orchestra heard during the 1930s and 1940s on Waltz Time, a program of traditional music.Gracyk, Tim.

When the Superbike World Championship began in [tpl]SBK|1988[/tpl], he was one of its first entrants, finishing as championship runner-up in [tpl]SBK|1988[/tpl] and [tpl]SBK|1990[/tpl], and in the top five four other times.

[[Irish military diaspora]]
CATEGORIES: Irish diaspora, Military of Ireland

The Irish military diaspora refers to the many people of either Irish birth or extraction (see Irish diaspora) who have served in overseas military forces, regardless of rank, duration of service, or success.
Many overseas military units were primarily made up of Irishmen (or members of the Irish military diaspora) and had the word 'Irish', an Irish place name or an Irish person in the unit's name. 'Irish' named military units took part in numerous conflicts throughout world history.Harris, R.

The Zastava 750 (Застава 750) was a car made by the Serbian car maker Zavod Crvena Zastava in Kragujevac. It was a version of the Fiat 600 made under licence from 1965, it was longer in length than the Fiat version. The Zastava 750 has a [tpl]convert|767|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on[/tpl] engine, which produces [tpl]convert|25|PS|kW|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. The more powerful 750 SE has [tpl]convert|30|PS|kW|1|abbr=on[/tpl] at 5400 rpm and torque is [tpl]convert|38|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] at 3600 rpm. It is the smallest car ever made by Zastava. Later on during production, in 1980. the Zastava 850 was introduced, it featured the same body as the Zastava 750 but the engine had a larger capacity. The Zastava 850 is harder to find than the 750 model but both are still widely available in former Yugoslavia.
Zastava 750 is widely known by its nickname "Fića" (Фићa) or "Fićo" (Фићo) in Serbian, Montenegrin, Croatian and Bosnian, by "Fičo" or "Fičko" in Slovene and by "Fikjo" (Фиќо) in Macedonian. The nickname "Fića" comes from the main character of a comic published by the newspaper Borba during the first years of the car's production.
