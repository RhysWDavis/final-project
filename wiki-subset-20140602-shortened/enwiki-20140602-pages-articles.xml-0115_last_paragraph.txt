Beriberi refers to a cluster of symptoms caused primarily by a nutritional deficit in Vitamin B1 (thiamine). Beriberi has conventionally been divided into three separate entities, relating to the body system mainly involved (peripheral nervous system or cardiovascular) or age of patient (infantile). Beriberi is one of several thiamine-deficiency related conditions, which may occur concurrently, including Wernicke's encephalopathy (when mainly affects the central nervous system), Korsakoff's syndrome (when it reaches psychiatric aspects), and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (with both neurologic and psychiatric symptoms).
Historically, Beriberi has been endemic in regions dependent on what is variously referred to as polished, white, or de-husked rice. This type of rice has its husk removed in order to extend its lifespan, but also has the unintended side-effect of removing the primary source of thiamine.[tpl]citation | url = http://www.medical-library.net/content/view/826/41/ | title = Doctors' Medical Library – Beriberi (Thiamine Deficiency) (B1 Deficiency) | first = Ron | last = Kennedy| year = 2013[/tpl]

Messier 82 (also known as NGC 3034, Cigar Galaxy or M82) is the prototype nearby starburst galaxy about 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. The starburst galaxy is five times more luminous than the whole Milky Way and one hundred times more luminous than our galaxy's center.  The starburst activity is thought to be triggered by interaction with neighboring galaxy M81, and M82 is a member of the M81 Group.

CATEGORIES: Festivals in Sweden, Name days, Swedish culture, Swedish given names, Saints days

This is the old Swedish name day calendar, sanctioned by the Swedish Academy in 1901, with official status until 1972. Some days still refer to traditional or religious feasts rather than personal names. Some of the names below are linked to the original saints or martyrs from which they originate. A work group, consisting of the Swedish Academy, publishers and others, agreed to adopt a new name day list in 2001, very similar to the old one but with more names. It is intended that this list will be updated every 15 years. 
The Swedish Name day has developed to a big celebration for a person with a Swedish name. This "tradition" is something that is nowadays seen as a Swedish tradition. Presents, big parties and singing is all related to the celebration of the nameday.

[[Lemon battery]]

CATEGORIES: Disposable batteries, Biodegradable materials

The lemon battery is a simple type of electrical battery that is commonly made for school science projects because it illustrates a battery's main components. Typically, a  piece of zinc metal and a piece of copper metal are inserted into a lemon. Everyday objects such as galvanized nails and copper pennies can be used for the zinc and for the copper. A single lemon is usually studied using an electrical multimeter. Several lemons can be wired together to form a more powerful battery that will power a light-emitting diode, a buzzer, or a digital clock.
The lemon battery is similar to the first electrical battery invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta, who used brine (salt water) instead of lemon juice. The lemon battery is described in some textbooks in order to illustrate the type of chemical reaction (oxidation-reduction) that occurs in batteries. The zinc and copper are called the electrodes, and the juice inside the lemon is called the electrolyte. There are many variations of the lemon cell that use different fruits (or liquids) as electrolytes and metals other than zinc and copper as electrodes.

[[Premenstrual syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Menstrual cycle, Noninflammatory disorders of female genital tract, Syndromes

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a collection of emotional symptoms, with or without physical symptoms, related to a woman's menstrual cycle. While most women of child-bearing age (up to 85%) report having experienced physical symptoms related to normal ovulatory function, such as bloating or breast tenderness, medical definitions of PMS are limited to a consistent pattern of emotional and physical symptoms occurring only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle that are of "sufficient severity to interfere with some aspects of life". In particular, emotional symptoms must be present consistently to diagnose PMS. The specific emotional and physical symptoms attributable to PMS vary from woman to woman, but each individual woman's pattern of symptoms is predictable, occurs consistently during the ten days prior to menses, and vanishes either shortly before or shortly after the start of menstrual flow.
Two to ten percent of women have significant premenstrual symptoms that are separate from the normal discomfort associated with menstruation in healthy women.
Culturally, the abbreviation "PMS" is widely understood in English-speaking countries to refer to difficulties associated with menses, and the abbreviation is used frequently even in casual and colloquial settings, without regard to medical rigor.  In these contexts, the syndrome is rarely referred to without abbreviation, and the connotations of the reference are frequently more broad than the clinical definition.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) consists of symptoms similar to, but more severe than, PMS, and while primarily mood-related, may include physical symptoms such as bloating.  PMDD is classified as a repeating transitory cyclic disorder with similarities to unipolar depression, and several antidepressants have been approved as therapy.

"Twinkie defense" is a derisive label for an improbable legal defense. It is not a recognized legal defense in jurisprudence, but a catchall term coined by reporters during their coverage of the trial of defendant Dan White for the murders of San Francisco city supervisor Harvey Milk and mayor George Moscone. White's defense was that he suffered diminished capacity as a result of his depression. His change in diet from healthy food to Twinkies and other sugary food was said to be a symptom of depression. Contrary to common belief, White's attorneys did not argue that the Twinkies were the cause of White's actions, but that their consumption was symptomatic of his underlying depression. White was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

[[Black rage (law)]]
CATEGORIES: Criminal defenses, Rage, Race and crime in the United States

In the USA, black rage refers to a purported psychological phenomenon and innovative defense proposed, but not used, for the 1994 Colin Ferguson mass murder trial. Ferguson's lawyers (Eric Nnanabu) argued that he should not be held criminally liable, for actions which broke the law, because he was overcome with rage by his perceived society's racist discrimination against Black people. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980835,00.html Ferguson rejected the advice of his lawyer and represented himself, arguing instead that he was completely innocent; he was found guilty and imprisoned.
Black rage was first proposed by psychologists William Henry Grier and Price Cobbs in their 1968 book Black Rage (ISBN 1-57910-349-9). Grier and Cobbs argue that Black people living in a racist, white supremacist society are psychologically damaged by the effects of racist oppression. They argue that this damage causes black people to act abnormally in certain situations.  
Colloquially, black rage can simply mean an outburst of a Black person when he feels racially threatened. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]

[[10BROAD36]]
CATEGORIES: Ethernet

10BROAD36 is an obsolete computer network standard in the Ethernet family. It was developed during the 1980s and specified in IEEE 802.3b-1985.
The standard supported 10 Mbit/s Ethernet signals over standard 75 ohm cable television (CATV) cable over a 3600 meter range. The original Ethernet standard 10BASE5 used a baseband encoding (also known as line coding), where the signal is simply encoded directly on the wire without any sort of carrier wave. Instead, 10BROAD36 modulated its data onto a higher carrier frequency signal, much as an audio signal would modulate a carrier wave to be transmitted in a radio station. This was called broadband at the time; the term has a different (more meaningless) marketing meaning today.
This provides several advantages over the more traditional baseband signal. Range was greatly extended, (3600 meters, versus 500 meters for 10BASE5) and multiple signals can be carried on the same cable. 10BROAD36 could even share a cable with standard television channels.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers standards committee IEEE 802 published the standard that was ratified in 1985 as an additional section 11 to the base Ethernet standard.[tpl]cite web |title= 802.3b-1985 - Supplement to 802.3: Broadband Medium Attachment Unit and Broadband Medium Specifications, Type 10BROAD36 (Section 11) |year= 1985 |publisher= IEEE Standards Association |url= http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.3b-1985.html |accessdate= July 12, 2011 [/tpl]
It was also issued as ISO/IEC 8802-3 in 1989.[tpl]cite web |title= Information processing systems — Local and metropolitan area networks — Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=16235 |accessdate= July 12, 2011 [/tpl]
10BROAD36 was less successful than its contemporaries because of the high equipment complexity (and cost) associated with it. The individual stations were much more expensive due to the extra radio frequency circuitry involved; however the primary extra complexity came from the fact that 10BROAD36 was unidirectional. Signals could only travel one direction along the line, so head-end stations must be present on the line to repeat the signals (ensuring that no packets travel through the line indefinitely) on either another, backwards direction frequency on the same line, or another line entirely. This also increased latency and prevented bidirectional signal flow.
The extra complexity outweighed the advantage of reusability of CATV technology for the intended campus networks and metropolitan area networks. An installer at Boston University using the Ungermann-Bass product noted that no installers understood both the digital and analog aspects of the system.[tpl]cite news |title= Broadband user share pains, gains |author= Paula Musich |pages= 1, 8 |work= Network World |date= July 20, 1987 |quote= Broadband networks employ frequency-division multiplexing to divide coaxial cable into separate channels, each of which serves as an individual local network. |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=gxwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8 |accessdate= July 14, 2011 [/tpl]
In wide area networks it was quickly replaced by fiber-optic communication alternatives, such as 100BASE-FX (which provided ten times the data rate). Interest in cable modems was revived for residential Internet access, through later technologies such as the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) in the 1990s.

[[10BASE-FL]]

CATEGORIES: Ethernet

10BASE-FL is the most commonly used 10BASE-F specification of Ethernet over optical fiber. It replaces the original fiber-optic inter-repeater link (FOIRL) specification, but retains compatibility with FOIRL-based equipment.  Maximum segment length values 2000 meters[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.techfest.com/networking/lan/ethernet4.htm TechFest |title=Ethernet Technical Summary |accessdate=2012-03-24[/tpl] When mixed with FOIRL equipment, maximum segment length is limited to FOIRL's 1000 meters.
In 10BASE-F standard, the 10 represents its maximum throughput of 10 Mbit/s, BASE indicates its use of baseband transmission, and F indicates that it relies on medium of fiber-optic cable. In fact, there are at least three different kinds of 10BASE-F. All require two strands of 62.5/125 µm multimode fiber. One strand is used for data transmission and one strand is used for reception, making 10BASE-F a full-duplex technology.
After the introduction of 10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL was developed. In 10BASE-FL, FL stands for fiber optic link: It is a version of fiber-optic cable for transmitting data package using pulses of light, rather than electrical signal. The use of fiber optic cable provides advantages over copper cables (Ethernet) for multiple reasons. Fiber optic cable is immune to electrical and magnetic interference so it can be used in high interference environment. 10BASE-FL can reach 2000 meters while 10BASE-T is limited to 100 meters.
Today, 10BASE-FL is rarely used in networking and has been replaced by the family of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet standards.

[[10BASE-FB]]

CATEGORIES: Ethernet

The 10BASE-FB (10BASE-FiberBackbone) is a network segment used to bridge network hubs.  Due to the synchronous operation of 10BASE-FB, delays normally associated with Ethernet repeaters are reduced, thus allowing segment distances to be extended without compromising the collision detection mechanism. The maximum allowable segment length for 10BASE-FB is 2000 meters.

Bus, Buss, or Busse Island was a phantom island in the North Atlantic Ocean. It was recorded as discovered during the third expedition of Martin Frobisher in September 1578 by sailors aboard the ship Emanuel of Bridgwater (a "busse") and was indicated on maps as existing between Ireland and mythical Frisland at about 57° N. The island was then named for the type of vessel that its discoverers used.Gosch, C.C.A. Danish Arctic Expeditions, 1605 to 1620. Book I.—The Danish Expeditions to Greenland in 1605, 1606, and 1607; to which is added Captain James Hall's Voyage to Greenland in 1612. "Appendix B. On 'Busse Island'." Hakluyt Society (London), 1897. It is believed that Frobisher took Greenland for Frisland and Baffin Island for Greenland and the Emmanuel, returning home, made a mistake in dead reckoning and mistook optical effects near Greenland at around 62° N for a new land.
A Thomas Shepard claimed to have explored and mapped the island from the Golden Lion of Dunkirk in 1671. As Atlantic traffic increased, the island's existence was less certain and its supposed size was greatly reduced. By 1745, it was apparent there was no island at the site claimed and it was renamed the Sunken Land of Buss, as the supposed area was relatively shallow. The island or 'site of sunken island' persisted on charts into the 19th century.

The Reichstag Fire Decree ([tpl]lang-de|Reichstagsbrandverordnung[/tpl]) is the common name of the Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State ([tpl]lang-de|Verordnung des Reichspräsidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat[/tpl]) issued by German President Paul von Hindenburg in direct response to the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933. The decree nullified many of the key civil liberties of German citizens. With Nazis in powerful positions in the German government, the decree was used as the legal basis of imprisonment of anyone considered to be opponents of the Nazis, and to suppress publications not considered “friendly” to the Nazi cause. The decree is considered by historians to be one of the key steps in the establishment of a one-party Nazi state in Germany.

[[Elegant variation]]
CATEGORIES: Language varieties and styles

Elegant variation is a term coined by Henry Watson Fowler (1858–1933). It refers to the unnecessary use of synonyms to denote a single thing. In his Dictionary of Modern English Usage (first edition, 1926), Fowler wrote:

In the 1920s, when Fowler coined the term "elegant variation," the word elegant had a pejorative connotation of “precious over-refinement”. In Garner's Modern American Usage, Bryan Garner unambiguously recast the term as "inelegant variation."[tpl]cite book |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |edition=3rd |date=2009 |title=Garner's Modern American Usage |page=298 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-538275-4[/tpl]
Elegant variation is very common in modern journalism, where, for example, a "fire" often becomes a "blaze" or a "conflagration" with no clear justification. It is considered particularly problematic in legal, scientific, and technical writing, where the avoidance of ambiguity is essential.
Elegant variation in poetry may occur because of a poet’s need to use a word which fits the scansion and rhyme pattern of the poem.

[[Politics and the English Language]]

CATEGORIES: English language, Essays by George Orwell, 1946 essays, Essays in literary criticism, Works originally published in Horizon (magazine)

"Politics and the English Language" (1946) is an essay by George Orwell which criticises the "ugly and inaccurate" written English of his time and examines the connection between political orthodoxies and the debasement of language. It was originally published in the April 1946 issue of the journal Horizon. The article had been intended for George Weidenfeld's Contact magazine but it was turned down – the magazine wanted reportage. Politics and the English Language was Orwell's last major article for Horizon.I Belong to the Left'', p.431
Orwell wrote, "Political language — and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists — is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind." Orwell believed that because this writing was intended to hide the truth rather than express it, the language used was necessarily vague or meaningless. This unclear prose was a "contagion" which had spread even to those who had no intent to hide the truth, and it concealed a writer's thoughts from himself and others.[tpl]Harvnb|Shelden|1991|p=393[/tpl] Orwell encourages concreteness and clarity instead of vagueness, and individuality over political conformity.

[[Anatinae]]
CATEGORIES: Anatinae, Ducks, Subfamilies of birds

The Anatinae are a subfamily of the family Anatidae (swans, geese and ducks). Its surviving members are the dabbling ducks, which feed mainly at the surface rather than by diving. The other members of the Anatinae are the extinct moa-nalo, a young but highly apomorphic lineage derived from the dabbling ducks.
There has been much debate about the dabbling ducks' systematical status and which ducks belong to the Anatinae. As understood here, the subfamily contains only the dabbling ducks and their close relatives, the extinct moa-nalos. Alternatively, the Anatinae are considered to include most "ducks", and the dabbling ducks form a tribe Anatini within these. The classification as presented here more appropriately reflects the remaining uncertainty about the interrelationships of the major lineages of Anatidae (waterfowl).

There are many natural hybrids. The type species is Ophrys insectifera L.
They are referred to as the "Bee orchids" due to the flowers of some species resemblance to the furry bodies of bees and other insects. Their scientific name Ophrys is the Greek word for "eyebrow", referring to the furry edges of the lips of several species.[tpl]cite book|title=Illustrated Encyclopedia of Orchids|isbn=0-88192-267-6[/tpl]

Gymnadenia is a genus in the orchid family (Orchidaceae) containing 22 terrestrial species.
They can be found in damp meadows, fens and marshes, and on chalk or limestone, often in alpine regions of Europe and Asia up to the Himalayas. The Fragrant Orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea) has been introduced into the USA.
These hardy terrestrial orchids are deciduous. They survive the winter through their corms, two deep-cut tubers (more like tuberous roots). Long lanceolate green leaves grow at the bottom of the stem. There are some small leaves at the stop of the stem.
They flower during the summer. The inflorescence is a dense cylindrical spike between 5 and 30 cm long. It can consists of up to 150 small pleasant-smelling flowers. Their color can vary from pale purple to pink and white. The lip is wide with three lobes. The marginal petals are horizontal. There is a long, thin, threadlike spur.
Several species were formerly classified under Nigritella. The nothogeneric name ×Gymnigritella was used for hybrids between these two groups.

The Royal Academy of Turku ([tpl]lang-sv|Kungliga Akademin i Åbo[/tpl] or Åbo Kungliga Akademi, [tpl]lang-la|Regia Academia Aboensis[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fi|Turun akatemia[/tpl]) was the first university in Finland, and the only university in present-day Finland to be founded when it was still a part of Sweden. In 1809, after Finland became a Grand Duchy under the suzerainty of the Russian Tzar, it was renamed the Imperial Academy of Turku[tpl]fact|date=October 2012[/tpl]. In 1828 the institution was moved from Turku after the Great Fire to Helsinki, in line with the relocation of the Grand Duchy's capital, and was finally named the University of Helsinki when Finland became a sovereign nation-state in 1917.
The academy was founded in 1640 by Queen Christina of Sweden at the proposal of Count Per Brahe on base of Åbo Cathedral School (f. 1276). It was the Sweden's third university following Uppsala University, founded in 1477, and the Academia Gustaviana (now the University of Tartu in Estonia), founded in 1632. Among its alumni are Johannes Palmberg, author of the 17th-century Swedish textbook in botany Serta Florea Svecana.
The first printing shop in Finland was established at the academy in 1642. The printer was Peder Walde.
Turku (in Swedish known as Åbo) was the largest city in Finland and among the three largest in Sweden, while under Swedish sovereignty. In 1809 Finland was ceded to Russia and the capital of the new Grand Duchy of Finland was relocated to Helsinki in 1812, as Turku was regarded as being too remote from Saint Petersburg — and too near to Stockholm. As a result of the Great Fire of Turku of 1827, which devastated most of the city, the government offices that had remained were finally moved to the new capital, and so also was the university. It continued in Helsinki, first as the Imperial Alexander University in Finland, and, following Finland's independence in 1917, as the University of Helsinki.
Both the Swedish-speaking Åbo Akademi University (1918) and the Finnish speaking University of Turku (1920) are much newer entities in Turku, although they claim an academic tradition at the location since the 17th century, in spite of a break for almost a century.

In computer security, a shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability.  It is called "shellcode" because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode.  Because the function of a payload is not limited to merely spawning a shell, some have suggested that the name shellcode is insufficient. However, attempts at replacing the term have not gained wide acceptance.

SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' was an American Great Lakes freighter that sank in a Lake Superior storm on November 10, 1975, with the loss of the entire crew of 29. When launched on June 8, 1958, she was the largest ship on North America's Great Lakes, and she remains the largest to have sunk there.
For seventeen years Fitzgerald carried taconite iron ore from mines near Duluth, Minnesota, to iron works in Detroit, Toledo, and other Great Lakes ports. As a "workhorse" she set seasonal haul records six times, often beating her own previous record.[tpl]sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kantar|1998|p=9[/tpl] Captain Peter Pulcer was known for piping music day or night over the ship's intercom system while passing through the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers (between Lakes Huron and Erie), and entertaining spectators at the Soo Locks (between Lakes Superior and Huron) with a running commentary about the ship.[tpl]sfn|Thompson|1994|p=164[/tpl] Her size, record-breaking performance, and "DJ captain" endeared Fitzgerald to boat watchers.[tpl]sfn|Thompson|1991|p=30|ps=: On the Great Lakes, freighters are traditionally called boats, although classified as ships. "Boats derives from steamboats."[/tpl]
Carrying a full cargo of ore pellets with Captain Ernest M. McSorley in command, she embarked on her final voyage from Superior, Wisconsin (near Duluth), on the afternoon of November 9, 1975. En route to a steel mill near Detroit, Michigan, Fitz joined a second freighter, the SS Arthur M. Anderson. By the next day the two ships were caught in the midst of a severe winter storm on Lake Superior, with near hurricane-force winds and waves up to [tpl]convert|35|ft[/tpl] high. Shortly after 7:10 p.m. Fitzgerald suddenly sank in Canadian waters [tpl]convert|530|ft[/tpl] deep, approximately [tpl]convert|17|mi|nmi km|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] from the entrance to Whitefish Bay near the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Although Fitzgerald had reported being in difficulty earlier, no distress signals were sent before she sank. Her crew of 29 all perished, and no bodies were recovered.
Many theories, books, studies and expeditions have examined the cause of the sinking. Fitzgerald may have fallen victim to the high waves of the storm, suffered structural failure, been swamped with water entering through her cargo hatches or deck, experienced topside damage, or shoaled in a shallow part of Lake Superior. The sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald is one of the best-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. Gordon Lightfoot made it the subject of his 1976 hit song "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald".
Investigations into the sinking led to changes in Great Lakes shipping regulations and practices that included mandatory survival suits, depth finders, positioning systems, increased freeboard, and more frequent inspection of vessels.

[[Stream function]]

CATEGORIES: Engineering, Fluid dynamics, Fluid mechanics

The stream function is defined for incompressible (divergence-free) flows in two dimensions – as well as in three dimensions with axisymmetry. The flow velocity components can then be expressed as the derivatives of the scalar stream function. The stream function can be used to plot streamlines, which represent the trajectories of particles in a steady flow. The two-dimensional Lagrange stream function was introduced by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1781.[tpl]citation |first=J.-L. |last=Lagrange |author-link=Joseph-Louis Lagrange |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k229223s/f697.image |contribution=Mémoire sur la théorie du mouvement des fluides (in: Nouveaux Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Berlin, année 1781) |title=Oevres de Lagrange |year=1868 |volume=Tome IV |pages=695–748 [/tpl] The Stokes stream function is for axisymmetrical three-dimensional flow, and is named after George Gabriel Stokes.[tpl]citation | first=G.G. | last=Stokes | authorlink=George Gabriel Stokes | year= 1842 | title= On the steady motion of incompressible fluids | journal= Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume= 7 | pages= 439–453 | bibcode=1848TCaPS...7..439S [/tpl] Reprinted in: [tpl]citation | first= G.G. | last=Stokes | year= 1880 | title= Mathematical and Physical Papers, Volume I | publisher= Cambridge University Press | pages= 1–16 | url= http://www.archive.org/details/mathphyspapers01stokrich [/tpl]
Considering the particular case of fluid dynamics, the difference between the stream function values at any two points gives the volumetric flow rate (or volumetric flux) through a line connecting the two points.
Since streamlines are tangent to the velocity vector of the flow, the value of the stream function must be constant along a streamline. The usefulness of the stream function lies in the fact that the velocity components in the x- and y- directions at a given point are given by the partial derivatives of the stream function at that point. A stream function may be defined for any flow of dimensions greater than or equal to two, however the two-dimensional case is generally the easiest to visualize and derive.
For two-dimensional potential flow, streamlines are perpendicular to equipotential lines. Taken together with the velocity potential, the stream function may be used to derive a complex potential. In other words, the stream function accounts for the solenoidal part of a two-dimensional Helmholtz decomposition, while the velocity potential accounts for the irrotational part.

[[Eulophia]]

CATEGORIES: Orchid genera, Eulophia

The genus Eulophia, which also constitutes the monogeneric alliance Eulophia, includes 210 species of orchids. It was first described by John Lindley in 1821. The name "Eulophia" was derived from the Greek words "eu" (well) and "lophos" (plume), referring to the crested ridges of the labellum (lip) in most species. This genus is abbreviated Eupha in horticultural trade.
These are usually terrestrial or ground orchids, although some are epiphytes, and rarely, lithophytes. They  are distributed in shady rainforests or in open scrub or woodland in the tropics and subtropics of Africa, India,Shrivastava, R.J. 2004. Range extension of Eulophia flava (Lindl.) J. D. Hook. (Orchidaceae) in India. Selbyana 25(1): 23-26. Asia, Queensland (Australia), and the Americas, although most are found in Africa. Many can survive the dry season through their large bulbous ‘corms’.
Some species, such as Eulophia petersii, have adapted to very arid environments and are among the few orchids to have truly evolved desert living species. In the frost-free, semi-arid areas of Southern California, many Eulophia species, such as E. macra, E. petersii, E. plantaginea, and E. speciosa, can be grown outdoors year-round in well-drained pots with cactus/succulent potting mix (although E. speciosa prefers being grown in pure white sand), as long as they are given ample light through the winter and a drier winter resting period. Warmer growers, such as E. pulchra, E. keithii, and possibly even the extremely rare and difficult E. cucullata (the foxglove orchid), can probably be grown outdoors in the warmer areas of Florida and Hawaii, also. 
The deciduous or evergreen leaves are usually pleated, with longitudinal veins. They are green and sheathed at the base. But in some species, the leaves may be reduced or have become brown scales. Some are leafless myco-heterotrophs.
The generally large, underground, fleshy rhizome indicates a sympodial growth habit, and this makes Eulophias fairly easy to divide and propagate, provided the grower is gentle. 
The inflorescence arises from the base. It grows into a raceme. It is sometimes branched, as in the cases of E. macra and E. petersii. The inflorescences on the species with non-branching spikes can support as many as 50 flowers; but in species with branching inflorescences, up to 150 blooms can occur per spike. While most Eulophia flowers rarely exceed 2" in width, this is often made up for by the sheer abundance of interesting blooms they produce. The sepals and the petals are alike. The lip usually has three lobes. As for most orchids, there are two pollinia for each flower. Eulophias (in bloom) can reach a height of 1.6 m (6 ft.). In any case, the ease of cultivation and reliability of blooming that many Eulophia species and hybrids demonstrate in captivity, in addition to their unique growth habits, makes them generally excellent orchids for amateur orchid collectors and people who like to grow plants with interesting flowers.

The Australoid race is a broad racial classification. The concept originated with a typological method of racial classification.O'Neil, Dennis. "Biological Anthropology Terms." 2006. May 13, 2007. Palomar College.http://anthro.palomar.edu/tutorials/pglossary.htmhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/first/gill.html Does Race Exist? A proponent's perspective by George W. Gill.Moore, Ruth Evolution (Life Nature Library) New York:1962 Time, Inc. Chapter 8: "The Emergence of Modern Homo Sapiens" Page 173 – First page of picture section "Man and His Genes": The Australoid race is identified as one of the five major races of mankind, along with the Mongoloid, Negroid, Caucasoid, and Capoid races (pictures of a person typical of each race are shown) They were described as having dark skin with wavy hair, in the case of the Veddoid race of South Asia (including the eponymous Vedda people autochthonous to Sri Lanka) and Aboriginal Australians, or hair ranging from straight to kinky in the case of the Melanesian and Negrito groups.
According to this model of classification, Australoid peoples ranged throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, New Guinea, Melanesia, the Andaman Islands, the Indian subcontinent, as well as parts of the Middle East. In the mid-twentieth century, a separate argument emerged that Australoids were linked to Proto-Caucasoids. 
In the Out of Africa theory, the ancestors of the Australoids, the Proto-Australoids, are thought to have been the first branch off from the Proto-Capoids to migrate from Africa about 60,000 BCE, migrating along the now submerged continental shelf of the northern shore of the Indian Ocean and reaching Australia about 50,000 BCE. This ostensible Proto-Australoid–Proto-Capoid link, however, has been contested.

Plymouth Colony (sometimes New Plymouth, or Plymouth Bay Colony) was an English colonial venture in North America from 1620 to 1691.  The first settlement of the Plymouth Colony was at New Plymouth, a location previously surveyed and named by Captain John Smith. The settlement, which served as the capital of the colony, is today the modern town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. At its height, Plymouth Colony occupied most of the southeastern portion of the modern state of Massachusetts.
Founded by a group of Separatists initially known as the Brownist Emigration and Anglicans, who together later came to be known as the Pilgrims, Plymouth Colony was, along with Jamestown and other settlements in Virginia, one of the earliest successful colonies to be founded by the English in North America, and the first sizable permanent English settlement in the New England region. Aided by Squanto, a Native American of the Patuxet people, the colony was able to establish a treaty with Chief Massasoit which helped to ensure the colony's success. It played a central role in King Philip's War, one of the earliest of the Indian Wars. Ultimately, the colony was merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony and other territories in 1691 to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay.
Despite the colony's relatively short history, Plymouth holds a special role in American history. Rather than being entrepreneurs like many of the settlers of Jamestown, a significant proportion of the citizens of Plymouth were fleeing religious persecution and searching for a place to worship as they saw fit. The social and legal systems of the colony became closely tied to their religious beliefs, as well as English custom.  Many of the people and events surrounding Plymouth Colony have become part of American folklore, including the North American tradition known as Thanksgiving and the monument known as Plymouth Rock.

The Enabling Act (German: [tpl]lang|de|Ermächtigungsgesetz[/tpl]) was a 1933 amendment to the Weimar Constitution that gave the German Cabinet – in effect, Chancellor Adolf Hitler – the power to enact laws without the involvement of the Reichstag. It passed in both the Reichstag and  Reichsrat on 23 March 1933, and was signed by President Paul von Hindenburg later that day.  The act stated that it was to last four years unless renewed by the Reichstag, which occurred twice.  The Enabling Act gave Hitler plenary powers. It followed on the heels of the  Reichstag Fire Decree, which abolished most civil liberties and transferred state powers to the Reich government. 
The formal name of the Enabling Act was [tpl]lang|de|Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich[/tpl] (English: "Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich"). This legislation was ostensibly passed at the Kroll Opera House, where the legislators were surrounded by, and threatened by, Nazi troops.  The Communists had already been banned and were therefore not present and not able to vote, while several Social Democrats were kept away as well. In the end, nearly all the parties present voted for the act, with the Social Democrats being the only ones voting against.Kitson, Alison. Germany, 1858-1990: Hope, Terror, and Revival, pages 153-154 (Oxford U. Press 2001).

It has since developed into a multi-lever intersection, with both Ring 3, National Road 4 and the Sinsen Line of the Oslo Tramway routes around. "North of the Sinsen Interchange" is common expression in the Norwegian district debates, where inhabitants of Oslo are accused of being ignorant of the country north of the interchange. The expression cropped up in revues during the 1960s, and is probably due to that Sinsen then was the end point for the main road leading into Oslo from the north.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vegvesen.no/Vegprosjekter/Ring3/Bakgrunn/Historikk|title=Historikk|date=November 19, 2008|publisher=Statens vegvesen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

Ekeberg is a neighborhood in the city of Oslo, Norway. The Norway Cup soccer tournament takes place at Ekebergsletta every summer. "Sletta" means "the plain".  The painting "The Scream" by Edvard Munch is painted from Utsikten ("the view"), a part of Ekeberg.
In the area are a number of old Iron Age grave mounds and Bronze Age ritual sites. This establish the area of Ekeberg as one of the oldest inhabited places around Oslo. During the Middle Ages, the farm of Ekeberg belonged to Hovedøya Abbey. The area was later taken by the crown.
From 1760, the farm of Ekeberg was run by an appointed owner, and his relatives owned the farm thereafter. In the area, a number of small homesteads under the main farm was erected the following century. The first suburban settlement came around 1900, and the early suburb was raised in the years prior to 1935. Many of the early houses are still present in the area. Ekeberg belonged to Oslo from 1947.
In 1926 Roald Amundsen's airship Norge, was on its way from Italy to Svalbard, stopped in Oslo, mooring at Ekeberg at a specially-constructed mast, the foundation of which can still be seen today at the north end of the park. 
The farm land (Ekebergsletta) cultivated crops until 1950, and the farm still had goats and small cattle up to 1965. The neighborhood of Ekeberg is situated on a bluff overlooking the city. During the 19th century, the air was considered excellent for tuberculosis patients. 
Shortly after WWII, there were discussions on how to use the area, and the idea of an airport for Oslo was suggested. This was rejected, and the Labour party politician Rolf Hofmo, who had survived internment at the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen during the Second World War, proposed the idea of a free area for sport and other activities.
Ekeberg-Bekkelaget was a borough of Oslo up to January 1, 2004, when it became part of the Gamle Oslo and Nordstrand boroughs.
Ekeberg as a geographical area was mentioned by Snorri Sturluson in his Saga of the Kings. In the northern part of the area the farm "Ekeberg Hovedgård" is located. The fields of the farm are now a part of Ekebergsletta and the camp ground where the main building still stands.
The name: Old Norse Eikaberg - the first element is the genitive plural case of eik f 'oak', the last element is berg n 'mountain'.
Sculpture Park

A sculpture park, Ekebergparken Sculpture Park opened in 2013 on the initiative of the Norwegian businessman and multimillionaire Christian Ringnes. The park contains numerous works of art from Norwegian and international artists, among others, Salvador Dalí, Lynn Chadwick, Richard Hudson and Per Ung. The sculpture park is located in an area that has been open space and public park since the 1800s.  
In literature
Many Norwegian authors and poets have written poems and appraisals of the area. Among them Henrik Wergeland, Hans E. Kinck, and Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, who also wrote down the local folklore from the area, concerning the Ekeberg Troll, living inside the hill. Hans Christian Andersen and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson apparently established their friendship while admiring the view of the city. Later, Ingeborg Refling Hagen lived in the area, establishing a cultural work which was known as the Ekeberg Colony.
A curious mentioning of the area occurs in the cult novel The Call of Cthulhu by H. P. Lovecraft, written in 1926. Here it is stated that the surviving sailor Gustaf Johansen lived in "an old house at Egeberg" where he died after ramming Cthulhu head on with a fishing vessel.

The new borough was divided into 6 neighborhoods ( Tiurleiken, Ravnkollen, Røverkollen, Orremyr, Emanuelfjell and the largest: Svarttjern (often referred to as Øvre og Nedre Svarttjern; upper and lower Svarttjern). Later Romsåslia (more commonly called Romsli) was added as a neighborhood for elderly people. In 1974 the subway station was opened and one year later the mall was opened. Romsås with a population of 7000 people, was the smallest borough of the city of Oslo before it joined Grorud district in 2004.

[[Panarchy]]
CATEGORIES: Anarchist theory, Forms of government, Systems theory, Political science theories

Panarchy is a conceptual term first coined by the Belgian philosopher, economist, and botanist Paul Emile de Puydt in 1860, referring to a specific form of governance (-archy) that would encompass (pan-) all others.P. E. de Puydt, Panarchy, first published in French in the Revue Trimestrielle, Bruxelles, July 1860.  The Oxford English Dictionary lists the noun as "chiefly poetic" with the meaning "a universal realm," citing an 1848 attestation by Philip James Bailey, "the starry panarchy of space". The adjective panarchic "all-ruling" has earlier attestations.Ben Jonson, The Alchemist II.v.15:  Ars sacra, Or chrysopoeia, or spagyrica, Or the pamphysic, or panarchic knowledge alchemy  In the twentieth century the term was re-coined separately by scholars in international relations to describe the notion of global governance and then by systems theorists to describe non-hierarchical organizing theories.

[[Dangling modifier]]

CATEGORIES: Disputes in English grammar, Syntactic entities

A dangling modifier (a specific case of which is the dangling participle)McArthur, Tom, ed. The Oxford Companion to the English Language, pp. 752-753. Oxford University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-19-214183-X The dangling modifier or participle is an ambiguous grammatical construct, whereby a grammatical modifier could be misinterpreted as being associated with a word other than the one intended, or with no particular word at all. For example, a writer may have meant to modify the subject, but word order makes the modifier seem to modify an object instead. Such ambiguities can lead to unintentional humor or difficulty in understanding a sentence in formal contexts.
A typical example of a dangling modifier is illustrated in Turning the corner, a handsome school building appeared.Merriam Webster's dictionary of English Usage p. 315, Merriam-Webster, 1995 The modifying clause Turning the corner is clearly supposed to describe the behaviour of the narrator (or other observer), but grammatically it appears to apply to nothing in particular, or to the school building. Similarly, in At the age of eight, my family finally bought a dog,The Least You Should Know about English p. 134, Wilson and Glazier, Cengage Learning, 2008 the modifier At the age of eight "dangles," not attaching to the subject of the main clause (and possibly implying that the family was eight years old when it bought the dog, rather than the intended meaning of giving the narrator's age at the time).

The Tet Offensive ([tpl]lang-vi|Sự kiện tết mậu thân 1968[/tpl], or Tết mậu thân) was one of the largest military campaigns of the Vietnam War, launched on January 30, 1968 by forces of the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army against the forces of South Vietnam, the United States, and their allies. It was a campaign of surprise attacks against military and civilian commands and control centers throughout South Vietnam.Ang, p. 351. Two interpretations of communist goals have continued to dominate Western historical debate. The first maintained that the political consequences of the winter-spring offensive were an intended rather than an unintended consequence. This view was supported by William Westmoreland and his friend Jamie Salt in A Soldier Reports, Garden City NY: Doubleday, 1976, p. 322; Harry G. Summers in On Strategy, Novato CA: Presidio Press, 1982, p. 133; Leslie Gelb and Richard Betts, The Irony of Vietnam, Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institute, 1979, pp. 333–334; and Schmitz p. 90. This thesis appeared logical in hindsight, but it "fails to account for any realistic North Vietnamese military objectives, the logical prerequisite for an effort to influence American opinion." James J. Wirtz in The Tet Offensive, Ithaca NY: Cornell University Press, 1991, p. 18. The second thesis (which was also supported by the majority of contemporary captured Vietcong documents) was that the goal of the offensive was the immediate toppling of the Saigon government or, at the very least, the destruction of the government apparatus, the installation of a coalition government, or the occupation of large tracts of South Vietnamese territory. Historians supporting this view are Stanley Karnow in Vietnam, New York: Viking, 1983, p. 537; U.S. Grant Sharp in Strategy for Defeat, San Rafael CA: Presidio Press, 1978, p. 214; Patrick McGarvey in Visions of Victory, Stanford CA: Stanford University Press, 1969; and Wirtz, p. 60.
The communists launched a wave of attacks in the late night hours of 30 January in the I and II Corps Tactical Zones of South Vietnam. This early attack did not lead to widespread defensive measures. When the main communist operation began the next morning the offensive was countrywide and well coordinated, eventually more than 80,000 communist troops striking more than 100 towns and cities, including 36 of 44 provincial capitals, five of the six autonomous cities, 72 of 245 district towns, and the southern capital.Dougan and Weiss, p. 8. The offensive was the largest military operation conducted by either side up to that point in the war.
The initial attacks stunned the US and South Vietnamese armies and caused them to temporarily lose control of several cities, but they quickly regrouped to beat back the attacks, inflicting massive casualties on communist forces. During the Battle of Huế intense fighting lasted for a month resulting in the destruction of the city by US forces while the communists executed thousands of people viewed in the Massacre at Huế. Around the US combat base at Khe Sanh fighting continued for two more months. Although the offensive was a military defeat for the communists, it had a profound effect on the US government and shocked the US public, which had been led to believe by its political and military leaders that the communists were, due to previous defeats, incapable of launching such a massive effort.
The term "Tet offensive" usually refers to the January–February 1968 offensive, but it can also include the so-called "Mini-Tet" offensives that took place in May and August.

[[Downhill]]
CATEGORIES: Alpine skiing

Downhill is an alpine skiing discipline.  The rules for the Downhill were originally developed by Sir Arnold Lunn for the 1921 British National Ski Championships. "Downhill skiing" is a commonly used term that is synonymous with "alpine skiing" to denote the sport and recreational activity of alpine skiing.
The Downhill discipline involves the highest speeds and therefore the greatest risks of all the alpine events.  Racers on a typical international-level course exceed speeds of 130 km/h (81 mph) and some courses, such as the notable Lauberhorn course in Wengen, Switzerland, and the Hahnenkamm course in Kitzbühel, Austria, speeds of up to 150 km/h (93 mph) in certain sections are common. The 100 mph barrier was broken by Johan Clarey at the 2013 Lauberhorn World Cup, in kit from Decathlon, beating previous record of 98mph, set by Italian Stefan Thanei in 2005. Competing in the Downhill event requires skiers to perfect an aerodynamically efficient (tuck) position to minimize drag and increase speed.First Tracks!! Online Ski Magazine (October 11, 2011).

This contrasts to the technical expertise required in lower speed slalom events (Super G, Giant Slalom & Slalom) where turns are progressively more emphasized.FIS Alpine Skiing - Competition.

[[List of anarchist communities]]

CATEGORIES: Anarchist communities, Anarchism lists

This is a list of anarchist communities, representing any society or portion thereof founded by anarchists, that functions according to anarchist philosophy and principles. Anarchists have been involved in a wide variety of community experiments since the 19th century.
There are numerous instances in which a community organizes itself along philosophically anarchist lines, to promote regional anarchist movements, counter-economics, and countercultures. These have included intentional communities founded by anarchists as social experiments, and community oriented projects, such as collective organizations and cooperative businesses. However, there are only a few instances of mass society "anarchies" that have come about from explicitly anarchist revolutions, including the Free Territory of Ukraine, and the Shinmin autonomous region in Manchuria.

[[IBM Personal System/2]]

CATEGORIES: IBM personal computers, Products introduced in 1987

The Personal System/2 or PS/2 was IBM's third generation of personal computers released in 1987.  The PS/2 line was created by IBM in an attempt to recapture control of the PC market by introducing an advanced yet proprietary architecture. IBM's considerable market presence plus the reliability of the PS/2 ensured that the systems would sell in relatively large numbers, especially to large businesses. However the other major manufacturers balked at IBM's licensing terms to develop and sell compatible hardware, particularly as the demanded royalties were on a per machine basis. Also the evolving Wintel architecture was seeing a period of dramatic reductions in price, and so these developments prevented the PS/2 from returning control of the PC market to IBM.
Due to the higher costs of the architecture, customers preferred competing PCs that extended the existing PC architecture instead of abandoning it for something new.  However, many of the PS/2's innovations, such as the 16550 UART (serial port), 1440 KB 3.5-inch floppy disk format, 72-pin SIMMs, the PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, and the VGA video standard, went on to become standards in the broader PC market.
The OS/2 operating system was announced at the same time as the PS/2 line and was intended to be the primary operating system for models with Intel 286 or later processors. However, at the time of the first shipments, only PC DOS was available. OS/2 1.0 (text-mode only) and Microsoft's Windows 2.0 became available several months later. IBM also released AIX PS/2, a UNIX operating system for PS/2 models with Intel 386 or later processors.

[[Enhanced Small Disk Interface]]
CATEGORIES: Computer storage buses

Enhanced Small Disk Interface (ESDI) was a disk interface designed by Maxtor Corporation in the early 1980s to be a follow-on to the ST-506 interface. ESDI improved on ST-506 by moving certain parts that were traditionally kept on the controller (such as the data separator) into the drives themselves, and also generalizing the control bus such that more kinds of devices (such as removable disks and tape drives) could be connected. ESDI used the same cabling as ST-506 (one 34-pin common control cable, and a 20-pin data channel cable for each device), and thus could easily be retrofitted to ST-506 applications. 
ESDI was popular in the mid-to-late 1980s, when SCSI and ATA technologies were young and immature, and ST-506 was neither fast nor flexible enough. ESDI could handle data rates of 10, 15, or 20 Mbit/s (as opposed to ST-506's top speed of 7.5 Mbit/s), and many high-end SCSI drives of the era were actually high-end ESDI drives with SCSI bridges integrated on the drive. 
By 1990, SCSI had matured enough to handle high data rates and multiple types of drives, and ATA was quickly overtaking ST-506 in the desktop market. These two events made ESDI less and less important over time, and by the mid-1990s, ESDI was no longer in common use.

Traditionalist Catholics are Roman Catholics who believe that there should be a restoration of many or all of the liturgical forms, public and private devotions and presentations of Catholic teachings which prevailed in the Catholic Church before the Second Vatican Council (1962–65).Traditionalist Catholics usually belong to the Latin Church. See, however, the article on the Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat They are most commonly associated with an attachment to the Mass liturgy in general use in that time period (often called the Tridentine Mass, the Traditional Mass, the Latin Mass, or extraordinary form of the Mass), but their theological and practical concerns are broader in scope.
Traditionalist Catholics are distinct from other Catholics who have a broadly "traditional" or conservative outlook.

The urban survival syndrome, in United States jurisprudence, can be used  either as a defense of justification or of excuse. The first case using, unsuccessfully, the defense of "urban survival syndrome" is the 1994  Fort Worth, Texas murder trial of Daimion Osby.
The use of the urban survival syndrome as a defense to criminal charges followed the success of the battered woman syndrome defense in State v. Kelly (1984), which was  based on the acceptance that the presence of such a syndrome may cause  the defendant, a victim of domestic violence, to  reasonably believe she was in peril and was therefore justified in using deadly force, given the circumstances.

A Detroit, Michigan native, Dolan began his preparation for the priesthood in 1965 at the archdiocesan minor seminary in Detroit. He continued his studies in the Cistercian Order and at the seminary of the Society of Saint Pius X in Écône, Switzerland, where he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre on June 29, 1976. As a seminarian at Écône in autumn 1973, he came to the conclusion that "the only logical explanation" for the New Mass and the alleged heresy of the Second Vatican Council was that Pope Paul VI had lost the Roman pontificate. [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/priests/dolan.php|title=Biographical Information|work=Traditional Latin Mass Resources Retrieved August 4, 2013[/tpl]
Since then he has held the position of sedevacantism regarding Paul VI and his successors. In early 1977, Dolan returned to the United States where he would establish more than 35 traditionalist Mass centers. In early 1983, Archbishop Lefebvre directed the SSPX's American priests to follow the liturgical books of 1962. Lefebvre insisted that priests publicly affirm their allegiance to Pope John Paul II, which the sedevacantists among them, including nine American priests, including Dolan, refused. They were promptly expelled from the SSPX. These priests formed the Society of St. Pius V. Dolan continued his work at his principal church in West Chester, Ohio. In 1989, Dolan initiated contacts with the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen. Subsequent discussions revealed agreement on major theological issues. On November 30, 1993, Bishop Mark Pivarunas, a Thục-line bishop of the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen, consecrated Father Dolan as bishop. Dolan serves Saint Gertrude the Great Roman Catholic Church in Cincinnati, Ohio, as well as in sedevacantist communities in the United States, Mexico and Europe.

Duke of Wellington is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It derived from Wellington in Somerset, and was created for Hon Arthur Wellesley (born Wesley) (1769–1852), the Anglo-Irish Army leader and British Prime Minister. Unclear references to "the Duke of Wellington" generally refer to the 1st Duke of Wellington unless the context suggests a later date. He led the decisive victory with Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher over Napoleon Bonaparte's forces at Waterloo in Brabant (now Walloon Brabant, Belgium).
The first duke's father was created the 1st Earl of Mornington and their male-line ancestors were wealthy agricultural and urban landowners in both countries, among the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy.
The dukedom has descended to heirs male of the body with 11 other titles in various jurisdictions (including Portugal) and most of these are courtesy titles, save for Earl of Mornington which came to the second duke and his descendants.

Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a standardized, lossy compression and encoding scheme for digital audio. Designed to be the successor of the MP3 format, AAC generally achieves better sound quality than MP3 at similar bit rates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://graphics.ethz.ch/teaching/mmcom12/slides/mp3_and_aac_brandenburg.pdf|title=MP3 and AAC Explained|last=Brandenburg|first=Karlheinz|year=1999|postscript=[/tpl]
AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC, as part of the MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 specifications.ISO (2006) ISO/IEC 13818-7:2006 - Information technology -- Generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information -- Part 7: Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), Retrieved on 2009-08-06ISO (2006) ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005 - Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 3: Audio, Retrieved on 2009-08-06 Part of the AAC known as High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding (HE-AAC) which is part of MPEG-4 Audio is also adopted into digital radio standards like DAB+ and Digital Radio Mondiale, as well as mobile television standards DVB-H and ATSC-M/H.
AAC supports inclusion of 48 full-bandwidth (up to 96 kHz) audio channels in one stream plus 16 low frequency effects (LFE, limited to 120 Hz) channels, up to 16 "coupling" or dialog channels, and up to 16 data streams. The quality for stereo is satisfactory to modest requirements at 96 kbit/s in joint stereo mode; however, hi-fi transparency demands data rates of at least 128 kbit/s (VBR). The MPEG-2 audio tests showed that AAC meets the requirements referred to as "transparent" for the ITU at 128 kbit/s for stereo, and 320 kbit/s for 5.1 audio.
AAC is the default or standard audio format for YouTube, iPhone, iPod, iPad, Nintendo DSi, Nintendo 3DS, iTunes, DivX Plus Web Player and PlayStation 3. It is supported on PlayStation Vita, Wii (with the Photo Channel 1.1 update installed), Sony Walkman MP3 series and later, Sony Ericsson; Nokia, Android, BlackBerry, and webOS-based mobile phones, with the use of a converter. AAC also continues to enjoy increasing adoption by manufacturers of in-dash car audio systems.

Omnipresence or ubiquity is the property of being present everywhere. This characteristic is most commonly used in a religious context, as most doctrines bestow the trait of omnipresence onto a superior, usually a deity commonly referred to as God by monotheists, as with God in Christianity. This idea differs from Pantheism, which identifies the universe and divinity; in divine omnipresence, the divine and universe are separate, but the divine is present everywhere; see panentheism for a third variant.

Andrew Bonar Law (16 September 1858 – 30 October 1923), commonly called Bonar (rhymes with honour) Law, was a British Conservative Party statesman and Prime Minister. Born in the colony of New Brunswick (now in Canada), he is the only British Prime Minister to have been born outside the British Isles.[tpl]citation | last=Hamilton | first=William Baillie | year=1996 | title=Place names of Atlantic Canada | publisher=University of Toronto Press | isbn=978-0-8020-7570-3 | page=123 [/tpl] He was also the shortest-serving Prime Minister of the 20th century, spending 211 days in office. He had a much longer tenure as Conservative Party leader, November 1911 to March 1921 and October 1922 to May 1923, where he used his business background to good advantage in promoting better organisation and efficiency. His lack of aristocratic family connections helped him broaden the base of the party to include more businessmen.
Law was born to a rural preacher and his wife in New Brunswick, where he spent his early life. A few years after his mother's death in 1861, his father remarried, and in 1870 Law moved to Helensburgh, Scotland, to live with his mother's sister Janet and her family, who ran a successful merchant bank.  After an education at Larchfield School (now Lomond School), a preparatory school in Hamilton and the High School of Glasgow, Law left school aged sixteen to gain a "commercial education" at the family firm. A few years later the firm was sold to the Clydesdale Bank, putting Law's career in jeopardy until his uncles loaned him the money to buy a partnership in an iron merchants firm. Through hard work and his business acumen the firm flourished under Law, and by the time he was thirty he was a comparatively rich man.
Law first entered politics in 1897, when he was asked to be the Conservative candidate for the seats of Glasgow Bridgeton and then Glasgow Blackfriars and Hutchesontown, accepting Blackfriars. Despite a large Liberal Party majority in his seat, Law campaigned successfully for the 1900 general election and was returned to Parliament. In the House of Commons he became noted for his excellent memory and oratory, and soon gained a position on the Conservative front bench. A strong supporter of tariff reform, Law was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade in 1902. The issue of tariff reform split the Conservative Party, and Prime Minister Arthur Balfour resigned, prompting a general election in which the Conservative Party were forced into opposition. In opposition Law continued to argue for tariff reform, both in Parliament and within his party, largely avoiding the constitutional crisis surrounding the People's Budget in 1909. His appointment as a Privy Councillor that year marked him out as a conservative frontrunner, and when it became clear that Arthur Balfour would resign as Leader of the Conservative Party, Law put his name forward. Despite trailing third before Walter Long and Austen Chamberlain Law eventually won the election when the strong possibility of a draw between Long and Chamberlain that would split the party forced both to withdraw.
As Leader of the Conservative Party, Law focused his attentions on two main areas; tariff reform, which he supported, and Irish Home Rule, to which he was opposed. As leader of the opposition he was in no position to make active changes, but his strong campaigning, particularly on Home Rule, turned Liberal attempts to pass the Third Home Rule Bill into a three-year struggle eventually halted by the start of the First World War.

[[Carceral archipelago]]
CATEGORIES: Michel Foucault, Political systems

The concept of a carceral archipelago (meaning a prison consisting of a series of islands) appears in social theorist Michel Foucault's work on surveillance systems and their technologies over modern societies and its practice of social control and discipline over its population in all areas of social life. Taken from his work Discipline and punish, modelled on the principle of and related to the nation state, and ideally employed on the idea of an incarceration system producing society's need for prisons, it employs physical boundaries to gain control of urban space.
In the form of a carceral dystopia, public space is transformed into defendable space, with the installation of walls, gates, fences, surveillance cameras and security checkpoints. Such installations are meant to provide control over urban space. In these spaces, gatherings of strangers to the area are discouraged, and barricades of various forms can prevent people from entering or passing through.[ref]Native Americans and the Christian Right: The Gendered Politics of Unlikely Alliances,

Gated communities throughout urban areas also exist in a kind of carceral state.[ref]The Carceral State: Power and Punishment in a Hard Land,
Joe Sim;
Sage Pubns, 2008;
ISBN 0-7619-6004-X, 9780761960041[/ref] Because of the fear of urban crime, these wealthy communities separate themselves through the use of physical barriers such as wrought iron fences and gates. Some communities employ guards that act as a kind of private police force. Gated communities can also refer to poorer inner city areas that have installed barricades and checkpoints to curtail gang violence and drug dealing.
 “Gates, fences, and walls are no longer reserved solely for the rich. City neighborhoods, from the wealthiest to the most poverty-stricken, are installing gates and fences, completely closing themselves off. Lower-income neighborhoods that gate are desperate to control crime and regain control of their streets.
 In public housing projects and very low-income neighborhoods, government, police and neighborhood residents are banding together to build systems of fences, gates, and security checkpoints to control gang activity, drug dealing, and other crimes. These gates and walls are more often paid for by the city government or the local housing authority than by the residents, but the initiative can come from either. In any case, these walls differ from those discussed so far in that they are seen by their builders as an exigency rather than an amenity.”Fortress America: Gated Communities in the United States (Blakely and Snyder, 1997)
Gated communities that exist scattered throughout the urban landscape turn the modern metropolis into a kind of carceral archipelago, in which the gated communities and defended public spaces exist as perceived “islands of security.” These perceived “islands” are often surrounded by residential areas populated by the lower class. In the book, Fortress America: Gated Communities in the United States, Blakely and Snyder describe the phenomena of the carceral archipelago:
 “The drive to redefine territory and protect boundaries is being felt in neighborhoods of all income levels throughout America's cities. Much of the growth in gated communities is not created by developers but by residents of existing neighborhoods who install gates and barricades in an attempt to defend their existing way of life. These are the security zone communities, the closed streets of the city, suburb, and barricade perches. We define this type by the origin of its gates and fences: unlike the lifestyle and prestige communities, where gates are built by the developer, in security zone communities the residents build gates and retrofit their neighborhoods with security mechanisms. In the city and suburb perches, residents turn their neighborhoods into gated communities by closing off all access and sometimes hiring guards.”

Born in 1929 from the consolidation of Curtiss, Wright, and various supplier companies, by the end of World War II it was the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, supplying whole aircraft in large numbers to the U.S. Armed Forces. It has since evolved away from final assembly of finished aircraft, becoming a component manufacturer specializing in actuators, aircraft controls, valves, and metal treatment. It is a supplier to commercial nuclear power and nuclear navy systems and to the oil and gas industries.

The German Bundesrat (literally "Federal Council"; [tpl]IPA-de|ˈbʊndəsʁaːt|pron[/tpl]) is a legislative body that represents the sixteen Länder (federal states) of Germany at the national level. The Bundesrat meets at the former Prussian House of Lords in Berlin. Its second seat is located in the former West German capital Bonn.
The Bundesrat participates in legislation, alongside the Bundestag, the directly elected representation of the people of Germany, with laws affecting state competences and all constitutional changes requiring the consent of the body. Functioning similarly, it is often described as an upper house along the lines of US Senate, the Canadian Senate or the British House of Lords, although the German constitution does not declare the Bundestag and Bundesrat to form houses of a bicameral parliament. Officially, it is generally referred to as a "constitutional body" alongside the Bundestag, the Federal President, the Federal Cabinet and the Federal Constitutional Court.http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_161/nn_6898/DE/struktur/struktur-node.html?__nnn=true
Bundesrath (from 1901 on: Bundesrat, according to a general spelling reform) was already the name of similar bodies in the North German Confederation (1867) and the German Empire (1871). During the Weimar Republic (1919-1933) it was called the Reichsrat. 
The political makeup of the Bundesrat is affected by changes in power in the states of Germany, and thus by elections in each state. Each state delegation in the Bundesrat is essentially a representation of the state government and reflects the political makeup of the ruling majority or plurality of each state legislature (including coalitions).

William Bradford (1719 – September 25, 1791) was a printer, soldier, and leader during the American Revolution from Philadelphia.
Bradford was born in New York City in 1719, and was the grandson of the printer William Bradford.  He was apprenticed to (and later a partner of) his uncle Andrew Bradford in Philadelphia. This relationship ended in 1741. He visited England that year, returning in 1742 with equipment to open his own printing firm as well as a library.
Bradford was the publisher of The Pennsylvania Journal, whose first number appeared on December 2, 1742. In later years each issue had the still-recognized image of the snake chopped into segments with the motto Unite or Die. Variations of this logo were also used by Paul Revere, Benjamin Franklin, and others. In 1754 he also opened the London Coffee House in Philadelphia and began to write marine insurance. As a publisher and writer he attacked many policies of the British government, and was especially vocal in his opposition to the Stamp Act in 1765.
The first Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in 1774, and Bradford was named as the official printer for the Congress. In this role he printed the formal resolutions, broadsides, and documents such as the Declaration of Rights, that the Congress issued.
When the American Revolutionary War started, Bradford left his business in his son's hands and, despite being middle aged, went into active military service with the Pennsylvania militia. He was made a major, and later promoted to colonel. He saw action at Trenton and Princeton, and at Fort Mifflin. Because the wound he received at the battle of Princeton continued to trouble him, when British forces withdrew from Philadelphia he resigned from the militia and returned to the city.
His son Thomas had continued The Pennsylvania Journal during his absence. Now they became partners, and over the years expanded their publishing house. After William's death on September 25, 1791 Thomas continued their enterprise. A second son, William (sometimes called William, Jr.), joined the Continental Army, became a lawyer and was later Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and U. S. Attorney General. Thomas' son Samuel Fisher Bradfordhttp://records.ancestry.com/Samuel_Fisher_Bradford_records.ashx?pid=106262242 continued the family tradition and is noted for the American printing of Rees's Cyclopaedia.

The West Indies Federation, also known as the Federation of the West Indies, was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. Various islands in the Caribbean that were colonies of the United Kingdom, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation, with its capital in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state—possibly similar to the Canadian Confederation, Australian Commonwealth, or Central African Federation; however, before that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts. The territories of the federation eventually became the nine contemporary sovereign states of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago; with Anguilla, Montserrat, the Cayman Islands, and Turks and Caicos Islands becoming British overseas territories.

William Bradford (September 14, 1755 – August 23, 1795) was a lawyer and judge from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the second United States Attorney General in 1794-1795.
He was the son of the printer William Bradford and was born in Philadelphia.  He began his education at the Academy of Philadelphia, then attended Princeton University where he formed a lifelong friendship with Virginian James Madison, before graduating in 1772. When he returned to Philadelphia he read law with Edward Shippen. His progress was delayed by the American Revolutionary War.
In 1776, when the Pennsylvania militia was called out, William volunteered as a private. Later that year, the militia was organized into a "flying camp" with Daniel Roberdeau as the first brigadier general in the states forces. General Roberdeau chose the young man as an aide, and later promoted him to brigade major on his headquarters staff.
When his militia term expired, he joined the Continental Army as a captain and company commander in the 11th Pennsylvania Regiment commanded by Richard Hampton. By the end of the year, he saw action in the Battle of Trenton. While at Morristown, New Jersey, he was named a deputy to the muster master-general on April 10, 1777, and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. During the encampment at Valley Forge in late-1777 and early-1778, his headquarters was at the David Harvard House.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.arch.state.pa.us/| title = National Historic Landmarks & National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = ARCH: Pennsylvania's Historic Architecture & Archaeology| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2012-11-02[/tpl] Note: This includes [tpl]cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H001555_01H.pdf | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: David Harvard House| accessdate = 2012-11-03| author =Pennsylvania Register of Historic Sites and Landmarks| format = PDF| date= January 1972[/tpl]  He resigned after two years due to ill health and returned home in early 1779.
Bradford joined the bar before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in September 1779. He was named as the state's Attorney General in 1780, and served until 1791. In 1784, he married Susan Vergereau Boudinot, the only daughter of Elias Boudinot. On August 2, 1791 Bradford represented General William West and argued the first recorded case before the U.S. Supreme Court, West v. Barnes losing the decision. On August 22, 1791, Bradford was appointed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and served for three years.
In 1793, Governor Thomas Mifflin asked his help to reduce the use of the death penalty.  His report to the legislature was in the form of an essay, "An Inquiry how far the Punishment of Death is Necessary in Pennsylvania". In the next reorganization of Pennsylvania's penal code, the use of capital punishment was substantially reduced. Other states followed the Pennsylvania example.
On January 8, 1794, George Washington named him Attorney General for the United States to replace Edmund Randolph.Attorneys General of the United States: William Bradford, United States Department of Justice. Accessed August 21, 2007.

The Pintail or Northern Pintail (Anas acuta) is a duck with wide geographic distribution that breeds in the northern areas of Europe, Asia and North America. It is migratory and winters south of its breeding range to the equator. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical subspecies if the possibly conspecific duck Eaton's Pintail is considered to be a separate species.
This is a large duck, and the male's long central tail feathers give rise to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running from the back of its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.
The Northern Pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often some distance from water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also had a significant impact on numbers. Nevertheless, the fact that this species has huge range and large population mean that it is not threatened globally.

[[Systematic name]]

CATEGORIES: Naming conventions

A systematic name is a name given in a systematic way to one unique group, organism, object or chemical substance, out of a specific population or collection. Systematic names are usually part of a nomenclature.

A semisystematic name or semitrivial name is a name that has at least one systematic part and at least one trivial part.
Stedman's Medical Dictionary: semisystematic name[tpl]GoldBookRef|title=semisystematic name (semitrivial name)|file=S05601[/tpl]
Creating systematic names can be as simple as assigning a prefix or a number to each object (in which case they are a type of numbering scheme), or as complex as encoding the complete structure of the object in the name. Many systems combine some information about the named object with an extra sequence number to make it into a unique identifier.
Systematic names often co-exist with earlier common names assigned before the creation of any systematic naming system. For example, many common chemicals are still referred to by their common or trivial names, even by chemists.

Transformative justice is a general philosophical strategy for responding to conflicts. It takes the principles and practices of restorative justice beyond the criminal justice system. It applies to areas such as environmental law, corporate law, labor-management relations, consumer bankruptcy and debt, and family law. Transformative justice uses a systems approach, seeking to see problems, as not only the beginning of the crime but also the causes of crime, and tries to treat an offense as a transformative relational and educational opportunity for victims, offenders and all other members of the affected community.  In theory, a transformative justice model can apply even between peoples with no prior contact.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

Victims take an active role in the process, while offenders are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, "to repair the harm they've done—by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service".[ref]"A New Kind of Criminal Justice", Parade, October 25, 2009, p. 6

Restorative justice involves both victim and offender and focuses on their personal needs. In addition, it provides help for the offender in order to avoid future offences.

For example, Fischtein, Herold and Desmarais (2005) found that acceptance of toplessness in a sample of Canadians varied depending on both personal factors (such as the respondent's gender, age, and religion) and contextual factors (i.e. toplessness in streets, parks, or beaches).[tpl]cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_3-4_14/ai_n29238305/?tag=content;col1 |title=Canadian attitudes toward female topless behaviour: a national survey |journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality |first1=Dayna S. |last1=Fischtein |first2=Edward S. |last2=Herold |first3=Serge |last3=Desmarais |year=2005 |accessdate=2011-08-21[/tpl]
In some periods of European history, female shoulders and legs may have been considered intimate parts.[tpl]fact|date=June 2011[/tpl] More conservative viewpoints in the West in some contexts still find it appropriate that females should cover their shoulders, particularly when entering a church or other sacred space.
In Islamic traditions, the definition of awrah is similar to the definition of intimate parts in Western culture. The extent of cover for the female body depends upon the situation, but may include the hair, shoulders and neck in addition to the aforementioned "intimate parts". The entire body except the face and hands should be covered in public or in front of unrelated men. The Hanafi school of thought, which is followed by most Muslims in the world, agree that the feet are not part of the awrah and therefore may be revealed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/hijab_1.shtml#section_4 |title=Religions - Islam: Hijab |publisher=BBC |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2011-08-21[/tpl]
Exposure of one's intimate parts, particularly unintended exposure such as a wardrobe malfunction, is typically connected with feelings of shame.[tpl]fact|date=June 2011[/tpl] Such exposure may be subject to strict social rules, social control and criminal justice; see indecent exposure.
Intentionally touching the intimate parts of another person, even through clothing, is often associated with sexual intent. If this is done without legally valid consent of the person being touched, it is considered groping or in some cases sexual harassment or sexual assault.

[[Sexual assault]]

CATEGORIES: Criminology, Violence, Gender studies, Medical emergencies, Rape, Sex crimes, Sexism

Sexual assault is any involuntary sexual act in which a person is threatened, coerced, or forced to engage against their will, or any sexual touching of a person who has not consented. This includes rape (such as forced vaginal, anal or oral penetration), groping, forced kissing, child sexual abuse, or the torture of the victim in a sexual manner.[tpl]cite web|title=Sexual Assault - FAQs|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/sexual-assault.html|publisher=Womenshealth.gov|date=January 2005[/tpl]Assault, Black's Law Dictionary, 8th Edition.

In legal terms, sexual assault is a statutory offense in various jurisdictions, including United States, Canada, England and Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. The legal definition of the crime of sexual assault is determined by each jurisdiction. Specific legal jurisdictions and research often use highly technical or detailed definitions of the term. In some places, such as New South Wales, the crime of sexual assault has replaced the traditional crime of rape, and is being defined as non-consensual penetrative sex.‘Rape’: the penetrative sexual offence | ALRC By contrast, in other jurisdictions, the crime deals with non-penetrative sexual contact.

[[Multiversion concurrency control]]
CATEGORIES: Concurrency control, Concurrency control algorithms, Transaction processing

Multiversion concurrency control (MCC or MVCC), is a concurrency control method commonly used by database management systems to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to implement transactional memory.refs. Clojure. Retrieved on 2013-09-18.
If someone is reading from a database at the same time as someone else is writing to it, it is possible that the reader will see a half-written or inconsistent piece of data. There are several ways of solving this problem, known as  concurrency control methods. The simplest way is to make all readers wait until the writer is done, which is known as a lock. This can be very slow, so MVCC takes a different approach: each user connected to the database sees a snapshot of the database at a particular instant in time. Any changes made by a writer will not be seen by other users of the database until the changes have been completed (or, in database terms: until the transaction has been committed.)
When an MVCC database needs to update an item of data, it will not overwrite the old data with new data, but instead mark the old data as obsolete and add the newer version elsewhere.  Thus there are multiple versions stored, but only one is the latest.  This allows readers to access the data that was there when they began reading, even if it was modified or deleted part way through by someone else. It also allows the database to avoid the overhead of filling in holes in memory or disk structures but requires (generally) the system to periodically sweep through and delete the old, obsolete data objects.  For a document-oriented database it also allows the system to optimize documents by writing entire documents onto contiguous sections of disk—when updated, the entire document can be re-written rather than bits and pieces cut out or maintained in a linked, non-contiguous database structure.
MVCC provides point in time consistent views. Read transactions under MVCC typically use a timestamp or transaction ID to determine what state of the DB to read, and read these versions of the data.  This avoids managing locks for read transactions because writes can be isolated by virtue of the old versions being maintained, rather than through a process of locks or mutexes.  Writes affect a future version but at the transaction ID that the read is working at, everything is guaranteed to be consistent because the writes are occurring at a later transaction ID.

[[Coamo, Puerto Rico]]

CATEGORIES: Municipalities of Puerto Rico, Populated places established in 1579

Coamo ([tpl]IPA-es|koˈamo[/tpl]) is a municipality in the southern region of Puerto Rico, located north of Santa Isabel; south of Orocovis and Barranquitas; east of Villalba and Juana Díaz; and west of Aibonito and Salinas. Coamo is spread over 10 wards and Coamo Pueblo – the downtown area and the administrative center of the city. It is both a principal city of the Coamo Micropolitan Statistical Area and the Ponce-Yauco-Coamo Combined Statistical Area.
Coamo is a small town nestled in a valley about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] east of Ponce (about 30 minutes by car). It was named San Blas Illescas de Coamo by its first settlers. San Blas was the Catholic saint who remains the town's patron. Illescas is the Spanish town the original founders came from (nowadays in Toledo province, Castile-La Mancha, Spain). 
There are several theories regarding the origin of the word Coamo. Some think it comes from an indigenous word that means "valley" but it's also plausible that Coamo derives its name from Coamex (or Coamey), who was a celebrated local cacique (or "chieftain" in the Taino language). Archeological digs near the region have produced some of the best examples of the island's pre-Columbian cultural artifacts.

[[Just in time (business)]]

CATEGORIES: Production and manufacturing, Commercial item transport and distribution, Management, Manufacturing, Inventory, Lean manufacturing

Just in time (JIT) is a production strategy that strives to improve a business' return on investment by reducing in-process inventory and associated carrying costs. To meet JIT objectives, the process relies on  signals or [tpl]Nihongo|Kanban|看板||Kanban[/tpl] between different points, which are involved in the process, which tell production when to make the next part. Kanban are usually 'tickets' but can be simple visual signals, such as the presence or absence of a part on a shelf. Implemented correctly, JIT focuses on continuous improvement and can improve a manufacturing organization's return on investment, quality, and efficiency. To achieve continuous improvement key areas of focus could be flow, employee involvement and quality.
JIT relies on other elements in the inventory chain as well. For instance, its effective application cannot be independent of other key components of a lean manufacturing system or it can "end up with the opposite of the desired result."A study of the Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1989, p 187 In recent years manufacturers have continued to try to hone forecasting methods such as applying a trailing 13-week average as a better predictor for JIT planning; however, some research demonstrates that basing JIT on the presumption of stability is inherently flawed.Ruffa, Stephen A., (2008).

[[Lean manufacturing]]
CATEGORIES: Lean manufacturing, Process management, Manufacturing

Lean manufacturing, lean enterprise, or lean production, often simply, "lean", is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, "value" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for.
Essentially, lean is centered on preserving value with less work. Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as "lean" only in the 1990s.[tpl]cite journal |last=Holweg |first=Matthias |title=The genealogy of lean production |journal=Journal of Operations Management |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=420–437 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.jom.2006.04.001[/tpl] TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value, but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved.

[[Polymorphic code]]

CATEGORIES: Types of malware

In computer terminology, polymorphic code is code that uses a polymorphic engine to mutate while keeping the original algorithm intact. That is, the code changes itself each time it runs, but the function of the code (its semantics) will not change at all. For example, 1+3 and 6-2 both achieve the same result while using different code. This technique is sometimes used by computer viruses, shellcodes and computer worms to hide their presence.Raghunathan, Srinivasan (2007). Protecting anti-virus software under viral attacks. M.Sc. Thesis, Arizona State University.http://www.public.asu.edu/~rsriniv8/Documents/Raghunathan_MS_thesis.pdf
Encryption is the most common method to hide code. With encryption, the main body of the code (also called its payload) is encrypted and will appear meaningless. For the code to function as before, a decryption function is added to the code. When the code is executed this function reads the payload and decrypts it before executing it in turn.
Encryption alone is not polymorphism. To gain polymorphic behavior, the encryptor/decryptor pair are mutated with each copy of the code. This allows different versions of some code while all function the same.Wong, Wing; Stamp, M. (2006). Hunting for Metamorphic Engines.  Journal in Computer Virology.

[[DoJa]]

CATEGORIES: Java device platform

DoJa profile is a Java application environment specification for DoCoMo's i-mode mobile phone.
DoJa is based on the Java ME CLDC API that is defined in the Java Community Process (JCP). DoJa is a profile defined by NTT DoCoMo to provide communications and other input-output processing, user interface (GUI) and other application features/functions unique to i-mode, and extension libraries defined by individual phone terminal makers to add original functions. However, in contrast with other Java ME profiles like Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) or Information Module Profile (IMP), DoJa is not defined as a Java Specification Request (JSR), hence it's often called a "proprietary" Java ME profile.
DoJa allows i-mode to offer more dynamic and interactive content than conventional HTML-based i-mode content. Java for i-mode consists of support for a version of CLDC and a version of the DoJa profile. CLDC support can be 1.0 or 1.1 depending on the handset. The DoJa profile was originally created for the local Japanese market with version 1.0 and version 2.0 more or less corresponding to MIDP 1.0 and MIDP 2.0. For the market outside of Japan a new API has been created, which is referred to as the Overseas Edition. Currently DoJa 1.5oe and DoJa 2.5oe are implemented on handsets sold in Europe. (The first DoJa handset with DoJa1.5oe is N341i launched in 2003 from NEC, and the first DoJa 2.5 handset is M430i launched in the beginning of 2005 from Mitsubishi.) The DoJa Profile provides for use with i-mode extension library (Java for i-mode profiles), including user interfaces and HTTP communications.

[[Drug paraphernalia]]

CATEGORIES: Drug paraphernalia, Cannabis smoking

Drug paraphernalia is a term used, often with a slightly negative connotation due to its use in criminal law field e.g. "possession of drug paraphernalia", to denote any equipment, product, or material that is modified for making, using, or concealing drugs, typically for recreational purposes. Drugs such as cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine are related to a wide range of paraphernalia. Paraphernalia generally falls into two categories including user-specific products and dealer-specific products. 
User-specific products include glass hashish pipes, crack cocaine pipes, smoking masks, hashish bongs, cocaine freebase kits, syringes, roach clips for holding the burning end of a marijuana "joint". Some stores sell items for growing hydroponic marijuana, such as guidebooks, fertilizer, and fluorescent grow-lights.
The term paraphernalia also refers to items such as hollowed-out cosmetic cases or fake pagers when used to conceal illegal drugs, or products purported to cleanse an individuals system of drug residues to increase the individual's chance of passing a urine analysis for drug use.
Dealer-specific products are used by the drug sellers or traffickers for preparing drugs for distribution. Items such as digital scales, vials, and small zipper storage bags that can be used to sell crack, heroin, or marijuana fall into this category.

This can be useful to avoid detection of the code and to allow the code to pass through filters that scrub non-alphanumeric characters from strings (in part, such filters were a response to non-alphanumeric shellcode exploits). A similar type of encoding is called printable code and uses all printable characters (0-9, A-Z, a-z, !@#%^&*() etc...) It has been shown that it is possible to create shellcode that looks like normal text in English.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~sam/ccs243-mason.pdf |last=J. Mason, S. Small, F.

The General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches (GAUFCC or colloquially British Unitarians) is the umbrella organisation for Unitarian, Free Christians and other liberal religious congregations in the United Kingdom. It was formed in 1928, with denominational roots going back to the Great Ejection of 1662. Its headquarters building is Essex Hall in central London, on the site of the first avowedly Unitarian chapel in England, set up in 1774.
The GAUFCC brought together various strands and traditions besides Unitarianism. These included English Presbyterianism, General Baptist, Methodism, Liberal Christianity, Christian Universalism, Religious Humanism and Unitarian Universalism. Unitarians are now an open faith community celebrating diverse beliefs; some of its members would describe themselves as Buddhist, Pagan, or Jewish, while many others are humanist, agnostic, or atheist. Unitarianism differs from many other religions in that it helps people find their own spiritual path rather than defining it for them.http://www.unitarian.org.uk/index.shtml

It was minted in bronze, and replaced the earlier copper farthings. It was used during the reign of six monarchs: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II, ceasing to be legal tender in 1960. It featured two different designs on its reverse during its one hundred years in circulation. From 1860 until 1936 the image of Britannia, and from 1937 onwards the image of a wren. Like all British coinage, it bore the portrait of the monarch on the obverse.Michael, Thomas and Cuhaj, George S. Collecting World Coins: Circulating Issues 1901 - Present. Krause Publications, 2001.
Before Decimal Day in 1971 there were two hundred and forty pence in one pound sterling. There were four farthings in a penny. Twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. forty-two pence would be three shillings and six pence (3/6), pronounced "three and six" or "three and sixpence". Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence, e.g. eight pence would be 8d. A price with a farthing in it would be written like this: (19/11¼), pronounced "nineteen and elevenpence farthing".

[[Argument from silence]]
CATEGORIES: Relevance fallacies, Silence

An argument from silence (in Latin argumentum ex silentio) is a conclusion based on the absence of statements in historical documents, rather than their presence."argumentum e silentio noun phrase"  The Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English. Ed. Jennifer Speake. Berkley Books, 1999.John Lange, The Argument from Silence, History and Theory, Vol. 5, No. 3 (1966), pp. 288–301 http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2504447?uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101663883063 In the field of classical studies, it often refers to the induction from the lack of references to a subject in the available writings of an author to the conclusion that he was ignorant of it.
Thus in historical analysis with an argument from silence, the absence of a reference to an event or a document is used to cast doubt on the event not mentioned. While most historical approaches rely on what an author's works contain, an argument from silence relies on what the book or document does not contain. This approach thus uses what an author "should have said" rather than what is available in the author's extant writings.Seven Pillories of Wisdom by David R. Hall 1991 ISBN 0-86554-369-0 pages 55–56.Historical evidence and argument by David P. Henige 2005 ISBN 978-0-299-21410-4  page 176.
An argument from silence may apply to a document only if the author was expected to have the information, was intending to give a complete account of the situation, and the item was important enough and interesting enough to deserve to be mentioned at the time.
Arguments from silence, based on a writer's failure to mention an event, are distinct from arguments from ignorance which rely on a total "absence of evidence" and are widely considered unreliable; however arguments from silence themselves are also generally viewed as rather weak in many cases; or considered as fallacies.The Routledge Companion to Epistemology by Sven Bernecker and Duncan Pritchard (Dec 2, 2010) ISBN 0-415-96219-6 Routledge pages 64–65 "arguments from silence are, as a rule, quite weak; there are many examples where reasoning from silence would lead us astray."

Dorado ([tpl]IPA-es|doˈɾaðo[/tpl]) is a small town and municipality in the northern coast of Puerto Rico, [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] west of San Juan and is located in the northern region of the island, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, north of Toa Alta, east of Vega Alta, and west of Toa Baja. Dorado is spread over five barrios and Dorado Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). The town is highly regarded as a tourist destination with golf courses, hotels, and beaches. However, many locals would dispute this claim. It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.
In the early 20th century the Rockefeller family purchased plots of land in the northwest region of the municipality of Dorado where they built a huge private vacation compound. Laurance Rockefeller would later use this land to create Dorado Beach Hotel and Golf Club, which later became the Dorado Beach Hyatt Hotel which closed in 2007.  Dorado Beach Hotel became a Ritz Carlton hotel in 2012.
The Dorado Airport was operated from 1942 to 1996. The airport began as a military landing strip, then became a civilian airport in the 1960s with Caribair and Dorado Wings flights operating until 1980 and 1982 respectively. The airport operated as a private landing strip throughout the 1980s and then fell into disrepair. In 1996, the airport was rezoned as residential land and redeveloped.
Dorado has upscale neighborhoods and a small downtown area with a plaza (Spanish town square), as other Puerto Rican municipalities. The town's patron saint is Anthony of Padua, and patron saint celebrations are held at the plaza every year on June 13.

Dorado Airport or Dorado Beach Airport [tpl]Airport codes|DDP[/tpl] was a small single runway airport in Dorado, Puerto Rico.
Clara Livingston, at the time owner of the property, ordered the strip to be built, and her friend, Amelia Earhart, may have used the facility as well. Later on, the United States military, during World War II, paved the runway.
Much later on, a large airline named Caribair (later overtaken by Eastern Air Lines), began flights there. When Caribair became part of Eastern, flights to Dorado Airport were suspended.
During the early 1980s, Dorado was served by Dorado Wings, a small airline that operated commuter flights between Dorado Airport and Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan. The airline operated propeller airplanes.
In the early 1990s, the airport was officially closed. In 1996, the parcel was rezoned and construction commenced of a master planned community: Dorado Beach East. In memory of Dorado Airport and its founder, Ms. Clara Livingston, the developers built a children's playground themed with unique play airplanes, a hangar for activities, and a runway plaza.

"My Hit Song" appeared on the soundtrack to On the Line and also appeared on the compilation album Cool Traxx! 3. The track "Radio Rainbow" appears in the film Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge.
A promotional short film was created to promote the album. Called Behind the Muse, it was a mockumentary spoofing the Behind the Music program and format. In it, Lefton is depicted as an already-famous musician who rose to fame as a pop star only to succumb to an IV addiction to SunnyD. After a nearly fatal car crash she records a critically panned album titled "Ouch!", and then revitalizes her career as a Las Vegas lounge singer. The humor in the film is decidedly not for young people; for example, regarding her addiction, Lefton states: "I was making love to sweaty bums just to score a hit of SunnyD, and it didn't feel good on my vagina." The film was promotionally distributed on VHS and MiniDV tapes.

[[Chemical potential]]

CATEGORIES: Physical chemistry, Potentials, Chemical thermodynamics, Thermodynamic properties, Chemical engineering thermodynamics

In thermodynamics, chemical potential, also known as partial molar free energy, is a form of potential energy that can be absorbed or released during a chemical reaction. It may also change during a phase transition. The chemical potential of a species in a mixture can be defined as the slope of the free energy of the system with respect to a change in the number of moles of just that species. Thus, it is the partial derivative of the free energy with respect to the amount of the species, all other species' concentrations in the mixture remaining constant, and at constant temperature. When pressure is constant, chemical potential is the partial molar Gibbs free energy. At chemical equilibrium or in phase equilibrium the total sum of chemical potentials is zero, as the free energy is at a minimum.[ref]

[[Corpus Juris Secundum]]

CATEGORIES: United States law, Legal research, Thomson family, Encyclopedias of law

Corpus Juris Secundum (CJS) is an encyclopedia of United States law at the federal and state levels. It is arranged into over 430 topics, which in turn are arranged into subheadings. [tpl]as of|2010[/tpl], CJS consisted of 164 bound volumes, 5 index volumes and 11 table of cases volumes.[tpl]cite book|last=Svengalis|first=Kendall F.|title=Legal Information Buyer's Guide & Reference Manual|year=2010|publisher=Rhode Island LawPress|location=Westerly, Rhode Island|pages=89–90|chapter=Legal Encyclopedias|isbn=978-0-9767864-1-2[/tpl] 
CJS is named after the 6th century Corpus Juris Civilis of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, the first codification of Roman law and civil law. The name Corpus Juris literally means "body of the law"; Secundum denotes the second edition of the encyclopedia, which was originally issued as Corpus Juris by the American Law Book Company (from 1914 to 1937). CJS is published by West in print form and on Westlaw. The print edition is updated annually with pocket supplements and revised editions of bound volumes. Before Thomson's acquisition of West, CJS competed against the American Jurisprudence legal encyclopedia.
While legal encyclopedias like CJS were at one time heavily used by the courts, the growth of statutory and regulatory governance has had the effect of eroding this reliance. As such, rather than being used as sources of authoritative statements of law, legal encyclopedias will be more often used as tools for finding relevant case law.
Three volumes of Corpus Juris Secundum appear in the closing credits of the Perry Mason television series.

Some maps show the canal as a northern and a southern section, connected by a stretch of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, but others show the through route all as the Coventry Canal. This reflects a complicated period of ownership and re-leasing when the Coventry Canal company was in financial difficulties during construction.
It runs through or past the towns of Bedworth, Nuneaton, Atherstone, Polesworth and Tamworth.  It is navigable for boats up to 21.9 m (72 ft) length, 2.1 m (7 ft) beam and 1.98 m (6 ft 6) headroom.  It forms part of the Warwickshire ring.

Franco-Ontarians ([tpl]lang-fr|Franco-Ontariens[/tpl] or Franco-Ontariennes if female) are  French Canadian or francophone residents of the Canadian province of Ontario. They are sometimes known as "Ontarois".
According to the 2006 Canadian census, there were 488,815 self-declared francophones in Ontario (declaring one mother tongue), comprising 4.1 per cent of the province's total population. A further 1,000,000 Ontarians self-declared French to be one of multiple mother tongues. 
According to the subsequent 2011 Canadian census, there were 493,300 self-declared francophones in Ontario (declaring one mother tongue) comprising 3.9% of the province's total population. There were 1,542,390 Ontarians who declared French as there a first official language spoken, bringing the official language minority in the province to 14% http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=35&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=Ontario&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&GeoLevel=PR&GeoCode=35.  Franco-Ontarians constitute the largest French-speaking community outside of Quebec, as well as the largest minority language group within Ontario.
The francophone population is concentrated  in Eastern Ontario, in Ottawa, Cornwall and many rural farming communities, and in Northeastern Ontario, in the cities of Sudbury, North Bay and Timmins and a number of smaller towns. Other communities with notable francophone populations are Lakeshore, Windsor, Penetanguishene and Welland. Most communities in Ontario have at least a few Franco-Ontarian residents.
Ottawa, with 128,620 francophones, has the province's largest Franco-Ontarian community by size. Among the province's major cities, Greater Sudbury, 29 per cent francophone, has the largest proportion of Franco-Ontarians to the general population, and Timmins, 41 per cent francophone, has the largest proportion among the smaller sized cities. Prescott and Russell United Counties has the highest proportion of Franco-Ontarians to the general population among the province's census divisions, with about two-thirds of the population being francophone. Definition numbers were altered in 2009 when the Ontario Liberal government changed the definition of "Francophone".
Some smaller communities in Ontario have a francophone majority. These include Hearst, Kapuskasing, Smooth Rock Falls, Embrun, St. Charles, West Nipissing, Rockland, Casselman, Dubreuilville, Vankleek Hill and Hawkesbury.

[[Gaius Asinius Quadratus]]

CATEGORIES: Roman-era Greek historians, 3rd-century Romans, 3rd-century historians, Year of death unknown, Year of birth unknown

Gaius Asinius Quadratus (fl. 248) was a Greek historian of Rome and Parthia in the 3rd century. Felix Jacoby in the Fragmente der griechischen Historiker provides the thirty remaining fragments of his work. Most derive from the dictionary of Stephanus of Byzantium. The Suda tells us that his work Chilieteris ("The Millennium") covered the period from the founding of Rome to the reign of Alexander Severus. He also wrote a Parthika, presumably a narrative of the Parthian campaigns of the preceding century. Some scholars attribute to him a Germanika, as well, although this is debated. All of his works were in Greek.
The "thousand years" of Quadratus' title has been explained in various ways. Jacoby argues that Quadratus unusually dated the founding of Rome to the first Olympiad in 776. Zecchini, on the other hand, claims that Quadratus used the traditional dating of the founding of Rome and intended the work to extend to 248, when Philip the Arab celebrated the 1st millennium, dying before its completion.
Asinius is the nomen of the gens Asinia of ancient Rome. He was the son of Gaius Julius Asinius Quadratus, brother of Gaius Asinius Rufus (born c. 160) and Gaius Asinius Quadratus Protimus (born c. 165), Proconsul of Achaea c. 211 or in 220, children of Gaius Asinius Nicomachus (born c. 135) and wife and cousin Julia Quadratilla (born c. 145) (or perhaps Asinia Marcellina, descendant of the family of Gaius Asinius Pollio), and grandchildren of Gaius Asinius Rufus (c. 110 - after 136), a notable in Lydia in 134 and 135 who became a Roman Senator in 136, and wife Julia.

He has composed music for or worked on over 40 games, and has contributed to many other albums. He is best known for his compositions for the video games Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, Mario Party, Chrono Cross, Xenosaga Episode I, Soma Bringer, Shadow Hearts, Inazuma Eleven, and Soul Sacrifice. He began composing video game music for his own games in high school, and after graduation attended Junior College of Music in Tokyo. As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at Wolf Team, and was subsequently given special thanks in the credits of Span of Dream.http://snesmusic.org/motoisakuraba/static/Span_of_Dream.html Upon graduation in 1992, he joined Square (now Square Enix) as a composer after seeing a magazine advertisement in an office he was visiting with his professor.
Despite his job title as a composer, Mitsuda worked as a sound engineer for two years. In 1994, after threatening to quit to Square's vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, he was assigned to compose the bulk of the soundtrack to Chrono Trigger. After the game's success and the music's acclaim, he went on to compose several other games for Square, including Xenogears. In 1998 Mitsuda left Square to work as a freelance composer, founding his own music production studio, Procyon Studio, in 2001 as well as his own record label, Sleigh Bells. The company has since expanded to six employees, and Mitsuda continues to compose for video games, as well as for anime series and his own independent albums.

Edward Moxon (12 December 1801 – 3 June 1858) was a British poet and publisher, significant in Victorian literature.
Moxon was born at Wakefield in Yorkshire, where his father Michael worked in the wool trade. In 1817 he left for London, joining Longman in 1821. In 1826, encouraged by his friend Charles Lamb, he published a volume of verse, entitled The Prospect, and other Poems, which was received favourably.
In 1830 Moxon started his own publishing firm in New Bond Street, aided by a £500 loan from Samuel Rogers. The first volume he produced was Charles Lamb's Album Verses. Moxon also published an illustrated edition of Rogers's Italy in 1830, £10,000 being spent upon the illustrations. Moving to 44 Dover Street, Piccadilly in 1833, Moxon married Emma Isola, the orphan adopted by Charles and Mary Lamb, in the same year. William Wordsworth entrusted him with the publication of his works from 1835 onwards, and in 1839 he issued the first complete edition of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poems.
Some passages in Shelley's Queen Mab resulted in a charge of blasphemy being made against Moxon in 1841. The case was tried before Lord Denman. Serjeant Talfourd defended Moxon, but the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the offensive passages were expunged. Moxon continued to publish: in 1840 he published Robert Browning's Sordello, and in succeeding years works by Richard Monckton Milnes, Tom Hood, Barry Cornwall, Lord Lytton, Browning and Alfred Tennyson appeared. Both Tennyson and Wordsworth were to become personal friends of Moxon.
On Moxon's death, his business was continued by the printer Frederick Evans and later James Bertrand Payne, with input from Moxon's widow Emma and his son Arthur. In 1865 the firm published Algernon Charles Swinburne's Atalanta in Calydon; in 1871 it was taken over by Ward, Lock & Tyler.

In computing, binary translation (or (binary) recompilation) is the emulation of one instruction set by another through translation of binary code. Sequences of instructions are translated from the source to the target instruction set. In some cases such as instruction set simulation, the target instruction set may be the same as the source instruction set, providing testing and debugging features such as instruction trace, conditional breakpoints and hot spot detection.
The two main types are static and dynamic binary translation.  Translation can be done in hardware (for example, by circuits in a CPU) or in software (e.g. run-time engines, statical recompiler, emulators).

The Ontario Hockey League (OHL) is one of the three Major Junior ice hockey leagues which constitute the Canadian Hockey League. The league is for players aged 15–20.
The OHL also operates under the Ontario Hockey Federation (OHF) of Hockey Canada.
The league was formed in 1974, out of the Major Junior A Tier I division of the Ontario Hockey Association. 
For the first four seasons of the league's existence (as the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League), Clarence "Tubby" Schmalz was the league's commissioner. Then, for one season (1978-79), former IHL commissioner Bill Beagan served as commissioner of the OMJHL. Beginning with the 1979-80 season, David Branch has been the Commissioner of the OHL (which became the league's official name prior to the 1981-82 season). Branch was appointed on August 11, 1979, and assumed the commissioner's role on September 17, 1979. Since 1980 the league has grown rapidly into a high profile marketable product, with many games broadcast on television and radio.
There are currently 20 teams in the OHL; 17 are based in the Canadian province of Ontario, two teams in the American state of Michigan and one team in the American state of Pennsylvania. Out of the 17 teams based in Ontario, 14 teams are in Southern Ontario, and 3 teams are in Northern Ontario.
The three largest arenas in the OHL are Ottawa's TD Place Arena, London's Budweiser Gardens, and the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium Complex in Kitchener.

The WHL is one of three leagues that constitute the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) as the highest level of junior hockey in Canada. Teams play for the Ed Chynoweth Cup, with the winner moving on to play for the Memorial Cup, Canada's national junior championship.
The league was founded in 1966 with seven western Canadian teams in Saskatchewan and Alberta. It was the brainchild of Bill Hunter, who intended to build a western league capable of competing with the top leagues in Ontario and Quebec. Originally considered an "outlaw league" by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, the WHL was sanctioned as the top junior league in Western Canada when junior hockey was reorganized in 1970. WHL teams have won the Memorial Cup 18 times since the league became eligible to compete for the trophy.
Today, the WHL comprises 22 teams, divided into two conferences of two divisions. The Eastern Conference comprises 12 teams from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, while the Western Conference comprises ten teams from British Columbia, and the US states of Washington and Oregon.

Few decrees are taken after advice from the Council of State ([tpl]lang-fr|Conseil d'État[/tpl]).
All prime ministers defend the programs of their ministry, and make budgetary choices. The extent to which those decisions lie with the Prime Minister or President depends upon whether they are of the same party.

[[Fly fishing]]
CATEGORIES: Fly fishing

Fly fishing is an angling method in which an artificial "fly" is used to catch fish. The fly is cast using a fly rod, reel, and specialized weighted line. Casting a nearly weightless fly or "lure" requires casting techniques significantly different from other forms of casting. Fly fishermen use hand tied flies that resemble natural invertebrates or other food organisms, or "lures" to provoke the fish to strike.
Fly fishing can be done in fresh or salt water. North Americans usually distinguish freshwater fishing between cold-water species (trout, salmon, steelhead) and warm-water species, notably bass. In Britain, where natural water temperatures vary less, the distinction is between game fishing for trout or salmon and coarse fishing for other species. Techniques for fly fishing differ with habitat (lakes and ponds, small streams, large rivers, bays and estuaries, and open ocean.)
Author Izaak Walton called fly fishing "The Contemplative Man's Recreation".

A Golden Bull or chrysobull was a golden ornament representing a seal (a bulla aurea or "golden seal" in Latin), attached to a decree issued by Byzantine Emperors and later by monarchs in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The term was originally coined for the golden seal itself but came to be applied to the entire decree. Such decrees were known as golden bulls in western Europe and chrysobullos logos, or chrysobulls, in the Byzantine Empire (χρυσός, chrysos, being Greek for gold).
For nearly eight hundred years, they were issued unilaterally, without obligations on the part of the other party or parties. However, this eventually proved disadvantageous as the Byzantines sought to restrain the efforts of foreign powers to undermine the empire. During the 12th century, the Byzantines began to insert into golden bulls sworn statements of the obligations of their negotiating partners.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]

[[Thyroidectomy]]
CATEGORIES: Surgical oncology, Surgical removal procedures, Thyroid disease, Endocrine surgery

A thyroidectomy is an operation that involves the surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland.  Surgeons often perform a thyroidectomy when a patient has thyroid cancer or some other condition of the thyroid gland (such as hyperthyroidism) or goiter.  Other indications for surgery include cosmetic (very enlarged thyroid), or symptomatic obstruction (causing difficulties in swallowing or breathing). Thyroidectomy is a common surgical procedure that has several potential complications or sequela including: temporary or permanent change in voice, temporary or permanently low calcium, need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement, bleeding, infection, and the remote possibility of airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis.  Complications are uncommon when the procedure is performed by an experienced surgeon.
The thyroid produces several hormones, such as thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and calcitonin. 
After the removal of a thyroid, patients usually take a prescribed oral synthetic thyroid hormone - levothyroxine (Synthroid) - to prevent hypothyroidism.
Less extreme variants of thyroidectomy include:
A "thyroidectomy" should not be confused with a "thyroidotomy" ("thyrotomy"), which is a cutting into (-otomy) the thyroid, not a removal (-ectomy) of it. A thyroidotomy can be performed to get access for a median laryngotomy, or to perform a biopsy. (Although technically a biopsy involves removing some tissue, it is more frequently categorized as an -otomy than an -ectomy because the volume of tissue removed is minuscule.)

The town was for many years the favourite of Charles Dickens, who lived nearby at Gads Hill Place, Higham, and who based many of his novels in the area. The Diocese of Rochester, the second oldest in England, is based at Rochester Cathedral, and was responsible for the founding of King's School in 604 AD, which is the second oldest school in the world. Rochester Castle, built by Gundulf of Rochester, has one of the best preserved keeps in England or France, and during the First Barons' War (1215–1217) in King John's reign, baronial forces captured the castle from Archbishop Stephen Langton and held it against the king, who then besieged it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.14818 |title=English Heritage Rochester Castle |publisher=English-heritage.org.uk |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010[/tpl]

Medway is a conurbation and unitary authority in South East England. The Unitary Authority was formed in 1998 when the City of Rochester-upon-Medway amalgamated with Gillingham Borough Council and part of Kent County Council to form Medway Council, a unitary authority independent of Kent County Council.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/leisure/localhistory/timeline/17909.htm |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090309021853/http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/leisure/localhistory/timeline/17909.htm |archivedate= 9 March 2009 |title=Medway Council – Local history: Medway in the 20th century 1901–2000  |work=web.archive.org |year=2009 |accessdate=9 June 2012[/tpl]
It is colloquially known as The Medway Towns. Over half of the unitary authority area is parished and rural in nature. Because of its strategic location by the major crossing of the River Medway, it has made a wide and historically significant contribution to Kent, and to England, dating back thousands of years, as evident in the siting of Watling Street by the Romans and by the Norman Rochester Castle, Rochester Cathedral (the second oldest in Britain), and the Chatham naval dockyard and its associated defences.
The main towns in the conurbation are (from west to east in terms of geographical position): Strood, Rochester, Chatham, Gillingham, and Rainham. Many smaller towns and villages such as Frindsbury, Brompton, Walderslade, Luton, Wigmore etc., lie within the conurbation. Outside the urban area, the villages retain parish councils. Cuxton, Halling and Wouldham are in the Medway Gap region to the south of Rochester and Strood. Hoo St Werburgh, Cliffe, High Halstow, St Mary Hoo, Allhallows, Stoke and Grain are on the Hoo Peninsula to the north. Frindsbury Extra including Upnor borders Strood.
Medway includes parts of the North Kent Marshes, an environmentally significant wetlands region with several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). Other similar areas of conservation include Ranscombe Farm on chalk grassland and woodland between Strood and Cuxton, with rare woodland flowers and orchids.
Medway is one of the boroughs included in the Thames Gateway development scheme. It is also the home of Universities at Medway, a tri-partite collaboration of the University of Greenwich, the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University on a single campus in Chatham.

William Lewis Sharkey (July 12, 1798– March 30, 1873) was an American judge of Scotch Irish extraction and politician from Mississippi.
He was born in Sumner County, Tennessee, where he and his family lived until they moved to Warren County, Mississippi, when he was six years of age.  In 1822, he was accepted into the bar at Natchez.  Three years later he moved to Vicksburg and after a few years was elected for a single term to the state House of Representatives (1828–1829).  He served briefly in 1832 as a circuit court judge before being elected a justice to the state supreme court later that year where he remained for 18 years until his resignation. Sharkey was appointed to the office of Secretary of War by U.S. President Millard Fillmore in 1851, but declined. 
He was a member of the Whig Party and was strongly opposed to the secession of Mississippi in 1861.  Throughout the American Civil War he remained a staunch Unionist and, according to one source, was "tolerated by his Confederate neighbors only because of his towering reputation as a jurist."  Governor Charles Clark appointed him in 1865 as a commissioner (along with William Yeager) to confer on behalf of the state with President Andrew Johnson. On June 13, 1865, Johnson appointed Sharkey to be provisional governor,Presidential Proclamation No. 39, 13 June 1865, [tpl]USStat|13|761[/tpl], 762 leaving office with the election of Benjamin G. Humphreys in October.  He was elected Senator in 1865 but was denied his seat by the United States Congress. Sharkey died in Washington, D.C. in 1873.  He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.
Sharkey County, Mississippi is named after him.

Bon Homme Richard was commissioned in November 1944, and served in the final campaigns of the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning one battle star. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA). In her second career she operated exclusively in the Pacific, playing a prominent role  in the Korean War, for which she earned five battle stars, and the Vietnam War.

[[Obligation]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy of law, Concepts in ethics, Philosophy of life

An obligation is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether legal or moral.  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of etiquette, social obligations, and possibly in terms of politics, where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally legal obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a tradition or for social reasons.  Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.Old Bear, Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are". Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit isn't blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.
The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

[[Custom (law)]]

CATEGORIES: Customary legal systems, International law, Sources of law, Tort law, Social agreement

Custom in law is the established pattern of behavior that can be objectively verified within a particular social setting. A claim can be carried out in defense of "what has always been done and accepted by law." Related is the idea of prescription; a right enjoyed through long custom rather than positive law.
Customary law (also, consuetudinary or unofficial law) exists where:  
Most customary laws deal with standards of community that have been long-established in a given locale. However the term can also apply to areas of international law where certain standards have been nearly universal in their acceptance as correct bases of action - in example, laws against piracy or slavery (see hostis humani generis). In many, though not all instances, customary laws will have supportive court rulings and case law that has evolved over time to give additional weight to their rule as law and also to demonstrate the trajectory of evolution (if any) in the interpretation of such law by relevant courts.

[[Ubykh phonology]]
CATEGORIES: Language phonologies

Ubykh, a recently extinct Northwest Caucasian language, has the largest consonant inventory of all documented languages that do not use clicks, and also has the most disproportional ratio of phonemic consonants to vowels. It has consonants in at least eight, perhaps nine, basic places of articulation and 29 distinct fricatives, 27 sibilants, and 20 uvulars, more than any other documented language. Some Khoisan languages, such as [tpl]Unicode|ǃXóõ[/tpl], may have larger consonant inventories due to their extensive use of click consonants, although some analyses (see for instance Traill (1985)) view a large proportion of the clicks in these languages as clusters, which would bring them closer into line with the Caucasian languages.

Ribot (February 27, 1952 - April 28, 1972) was a British-bred Italian-trained Thoroughbred racehorse who is considered by many to be one of the greatest horses of all time. Undefeated in sixteen races, he won over all distances, from 5 furlongs (1,000m) to 1m 7f (3,000m) in three countries and on all types of track conditions. He was the best Italian two-year-old of 1954, when his three wins included the Gran Criterium. He won his first four races of 1955 in Italy before being sent to France where he won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In the following year he was even better, recording wide-margin victories in both the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.
Ribot was then retired to stud where he proved to be a highly successful breeding stallion. The performances of Ribot's progeny saw him become the leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland on three occasions (1963, 1967, 1968).

[[Delegation]]

CATEGORIES: Management

Delegation is the assignment of responsibility or authority to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. It is one of the core concepts of management leadership. However, the person who delegated the work remains accountable for the outcome of the delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions, i.e. it is a shift of decision-making authority from one organizational level to a lower one.  Delegation, if properly done, is not abdication. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a manager provides too much input, direction, and review of delegated work. In general, delegation is good and can save money and time, help in building skills, and motivate people. Poor delegation, on the other hand, might cause frustration and confusion to all the involved parties.12 Rules of Delegation - Retrieved December 17, 2009 Some agents however do not favour a delegation and consider the power of making a decision rather burdensome.Angst, Lukas and Karol J.

Greyhound was a grey Standardbred gelding by Guy Abbey out of Elizabeth by Peter the Great. Born in 1932, Greyhound was the outstanding trotting horse of his day and arguably the most outstanding in the history of the sport. He was nicknamed "The Great Grey Ghost" and "Silver-skinned Flyer."
In 1935, he won the Hambletonian race and in 1938 he lowered the record time for trotting the mile to 1:55¼. This record stood until 1969. He trotted 25 two-minute miles and at one time held fourteen world records. He once raced in double harness, hitched to the great trotting mare Rosalind.  He was retired in 1940 to Red Gate Farm in St. Charles, Illinois. During his twenty years of retirement, Greyhound was immensely popular among horse enthusiasts around the country. As he aged, his coat whitened, and his owners painted his hooves red and draped garlands of roses over his back, a color combination that became iconic of the horse. Greyhound was so popular that his owner, Col. Edward J. Baker, allowed visitors to see the horse until February 1965 when he died at the age of 33.
Greyhound was honored as Horse of the Century after his death.

[[Abuse of process]]

CATEGORIES: Abuse of the legal system, Tort law, Common law, Legal terms, Abuse

Abuse of process is a cause of action in tort arising from one party making a malicious and deliberate misuse or perversion of regularly issued court process (civil or criminal) not justified by the underlying legal action.
It is a common law intentional tort. It is to be distinguished from malicious prosecution, another type of tort that involves misuse of the public right of access to the courts.
The elements of a valid cause of action for abuse of process in most common law jurisdictions are as follows: (1) the existence of an ulterior purpose or motive underlying the use of process, and (2) some act in the use of the legal process not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceedings.Cartwright v. Wexler, Wexler & Heller, Ltd., 369 N.E.2d 185, 187 (Ill. App. Ct. 1977). Abuse of process can be distinguished from malicious prosecution, in that abuse of process typically does not require proof of malice, lack of probable cause in procuring issuance of the process, or a termination favorable to the plaintiff, all of which are essential to a claim of malicious prosecution.See, e.g., Liquid Carbonic Acid Mfg. Co. v. Convert, 82 Ill. App. 39, 44 (Ill. App. Ct. 1899).   "Process," as used in this context, includes not only the "service of process," i.e. an official summons or other notice issued from a court, but means any method used to acquire jurisdiction over a person or specific property that is issued under the official seal of a court.Arora v. Chui, 664 N.E.2d 1101 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996). Typically, the person who abuses process is interested only in accomplishing some improper purpose that is collateral to the proper object of the process and that offends justice, such as an unjustified arrest or an unfounded criminal prosecution. Subpoenas to testify, attachments of property, executions on property, garnishments, and other provisional remedies are among the types of "process" considered to be capable of abuse.

[[Malicious prosecution]]

CATEGORIES: Legal terms, Abuse of the legal system, Abuse, Tort law

Malicious prosecution is a common law intentional tort, while like the tort of abuse of process,  its elements include (1) intentionally (and maliciously) instituting and pursuing (or causing to be instituted or pursued) a legal action (civil or criminal) that is (2) brought without probable cause and (3) dismissed in favor of the victim of the malicious prosecution.  In some jurisdictions, the term "malicious prosecution" denotes the wrongful initiation of criminal proceedings, while the term "malicious use of process" denotes the wrongful initiation of civil proceedings.
Criminal prosecuting attorneys and judges are protected from tort liability for malicious prosecution by doctrines of prosecutorial immunity and judicial immunity. Moreover, the mere filing of a complaint cannot constitute an abuse of process. The parties who have abused or misused the process, have gone beyond merely filing a lawsuit. The taking of an appeal, even a frivolous one, is not enough to constitute an abuse of process. The mere filing or maintenance of a lawsuit, even for an improper purpose, is not a proper basis for an abuse of process action.
Declining to expand the tort of malicious prosecution, a unanimous California Supreme Court in the case of Sheldon Appel Co. v. Albert & Oliker, 47 Cal. 3d 863, 873 (1989) observed: "While the filing of frivolous lawsuits is certainly improper and cannot in any way be condoned, in our view the better means of addressing the problem of unjustified litigation is through the adoption of measures facilitating the speedy resolution of the initial lawsuit and authorizing the imposition of sanctions for frivolous or delaying conduct within that first action itself, rather than through an expansion of the opportunities for initiating one or more additional rounds of malicious prosecution litigation after the first action has been concluded." Per the case of Lossing v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal. App. 3d 635, 638-640Cal. Rptr. 18; see also Tellefsen v. Key System Transit Lines, supra, 198 Cal.App.2d at p. 615 of Appeal has remedies for frivolous appeals; Green v. Uccelli (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1112, 1122-1123 Cal.Rptr. 315

[tpl]intellectual property[/tpl] [tpl]Refimprove|date=December 2012[/tpl]
A trademark is a word, phrase, or logo that identifies the source of goods or services. Trademark law protects a business' commercial identity or brand by discouraging other businesses from adopting a name or logo that is "confusingly similar" to an existing trademark. The goal is to allow consumers to easily identify the producers of goods and services and avoid confusion.  
U.S. Trademark Law is mainly governed by the Lanham Act. "Common Law" trademark rights are acquired automatically when a business uses a name or logo in commerce, and are enforceable in state courts. Marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are given a higher degree of protection in federal courts than unregistered marks - both registered and unregistered trademarks are granted some degree of federal protection under the Lanham Act 43(a).

The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights, fought on August 27, 1776, was a defeat for the Continental Army under General George Washington and the beginning of a successful campaign that gave the British control of the strategically important city of New York. In the American Revolutionary War it was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared independence on July 4, 1776. In terms of troop size, it was the largest battle of the entire war.
After defeating the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, General George Washington, Commander-in-Chief, brought the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign. There he established defenses and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British, under the command of General William Howe, landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated of Staten Island, where during the next month and a half they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. With the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at The Narrows, Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city. Believing Manhattan would be the first target, he moved there the bulk of his forces.
On August 22, the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across The Narrows from Staten Island, more than a dozen miles south from the East River crossings to Manhattan. After five days of waiting, the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented most of the army from being captured. The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege but, on the night of August 29–30, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life. Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.

William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe, KB, PC (10 August 1729 – 12 July 1814) was a British army officer who rose to become Commander-in-Chief of British forces during the American War of Independence. Howe was one of three brothers who enjoyed distinguished military careers.
Having joined the army in 1746 Howe saw extensive service in the War of the Austrian Succession and Seven Years' War. He became known for his role in the capture of Quebec in 1759 when he led a British force to capture the cliffs at Anse-au-Foulon, allowing James Wolfe to land his army and engage the French, in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Howe also participated in the campaigns to take Louisbourg, Belle Île and Havana.
Howe was sent to North America in March 1775, arriving in May after the Revolutionary War broke out.  After leading British troops to a costly victory in the Battle of Bunker Hill, Howe took command of all British forces in America from Thomas Gage in September of that year.  Howe's record in North America was marked by the successful capture of both New York City and Philadelphia.  However, poor British campaign planning for 1777 contributed to the failure of John Burgoyne's Saratoga campaign, which played a major role in the entry of France into the war. Howe's role in developing those plans, and the degree to which he was responsible for British failures that year (despite his personal success at Philadelphia) have been a subject of contemporary and historic debate.
He resigned his post as Commander in Chief, North America, in 1778, and returned to England, where he was at times active in the defence of the British Isles.  He served for many years in Parliament, and was knighted after his successes in 1776.  He inherited the Viscountcy of Howe upon the death of his brother Richard in 1799.  He married, but had no children, and the viscountcy was extinguished with his death in 1814.

The Battle of Princeton (January  3, 1777) was a battle in which General George Washington's revolutionary forces defeated British forces near Princeton, New Jersey.
On the night of January 2, 1777 George Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, repulsed a British attack at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek in Trenton. That night, he evacuated his position, circled around General Lord Cornwallis' army, and went to attack the British garrison at Princeton. Brigadier General Hugh Mercer of the Continental Army, clashed with two regiments under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood of the British Army. Mercer and his troops were overrun and Washington sent some militia under Brigadier General John Cadwalader to help him. The militia, on seeing the flight of Mercer's men, also began to flee. Washington rode up with reinforcements and rallied the fleeing militia. He then led the attack on Mawhood's troops, driving them back. Mawhood gave the order to retreat and most of the troops tried to flee to Cornwallis in Trenton.
In Princeton itself, Brigadier General John Sullivan encouraged some British troops who had taken refuge in Nassau Hall to surrender, ending the battle.  After the battle, Washington moved his army to Morristown, and with their third defeat in 10 days, the British evacuated southern New Jersey. With the victory at Princeton, morale rose in the ranks and more men began to enlist in the army. The battle (while considered minor by British standards)[tpl]cite web|url=http://totallyhistory.com/battle-of-princeton/ |title=Battle of Princeton (Jan. 3, 1777) Summary & Facts |publisher=Totallyhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21[/tpl]http://www.xtimeline.com/evt/view.aspx?id=60370 was the last major action of Washington's winter New Jersey campaign.

Isauria ([tpl]IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|z|ɔr|i|ə[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|s|ɔr|i|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Ἰσαυρία[/tpl]), in ancient geography, is a rugged isolated district in the interior of South Asia Minor, of very different extent at different periods, but generally covering what is now the district of Bozkır and its surroundings in the Konya province of Turkey, or the core of the Taurus Mountains. In its coastal extension it bordered on Cilicia. It derives its name from the contentious Isaurian tribe (probably Luwian) and twin settlements Isaura Palaea (Ίσαυρα Παλαιά, Latin: Isaura Vetus, "Old Isaura") and Isaura Nea (Ίσαυρα Νέα, Latin: Isaura Nova, "New Isaura"). Isaurian marauders were fiercely independent mountain people who created havoc in neighboring districts under Macedonian and Roman occupations.
The permanent nucleus of Isauria was north of the Taurus range which lies directly to south of Iconium and Lystra. Lycaonia had all the Iconian plain; but Isauria began as soon as the foothills were reached. Its two original towns, Isaura Nea and Isaura Palaea, lay, one among these foothills (Doria) and the other on the watershed (Zengibar Kalesi).
In the 4th century BC, Isauria began as it would end, and became the wild district about Isaura Palaea and the heads of the Calycadnus. When the capital, Isaura (also known as Isaura Vetus or Isaura Palaea), a strongly fortified city at the foot of Mt. Taurus, was besieged by Perdiccas, the Macedonian regent after Alexander the Great's death, the Isaurians set the place alight and let it perish in flames rather than submit to capture.

[tpl]About||railroad artillery|Railway gun|other uses|Rail-gun[tpl]![/tpl]Rail-gun (disambiguation)[/tpl]
A railgun is an electrically powered electromagnetic projectile launcher based on similar principles to the homopolar motor. A railgun comprises a pair of parallel conducting rails, along which a sliding armature is accelerated by the electromagnetic effects of a current that flows down one rail, into the armature and then back along the other rail.C. S. Rashleigh and R. A. Marshall, Electromagnetic Acceleration of Macroparticles to High Velocities, J. Appl. Phys. 49(4), April 1978.
Railguns have long existed as experimental technology but the mass, size and cost of the required power supplies have prevented railguns from becoming practical military weapons. However, in recent years, significant efforts have been made towards their development as feasible military technology. For example, in the late 2000s, the U.S. Navy tested a railgun that accelerates a 3.2 kg (7 pound) projectile to hypersonic velocities of approximately [tpl]convert|2.4|km/s|mph[/tpl], about [tpl]convert|2.4|km/s|Mach|disp=output only|sigfig=1[/tpl].[tpl]Cite news |work=Technology Review |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/20164/?nlid=857 |title=Electromagnetic Railgun Blasts Off |date=February 6, 2008 |author=Brendan Borrell[/tpl] They gave the project the Latin motto "Velocitas Eradico", Latin for "I, am speed, eradicate".
In addition to military applications, railguns have been proposed to launch spacecraft into orbit; however, unless the launching track was particularly long, and the acceleration required spread over a much longer time, such launches would necessarily be restricted to unmanned spacecraft.

"Angel of Death" is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer's 1986 album Reign in Blood. The lyrics and music were written by Slayer guitarist, Jeff Hanneman and are based on Nazi physician Josef Mengele, who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. "Angel of Death" led to the band facing accusations of Nazi sympathizing and racism throughout their career.
Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood, "Angel of Death" is featured on all of Slayer's live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies. The song was well received by critics; Steve Huey of Allmusic described it as a "classic."

Derek Sanderson Jeter ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|t|ər[/tpl]; born June 26, 1974) is an American baseball shortstop who has played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. A five-time World Series champion, Jeter is regarded as a central figure of the Yankees during their success of the late 1990s and early 2000s due to his hitting ability, baserunning, fielding, and leadership. He is the Yankees' all-time career leader in hits (3,337), games played (2,621), stolen bases (348), and at bats (10,686). His accolades include thirteen All-Star selections, five Gold Glove Awards, five Silver Slugger Awards, two Hank Aaron Awards, and a Roberto Clemente Award. Jeter is the all-time MLB leader in hits by a shortstop, and the 28th player to reach 3,000 hits.
The Yankees drafted Jeter out of high school in 1992, and he debuted in the major leagues in 1995.

The Pact of Steel ([tpl]lang-de|Stahlpakt[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-it|Patto d'Acciaio[/tpl]), known formally  as the Pact of Friendship and Alliance between Germany and Italy, was originally intended to be a tripartite military alliance between Japan, Italy, and Germany. However, Japan wanted the focus of the pact to be aimed at the potential adversary Russia, while Italy and Germany wanted it aimed at Britain and France.Goldman p. 155  Due to this disagreement, the pact was signed without Japan and became an agreement between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany signed on May 22, 1939, by the foreign ministers of each country and witnessed by Count Galeazzo Ciano for Italy and Joachim von Ribbentrop for Germany.
The Pact consisted of two parts: the first section was an open declaration of continuing trust and cooperation between Germany and Italy while the second, a "Secret Supplementary Protocol"A translation of the text of the Pact of Steel attributed to Office of United States Chief of Counsel for Prosecution of Axis Criminality, Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, 8 vols. and 2 suppl. vols.

[tpl]For|the Welsh privateer|William Salesbury (of Rhug) [/tpl]William Salesbury also Salusbury (c. 1520 – c. 1584) was the leading Welsh scholar of the Renaissance and the principal translator of the 1567 Welsh New Testament.
Salesbury was born in about 1520 in the parish of Llansannan, Conwy.  He was educated at Oxford University, where he studied the Hebrew, Greek and Latin languages, and also became familiar with the (banned) writings of Martin Luther and William Tyndale as well as the technology of printing.
In 1547, Salesbury produced an English-Welsh dictionary called A dictionary in Englyshe and Welshe, and in 1550 his A briefe and a playne introduction, teachyng how to pronounce the letters in the British tong (now commenly called Walsh)... was printed by Robert Crowley. A revised edition was printed "by Henry Denham for Humfrey Toy, dwellyng at the sygne of the Helmet in Paules church yarde, The. xvij. of May. 1567." Both of these books have become important sources for information about the spoken English of the sixteenth century.
Salesbury also published books in Welsh at the same time. In 1547 he published a collection of Welsh proverbs made by Gruffudd Hiraethog (d. 1564), Oll synnwyr pen Kembero ygyd. 
In 1550, he published Ban wedy i dynny air yngair allan o hen gyfreith Howel da vap Cadell brenhin Kymbry ynghylch chwechant mlynedd aeth heibio wrth yr hwn van y gellir deall bot yr offeiriait y pryd hynny yn priodi gwragedd yn ddichwith ac yn kyttal ac wynt in gyfreithlawn. A certaine case extracted out of the auncient law of Hoel da, kyng of Wales in the yere of oure Lorde, nyne hundred and fourtene passed: whereby it maye gathered that priestes had lawfully married wyues at that tyme. This book, printed by Robert Crowley, was in Welsh and English; as the title indicates, it was an attempt to justify Protestant doctrine in favour of a clerical marriage to the Welsh and English by establishing precedent for it in the "auncient law" of a Welsh king. (It was no doubt significant that the present royal family, the Tudors, had Welsh origins.) Also in 1550, a polemical text appeared under Crowley's imprint stating that it was "compiled" by Salesbury: The baterie of the Popes Botereulx, commonly called the high altare. A third Salesbury book with Crowley's imprint in 1551 is a translation of the epistle and gospel readings from the 1549 Book of Common Prayer: Kynniuer llith a ban or yscrythur lan ac a d’arlleir yr eccleis pryd commun, y sulieu a’r gwilieu trwy’r vlwyd’yn: o Cambereiciat.
As a convinced Protestant, Salesbury was obliged to spend most of the reign of Mary I, 1553–1558, in hiding. As a consequence his writing and publishing came to a stop.
The belief of Erasmus and Luther that the Bible should be available to all in their native language was firmly advocated by Salesbury. With the succession of Elizabeth I, Salesbury went to work on this project. In 1563, he helped instigate an act of parliament under which the translation of the Bible became a priority for the bishops of Wales and Hereford. Quite possibly a confederate in this project, Robert Crowley, Salesbury's former printer, was at this time a Canon of Hereford, having been instituted to the stall or prebend of "Pratum majus" in the cathedral of Hereford c. 1560-63.
Salesbury worked with Richard Davies (Bishop of St. David's) and Thomas Huet (Precentor of St David's) to prepare a translation of the New Testament from the original Greek into Welsh. This was published on 7 October 1567. He also translated the English Book of Common Prayer into Welsh, which was also published in 1567 as Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin), both were published by Humphrey Toy.

[[Eärnil II]]
CATEGORIES: Rulers of Gondor

Eärnil II is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's universe of Middle-earth. He was born in T.A. 1883. In 1945 Third Age he was elected as the thirty-second King of Gondor after his predecessor, King Ondoher, was slain in battle. In the previous year a two-pronged attack had been launched upon Gondor by the Haradrim and the Wainriders. In response, King Ondoher led the main army north to counter the Easterling invasion at Dagorlad and was defeated. Eärnil was commander of Gondor's southern army and guarded Pelargir.
Eärnil led his army to the Crossings of the Poros where he won an astounding victory over the Haradrim. This enabled him to turn his attention to the invading Wainriders.
The Wainriders, certain of victory, were celebrating their success before they would enter Minas Anor. They were unaware of Eärnil's victory in the south and were taken by surprise when Eärnil suddenly attacked them. As a result Eärnil won the Battle of the Camp.
After the threat was eliminated, Gondor's attention shifted towards the royal succession, overseen by Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor, for King Ondoher along with his two sons were slain at Dagorlad. Both Eärnil and Prince Arvedui of Arthedain (successor state of Arnor) claimed the throne. Arvedui based his claim on his direct descent from Isildur (second High King of Arnor and Gondor and uncle to Meneldil, the first King of Gondor after the joint rule of Isildur and Anárion), and as the husband of Fíriel, only surviving child of King Ondoher. Pelendur rebuffed him, claiming that "The crown and royalty of Gondor belongs solely to the heirs of Meneldil, son of Anárion, to whom Isildur relinquished this realm. In Gondor this heritage is reckoned through the sons only; and we have not heard that the law is otherwise in Arnor".Tolkien, JRR. The Lord of the Rings (Collector’s Edition). Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., c.1987. p. 329-30
Eärnil was elected king for his deeds, heritage, and because of the Steward's influence.  However, he was still of the royal house since he was a direct male-line descendant of King Telumehtar Umbardacil. Eärnil's father was Siriondil, son of Calimmacil, son of Arciryas, son of Telumehtar. He reigned as Eärnil II.
Aside from being a gifted general Eärnil also was a wise ruler and sought the friendship of the weaker kingdom of Arnor. He sent messages to Arvedui (now king) announcing that he had received the crown of Gondor, according to the laws and the needs of the South-kingdom, "but I do not forget the royalty of Arnor, nor deny our kinship, nor wish that the realms of Elendil be estranged. I will send to your aid when you have need, so far as I am able".Tolkien, JRR. The Lord of the Rings (Collector’s Edition). Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., c.1987. p. 330
Nonetheless, Eärnil II was chiefly concerned with the reorganization of Gondor after their heavy losses suffered against the Wainriders. And at last in the autumn of 1973 Third Age, messages came to Gondor that Arthedain was in great trouble, and that the Witch-king of Angmar was preparing a final stroke against it. Then Eärnil sent his son Eärnur north with a fleet, as swiftly as he could, and with as great a strength as he could spare to aid Arvedui. Eärnur arrived too late to save Arthedain. Arvedui had been defeated and fled north, later to drown in the Ice Bay of Forochel despite the attempt by Círdan's mariners to rescue him from exile. However, Eärnur annihilated the witch-kingdom of Angmar in the Battle of Fornost with the help of Círdan Lord of Lindon and Glorfindel with an army from Rivendell. Thereafter Eärnur earned the hatred of the Witch-king.
Despite his military prowess, Eärnil was not able to withstand the takeover of Minas Ithil by the Ringwraiths, who besieged the city from 2000 to 2002. After that defeat, Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard) and Minas Ithil was called Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery).
Eärnil died in 2043 Third Age and was succeeded by his son Eärnur, who was as good a general as his father but lacked his wisdom, and who would be the last king before Aragorn reclaimed his throne after a long gap.Tolkien, JRR. The Lord of the Rings (Collector’s Edition). Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., c.1987. p. 329-31

BeppoSAX was an Italian–Dutch satellite for X-ray astronomy which played a crucial role in resolving the origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the most energetic events known in the universe. It was the first X-ray mission capable of simultaneously observing targets over more than 3 decades of energy, from 0.1 to 300 kiloelectronvolts (keV) with relatively large area, good (for the time) energy resolution and imaging capabilities (with a spatial resolution of 1 arc minute between 0.1 and 10 keV). BeppoSAX was a major programme of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) with the participation of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes (NIVR). The prime contractor for the space segment was Alenia while Nuova Telespazio led the development of the ground segment. Most of the scientific instruments were developed by the Italian National Research Council (CNR) while the Wide Field Cameras were developed by the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON) and the LECS was developed by the astrophysics division of the European Space Agency's ESTEC facility.
BeppoSAX was named in honour of the Italian physicist Giuseppe "Beppo" Occhialini. SAX stands for "Satellite per Astronomia a raggi X" or "Satellite for X-ray Astronomy".
X-ray observations cannot be performed from ground-based telescopes, since Earth's atmosphere blocks most of the incoming radiation.
One of BeppoSAX's main achievements was the identification of numerous gamma ray bursts with extra-galactic objects. (See the linked article for details.)

[[Capillary action]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid dynamics, Hydrology

Capillary action (sometimes capillarity, capillary motion, or wicking) is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in opposition to, external forces like gravity.  The effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the hairs of a paint-brush, in a thin tube, in porous materials such as paper, in some non-porous materials such as liquified carbon fiber, or in a cell. It occurs because of intermolecular forces between the liquid and surrounding solid surfaces. If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small, then the combination of surface tension (which is caused by cohesion within the liquid) and adhesive forces between the liquid and container act to lift the liquid. In short, the capillary action is due to the pressure of cohesion and adhesion which cause the liquid to work against gravity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1182/Capillary-Action.html |title=Capillary Action – Liquid, Water, Force, and Surface – JRank Articles|publisher=Science.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Apodidae, Swifts

The swifts are a family, Apodidae,  of highly aerial birds. They are superficially similar to swallows, but are not closely related to passerine species. Swifts are placed in the order Apodiformes, which they share with hummingbirds. The treeswifts are closely related to the true swifts, but form a separate family, the Hemiprocnidae.
Resemblances between swifts and swallows are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar life styles based on catching insects in flight.
The family name, Apodidae, is derived from the Greek απους, apous, meaning "without feet", a reference to the small, weak legs of these most aerial of birds.Jobling (2010) pp. 50–51.Kaufman (2001) p. 329. The tradition of depicting swifts without feet continued into the Middle Ages, as seen in the heraldic martlet.
Some species of swifts are among the fastest animals on the planet, with some of the fastest measured flight speeds of any bird.

The film was later referenced in connection with Reagan in the 1986 Ramones song "My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)", in the 1986 Dead Kennedys album "Bedtime for Democracy" and in a track on a 1984 Jerry Harrison record, sampling Reagan and credited to "Bonzo Goes to Washington". A song unflattering to Reagan entitled "Bad Time for Bonzo" is featured on The Damned's fourth studio album, Strawberries. It was also referenced in a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/12/03 |title=Calvin and Hobbes Comic Strip, December 03, 1986 on |publisher=Gocomics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06[/tpl] "Bloom County" comic strip (October 11, 1981), as well as in the Strontium Dog comic story "Bitch", published in 2000AD (comic), which featured President Ronald Reagan being kidnapped out of his own era and taken into the far flung future setting of the comic.

[[Power supply]]

CATEGORIES: Power supplies

A power supply is a device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The term is most commonly applied to electric power converters that convert one form of electrical energy to another, though it may also refer to devices that convert another form of energy (mechanical, chemical, solar) to electrical energy. A regulated power supply is one that controls the output voltage or current to a specific value; the controlled value is held nearly constant despite variations in either load current or the voltage supplied by the power supply's energy source.
Every power supply must obtain the energy it supplies to its load, as well as any energy it consumes while performing that task, from an energy source. Depending on its design, a power supply may obtain energy from:
A power supply may be implemented as a discrete, stand-alone device or as an integral device that is hardwired to its load. Examples of the latter case include the low voltage DC power supplies that are part of desktop computers and consumer electronics devices.
Commonly specified power supply attributes include:

[[USS America (1782)]]

CATEGORIES: Ships of the Continental Navy, Ships of the line of the United States Navy, Ships built in Maine, 1782 ships

America was the first ship of the line built for the Continental Navy, but she never saw service there, being given to France after launching.
On 9 November 1776, the Continental Congress authorized the construction of three 74-gun ships of the line. One of these was America, laid down in May 1777 in the shipyard of John Langdon on Rising Castle Island (now Badger's Island) in Kittery, Maine, across the Piscataqua River from Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
However, progress on her construction was delayed by a chronic scarcity of funds and a consequent shortage of skilled craftsmen and well seasoned timber. The project dragged on for over two years under the immediate supervision of Col. James Hackett as master shipbuilder and the overall direction of John Langdon. Then, on 6 November 1779, the Marine Committee named Captain John Barry as her prospective commanding officer and ordered him to "...hasten, as much as will be in your power, the completing of that ship...."
Nevertheless, the difficulties which previously had slowed the building of the warship continued to prevail during the ensuing months, and little had been accomplished by mid-March 1780 when Barry applied for a leave of absence to begin on the 23rd. However he did perform one notable service for the ship. In November 1777, after inspecting the unfinished vessel which was slated to become his new command, he strongly recommended against a proposal, then under consideration, to reduce her to a 54-gun frigate. His arguments carried the day, and the Marine Committee decided to continue the work of construction according to the ship's original plans.
All possibility of Barry's commanding America ended on 5 September 1780 when he was ordered to Boston to take command of the 36-gun frigate Alliance which had recently arrived from Europe. Over nine months later, on 23 June 1781, Congress ordered the Continental Agent of Marine, Robert Morris, to get America ready for sea and, on the 26th, picked Captain John Paul Jones as her commanding officer. Jones reached Portsmouth on 31 August and threw himself into the task of completing the man-of-war. However, before the work was finished, Congress decided on 3 September 1782 to present the ship to King Louis XVI of France to replace the ship of the line Magnifique, which had run aground and been destroyed on 11 August 1782 while attempting to enter Boston Harbor. The ship was also to symbolize the new nation's appreciation for France's service to and sacrifices in behalf of the cause of the American patriots.
Despite his disappointment over losing his chance to command the largest warship yet built in America, Jones remained in Portsmouth striving to finish the new ship. The home in which he boarded is now known as the John Paul Jones House and is a National Historic Landmark. His labors bore fruit on 5 November 1782 when America – held partially back by a series of ropes calculated to break in sequence to check the vessel's acceleration, lest she come to grief on the opposite bank of the river – slipped gracefully into the waters of the Piscataqua. After she had been rigged and fitted out, the ship – commanded by M. le Chevalier de Macarty Martinge (who had commanded Magnifique when she was wrecked) departed Portsmouth on 24 June 1783 and reached Brest, France, on 16 July. Armed with a main battery of 18 pounder at a time when French 74's carried 24-pdr and 36-pdr guns, America would have a relatively weak broadside compared to other French ships-of-the-line.
Little is known of her subsequent service under the French flag other than the fact it was brief. A bit over three years later, she was carefully examined by a survey committee which found her damaged by dry rot beyond economical repair, probably caused by her wartime construction from green timber. She was accordingly scrapped and a much larger America with nearly twice her weight of shot was built to take her place.

Richard John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan (born 18 December 1934), popularly known as Lord Lucan, a British peer and suspected murderer, disappeared without trace early on 8 November 1974.  He was born into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family in Marylebone, the elder son of The 6th Earl of Lucan and his wife, Kaitlin Elizabeth Anne Dawson.  Evacuated during the Second World War, he returned to study at Eton and from 1953 to 1955 served with the Coldstream Guards in West Germany.  Lord Lucan developed a taste for gambling and, skilled at backgammon and bridge, became an early member of the Clermont gaming club.  Although his losses often outweighed his winnings, he left his job at a London-based merchant bank and became a professional gambler. He was known as Lord Bingham from April 1949 until January 1964.
Once considered for the role of James Bond, Lucan was a charismatic man with expensive tastes; he raced power boats and drove an Aston Martin. In 1963 he married Veronica Duncan, who bore him three children.  When the marriage collapsed late in 1972, he moved out of the family home at 46 Lower Belgrave Street in London, to a property nearby.  A bitter custody battle ensued, which Lucan lost.  He began to spy on his wife and record their telephone conversations, apparently obsessed with regaining custody of the children.  This fixation, combined with his gambling losses, had a dramatic effect on his general demeanour and personal finances.
On the evening of 7 November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned to death in the basement of the Lucan family home.  Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later identified Lucan as her assailant.  As the police began their murder investigation he telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, Sussex.  Hours later, he left the property and was never seen again.  The Corsair was later found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene.  A warrant for his arrest was issued a few days later and in his absence, the inquest into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court was allowed to make such a determination.
Lucan's fate remains a fascinating mystery for the British public.  Hundreds of reports of his presence in various countries around the world have been made since Rivett's murder, although none have been substantiated.  Despite a police investigation and huge press interest, Lucan has not been found and is presumed dead.

Bodoni is a series of serif typefaces first designed by Giambattista Bodoni (1740–1813) in 1798. The typeface is classified as Didone modern. Bodoni followed the ideas of John Baskerville, as found in the printing type Baskerville: increased stroke contrast and a more vertical, slightly condensed, upper case; but took them to a more extreme conclusion. Bodoni had a long career and his designs evolved and varied, ending with a typeface of narrower underlying structure with flat, unbracketed serifs, extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, and an overall geometric construction. Though these later designs are rightfully called "modern", the earlier designs are "transitional".
Some digital versions of Bodoni are said to be hard to read due to "dazzle" caused by the alternating thick and thin strokes, particularly as the thin strokes are very thin at small point sizes. This only occurs when display versions are used at text sizes, and it is also true of much display type that is used at text sizes. Non-dazzling versions of Bodoni that are intended to be used at text size are "Bodoni Old Face", optimized for 9 points; ITC Bodoni 12 (for 12 points); and ITC Bodoni 6 (for 6 points).

The Ojibwe (also Ojibwa), Anishinaabe, or Chippewa are one of the largest groups of Native American and First Nations Peoples on the North American continent. There are Ojibwe communities in both Canada and the United States. In Canada, they are the second-largest population among First Nations, surpassed only by the Cree. In the United States, they have the fourth-largest population among Native American tribes, surpassed only by the Navajo, Cherokee and Lakota. 
Because many Ojibwe were formerly located around the outlet of Lake Superior, which the French colonists called Sault Ste. Marie, the early settlers referred to the Ojibwe as Saulteurs.  Ojibwe who subsequently moved to the prairie provinces of Canada have retained the name Saulteaux. Ojibwe who were originally located along the Mississagi River and made their way to southern Ontario are known as the Mississaugas.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/ethno/etb0170e.shtml |title=First Nations Culture Areas Index |work=the Canadian Museum of Civilization [/tpl]
The Ojibwe Peoples are a major component group of the Anishinaabe-speaking peoples, a branch of the Algonquian language family, which includes the Algonquin, Nipissing, Oji-Cree, Odawa and the Potawatomi.  The majority of the Ojibwe peoples live in Canada. There are 77,940 mainline Ojibwe; 76,760 Saulteaux and 8,770 Mississaugas, in 125 bands, stretching from western Quebec to eastern British Columbia. Ojibwe in the U.S. number over 56,440, living in an area stretching across the northern tier from Michigan west to Montana.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
They are historically known for their crafting of birch bark canoes, sacred birch bark scrolls, use of cowrie shells for trading, cultivation of wild rice, and use of copper arrow points. In 1745 they adopted guns from the British to defeat the Dakota in the Lake Superior area, pushing them to the south and west.
The Ojibwe Nation was the first to set the agenda with European-Canadian leaders by signing detailed treaties before they allowed many European settlers into their western areas. Their Midewiwin Society is well respected as the keeper of detailed and complex scrolls of events, oral history, songs, maps, memories, stories, geometry, and mathematics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/history/mncultures/anishinabe.html |title=Anishinabe |accessdate=2010-03-16 |work=eMuseum @ Minnesota State University |publisher=Minnesota State University.

[[Risk assessment]]
CATEGORIES: Evaluation, Impact assessment, Probability assessment, Risk factors, Risk management, Hazard analysis, Technology assessment, Safety engineering, Reliability engineering

Risk assessment is the determination of quantitative or qualitative value of risk related to a concrete situation and a recognized threat (also called hazard). Quantitative risk assessment requires calculations of two components of risk (R):, the magnitude of the potential loss (L), and the probability (p) that the loss will occur. Acceptable risk is a risk that is understood and tolerated usually because the cost or difficulty of implementing an effective countermeasure for the associated vulnerability exceeds the expectation of loss.RFC 4949
In all types of engineering of complex systems sophisticated risk assessments are often made within Safety engineering and Reliability engineering when it concerns threats to life, environment or machine functioning. The nuclear, aerospace, oil, rail and military industries have a long history of dealing with risk assessment. Also, medical, hospital, social service and food industries control risks and perform risk assessments on a continual basis. Methods for assessment of risk may differ between industries and whether it pertains to general financial decisions or environmental, ecological, or public health risk assessment.

Anton Paul Stadler (28 June 1753, Bruck an der Leitha – 15 June 1812, Vienna) was an Austrian clarinet and basset horn player for whom Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote both his Clarinet Quintet and Clarinet Concerto.
He was reputed to be able to produce a beautiful tone, with exceptional mastery of the low register of the basset clarinet and distinctive basset horn playing. A contemporaraneous Viennese critic, referring to Stadler, wrote, “I would not have thought that a clarinet could imitate the human voice so deceptively as you imitate it. Your instrument is so soft, so delicate in tone that no-one who has a heart can resist it."Johann Friedrich Schink, "Musikalische Akademie von Stadler", Litterarische Fragmente, (Graz 1785). A noted virtuoso, he played second clarinet to his younger brother Johann Nepomuk Stadler (1755–1804) in the Vienna Court Orchestra. It was possibly this specialism in second clarinet along with the basset horn that led to his collaboration with Theodor Lotz (1748–1792), a clarinet maker. His idea was to add an extension to his B-flat and A clarinets – in the same vein as the basset horn – an extra major third to a low C. It was for this extended clarinet (now known as the basset clarinet but initially called a bass clarinet in the days before the modern bass had been invented) that the Clarinet Concerto and possibly the Quintet for Clarinet and Strings were written. A concerto in D major for basset clarinet was written for Stadler by Franz Xaver Süssmayr, which remains as two incomplete manuscripts. It is now thought that the clarinet concerti by Eybler and Kozeluch were also written for Anton Stadler. During the 1790s Stadler, who owing to financial problems in 1796 lost his job in the court orchestra, toured northern Europe, performing concerts on the basset horn. Shortly after 1800 he left his wife and family and moved to the Landstraße where he lived with his mistress, a certain Friederika Kebel. He died of emaciation and was buried on 17 June 1812 on the old Catholic cemetery in Matzleinsdorf. Contrary to widespread information in the literature (Albert R. Rice, Poulin, Zaslaw et al.) Stadler's son Anton was not a basset horn player. He played the "Passetl", which in Vienna describes a small stringed bass.
Stadler's compositions included "Terzetten", eighteen short pieces for basset-horn trio

[[Monogonont]]

CATEGORIES: Rotifers

The monogononts (Monogononta) are a class of rotifers, found mostly in freshwater but also in soil and marine environments.  They include both free-swimming and sessile forms.  Monogononts generally have a reduced corona, and each individual has a single gonad, which gives the group its name.  Males are generally smaller than females, and are produced only during certain times of the year, with females otherwise reproducing through parthenogenesis.
Their mastax is not designed for grinding. They produce mictic and amictic eggs. The class contains about 1,400 species.[tpl]cite book|last=Harley|first=Stephen A.

Seabiscuit (May 23, 1933 – May 17, 1947) was a champion Thoroughbred racehorse in the United States. A small horse, Seabiscuit had an inauspicious start to his racing career, but became an unlikely champion and a symbol of hope to many Americans during the Great Depression. Seabiscuit was the subject of a 1949 film, The Story of Seabiscuit; a 2001 book, Seabiscuit: An American Legend by Laura Hillenbrand; and a 2003 film, Seabiscuit, which was based on the Hillenbrand book and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

[[Roman emperor]]

CATEGORIES: Roman emperors, Ancient Roman titles, Positions of authority

The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman State during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The Romans had no single term for the position although at any given time, a given title was associated with the emperor. If a man was "proclaimed emperor" this normally meant he was proclaimed augustus, or (for generals) imperator (from which English emperor derives). Several other titles, such as caesar, and offices such as princeps senatus, consul and Pontifex Maximus were regularly accumulated by emperors. The power of emperors was generally based on the accumulation of powers from republican offices and the support of the army.
Roman emperors refused to be considered "kings", instead claiming to be leaders of a republic. The first emperor, Augustus, resolutely refused recognition as a monarch.[tpl]cite book|title=The Cambridge companion to the Age of Augustus|last=Galinsky|first=Karl|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-80796-8|pages=13–14|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=ftcx-5j7rjwC&pg=PA13|accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl] Although Augustus could claim that his power was authentically Republican, his successor, Tiberius, could not convincingly make the same claim.[tpl]cite book|title=Aspects of Roman history, AD 14-117|last=Alston|first=Richard|year=1998|isbn= 978-0-415-13237-4|page=39|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WwO_dzOVLw4C&pg=PA39|accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl] Nonetheless, the Republican institutional framework (senate, consuls, magistracy etc.) was preserved until the very end of the Western Empire.
By the time of Diocletian, emperors were openly monarchs,[tpl]cite book|title=Diocletian and the Roman recovery|last=Williams|first=Stephen|year=1997|isbn= 978-0-415-91827-5|page=147|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9il6P3TPj-AC&pg=PA147|accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl] but the contrast with "kings" was maintained: Although the imperial succession was generally hereditary, it was only hereditary if there was a suitable candidate acceptable to the army and the bureaucracy[tpl]cite book|title=The Fall of the Roman Empire|last=Heather|first=Peter|year=2005|isbn=978-0-330-49136-5|page=28|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_Jntu21N9K0C&pg=PA28|accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl] so the principle of automatic inheritance was not adopted. The Eastern (Byzantine) emperors ultimately adopted the title of "Basileus" ([tpl]lang|grc|βασιλεύς[/tpl]), which had meant king in Greek, but became a title reserved solely for the Roman emperor (and the ruler of the Sassanid Empire). Other kings were referred to, in Greek, as rēx or rēgas, the hellenized forms of the Latin title rex, king.[tpl]citation | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | title = Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=264[/tpl]
In addition to their pontifical office, some emperors were given divine status after death. In the theology of the Imperial cult, the rule of empire and the elevated status of emperors expressed the will and approval of Rome's traditional gods. With the eventual hegemony of Christianity, the empire was seen as part of God's plan to Christianize the world, and the emperor as Christ's regent on earth.
The Western Roman Empire was dealt fatal blows by a set of military coups d'état in the Italian Peninsula in 475 and 476. After the death of the last Western Emperor Julius Nepos in 480, no Western Emperor was recognized by the Eastern Emperors, who ruled from Constantinople until the conquest of that city by the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The last emperor Constantine XI died in hand to hand combat defending the capital. A dynasty of claimants maintained the Imperial tradition in the province of Chaldia until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1461.

The Donation of Constantine (Latin, Donatio Constantini) is a forged Roman imperial decree by which the emperor Constantine I supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the Pope. Composed probably in the 8th century, it was used, especially in the 13th century, in support of claims of political authority by the papacy.Vauchez, Andre (2001). Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages. Routledge.  p. 445. ISBN 9781579582821. Lorenzo Valla, an Italian Catholic priest and Renaissance humanist, is credited with first exposing the forgery with solid philological arguments in 1439–1440,Whelton, M. (1998). Two Paths: Papal Monarchy – Collegial Tradition. Salisbury, MA: Regina Orthodox Press. p. 113. although the document's authenticity had been repeatedly contested since 1001.
In many manuscripts, including the oldest one, the document bears the title Constitutum domini Constantini imperatoris.

Compressible flow is the area of fluid mechanics that deals with fluids in which the fluid density varies significantly in response to a change in pressure. Compressibility effects are typically considered significant if the Mach number (the ratio of the flow velocity to the local speed of sound) of the flow exceeds 0.3, or if the fluid undergoes very large pressure changes. The most distinct differences between the compressible and incompressible flow models are that the compressible flow model allows for the existence of shock waves and choked flow.

[tpl]italic title[/tpl]

The Vlaams Blok ([tpl]lang-en|Flemish Block[/tpl], or VB) was a Belgian far-right and secessionist political party with an anti-immigration platform.Erk, 2005, pp. 493-502. Its ideologies embraced Flemish nationalism, calling for the independence of Flanders. From its creation in 1978, it was the most notable militant right wing of the Flemish movement. Vlaams Blok's track record in the Flemish and Belgian parliament elections was strong. The election campaigns consisted mainly of the immigration and law-and-order theme, combined with the desire for Flemish autonomy.
All significant Flemish political parties were reluctant to enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The Court of Appeal in Ghent in April 2004 ruled that some of the party's organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang. By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate,De Winter, 2004, p. 6. as well as being one of the most successful radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.Coffé, 2005, p. 205.

[[Ticinum]]

CATEGORIES: Roman sites of Lombardy, Pavia

Ticinum (the modern Pavia) was an ancient city of Gallia Transpadana, founded on the banks of the river of the same name (now the Ticino river) a little way above its confluence with the Padus (Po).
It is said by Pliny the Elder to have been founded by the Laevi and Marici, two Ligurian tribes, while Ptolemy attributes it to the Insubres.
Its importance in Roman times was due to the extension of the Via Aemilia from Ariminum (Rimini) to the Padus (or Po) (187 BC), which it crossed at Placentia (Piacenza) and there forked, one branch going to Mediolanum (Milan) and the other to Ticinum, and thence to Laumellum where it divided once more, one branch going to Vercellae - and thence to Eporedia and Augusta Praetoria -  and the other to Valentia - and thence to Augusta Taurinorum (Turin) or to Pollentia.
thumb|left|17th-century drawing of the street layout and fortifications of the town of Pavia|alt=Full-view image of the planThe branch to Eporedia must have been constructed before 100 BC. Ticinum is frequently mentioned by classical writers. It was a municipium, but we learn little of it except that in the 4th century there was a manufacture of bows and a mint there.  The first Christian bishops of the city are identified as Juventius and Syrus.
It was pillaged by Attila in 452 and by Odoacer in 476, but rose to importance as a military centre in the Gothic period. At Dertona and here the grain stores of Liguria were placed, and Theodoric the Great constructed a palace, baths and amphitheatre and new town walls; while an inscription of Athalaric relating to repairs of seats in the amphitheatre is preserved (529). From this point, too, navigation on the Padus seems to have begun. Narses recovered it for the Eastern Empire, but after a long siege, the garrison had to surrender to the Lombards in 572.
thumb|300px|right|The Ponte Vecchio (old bridge) in Pavia|alt=Full-view photograph of the bridgeThe name Papia, from which the modern name Pavia comes, does not appear until Lombard times, when it became the seat of the Lombard kingdom, and as such one of the leading cities of Italy. Cornelius Nepos, the biographer, appears to have been a native of Ticinum. Of Roman remains little is preserved; there is, for example, no sufficient proof that the cathedral rests upon an ancient temple of Cybele though the regular ground plan of the central portion, a square of some 1150 yards, betrays its Roman origin, and it may have sprung from a military camp. This is not unnatural, for Pavia was never totally destroyed; even the fire of 1004 can only have damaged parts of the city, and the plan of Pavia remained as it was. Its gates were possibly preserved until early in the 8th century. The picturesque covered bridge (bombed down in the Second World War and subsequently rebuilt in a similar shape and position), which joins Pavia to the suburb on the right bank of the river, was preceded by a Roman bridge, of which only one pillar, in blocks of granite from the Baveno quarries, exists under the remains of the central arch of the medieval bridge, the rest having no doubt served as material for the latter. The medieval bridge dated from 1351‑1354.

The Freedom Party was a right wing political party in the United Kingdom.
The party was founded in December 2000 by former members of the British National Party (BNP), dubbed "ultra-Tories" by BNP leader Nick Griffin, who were disaffected with the party's refusal to moderate its position on race. They were expelled following a feud with the BNP leadership and allegations of financial irregularities and misconduct. Most prominent were two party activists in the West Midlands, husband and wife Steve Edwards (who became Freedom Party agent) and Sharron Edwards (formerly deputy chairman of the BNP and then deputy chairman of the Freedom Party). Adrian Davies was Party Chairman and Michael Newland was the  treasurer. Most of the leadership were prominent in the Bloomsbury Forum, a right-wing discussion group.
The party was primarily anti-immigration, although it claimed to place more of an emphasis on culture rather than race.  It was more mainstream on issues such as race than the British National Party, with which it had a stormy relationship. The party aimed to appeal to 'reasonable people'.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2242/is_1667_285/ai_n13807439/|title=The dangers of wearing glasses: intellectual opposition to liberalism in contemporary Britain|last=Dutton|first=Edward|date=December 2004|work=Contemporary Review|accessdate=10 February 2010[/tpl] It believed in a Keynesian approach to the economy, and was also protectionist.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

The accepted goals and ideologies related to preserving traditions and morality often vary from group to group within social conservatism. Thus, there are really no policies or positions that could be considered universal among social conservatives. There are, however, a number of general principles to which at least a majority of social conservatives adhere, such as support for traditional family values.

The sanctuary is a figure of heaven, into which entry is not guaranteed.  Rails are a feature of Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches.
Barriers of various kinds often mark off as especially sacred the area of a church close to the altar, which is largely reserved for ordained clergy. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, curtains are drawn to cut off that area during the holiest moments of the liturgy. In Eastern Orthodox and related rites, this evolved into a solid, icon-clad screen, called the iconostasis that has three doorways which usually have doors and curtains that can be closed or drawn aside at various times. Western Europe had its more transparent Gothic rood screens and the smaller more economical altar rails.

[[Binary code]]

CATEGORIES: Computer data, English inventions, Encodings, Gottfried Leibniz, Cryptographic algorithms

A binary code represents text or computer processor instructions using the binary number system's two binary digits, 0 and 1. A binary code assigns a bit string to each symbol or instruction. For example, a binary string of eight binary digits (bits) can represent any of 256 possible values and can therefore correspond to a variety of different symbols, letters or instructions.
In computing and telecommunication, binary codes are used for various methods of encoding data, such as character strings, into bit strings. Those methods may use fixed-width or variable-width strings. In a fixed-width binary code, each letter, digit, or other character is represented by a bit string of the same length; that bit string, interpreted as a binary number, is usually displayed in code tables in octal, decimal or hexadecimal notation. There are many character sets and many character encodings for them.
A bit string, interpreted as a binary number, can be translated into a decimal number. For example, the lower case a, if represented by the bit string 01100001 (as it is in the standard ASCII code), can also be represented as the decimal number 97.

Francisco Morazán (born October 3, 1792 – September 15, 1842) was President of the Federal Republic of Central America from 1830 to 1839. Before he was president of Central America he was head of state of Honduras,Biography of Francisco Morazán latinamericanhistory, By Christopher Minster, About.com Guide, October 06, 2009. Retrieved January 17, 2010. He rose to prominence at the legendary Battle of La Trinidad on November 11, 1827. Since then, and until his execution in 1842, Morazán dominated the political and military scene of Central America.
In the political arena, Francisco Morazán was recognized as a visionary and great thinker, as he attempted to transform Central America into one large and progressive nation. He enacted liberal reforms in the new Federal Republic of Central America, including freedom of the press, speech and religion.  Morazán also limited church power by making marriage secular and abolishing government-aided tithing.
These reforms made him some powerful enemies, and his period of rule was marked by bitter infighting between liberals and conservatives. But through his military skills, Morazán was able to keep a firm  grip on power until 1837, when the Federal Republic became irrevocably fractured. This was exploited by the conservative leaders, who rallied around the leadership of Rafael Carrera and in order to protect their own interests, ended up dividing Central America into five nations.THE AMERICAS: Morazan's Dream The Americas, Time, Time.com Guide, Monday, Sep. 21, 1942.

The Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal is a [tpl]convert|31|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long canal in England which connected the mining district around Moira, just outside the town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, with the Coventry Canal at Bedworth in Warwickshire. It was opened in 1804, and a number of tramways were constructed at its northern end, to service collieries. The canal was taken over by the Midland Railway in 1846, but remained profitable until the 1890s, after which it steadily declined. Around [tpl]convert|9|mi|km[/tpl] passed through the Leicestershire coal field, and was heavily affected by subsidence, with the result that this section from Moira, southwards to Snarestone, was progressively closed in 1944, 1957 and 1966, leaving [tpl]convert|22|mi|km[/tpl] of navigable canal.
The abandoned section is the subject of a restoration project and is the first canal where a new section has been authorised under the Transport and Works Act 1992. The Transport and Works Order was obtained by Leicestershire County Council, as some of the original route has been infilled and built over, and restoration therefore involves construction on a new route through the centre of Measham. It is hoped that all but the final [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] section of the canal can be re-opened. An isolated section near Moira Furnace and the National Forest visitor centre was opened between 1999 and 2005, and is the location for an annual trailboat festival.

Ralph Bates (12 February 1940 – 27 March 1991) was an English film and television actor, known for his role in the British sitcom Dear John and for being one of Hammer Horror's best-known actors from the latter period of the company.
Bates was born in Bristol, England, of French ancestry (he was the great-great-nephew of French scientist Louis Pasteur) and educated at Trinity College Dublin. He read French there, before winning a scholarship to Yale Drama School. The course completed, Bates returned to Ireland to make his stage debut in Shaw's You Never Can Tell at The Gate Theatre, Dublin, in 1963. A career in repertory theatre soon followed and the young actor gained experience in productions ranging from Hedda Gabler to raucous comedies.
Later, Bates carved a niche in the world of horror films and played important roles or the lead in several Hammer Horror productions, such as Taste the Blood of Dracula, The Horror of Frankenstein, Lust for a Vampire, and Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, in which he played a deranged doctor who mistakenly transforms himself into a beautiful siren.
He portrayed Caligula in the series The Caesars and alongside Cyd Hayman in a passionate French tale of murder and mystery - Crime of Passion series. After playing Thomas Culpeper in an episode of The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970), he went on to star in the BBC drama series, Moonbase 3 (1973) and the long-running Poldark, in which he played villainous George Warleggan. The series ran for 29 episodes, starting in 1975. He also played communist Paul Vercors in the final season of the drama series Secret Army. Because of his French ancestry and dark looks, he was often chosen to play a Frenchman on television, as for instance in a second series episode of ITV comedy drama Turtle's Progress. Bates also appeared in the television movie Minder on the Orient Express, again as a Frenchman.
It looked, for some time, as if he might remain typecast in sinister roles, but he was offered a part in a farcical comedy by the writer John Sullivan, which saw Bates as the loveable but loveless central character among a singles group, with each of its members looking for that perfect but ever elusive partner. Dear John (1986–87), in which he realistically played the part of a divorcé returning to single life, lasted for two series, and around the same time he appeared in the ITV Yorkshire Television sitcom Farrington of the F.O. (1986) with Angela Thorne and Joan Sims.
Bates became ill and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and died in London at age 51 from the disease. He was divorced from the actress Joanna Van Gyseghem, and survived by his second wife, the actress Virginia Wetherell (married 1973-1991). The couple had one daughter, actress Daisy Bates (b. 1974), and a son William Bates (b. 1977), an actor & musician.

[[Right to keep and bear arms]]

CATEGORIES: American phraseology, Civil rights and liberties, Gun politics, Human rights by issue

The right to keep and bear arms (often referred to as the right to bear arms or to have arms) is the people's right to have their own arms for their defense as described in the philosophical and political writings of Aristotle, Cicero, John Locke, Machiavelli, the English Whigs and others.[tpl]cite book|author=Halbrook, Stephen P.|title=That Every Man Be Armed: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (Independent Studies in Political Economy)|publisher=The Independent Institute|location=Oakland, CA|year=1994|page=8|isbn=0-945999-38-0[/tpl] In countries with an English common law tradition, a long standing common law right to keep and bear arms has long been recognized, as pre-existing in common law, prior even to the existence of written national constitutions.[tpl]cite journal|title=Bringing Forward The Right To Keep And Bear Arms: Do Text, History, Or Precedent Stand In The Way?|journal=North Carolina Law Review|date=March 1997|first=Thomas B.|last=McAffee|coauthors=Michael J.

The concept of the "right of the people to keep and bear arms" is derived from the English Bill of Rights 1689 which states:
This must be read in the context of the grievance being addressed, which reads:
The English Bill of Rights established that regulating the right to bear arms was one of the powers of Parliament, and did not belong to the monarch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1518621|title=1688 c.2 1 Will. and Mar.

A protectorate in its inception adopted by modern international law, is an autonomous territory that is protected diplomatically or militarily against third parties by a stronger  state or entity. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. However, it retains formal sovereignty, and remains a state under international law. A territory subject to this type of arrangement is also known as a protected state.

[[Sinaloa Crow]]

CATEGORIES: Corvus, Endemic birds of Western Mexico, Endemic fauna of Mexico

The Sinaloa Crow (Corvus sinaloae) is a crow native to western Mexico. Visually, it is nearly identical to and the same length (34–38 cm) as the Tamaulipas Crow (Corvus imparatus). It has the same purple-glossed, silky, black  plumage with a black bill, legs, and feet. The two species differ markedly in voice.
It occurs on the Pacific slope from southern Sonora south to Manzanillo. The crow inhabits coastal regions where it forages on the seashore, semi-desert, open woodlands, river banks and hills up to 300 metres or more. It is very common around coastal towns and villages.
Food is taken both on the ground and in trees. On the seashore it can be found turning over objects to find its food and it will take a wide range of invertebrates such as small shellfish, crabs, and insects. Fruits of many types are also taken and eggs and nestlings are also on the menu when opportunity arises.
Often, this bird will nest in a thorny tree or a tall coconut palm where its nest is said to be similar to the American Crow though smaller.
The voice is radically different from the Tamaulipas Crow in that it is quite high-pitched, jay-like, and clear: "ceow". That of the Tamaulipas Crow is a surprisingly low, gruff, frog-like croak.
Another species, the Fish Crow Corvus ossifragus from the southeastern seaboard of the United States is also considered genetically very close to both this species and the Tamaulipas Crow Corvus imparatus and the three are now considered a "Superspecies".
Other names: When lumped with the Tamaulipas Crow, the more inclusive taxon was called Mexican Crow.

CATEGORIES: Genetics, Population genetics, Evolutionary biology, Statistical genetics

Population genetics is the study of the distributions and changes of allele frequency in a population, as the population is subject to the four main evolutionary processes: natural selection, genetic drift, mutation and gene flow. It also takes into account the factors of recombination, population subdivision and population structure. Studies in this branch of biology examine such phenomena as adaptation and speciation.
Population genetics was a vital ingredient in the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis. Its primary founders were Sewall Wright, J. B. S. Haldane and R. A. Fisher, who also laid the foundations for the related discipline of quantitative genetics.
Traditionally a highly mathematical discipline, modern population genetics encompasses theoretical, lab and field work. Computational approaches, often using coalescent theory, have played a central role since the 1980s.

[[Codon usage bias]]
CATEGORIES: Molecular biology, Gene expression

Codon usage bias refers to differences in the frequency of occurrence of synonymous codons in coding DNA. A codon is a series of three nucleotides (triplets) that encodes a specific amino acid residue in a polypeptide chain or for the termination of translation (stop codons).
There are 64 different codons (61 codons encoding for amino acids plus 3 stop codons) but only 20 different translated amino acids. The overabundance in the number of codons allows many amino acids to be encoded by more than one codon. Because of such redundancy it is said that the genetic code is degenerate. Different organisms often show particular preferences for one of the several codons that encode the same amino acid- that is, a greater frequency of one will be found than expected by chance. How such preferences arise is a much debated area of molecular evolution.
It is generally acknowledged that codon preferences reflect a balance between mutational biases and natural selection for translational optimization. Optimal codons in fast-growing microorganisms, like Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), reflect the composition of their respective genomic tRNA pool. It is thought that optimal codons help to achieve faster translation rates and high accuracy. As a result of these factors, translational selection is expected to be stronger in highly expressed genes, as is indeed the case for the above-mentioned organisms. In other organisms that do not show high growing rates or that present small genomes, codon usage optimization is normally absent, and codon preferences are determined by the characteristic mutational biases seen in that particular genome. Examples of this are Homo sapiens (human) and Helicobacter pylori. Organisms that show an intermediate level of codon usage optimization include Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worm), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) or Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress).
The nature of the codon usage-tRNA optimization has been fiercely debated. It is not clear whether codon usage drives tRNA evolution or vice versa. At least one mathematical model has been developed where both codon-usage and tRNA-expression co-evolve in feedback fashion (i.e., codons already present in high frequencies drive up the expression of their corresponding tRNAs, and tRNAs normally expressed at high levels drive up the frequency of their corresponding codons), however this model does not seem to yet have experimental confirmation. Another problem is that the evolution of tRNA genes has been a very inactive area of research.

The Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch ([tpl]lang-syc|ܥܕܬܐ ܣܘܪܝܝܬܐ ܬܪܝܨܬ ܫܘܒܚܐ[/tpl]) is an autocephalous Oriental Orthodox church based in the Eastern Mediterranean, with members spread throughout the world. It employs the oldest surviving liturgy in Christianity, the Liturgy of St. James the Apostle, and  uses Syriac as its official and liturgical language. The church is led by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. The Syriac Orthodox Church traces its history to one of the first Christian communities in Antioch, described in the Acts of the Apostles (New Testament, [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|11:26|NIV[/tpl]) and established by the Apostle St. Peter in AD 37.
The Church belongs to the Oriental Orthodox family of churches, which has been a distinct church body since the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451 but its roots date back to the first founded church outside Jerusalem in Antioch in AD 37 when and where the followers of Jesus Christ were first called Christians. The precise differences in theology that caused the split, "arose only because of differences in terminology and culture and in the various formulae adopted by different theological schools to express the same matter", according to a joint declaration by the last head of the Syriac Orthodox church, Patriarch Mar Ignatius Zakka I Iwas, and Roman Catholic Pope John Paul II in 1984 (see: History of Oriental Orthodoxy). The Syriac Orthodox Church continues to lead ecumenical discussions through its membership in the World Council of Churches since 1960, where the last Patriarch Mor Ignatius Zakka I Iwas served as a president, and in the Middle East Council of Churches since 1974.
The Church has twenty-six archdioceses and eleven patriarchal vicariates. In 1959, the Patriarchate was moved to Damascus, modern-day Syria.The Syriac Orthodox Church Today

The NYWF of 1939–1940 was the first exposition to be based on the future, with an opening slogan of "Dawn of a New Day", and it allowed all visitors to take a look at "the world of tomorrow". According to the official New York World's Fair pamphlet,
 The eyes of the Fair are on the future — not in the sense of peering toward the unknown nor attempting to foretell the events of tomorrow and the shape of things to come, but in the sense of presenting a new and clearer view of today in preparation for tomorrow; a view of the forces and ideas that prevail as well as the machines. 
 To its visitors the Fair will say: "Here are the materials, ideas, and forces at work in our world. These are the tools with which the World of Tomorrow must be made. They are all interesting and much effort has been expended to lay them before you in an interesting way. Familiarity with today is the best preparation for the future.

Rafael Antonio Caldera Rodríguez ([tpl]IPA-es|rafaˈel anˈtonjo kalˈdeɾa roˈðɾiɣes[/tpl]; 24 January 1916 – 24 December 2009) was President of Venezuela from 1969 to 1974 and again from 1994 to 1999.
Caldera taught sociology and law at various universities before entering politics. He was a founding member of COPEI, Venezuela's Christian Democratic party. He first ran for president unsuccessfully in 1947 and tried again every time it was possible until finally succeeding in 1968, winning by a relatively scant 33,000 votes against a recently divided Acción Democrática party. When he was sworn into office in 1969, it marked the first peaceful transfer of power from one party to another in Venezuela's history. During his first presidency, Caldera was able to pacify the country by granting an amnesty that allowed guerrilla fighters, who had been operating clandestinely for almost a decade, to reincorporate into society and participate in politics.
In 1993, Caldera split from COPEI, the party he had founded, to form a new political party, Convergence, which, supported by a coalition of many small leftist parties: (MAS, MEP, PCV) as well as some centre-right parties (URD, MIN), raised Caldera to the presidency in December 1993. This was a fatal blow to the traditional parties which, leaderless and demoralized, garnered few votes in the election. He won a very narrow victory in that year's presidential election. During his second presidential period, he pardoned Hugo Chávez, who eventually went on to succeed him in 1999.

[[Heap overflow]]

CATEGORIES: Computer security exploits, Software anomalies

A heap overflow is a type of buffer overflow that occurs in the heap data area. Heap overflows are exploitable in a different manner to that of stack-based overflows. Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at run-time and typically contains program data. Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in specific ways to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as linked list pointers. The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as malloc meta data) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to overwrite a program function pointer.
A typical example on older versions of Linux is two buffers allocated next to each other on the heap, writing beyond the boundary of the first buffer allows overwriting meta data in the second buffer. By setting the in-use bit to zero of the second buffer and setting the length to a small negative value which allows null bytes to be copied, when the program calls free() on the first buffer it will attempt to merge these two buffers into a single buffer. When this happens, the buffer that is assumed to be freed will be expected to hold two pointers FD and BK in the first 8 bytes of the formerly allocated buffer. BK gets written into FD and can be used to overwrite a pointer.

Reference to civil law was not originally in contradistinction to common law, but to canon law, although it is true that common law was not taught in the civil law faculties in either university until at least the second half of the 18th century.

John Llewellyn Lewis (February 12, 1880 – June 11, 1969) was an American leader of organized labor who served as president of the United Mine Workers of America (UMW) from 1920 to 1960. A major player in the history of coal mining, he was the driving force behind the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which established the United Steel Workers of America and helped organize millions of other industrial workers in the 1930s. After resigning as head of the CIO in 1941, he took the Mine Workers out of the CIO in 1942 and in 1944 took the union into the American Federation of Labor (AFL).
A leading liberal, he played a major role in helping Franklin D. Roosevelt win a landslide in 1936, but as an isolationist broke with Roosevelt in 1940 on FDR's anti-Nazi foreign policy. Lewis was a brutally effective and aggressive fighter and strike leader who gained high wages for his membership while steamrolling over his opponents, including the United States government. Lewis was one of the most controversial and innovative leaders in the history of labor, gaining credit for building the industrial unions of the CIO into a political and economic powerhouse to rival the AFL, yet was widely hated by calling for nationwide coal strikes which critics believed damaging to the American economy and war effort. His massive leonine head, forest-like eyebrows, firmly set jaw, powerful voice and ever-present scowl thrilled his supporters, angered his enemies, and delighted cartoonists. Coal miners for 40 years hailed him as the benevolent dictator who brought high wages, pensions and medical benefits, and damn the critics.Robert H. Zieger. "Lewis, John L."

Marion Davies (January 3, 1897 – September 22, 1961) was an American film actress, producer, screenwriter, and philanthropist.
Davies was already building a solid reputation as a film comedienne when newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, with whom she had begun a romantic relationship, took over management of her career. Hearst financed Davies' pictures, promoted her heavily through his newspapers and Hearst Newsreels, and pressured studios to cast her in historical dramas for which she was ill-suited. For this reason, Davies is better remembered today as Hearst's mistress and the hostess of many lavish events for the Hollywood elite. In particular, her name is linked with the 1924 scandal aboard Hearst's yacht where one of his guests, film producer Thomas Ince, died.
In the film Citizen Kane (1941), the title character's wife—an untalented singer whom he tries to promote—was widely assumed to be based on Davies. But many commentators, including Citizen Kane writer/director Orson Welles himself, have defended Davies' record as a gifted actress, to whom Hearst's patronage did more harm than good. She retired from the screen in 1937, choosing to devote herself to Hearst and charitable work.
In Hearst's declining years, Davies provided financial as well as emotional support until his death in 1951. She married for the first time eleven weeks after his death, a marriage which lasted until Davies died of stomach cancer in 1961 at the age of 64.

[[Constitutional convention (political custom)]]
CATEGORIES: Constitutional law, Traditions, Legal doctrines and principles

A constitutional convention is an informal and uncodified procedural agreement that is followed by the institutions of a state. In some states, notably those Commonwealth of Nations states that follow the Westminster system and whose political systems derive from British constitutional law, most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution.
In these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describes. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the head of state that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the head of government.
Some constitutional conventions operate separate from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the constitutional reforms of 1982. Elsewhere, notably the United Kingdom which lacks a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. Everywhere, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification).

There are about 17 species in three genera. These do not appear to form a monophyletic lineage: Mimus and Nesomimus are quite closely related; their closest living relatives appear to be some thrashers, such as the Sage Thrasher. Melanotis is more distinct; it seems to represent a very ancient basal lineage of Mimidae.Hunt, Jeffrey S.; Bermingham, Eldredge; & Ricklefs, Robert E.

He was born in Mecca, Ohio, on Christmas Eve.  Later in life, he graduated from the University of Michigan and completed post-graduate work at Union College located in Schenectady, New York, in 1862.
In the second year of the American Civil War, Powers enlisted into the United States Army as a private. He became a second lieutenant and later a captain in the 125th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He served at the Third Battle of Chattanooga and in the Atlanta Campaign before returning with his regiment to Tennessee for much of the remainder of the war. He ended his military service as a colonel upon the end of the conflict.
In 1865, the Ohioan settled in Noxubee County, Mississippi as a cotton planter, later becoming sheriff. During Reconstruction, Powers was elected the seventh lieutenant governor and began his term in 1870. Governor James L.

[[Thrasher]]

CATEGORIES: Mimidae, Thrashers, Toxostoma

Thrashers are a New World group of passerine birds related to mockingbirds and New World catbirds. Like these, they are in the Mimidae family. There are 15 species in one large and 4 monotypic genera.
These do not form a clade but are a phenetic assemblage. It is rather likely than not — though by no means robustly supported — that the Sage Thrasher is a basal lineage among a group also consisting of mockingbirds and Toxostoma thrashers. The Caribbean thrashers occupy varying positions in an assemblage consisting of them, the tremblers, and the New World catbirds. Here, the White-breasted Thrasher appears to be quite basal though it is impossible to place it anywhere with certainty, whereas the Pearly-eyed Thrasher is probably quite close to the tremblers. (Hunt et al. 2001, Barber et al. 2004)
Their common name describes the behaviour of these birds when searching for food on the ground: they use their long bills to "thrash" through dirt or dead leaves. All of these birds eat insects and several species also eat berries.

[[British North America]]

CATEGORIES: British North America, British colonization of the Americas, History of Canada

British North America referred to the colonies and territories of the British Empire in continental North America.  The term was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.
In 1775 the British Empire included 20 territories north of New Spain. These were Newfoundland, Rupert's Land, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, the Thirteen Colonies (which later united to become the United States after independence from the United Kingdom), East and West Florida, and the Province of Quebec. 
Britain had acquired Quebec from France and East and West Florida from Spain by the Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the Seven Years' War. 
Spain regained the Floridas and the United States of America, upon acknowledgement of their sovereignty, acquired the part of Quebec south of the Great Lakes by the Treaty of Paris (1783). 
Nova Scotia was split into modern-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in 1784.
The part of Quebec retained after 1783 was split into the primarily French-speaking Lower Canada and the primarily English-speaking Upper Canada in 1791.
After the War of 1812, the Treaty of 1818 established the 49th parallel as the United States–British North America border from Rupert's Land west to the Rocky Mountains. Britain gave up Oregon south of the 49th parallel, which was part of the Hudson's Bay Company's Columbia District, under the Oregon Treaty of 1846.
The boundary of British North America with Maine was finally determined by Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842.
The Canadas were united into the Province of Canada in 1841. 
On July 1, 1867, an Act of the British Parliament called the British North America Act formed the Dominion of Canada from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  The former Province of Canada was split back into its pre-1841 parts, with Canada East (Lower Canada) renamed Quebec, and Canada West (Upper Canada) renamed Ontario. These were the original four provinces of Canada. 
In 1869, Rupert's Land was annexed to Canada as the Northwest Territories (NWT), and in 1870 a part of the NWT, Manitoba, became a province of Canada. The west-coast British colony north of the 49th parallel, British Columbia, joined Confederation in 1871, and Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. The boundary of British Columbia with Washington Territory was settled by arbitration in 1872, and with Alaska by arbitration in 1903.  In 1905, large parts of the Northwest Territories became the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. 
In 1907 the sole remaining British North American colony, Newfoundland, was granted Dominion status, although starting in 1934 it was administered by the non-representational Commission of Government, a body chaired by British officials.  In 1949 the island of Newfoundland, and its associated mainland territory of Labrador, joined Canada as the tenth province.
Although internally autonomous from 1867, and a separate kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931, the last vestiges of Canada's constitutional dependency upon the United Kingdom remained until Canadians agreed on an internal procedure for amending the Canadian Constitution.  This agreement was implemented when the British Parliament passed the Constitution Act of 1982 at the request of Parliament of Canada and the Legislatures of the provinces except Quebec (which objected to the terms to which the others agreed).

[[Convair]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct aircraft manufacturers of the United States, Companies established in 1943, Companies disestablished in 1996

Convair was an American aircraft manufacturing company which later expanded into rockets and spacecraft. The company was formed in 1943 by the merger of Consolidated Aircraft and Vultee Aircraft, and went on to produce a number of pioneering aircraft such as the Convair B-36 bomber, the F-102 Delta Dagger and the F-106 Delta Dart. It also manufactured the first Atlas rockets, including the rockets that were used for the pioneering manned orbital flights of Project Mercury. The company's subsequent Atlas-Centaur design continued this success and derivatives of the design remain in use as of 2010. In 1994 most of the company's divisions were sold by then-owners General Dynamics to McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, with the remaining components deactivated in 1996.

Sergeant (normally abbreviated to Sgt) is a rank used in some form by most militaries, police forces, and other uniformed organizations around the world. Its origins are the Latin serviens, "one who serves", through the French term sergent.
In most armies the rank of sergeant is classified by NATO as OR-5 and corresponds to command of a squad (or section). In Commonwealth armies, it is a more senior rank OR-6, corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command. In the United States Army, sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-man fireteam leader (OR-4), while still equivalent to OR-5.
More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant, for instance staff sergeant, regimental sergeant major, sergeant first class, master sergeant, first sergeant and sergeant major.  The spelling "serjeant" is used in a few regiments of the British Army.

[[Hobby (bird)]]
CATEGORIES: Falco (genus), Falcons

A hobby is a fairly small, very swift falcon with long, narrow wings. There are four birds called hobby, and some others which, although termed falcon, are very similar. All specialise in being superb aerialists. Although they will take prey on the ground if the opportunity presents itself, most prey is caught on the wing; insects are often caught by hawking, and many different birds are caught in flight, where even the quick maneuvering swifts and swallows cannot escape a hobby.
The typical hobbies are traditionally considered a subgenus Hypotriorchis due to their similar morphology: they have ample amounts of dark slaty grey in their plumage; the malar area is black and the underside usually has lengthwise black streaks. The tails are all-dark or have only slight bands (White et al. 1994).
Monophyly of Hypotriorchis is supported by DNA sequence data, though the exact limits of the group are still uncertain. The hobbies seem to be one of the Falco lineages which emerged around the Miocene-Pliocene boundary some 8-5 million years ago and subsequently radiated - in this case throughout the Old World. Their relationship to the Peregrine Falcon group and the kestrels is not well resolved, however; taxa like the Red-footed Falcon appear in some respects intermediate between the kestrels and the typical hobbies.Helbig et al. (1994), Wink et al. (1998), Groombridge et al. (2002), Nittinger et al. (2005)

[[Appeal to novelty]]

CATEGORIES: Appeals to emotion, Genetic fallacies

The appeal to novelty (also called argumentum ad novitatem) is a fallacy in which someone prematurely claims that an idea or proposal is correct or superior, exclusively because it is new and modern. In a controversy between status quo and new inventions, an appeal to novelty argument isn't in itself a valid argument. The fallacy may take two forms: overestimating the new and modern, prematurely and without investigation assuming it to be best-case, or underestimating status quo, prematurely and without investigation assuming it to be worst-case.
Investigation may prove these claims to be true, but it is a fallacy to prematurely conclude this only from the general claim that all novelty is good. 
The opposite of an appeal to novelty is an appeal to tradition, in which one argues that the "old ways" are always superior to new ideas.
Appeals to novelty are often successful in a modern world where everyone is eager to be on the "cutting edge" of technology. The so-called "Dot-com bust" of the early 2000s could easily be interpreted as a sign of the dangers of naïvely embracing new ideas without first viewing them with a critical eye. Also, advertisers frequently extoll the newness of their products as a reason to buy.  Conversely, this is satirised as bleeding edge technology by skeptics (this may itself be an example of the appeal to tradition fallacy).
The appeal to novelty is based on the reasoning that in general people will tend to try to improve the outputs resulting from their efforts. Thus, for example, a company producing a product might be assumed to know about existing flaws and to be seeking to correct them in a future revision. This line of reasoning is obviously flawed for many reasons, most notably that: it ignores motive (a new product may be released that is functionally identical to previous products but which is cheaper to produce); it ignores cyclicality (the fashion industry continually rediscovers old styles and markets them as the next new thing); and it ignores population dynamics (the previous product may have been created by an expert who has since been replaced by a neophyte).

Flattery is often used to hide the true intent of an idea or proposal. Praise offers a momentary personal distraction that can often weaken judgment. Moreover, it is usually a cunning form of appeal to consequences, since the audience is subject to be flattered as long as they comply with the flatterer.

At the 1904 Summer Olympics, a  football event was contested. Only three club teams competed. Medals were awarded at the time, at least to the Canadian team.  The 1904 contest is considered to be an official contest by the IOC but not by FIFA.
The 1904 Games were spread over several months, linked to the St Louis World's Fair, and football was the last sport to be contested, in November. The tournament was played as a straight round robin, although the game between Christian Brothers College and St. Rose Parish was replayed twice due to two 0-0 draws.

Romance tours, are tours that men take in search of a relationship, girlfriend or even a marriage.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dating/articles/1015aforeignaffair15-CP.html|title=Marriage Brokers Scrutinized|accessdate=2008-02-19|date=2005-10-15|author=Craig Harris|work=The Arizona Republic[/tpl] In some such tours, the men and potential brides interact in brief parties arranged by the hosting company.
As the romance tours industry has grown, there have been an increasingly higher number of success stories, such as that of Ukrainian mail order bride Lera Loeb.Lera Loeb - Mail Order Bride http://www.glamour.com/sex-love-life/2009/06/yes-this-woman-is-a-mail-order-bride Romance tours are the most effective next step for men to take after contacting a prospective bride from another country. A large number of highly successful romance tours take place every year throughout the world. Romance tours first began in Russia and CIS,Origination of Russian romance tours: http://www.anastasia-web-tours.com/Home/Tours/tabid/69/Default.aspx but have recently moved into other parts of the world such as South America.Romance Outsourcing: Tales of a Mail Order Bride Tour http://blog.sfgate.com/hleon/2012/01/25/romance-outsourcing-tales-of-a-mail-order-bride-tour/ Tours also take place in many parts of Asia. 
Once couples have met on a romance tour, an agency arranges "one on one" dates between the man and the women he found most compatible.  The ultimate goal of the tour is for the man to find a compatible wife.
Romance tours are just one part of the mail order bride business, which may also include catalogs, CD-ROMs and the Internet.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E2DF143FF937A25751C0A961958260|title=Video Valentines to Russia, Seeking Patient Brides|accessdate=2008-02-19|date=1997-02-14|author=Alessandra Stanley|work=The New York Times[/tpl] The traditional romance tour, seen by some as superficial, is being somewhat replaced by the internet as technology evolves. However, the two are closely linked as a man eventually has to meet his prospective wife using a well organized method of meeting and dating.
Romance tours should not be confused with sex tourism, because the ultimate goal of a sex tourist is usually not marriage.

Rapeseed (Brassica napus), also known as rape, oilseed rape, rapa, rappi, rapaseed (and, in the case of one particular group of cultivars, canola), is a bright yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family). The name derives from the Latin for turnip, rāpa or rāpum, and is first recorded in English at the end of the 14th century. Older writers usually distinguished the turnip and rape by the adjectives round and long (-rooted), respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/ |title=OED Online |publisher=Dictionary.oed.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-22[/tpl] Rutabagas, Brassica napobrassica are sometimes considered a variety of Brassica napus.

Annulment is a legal procedure for declaring a marriage null and void.[tpl]cite book |title= Statsky's Family Law: The Essentials|last= Statsky|first= William|year= 1996|publisher= Delmar Cengage Learning|isbn= 1-4018-4827-3|pages= 85–86[/tpl] Unlike divorce, it is usually retroactive, meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place (though some jurisdictions provide that the marriage is only void from the date of the annulment). For example, this is the case in section 12 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in England and Wales.
In legal terminology, an annulment makes a voidable marriage null. If a marriage is void ab initio, then it is automatically null, although a declaration of nullity is required to establish this.  The process of obtaining a declaration of nullity is similar to an annulment process. Despite its retroactive nature, children born before an annulment are considered legitimate in many countries.
Annulments are closely associated with the Catholic Church, which does not permit divorce, teaching that marriage is a lifelong commitment which cannot be dissolved through divorce, but can be annulled if invalidly entered into.

The 1904 Games had a confusing program of events spread out over several months, and the gymnastics competition was no different.  The International Olympic Committee considers two sets of events as "Olympic":
The individual all-around was a combination of the gymnastic triathlon competition and the athletics triathlon.  The team competition was a combination of individual scores from the individual all-around.
The parallel bars, horizontal bar, vault, and pommel horse scores for each gymnast were summed to get the "combined" score.

[[Crystal habit]]

CATEGORIES: Crystallography, Mineralogy, Mineral habits

[tpl]About|the descriptive term used in mineralogy|the addictive drug|methamphetamine[tpl]![/tpl]crystal methamphetamine[/tpl]
In mineralogy, crystal habit is the characteristic external shape of an individual crystal or groups of crystals. A single crystal's habit is a description of its general shape and its crystallographic forms, plus how well developed each are. Recognizing the habit may help in identifying the mineral. When the faces are well-developed due to uncrowded growth a crystal is called euhedral, one with partially developed faces is subhedral, and one with undeveloped crystal faces is called anhedral. The long axis of a euhedral quartz crystal typically has a six-sided prismatic habit with parallel opposite faces. Aggregates can be formed of individual crystals with euhedral to anhedral grains. The arrangement of crystals within the aggregate can be characteristic of certain minerals. For example, minerals used for asbestos insulation often grow in a fibrous habit, a mass of very fine fibers.Klein, Cornelis, 2007, Minerals and Rocks: Exercises in Crystal and Mineral Chemistry, Crystallography, X-ray Powder Diffraction, Mineral and Rock Identification, and Ore Mineralogy, Wiley, third edition, ISBN 978-0471772774Wenk, Hans-Rudolph and Andrei Bulakh, 2004, Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin, Cambridge, first edition, ISBN 978-0521529587
The terms used by mineralogists to report crystal habits describe the typical appearance of an ideal mineral. Recognizing the habit can aid in identification as some habits are characteristic. Most minerals, however, do not display ideal habits due to conditions during crystallization. Euhedral crystals formed in uncrowded conditions with no adjacent crystal grains are not common; more often faces are poorly formed or unformed against adjacent grains and the mineral's habit may not be easily recognized.  
Factors influencing habit include: a combination of two or more crystal forms; trace impurities present during growth; crystal twinning and growth conditions (i.e., heat, pressure, space); and specific growth tendencies like growth striations. Minerals belonging to the same crystal system do not necessarily exhibit the same habit. Some habits of a mineral are unique to its variety and locality: For example, while most sapphires form elongate barrel-shaped crystals, those found in Montana form stout tabular crystals. Ordinarily, the latter habit is seen only in ruby. Sapphire and ruby are both varieties of the same mineral; corundum.
Some minerals may replace other existing minerals while preserving the original's habit: this process is called pseudomorphous replacement. A classic example is tiger's eye quartz, crocidolite asbestos replaced by silica. While quartz typically forms prismatic (elongate, prism-like) crystals, in tiger's eye the original fibrous habit of crocidolite is preserved.
The names of crystal habits are derived from:
Predominant crystal faces (prism - prismatic, pyramid - pyramidal and pinacoid - platy).
Crystal forms (cubic, octahedral, dodecahedral).
Aggregation of crystals or aggregates (fibrous, botryoidal, radiating, massive).
Crystal appearance (foliated/lamellar (layered), dendritic, bladed, acicular, lenticular, tabular (tablet shaped)).

[[Remorse]]
CATEGORIES: Emotions

Remorse is an emotional expression of personal regret felt by a person after they have committed an act which they deem to be shameful, hurtful, or violent. Remorse is closely allied to guilt and self-directed resentment. When a person regrets an earlier action or failure to act, it may be because of remorse or in response to various other consequences, including being punished for the act or omission. In a legal context, the perceived remorse of an offender is assessed by Western justice systems during trials, sentencing, parole hearings, and in restorative justice. However, it has been pointed out that epistemological problems arise in assessing an offender's level of remorse.[tpl]citation|volume=91|publisher=Nw. U. L. Rev.|pages=1507|date=1996–1997|title=Remorse, Cooperation, and Acceptance of Responsibility: The Structure, Implementation, and Reform of Section 3E1.1 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines|author=O'Hear, Michael M.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/illlr91&section=51[/tpl]
A person who is incapable of feeling remorse is often labelled with antisocial personality disorder - as characterized in the DSM IV-TR. In general, a person needs to be unable to feel fear, as well as remorse, in order to develop psychopathic traits. Legal and business professions such as insurance have done research on the expression of remorse via apologies, primarily because of the potential litigation and financial implications.

[[Freedom of association]]
CATEGORIES: Human rights by issue

Freedom of association is the right to join or leave groups of a person's own choosing, and for the group to take collective action to pursue the interests of members.Jeremy McBride, Freedom of Association, The Essentials of Human Rights (Hodder Arnold 2005) 18, states it involves coming together with other individuals and collectively express, promote, pursue and defend common interests. It is both an individual right and a collective right, guaranteed by all modern and democratic legal systems, including the United States Bill of Rights, article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and international law, including articles 20 and 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Conventions 87 and 98 of the International Labour Organization.
Freedom of association is primarily manifested through the right to join a trade union, free speech or debating societies, political parties, or any other club or association such as religious groups, fraternities, or sport clubs. It is closely linked with the freedom of assembly, particularly under the US Bill of Rights. More specifically the freedom of assembly is understood in a political context, although depending on the source (constitution, human rights instrument, etc.) the right to freedom of association may be understood to include the right to freedom of assembly.

[[Person]]
CATEGORIES: Concepts in ethics, Humans, People, Personal life, Personhood, Self

A person is a being, such as a human, that has certain capacities or attributes constituting personhood, which in turn is defined differently by different authors in different disciplines, and by different cultures in different times and places. In ancient Rome, the word persona (Latin) or prosopon (πρόσωπον; Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various "personae" in the stage play.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|title=Person|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|year=1911|volume=11|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.[/tpl]
The current concept of person was developed during the Trinitarian and Christological debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature.Thisleton NIGNTC commentary on 1 Corinthians "Thinkers in ancient times had a difficulty in expressing the notion of personality"; Barfield in History of English Words “Take, for instance, the word person...Its present meaning of an individual human being is largely due to the theologians who hit upon it when they were looking for some term that would enable them to assert the trinity of Godhead without admitting more than one 'substance'"; John Zizioulas in Being as Communion 1985 New York:St Vladimirs Press p27writes: "although the person and “personal identity” are Widely discussed nowadays as a supreme ideal, nobody seems to recognize that historically as well as existentially the concept of the person is indissolubly bound up with theology" 
During the theological debates, some'philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/Verbum and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word "prosopon" (πρόσωπον) from the Greek theatre. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/Verbum) and God were defined as different "persons". This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.
Since then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence. In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as he or she was or will be at another time despite any intervening changes. The common plural of "person", "people", is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in "a people"). The plural "persons" is often used in philosophical and legal writing.

A panicle is a much-branched inflorescence.[tpl]cite book |author=Hickey, M.; King, C. |year=2001  |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press[/tpl] Some authors distinguish it from a compound spike, by requiring that the flowers (and fruit) are pedicellate. The branches of a panicle are often racemes. A panicle may have determinate or indeterminate growth.
This type of inflorescence is largely characteristic of grasses such as oat and crabgrass,Technically, the inflorescence unit in a grass is the spikelet, but the arrangement of spikelets may be described as a panicle. as well as other plants such as pistachio and mamoncillo. Botanists use the term paniculate in two ways: "having a true panicle inflorescence" as well as "having an inflorescence with the form but not necessarily the structure of a panicle".
A corymb is similar to a panicle with the same branching structure, but with the lower flowers having longer stems, thus giving a flattish top superficially resembling an umbel. Many species in the Maloideae, such as hawthorns and rowans, produce their flowers in corymbs.

First published in Venice in 1499, in an elegant page layout, with refined woodcut illustrations in an Early Renaissance style, Hypnerotomachia Poliphili presents a mysterious arcane allegory in which Poliphilo pursues his love Polia through a dreamlike landscape, and is, seemingly, at last reconciled with her by the Fountain of Venus.

The bird family Petroicidae includes roughly 45 species in about 15 genera. All are endemic to Australasia: New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand and numerous Pacific Islands as far east as Samoa. For want of an accurate common name, the family is often called the Australasian robins. Within the family the species are known not only as robins but as scrub-robins and flycatchers. They are, however, only distantly related to the Old World family Muscicapidae (to which other species with such names belong) and the monarch flycatchers (Monarchidae).

Elamkulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad (13 June 1909 – 19 March 1998), popularly EMS, was an Indian communist politician and theorist, who served as the first Chief Minister of Kerala state in 1957–59 and then again in 1967–69. As a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI), he became the first non-Indian National Congress chief minister in the Indian republic and his administration was the first democratically elected communist government in the world. In 1964, he led a faction of the CPI that broke away to form the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM).
As chief minister, Namboodiripad pioneered radical land and educational reforms in Kerala, which helped it become the country's leader in social indicators. It is largely due to his commitment and guidance that the CPM, of which he was Politburo member and general secretary for 14 years, has become such a domineering political force, playing a vital role in India's new era of coalition politics.[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-e-m-s-namboodiripad-1153957.html | work= The Independent | first=Kuldip | last= Singh | date= 2 April 1998 | title= Obituary: E.

Porgy and Bess is an opera, first performed in 1935, with music by George Gershwin, libretto by DuBose Heyward, and lyrics by DuBose Heyward and Ira Gershwin. It was based on DuBose Heyward's novel Porgy and subsequent play of the same title, which he co-wrote with his wife Dorothy Heyward. All three works deal with African-American life in the fictitious Catfish Row (based on the area of Cabbage RowCabbage Row – Charleston, SC – Attraction in South Carolina) in Charleston, South Carolina, in the early 1920s.
Originally conceived by George Gershwin as an "American folk opera", Porgy and Bess premiered in New York in the fall of 1935 and featured an entire cast of classically trained African-American singers—a daring artistic choice at the time. Gershwin chose the African-American musician Eva Jessye as the choral director for the opera. Gershwin explained why he called Porgy and Bess a folk opera in a 1935 New York Times article "Porgy and Bess is a folk tale. Its people naturally would sing folk music. When I first began work in the music I decided against the use of original folk material because I wanted the music to be all of one piece. Therefore I wrote my own spirituals and folksongs. But they are still folk music – and therefore, being in operatic form, Porgy and Bess becomes a folk opera."[tpl]cite news|last=Gershwin|first=George|title=Gershwin explains why his Porgy and Bess is called "folk opera"|url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/docview/531135886?accountid=14667|accessdate=April 10, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 2, 1935[/tpl] [tpl]Login required[/tpl]
The work was not widely accepted in the United States as a legitimate opera until 1976, when the Houston Grand Opera production of Gershwin's complete score established it as an artistic triumph. Nine years later, the Metropolitan Opera of New York gave their first performance of the work. This production was also broadcast as part of the ongoing Saturday afternoon live Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. The work is now considered part of the standard operatic repertoire and is regularly performed internationally. Despite this success, the opera has been controversial; some critics from the outset have considered it a racist portrayal of African Americans.
The song "Summertime" is the best-known selection from Porgy and Bess. Other popular and frequently recorded songs from the opera include "It Ain't Necessarily So", "Bess, You Is My Woman Now", "I Loves You, Porgy" and "I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'". The opera is admired for Gershwin's innovative synthesis of European orchestral techniques with American jazz and folk music idioms.
Porgy and Bess tells the story of Porgy, a disabled black beggar living in the slums of Charleston, South Carolina. It deals with his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown, her violent and possessive lover, and Sportin' Life, the drug dealer. Where the earlier novel and stage-play differ, the opera generally follows the stage-play.

[tpl]Former administrative units of Pakistan[/tpl]
Bahawalpur was a princely state, stretching along the southern bank of the Sutlej and Indus Rivers, with its capital city at Bahawalpur. The state was counted amongst the Punjab states. In 1941, it had a population of 1,341,209, living in an area of 45,911 km² (17,494 sq mi). The state was founded in 1802 by Nawab Mohammad Bahawal Khan Abbasi after the breakup of the Durrani Empire. His successor Nawab Mohammad Bahawal Khan Abbasi III signed the state's first subsidiary alliance with the British on 22 February 1833, guaranteeing the internal rule of the Nawab under British suzerainty. The alliance meant British control of Bahawalpur's external relations, but the state was never a British possession and until the Independence of Pakistan in 1947 was ruled by its own Nawabs. After one century of such relations, they were dissolved by the departure of the British, when the state opted to accede to the new dominion of Pakistan, with effect from 7 October 1947, becoming a princely state of Pakistan. It was merged into the province of West Pakistan on 14 October 1955.

[[Gemütlichkeit]]
CATEGORIES: Sociological terminology, German words and phrases

Gemütlichkeit ([tpl]IPA-de|ɡəˈmyːtlɪçkaɪt|-|De-gemuetlichkeit.ogg[/tpl]) means a situation that induces a cheerful mood, peace of mind, with connotation of belonging and social acceptance, coziness and unhurry.
Gemütlichkeit derives from gemütlich, the adjective of Gemüt, which means "heart, mind, temper, feeling" expressed by (and cognate with) English mood. This German abstract noun has been adopted into English.[tpl]cite book | title = Oxford dictionary of English| author = Soanes, C. and Stevenson, A. (ed.) | year=   2007| publisher = Oxford University Press[/tpl] The current meaning of the word derives from its use in the Biedermeier period. By the second half of the 19th century, it also became associated with a set of traits supposedly unique to Germans and German culture.   In the United States, the city of Jefferson, Wisconsin uses the phrase: "The Gemütlichkeit City" as its motto.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jeffersonchamberwi.com/ |title=Jefferson Chamber of Commerce | in Jefferson, WI |publisher=Jeffersonchamberwi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl]
The song The Bare Necessities from Disney's The Jungle Book (1967), where a cheerful Baloo explains how "a bear can rest at ease with just the bare necessities of life" was rendered as Probier’s mal mit Gemütlichkeit ("consider trying Gemütlichkeit") in the German version. As to talk of "bare necessities" has a certain ring of asceticism to it, the German text seems to convey Baloo's personality even more properly than the original, in spite of not rendering the pun.
In the 1973 English contract law case Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd, a holidaymaker sued after not receiving the Gemütlichkeit promised by the promotional literature for a package holiday to the Swiss Alps.
The word can be used in descriptions of holidays.[ref]
;
^ Gemütlichkeit PONS Online-Dictionary[/ref]  The communal connotations of Gemütlichkeit are also emphasized in some uses of the term.  For example, one academic
described it as a tradition of "public festivity" (in the form of a "mixture of music, food, and drink"), which "promoted community solidarity."  The Harlem Renaissance was then cited as of how a sense of Gemütlichkeit arises from a "mix of music, art and politics in service of community consciousness".
A less common use of Gemütlichkeit can be found in reference to the economic policy makers and analysts in the United States involved in influencing the decisions of the board of the Federal Reserve System.  With respect to the "inflation dampening effects of globalization", a Georgia Southern University professor writes that interpreting certain U.S. economic trends could "spell an end of the Gemütlichkeit — a situation in which cheap labor and money abroad as well as ever-increasing productivity at home had permitted an uninterrupted spell of controlled growth in overall prices".

[[Titania (moon)]]

CATEGORIES: Astronomical objects discovered in 1787, Moons of Uranus, Planemos, Titania (moon)

Titania is the largest of the moons of Uranus and the eighth largest moon in the Solar System at a diameter of [tpl]convert|1578|km[/tpl]. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Titania is named after the queen of the fairies in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies inside Uranus's magnetosphere.
Titania consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water may be present at the core–mantle boundary. The surface of Titania, which is relatively dark and slightly red in color, appears to have been shaped by both impacts and endogenic processes. It is covered with numerous impact craters reaching up to [tpl]convert|326|km[/tpl] in diameter, but is less heavily cratered than the surface of Uranus's outermost moon, Oberon. Titania probably underwent an early endogenic resurfacing event which obliterated its older, heavily cratered surface. Titania's surface is cut by a system of enormous canyons and scarps, the result of the expansion of its interior during the later stages of its evolution. Like all major moons of Uranus, Titania probably formed from an accretion disk which surrounded the planet just after its formation.
Infrared spectroscopy conducted from 2001 to 2005 revealed the presence of water ice as well as frozen carbon dioxide on the surface of Titania, which in turn suggested that the moon may possess a tenuous carbon dioxide atmosphere with a surface pressure of about one 10 trillionth of a bar. Measurements during Titania's occultation of a star put an upper limit on the surface pressure of any possible atmosphere at 10–20 nbar.
As of 2013, the Uranian system has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of Titania, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon’s surface.

San Jose ("Saint Joseph", [tpl]lang-es|San José[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-es|saŋ xoˈse|pron[/tpl]) is the capital of Costa Rica, head of the province of San José, and the nation's largest city. Located in the Central Valley, San José is the seat of national government, the focal point of political and economic activity, and the major transportation hub of this Central American nation. The population of San José Canton is 288,054,[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] though the metropolitan area stretches beyond the canton limits and comprises a third of the country's population.
Culturally, the city can be considered almost entirely European influenced, in part because of Spanish immigration soon after Costa Rica's discovery by Christopher Columbus, and the privileged classes which generally studied in Europe during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. This can be seen in the architecture of the city, namely theatres, museums and houses in the city centre. It is named in honor of Joseph of Nazareth.
Though few people live in the city center, it is the most important working area of the country, which brings in more than a million people daily.

He was a leader and principal thinker of Action Française, a political movement that was monarchist, anti-parliamentarist, and counter-revolutionary. Maurras' ideas greatly influenced National Catholicism and "nationalisme intégral". A major tenet of integral nationalism was put forth by Maurras as "a true nationalist places his country above everything". A political theorist, a major intellectual influence in early 20th-century Europe, his views anticipated some of the ideas of fascism.

Final Destination is a 2000 American horror film directed by James Wong and the first installment of the Final Destination series. The screenplay was written by Glen Morgan, Wong and Jeffrey Reddick, based on a story by Reddick. The film stars Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith and Tony Todd. Sawa portrays a teenager who "cheats death" after having a premonition of himself and others perishing in a plane explosion.  He uses his premonition to save himself and a handful of other passengers, but is stalked by Death, which gradually takes the lives of the passengers who should have perished on the plane.
The film was based on a spec script written by Reddick intended for The X-Files.  Wong and Morgan, The X-Files writing partners, were interested in the script and agreed to rewrite and direct a feature film, marking Wong's film directing debut.[tpl]cite video|people=James Wong (director)|title=Final Destination: A Look at Test Screening|medium=Videotape/DVD|publisher=New Line Cinema|location=New York, USA|accessdate=April 18, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite video|people = James Wong (director)|title = Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0780631684|medium=DVD|publisher=New Line Cinema|location=New York, USA|accessdate =April 18, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Special Feature ‘Final Destination’: Not So Final After All!|work=Bloody Disgusting|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/|accessdate=May 3, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Final Destination Press Book|work=Angelfire|url=http://www.angelfire.com/stars/chaddonella/flight180/press/book.html|accessdate=May 9, 2012[/tpl] Filming took place in New York and Vancouver, with additional scenes filmed in Toronto and San Francisco.

The Valle de los Caídos ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈbaʎe ðe los kaˈiðos[/tpl], "Valley of the Fallen") is a Catholic basilica and a monumental memorial in the municipality of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, erected at Cuelgamuros Valley in the Sierra de Guadarrama, near Madrid, conceived by Spanish general Francisco Franco to honor and bury those who fell during the Spanish Civil War. It was claimed by Franco that the monument was meant to be a "national act of atonement" and reconciliation. The Valley of the Fallen, as a surviving monument of Franco's rule, and its Catholic basilica remain controversial, particularly since 10% of the construction workforce were convicts, some of whom Popular Front political prisoners.
The monument, a landmark of 20th-century Spanish architecture, was designed by Pedro Muguruza and Diego Méndez on a scale to equal, according to Franco, "the grandeur of the monuments of old, which defy time and forgetfulness". Together with the Universidad Laboral de Gijón, it is the most prominent example of the original Spanish Neo-Herrerian style, which was intended to form part of a revival of Juan de Herrera's architecture, exemplified by the royal residence El Escorial. This uniquely Spanish architecture was widely used in public buildings of post-war Spain and is rooted in international classicism as exemplified by Albert Speer or Mussolini's Esposizione Universale Roma.
The monument precinct covers over [tpl]convert|3360|acre|km2[/tpl] of Mediterranean woodlands and granite boulders on the Sierra de Guadarrama hills, more than [tpl]convert|3000|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level and includes a Basilica, a Benedictine Abbey, a guest house, the Valley, and the Juanelos — four cylindrical monoliths dating from the 16th century. The most prominent feature of the monument is the towering 150-metre-high (500 ft) cross erected over a granite outcrop 150 meters over the basilica esplanade and visible from over [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] away.
Work started in 1940 and took over eighteen years to complete, the monument being officially inaugurated on April 1, 1959. According to the official ledger, the cost of the construction totaled 1.159 billion pesetas, funded through national lottery draws and donations.
The complex is owned and operated by the Patrimonio Nacional, the Spanish governmental heritage agency, and ranked as the third most visited monument of the Patrimonio Nacional in 2009. The Spanish socialdemocrat government closed the complex to visitors at the end of 2009, citing safety reasons connected to restoration on the facade. The decision was controversial, as the closure was attributed by some people to the Historical Memory Law enacted during José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's premiership,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.diariodelasierra.es/2010/02/11/una-decision-que-traera-polemica-ordenan-el-cierre-del-valle-de-los-caidos-por-tiempo-indefinido|title= Una decisión polémica: Ordenan el cierre del Valle de los Caídos por tiempo indefinido|accessdate=26 April 2010 |author= Diario de la Sierra|date= 10 February 2010|editorial= |language= |cite= [/tpl] and there were claims that the Benedictine community was being persecuted.http://www.elpais.com/solotexto/articulo.html?xref=20101115elpepinac_12&type=Tes&anchor=elpepunac The works include the Pietà sculpture prominently featured at the entrance of the crypt, using hammers and heavy machinery.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/04/23/madrid/1272015241.html|title= El desmontaje de 'La Piedad' del Valle de los Caídos, a 'mazazo limpio'|accessdate=26 April 2010 |work= El Mundo|date= 23 April 2010|editorial= |language= |cite= [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elvalledeloscaidos.es/|title= Images that show how the sculpture is being destroyed[/tpl]

Checkpoints were set up, according to socialist government sources, to prevent right-wing political manifestations such as Falange flags, in accordance with the Historical Memory Law. However, Catholic sources claimed that the government was simply trying to interfere with the celebration of the Mass. After Zapatero's electoral defeat and his leaving office on December 21, 2011, normal service at the Basilica resumed.

Aegidius (died 464 or 465) was a Gallo-Roman warlord of northern Gaul. He had been promoted as magister militum in Gaul under Aëtius around 450. An ardent supporter of Majorian, Aegidius rebelled when Ricimer deposed Majorian, engaging in several campaigns against the Visigoths and creating a Roman rump state that came to be known as the Domain of Soissons. After winning an important victory over the Visigoths he died suddenly, and was succeeded by his son Syagrius.
Ralph Mathisen points out the name of Aegidius' son, Syagrius, "would suggest that he was related to the Syagrii of Lyons, one of the oldest, most aristocratic families of Gaul. Aegidius, in fact, has been proposed as a grandson of Flavius Afranius Syagrius, consul in 382". Other Syagrii Mathisen lists with a connection to Gaul are a great-grandson of Afranius, who had an estate at Taionnacus near Lyons, and a wealthy Syagria of Lyons who was described by Magnus Felix Ennodius as thesaurus ecclesiae.Mathisen, "Prospographia II", Francia 7 (1980), pp. 608f, and notes

[[Appeal to emotion]]
CATEGORIES: Propaganda techniques, Appeals to emotion

Appeal to emotion or argumentum ad passiones is a logical fallacy which uses the manipulation of the recipient's emotions, rather than valid logic, to win an argument. The appeal to emotion fallacy uses emotions as the basis of an argument's position without factual evidence that logically supports the major ideas endorsed by the elicitor of the argument. Also, this kind of thinking may be evident in one who lets emotions and/or other subjective considerations influence one's reasoning process. This kind of appeal to emotion is a type of red herring and encompasses several logical fallacies, including:

The United Mine Workers of America (UMW or UMWA) is a North American labor union  best known for representing coal miners. Today, the Union also represents health care workers, truck drivers, manufacturing workers and public employees in the United States and Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umwa.org/index.php?q=content/who-we-are-where-we-work |title=Who We Are, Where We Work | United Mine Workers of America |publisher=Umwa.org |accessdate=2013-11-11[/tpl] Although its main focus has always been on workers and their rights, the UMW of today also advocates for better roads, schools, and universal health care.  By 2014, coal mining had largely shifted to open pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only 60,000 active coal miners.  The UMW was left with 35,000 members, of whom 20,000 were coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West Virginia. However it was responsible for pensions and medical benefits for 40,000 retired miners, and for 50,000 spouses and dependents.Kris Maher, “Mine Workers Union Shrinks but Boss Fights On, Wall Street Journal, January 9, 2014 p B1
The UMW was founded in Columbus, Ohio, on January 22, 1890, with the merger of two old labor groups, the Knights of Labor Trade Assembly No. 135 and the National Progressive Miners Union.The United Mine Workers of America: A Model of Industrial Solidarity? Edited by John M. Laslett 1994 Adopting the model of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), the union was initially established as a three-pronged labor tool: to develop mine safety; to improve mine workers' independence from the mine owners and the company store; and to provide miners with collective bargaining power.  After passage of the National Recovery Act in 1933, organizers spread throughout the United States to organize all coal miners into labor unions.  Under the powerful leadership of John L. Lewis, the UMW broke with the American Federation of Labor and set up its own federation, the CIO. Its organizers fanned out to organize major industries, including automobiles, steel, electrical equipment and rubber, and fought a series of battles with the AFL. The UMW grew to 800,000 members and was an element in the New Deal Coalition supporting Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lewis broke with Roosevelt in 1940 and left the CIO, leaving the UMW increasingly isolated in the labor movement.  During World War II the UMW was involved in a series of major strikes and threatened walkouts that angered public opinion and energized pro-business opponents.  After the war the UMW concentrated on gaining large increases in wages, medical services and retirement benefits for its shrinking membership.

An acrostic is a poem or other form of writing in which the first letter, syllable or word of each line, paragraph or other recurring feature in the text spells out a word or a message.  The word comes from the French acrostiche from post-classical Latin acrostichis, from Koine Greek ἀκροστιχίς, from Ancient Greek ἄκρος "highest, topmost" and στίχος "verse").Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed., s.v. acrostic; "The expected spelling of the English word, on the n., monostich n." As a form of constrained writing, an acrostic can be used as a mnemonic device to aid memory retrieval.

The Millers began working on Myst in [tpl]vgy|1991[/tpl] and released it for the Mac OS computer on September 24, 1993; it was developer Cyan's largest project to date. Remakes and ports of the game have been released for Sega Saturn, PlayStation, 3DO, Microsoft Windows, Atari Jaguar CD, CD-i, AmigaOS, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, iOS, and Nintendo 3DS.
Myst puts the player in the role of the Stranger, who uses a special book to travel to the island of Myst. There, the player uses other special books written by an artisan and explorer named Atrus to travel to several worlds known as "Ages". Clues found in each of these Ages help to reveal the back-story of the game's characters. The game has several endings, depending on the course of action the player takes.
Upon release, Myst was a surprise hit, with critics lauding the ability of the game to immerse players in the fictional world.

Action française ([tpl]IPA-fr|aksjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛz[/tpl], AF; [tpl]lang-en|French Action[/tpl]) is a French far right political movement. The name was also given to a journal associated with the movement.
The movement and the journal were founded by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois in 1899, as a nationalist reaction against the intervention of left-wing intellectuals on the behalf of Alfred Dreyfus. Charles Maurras quickly joined Action française and became its principal ideologist. Under the influence of Maurras, Action française became monarchist, counter-revolutionary (objecting to the legacy of the French Revolution) and anti-democratic, and supported integral nationalism and Catholicism.
Shortly after it was created, Action française tried to influence public opinion by turning its journal to a daily newspaper and by setting up various organizations. By 1914, it had become the best structured and the most vital nationalist movement in France. In the inter-war period, the movement enjoyed prestige and influence, but its popularity gradually declined as a result of the rise of fascism and of a rupture in the relations with the Catholic Church. During the Second World War, Action française supported the Vichy Regime and Marshal Philippe Pétain. After the fall of Vichy, its newspaper was banned and Maurras was sentenced to life imprisonment. The movement nevertheless continued to exist due to new publications and political movements. Although Action française is not a major force in the right as it used to be, its ideas have remained influential.

Indoor air quality (IAQ) is a term which refers to the air quality within and around buildings and structures, especially as it relates to the health and comfort of building occupants.
IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide, radon, volatile organic compounds), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, bacteria) or any mass or energy stressor that can induce adverse health conditions.  Source control, filtration and the use of ventilation to dilute contaminants are the primary methods for improving indoor air quality in most buildings. Residential units can further improve indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and area rugs. EPA has guidelines for frequency of cleaning based on traffic, number of household members, pets, children and smokers. Carpets and rugs act like an air filter and must be cleaned.
Determination of IAQ involves the collection of air samples, monitoring human exposure to pollutants, collection of samples on building surfaces and computer modelling of air flow inside buildings.
IAQ is part of IEQ (Indoor Environmental Quality), which includes IAQ as well as other physical and psychological aspects of life indoors (e.g., lighting, visual quality, acoustics, and thermal comfort).[tpl]cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=What's Your IQ on IAQ and IEQ?|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/products/whats_your_iq_on_iaq_and_ieq.aspx|accessdate=25 March 2013[/tpl]

Brazilian Integralism ([tpl]lang-pt|Integralismo brasileiro[/tpl]) was a fascist political movement in Brazil, created in October 1932. Founded and led by Plínio Salgado, a literary figure who was somewhat famous for his participation in the 1922 Modern Art Week, the movement had adopted some characteristics of European mass movements of those times, specifically of Italian Fascism, but differentiating itself from some forms of fascism in that Salgado did not preach racism. Despite the movement's slogan "Union of all races and all peoples", many militants held anti-semitic views. The name of the party created to support the ideology was Ação Integralista Brasileira (AIB, Brazilian Integralist Action). The reference to Integralism mirrored a traditionalist movement in Portugal, the Lusitan Integralism. For its symbol, the AIB used a flag with a white disk on a royal blue background, with an uppercase sigma (Σ) in its center.

[[Tit (bird)]]

CATEGORIES: Bird families, Paridae

The tits, chickadees, and titmice constitute Paridae, a large family of small passerine birds which occur in the northern hemisphere and Africa. Most were formerly classified in the genus Parus.
These birds are called either "chickadees" (onomatopoeic, derived from their distinctive "chick-a dee dee dee" alarm call) or "titmice" in North America, and just "tits" in the rest of the English-speaking world. The name titmouse is recorded from the 14th century, composed of the Old English name for the bird, mase (Proto-Germanic *maison, German Meise) and tit, denoting something small. The spelling was influenced by mouse in the 16th century. Emigrants to New Zealand presumably identified some of the superficially similar birds of the genus Petroica of the family Petroicidae, the Australian robins, as members of the tit family, giving them the title Tomtit although, in fact, they are not related.
These birds are mainly small stocky woodland species with short stout  bills. Some have crests. They range in length from 10 to 22 centimetres. They are adaptable birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects.[tpl]cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Perrins, C.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 202–203|isbn= 1-85391-186-0[/tpl] Many species will live around human habitation and come readily to bird feeders for nuts or seed, and learn to take other foods. In Britain, Great Tits and Blue Tits  learned to break open the foil caps sealing bottles of milk that had been delivered to homes to get at the cream floating on top.

[[Waxing]]
CATEGORIES: Depilation

''[tpl]Other uses[/tpl]
Waxing is a form of semi-permanent hair removal which removes the hair from the root. New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for four to six weeks, although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week due to some of their hair being on a different growth cycle. Almost any area of the body can be waxed, including eyebrows, face, pubic area (called bikini waxing), legs, arms, back, abdomen and feet. There are many types of waxing suitable for removing unwanted hair.
Strip waxing (soft wax) is accomplished by spreading a wax thinly over the skin. A cloth or paper strip is applied and pressed firmly, adhering the strip to the wax and the wax to the skin. The strip is then quickly ripped against the direction of hair growth, as parallel as possible to the skin to avoid trauma to the skin (i.e, bruising, broken capillaries, ingrown hairs caused by hair follicle trauma and lifting of skin).Waxing definition from Consumer Reports This removes the wax along with the hair.  
Strip-less wax (as opposed to strip wax), also referred to as hard wax, is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper strips. The wax then hardens when it cools, thus allowing the easy removal by a therapist without the aid of cloths. This waxing method is very beneficial to people who have sensitive skin. Strip-less wax does not adhere to the skin as much as strip wax does, thus making it a good option for sensitive skin as finer hairs are more easily removed because the hard wax encapsulates the hair as it hardens. The strip-less waxing method can also be less painful.

[[King's Daughters]]

CATEGORIES: New France

The King's Daughters ([tpl]lang-fr|filles du roi; filles du roy[/tpl]) is a term used to refer to the approximately 800 young French women who immigrated to New France between 1663 and 1673 as part of a program sponsored by Louis XIV. The program was designed to boost Canada's population both by encouraging male immigrants to settle there, and by promoting marriage, family formation and the birth of children. While women and girls certainly immigrated to New France both before and after this time period, they were not considered to be filles du roi, as the term refers to women and girls who were actively recruited by the government and whose travel to the colony was paid for by the king.[tpl]sfn|Lanctot|1952|pp=9, 102[/tpl] They were also occasionally known as the King's Wards, where "wards" meant those under the guardianship of another.

[[Calx]]

CATEGORIES: Inorganic chemistry

Calx is a residual substance, sometimes in the form of a fine powder, that is left when a metal or mineral combusts or is calcinated due to heat.
Calx, especially of a metal, is now known as an oxide.    According to the obsolete phlogiston theory, the calx was the true elemental substance, having lost its phlogiston in the process of combustion.
"Calx" is also sometimes used in older texts on artist's techniques to mean calcium oxide.

CATEGORIES: British Rail brands, British high-speed trains, Tilting trains, Articulated passenger trains, Abandoned rail transport projects in the United Kingdom

The Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was an experimental tilting high speed train developed by British Rail during the 1970s and early 1980s, for use on the West Coast Main Line, which contained a lot of curves. Notable among numerous technical advancements was the active tilting system, which the APT pioneered and has since appeared on other designs around the world. Other features of the APT such as the hydro-kinetic braking, used to stop the train within existing separations, have not been adopted.http://www.apt-p.com/aptbrakesystem.htm The experimental version APT-E achieved a new British railway speed record when on 10 August 1975 it hit 152.3 mph (245.1 km/h).
The introduction into service of the Advanced Passenger Train was to be a three-stage project. Phase 1, the development of an experimental APT, the APT-E, was completed. Phase 2, the introduction of three prototype trains, known as the APT-P, into revenue service on the Glasgow-London route, enjoyed only limited service due to bad publicity. Phase 3, the introduction of the Squadron fleet designated APT-S, did not occur.
The APT suffered from delays between the APT-E and APT-P, and then a lengthy series of in-service problems when the APT-P started testing. As these delays grew, the programme was dismissed as a white elephant and every minor problem was heavily covered in the press. It gathered a reputation that led to politicians wishing to distance themselves from the fray. Further funding for service entry became increasingly difficult to find, and the project eventually ground to a halt.

Bill Richmond (August 5, 1763 – December 28, 1829) was an African American boxer, born a slave in Cuckold's Town (now Richmondtown), Staten Island, New York.  His nickname was 'The Black Terror'.
During the American Revolutionary War, Richmond was the servant of Lord Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, who took him to England in 1777. On September 22, 1776, Richmond was the hangman who executed Nathan Hale.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/integrate/CHRON1.html |title=A CHRONOLOGY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MILITARY SERVICE |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=Integration of the Armed Forces |publisher=Redstone Arsenal Historical Information |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070301002822/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/integrate/CHRON1.html  |archivedate = 2007-03-01[/tpl] Later, Richmond was sent to school in Yorkshire and apprenticed to a cabinet maker in York. However, he made his career as a boxer, narrowly losing to later British and world champion Tom Cribb. After his retirement from boxing, he bought the Horse and Dolphin pub in Leicester Square and set up a boxing academy.
Richmond received no boxing tutoring and was entirely self-taught. By today's standards, Richmond, who weighed between [tpl]Convert|140|and|147|lbs|kg[/tpl], would have been a welterweight, and yet he often fought men who weighed [tpl]Convert|4|to|5|st|kg[/tpl] heavier than himself. He had excellent footwork and quick hands, which enabled him to avoid the big punches and outwork bigger fighters (the bob and weave technique). This was demonstrated in his fight with Tom Cribb, who was unable to land a punch in the early rounds. However, Cribb's superior weight and power eventually caught up with Richmond, who lost in the 60th round.
He was also a friend and coach of Tom Molineaux, another freed slave who took up boxing in England and fought Cribb twice for the title of world champion.
He died at his home in London, England in 1829.

Richmondtown, is a neighborhood on Staten Island in New York City, New York, in the United States.
Originally known as Coccles Town (sometimes misreckoned as Cuckolds Town) because of the abundance of oyster and clam shells found in the waters of the nearby Fresh Kills, Richmondtown gained its present name in 1728 when the village now preserved as Historic Richmond Town was founded. The village became the county seat of Richmond County, as Staten Island is alternatively known, and remained as such until the emergence of St. George soon after the ferries to Manhattan and Brooklyn began to proliferate at the latter site near the end of the 19th century.
Located at the base of Lighthouse Hill with New Dorp and Oakwood to the east, Richmondtown has seen much new home construction since the mid-1960s, and ranks as one of the most popular destinations for families seeking to relocate to Staten Island from New York City's other boroughs, especially Brooklyn.

The fact that both the Finnish centre-right and centre-left need the support from the party has meant that they have been able to affect politics of Finland in a larger scale than the party's actual size would suggest. The position of the Swedish language as one of two official languages in Finland and the Swedish-speaking minority's right to the Swedish culture are two of the results of the party's influence in Finnish politics.

[[Rudder]]
CATEGORIES: Aircraft controls, Watercraft components

A rudder is a device used to steer a ship, boat, submarine, hovercraft, aircraft, or other conveyance that moves through a medium (generally air or water). On an aircraft the rudder is used primarily to counter adverse yaw and p-factor and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane. A rudder operates by redirecting the fluid past the hull or fuselage, thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the craft. In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the craft's stern, tail, or after end. Often rudders are shaped so as to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag. On simple watercraft, a tiller—essentially, a stick or pole acting as a lever arm—may be attached to the top of the rudder to allow it to be turned by a helmsman. In larger vessels, cables, pushrods, or hydraulics may be used to link rudders to steering wheels. In typical aircraft, the rudder is operated by pedals via mechanical linkages or hydraulics.

[[Levinson recursion]]

CATEGORIES: Matrices, Numerical analysis

Levinson recursion or Levinson–Durbin recursion is a procedure in linear algebra to recursively calculate the solution to an equation involving a Toeplitz matrix. The algorithm runs in Θ(n2) time, which is a strong improvement over Gauss–Jordan elimination, which runs in Θ(n3). 
The Levinson-Durbin algorithm was proposed first by Norman Levinson in 1947, improved by James Durbin in 1960, and subsequently improved to 4n2 and then 3n2 multiplications by W. F. Trench and S. Zohar, respectively.
Other methods to process data include Schur decomposition and Cholesky decomposition. In comparison to these, Levinson recursion (particularly Split-Levinson recursion) tends to be faster computationally, but more sensitive to computational inaccuracies like round-off errors.
The Bareiss algorithm for Toeplitz matrices (not to be confused with the general Bareiss algorithm) runs about as fast as Levinson recursion, but it uses O(n2) space, whereas Levinson recursion uses only O(n) space.  The Bareiss algorithm, though, is  numerically stable,Bojanczyk et al. (1995).Brent (1999). whereas Levinson recursion is at best only weakly stable (i.e. it exhibits numerical stability for well-conditioned linear systems).Krishna & Wang (1993).
Newer algorithms, called asymptotically fast or sometimes superfast Toeplitz algorithms, can solve in Θ(n logpn) for various p (e.g. p = 2,http://www.maths.anu.edu.au/~brent/pd/rpb143tr.pdfhttp://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04182008-174330/unrestricted/kimitei_symon_k_200804.pdf p = 3 http://web.archive.org/web/20070418074240/http://saaz.cs.gsu.edu/papers/sfast.pdf). Levinson recursion remains popular for several reasons; for one, it is relatively easy to understand in comparison; for another, it can be faster than a superfast algorithm for small n (usually n

The Helicobacter genus belongs to class Epsilonproteobacteria, order Campylobacterales, family Helicobacteraceae and already involves >35 species.[tpl]cite book | author= Boyanova, L (editor) | year=2011 | title=Helicobacter pylori | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-84-4[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1099/00207713-39-4-397 | author = Goodwin CS, Armstrong JA, Chilvers T, et al. | title = Transfer of Campylobacter pylori and Campylobacter mustelae to Helicobacter gen. nov. as Helicobacter pylori comb. nov. and Helicobacter mustelae comb. nov., respectively| journal = Int.

[[Francesco Colonna]]

CATEGORIES: Italian Dominicans, 1430s births, 1527 deaths, Renaissance writers

Francesco Colonna (1433/1434 – 1527) was an Italian Dominican priest and monk who was credited with the authorship of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili by an acrostic in the text.
He lived in Venice, and preached at St. Mark's Cathedral.  Besides Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, he definitely wrote an Italian epic poem called Delfili Somnium, the "Dream of Delfilo' which went unpublished in his lifetime and was not published until 1959.  Colonna spent part of his life in the monastery of St. John and St. Paul in Venice, but the monastery was apparently not of the strictest observance and Colonna was granted leave to live outside its walls.
In Ian Caldwell's and Dustin Thomason's book, The Rule of Four, Francesco Colonna is said to be a Roman, rather than a monk and the true author of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.

The Irish Houses of Parliament ([tpl]lang-ga|Tithe na Parlaiminte[/tpl]), also known as the Irish Parliament House, today called the Bank of Ireland, College Green, due to its use by the bank, was the world's first purpose-built two-chamber parliament house. It served as the seat of both chambers (the Lords and Commons) of the Irish Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland for most of the 18th century until that parliament was abolished by the Act of Union of 1800, when Ireland became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
In the 17th century, Parliament settled at Chichester House, a town house in Hoggen Green (later College Green) formerly owned by Sir George Carew, Lord President of Munster and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland, which had been built on the site of a nunnery disbanded by King Henry VIII at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries. Carew's house, named Chichester House after its later owner Sir Arthur Chichester, was already a building of sufficient importance to have become a temporary home of the Kingdom of Ireland's law courts during the Michaelmas law term in 1605. Most famously, the legal documentation facilitating the Plantation of Ulster had been signed in the house on 16 November 1612.

[[Matrimonial regime]]

CATEGORIES: Civil law (legal system), Marriage, Property law

Matrimonial regimes, or marital property systems, are systems of property ownership between spouses providing for the creation or absence of a marital estate, and if created, what properties are included in that estate, how and by whom it is managed, and how it will be divided and inherited at the end of the marriage. Matrimonial regimes are applied either by operation of law or by way of prenuptial agreement in Civil law countries, and depend on the lex domicilii of the spouses at the time of or immediately following the wedding. (See e.g. Quebec Civil Code and French Civil Code, arts. 431-492.). In Common law countries, the default and only matrimonial regime is separation of property, though some U.S. states, known as community property states, are an exception.
Civil-law and bijuridical jurisdictions, including Quebec, Louisiana, France, South Africa, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and many others, have statutory default matrimonial regimes, in addition to or, in some cases, in lieu of regimes that can only be contracted by prenuptial agreements. Generally, couples marry into some form of community of property by default, or instead contract out under separation of property or some other regime through a prenuptial agreement passed before a Civil-law notary or other public officer solemnizing the marriage.  Five countries, including the Netherlands, have signed on to the Hague Convention on the Law applicable to Matrimonial Property Regimes, which entered into force on 1 September 1992, which allows spouses to choose not only the regimes offered by their country, but also any regime in force in the country where at least one is a citizen or resident or where marital real estate is situated.

[[In-place algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Algorithms

In computer science, an in-place algorithm (or in Latin in situ) is an algorithm which transforms input using a data structure with a small, constant amount of extra storage space. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place (or ex situ in Latin).
An algorithm is sometimes, informally, called in-place as long as it overwrites its input with its output. In reality, this is not sufficient (as the case of quicksort demonstrates), nor is it necessary; the output space may be constant, or may not even be counted, for example if the output is to a stream. On the other hand, sometimes it may be more practical to count the output space in determining whether an algorithm is in-place, such as in the first reverse example below; this makes it difficult to strictly define in-place algorithms. In theory applications such as log-space reductions, it's more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it's more essential that the output is write-only).

[[Family patrimony]]
CATEGORIES: Civil law (legal system)

Family patrimony is a type of civil law patrimony that is created by marriage or civil union (where recognized) which creates a bundle of entitlements and obligations that must be shared by the spouses or partners upon divorce, annulment, dissolution of marriage or dissolution of civil union, when there must be a division of property. It is similar to the common law concept of community property.


End of paragraph.[]

[[Community property]]
CATEGORIES: Property law, Marriage, Property law in the United States

Community property is a marital property regime that originated in civil law jurisdictions and is now also found in some common law jurisdictions. The states of the United States that recognize community property are primarily in the West; it was inherited from Mexico's ganancial community system,The half-borrowed term ganancial (from Spanish sociedad de gananciales) was used in some early U.S. community property opinions, such as Stramler v. Coe, 15 Tex. 211, 215 (1855); it has been used occasionally in some more recent opinions such as Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, [tpl]ussc|439|572|1979[/tpl].  which itself was inherited from Spanish law (a Roman-derived civil law system) and ultimately from the Visigoths.Jean A. Stuntz, Hers, His, and Theirs: Community Property Law in Spain and Early Texas, (Lubbock, Texas: Texas Tech University Press, 2005), 1-31. This source explains at length the Visigoths' legal protections for the property rights of married women and how later legal systems on the Iberian peninsula continued such rights. While under Spanish rule Louisiana adopted the ganancial community system of acquests and gains, which replaced the traditional French community of movables and acquests in its civil law system.The author of the Louisiana Code was Moreau Lislet; see Hans W. Baade, "Transplants of Laws and of Lawyers", Doc, retrieved 3 Dec. 2010 .
In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances)—the community, or communio bonorum—is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.See v. See, 64 Cal. 2d 778 (1966). Chief Justice Roger J. Traynor of the Supreme Court of California wrote: "If funds used for acquisitions during marriage cannot otherwise be traced to their source and the husband who has commingled property is unable to establish that there was a deficit in the community accounts when the assets were purchased, the presumption controls that property acquired by purchase during marriage is community property. The husband may protect his separate property by not commingling community and separate assets and income. Once he commingles, he assumes the burden of keeping records adequate to establish the balance of community income and expenditures at the time an asset is acquired with commingled property." The See family, of course, was the family that founded See's Candies, a major manufacturer and retailer of candy on the West Coast of the United States. 
Division of community property may take place by item, by splitting all items or by values. In some jurisdictions, such as California, a 50/50 division of community property is strictly mandated by statute,See California Family Code section 2550. meaning that the focus then shifts to whether particular items are to be classified as community or separate property. In other jurisdictions, such as Texas, a divorce court may decree an "equitable distribution" of community property, which may result in an unequal division of such. In non-community property states property may be divided by equitable distribution. Generally speaking, the property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property). See division of property. Division of community debts may not be the same as division of community property. For example, in California, community property is required to be divided "equally" while community debt is required to be divided "equitably".See In re Marriage of Eastis, 47 Cal. App. 3d 459 (1975).
Property that is owned by one spouse before the marriage is the separate property of that spouse, unless the property is "transmuted" into community property. The rules for this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

[[International human rights law]]
CATEGORIES: Human rights instruments, Human rights, International law, Human rights legislation, Sociocultural globalization

International human rights law is the body of international law designed to promote and protect human rights at the international, regional and domestic levels. As a form of international law, international human rights law is primarily made up of treaties, agreements between states intended to have binding legal effect between the parties that have agreed to them; and customary international law, rules of law derived from the consistent conduct of states acting out of the belief that the law required them to act that way. Other international human rights instruments while not legally binding contribute to the implementation, understanding and development of international human rights law and have been recognised as a source of political obligation.Human rights, A very short introduction p42 – replace this with a better reference later
Enforcement of international human rights law can occur on either a domestic, a regional or an international level. States that ratify human rights treaties commit themselves to respecting those rights and ensuring that their domestic law is compatible with international legislation. When domestic law fails to provide a remedy for human rights abuses, parties may be able to resort to regional or international mechanisms for enforcing human rights.
International human rights law is closely related to, but distinct from international humanitarian law. They are closely related because the substantive norms they contain are often similar or related: Both provide, for example, a protection against torture. They are distinct because they are regulated by legally discrete frameworks, and usually operate in different contexts and regulate different relationships. Generally, human rights are understood to regulate the relationship between states and individuals in the context of ordinary life, while humanitarian law regulates the actions of a belligerent state and those parties with which it comes into contact, both hostile and neutral, within the context of an armed conflict.[tpl]cite book |author=Provost, René |title=International human rights and humanitarian law |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2002 |page=8 |isbn=0-511-04186-1 |oclc= [/tpl]

[[Exploration]]

CATEGORIES: Exploration, Historical eras

Exploration is the act of searching for the purpose of discovery of information or resources. Exploration occurs in all non-sessile animal species, including humans. In human history, its most dramatic rise was during the Age of Discovery when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world, largely in a pursuit of material wealth. Since then, major explorations after the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery.
In scientific research, exploration is one of three purposes of empirical research (the other two being description and explanation). The term is commonly used metaphorically. For example, an individual may speak of exploring the Internet, sexuality, etc.

Even though he retired from Pro Mountain biking in 1996, he continued competing in endurance competitions like the XTERRA Triathlon, and regular road triathlons. While in professional mountain biking, Overend earned the nicknames "Deadly Nedly" and "The Lung", because he was very difficult to beat and for his phenonomenal aerobic endurance at altitude (especially so for a man of his age), respectively.

The Brooks Range (Athabaskan Gwazhał[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl]) is a mountain range in far northern North America stretching some 1100 km (700 mi) from west to east across northern Alaska into Canada's Yukon Territory.  Reaching an elevation exceeeding 2,700 m (9,000 ft), the range is believed to be approximately 126 million years old.  
In the United States, these mountains are considered an extension of the Rocky Mountains, whereas in Canada they are considered separate, the northern border of the Rocky Mountains regarded as the Liard River far to the south in the province of British Columbia.The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 23, page 618 (Grolier 2000).Safire, William. The New York Times guide to essential knowledge: a desk reference for the curious mind, page 623 (Macmillan 2007 ).
While the range is mostly uninhabited, the Dalton Highway and Trans-Alaska Pipeline System run through the Atigun Pass (1,415 m, 4,643 ft) on their way to the oil fields at Prudhoe Bay on Alaskas's North Slope . The Alaska Native villages of Anaktuvuk and Arctic Village, as well as the very small communities of Coldfoot, Wiseman,  Bettles, and Chandalar Lake, are the range's only settlements. In the far west, near the Wulik River in the De Long Mountains is the Red Dog mine, largest zinc mine in the world.
The range was named by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1925 after Alfred Hulse Brooks, chief USGS geologist for Alaska from 1903 to 1924.
Various historical records also referred to the range as the Arctic Mountains, Hooper Mountains, Meade Mountains and Meade River Mountains; the Canadian portion is still often referred to as the British Mountains, a part of Ivvavik National Park.

[[Oil field]]
CATEGORIES: Oil fields

An "oil field" or "oilfield" is a region with an abundance of oil wells extracting petroleum (crude oil) from below ground. Because the oil reservoirs typically extend over a large area, possibly several hundred kilometres across, full exploitation entails multiple wells scattered across the area. In addition, there may be exploratory wells probing the edges, pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support facilities.
Because an oil field may be remote from civilization, establishing a field is often an extremely complicated exercise in logistics. This goes beyond requirements for drilling, to include associated infrastructure. For instance, workers require housing to allow them to work onsite for months or years. In turn, housing and equipment require electricity and water. In cold regions, pipelines may need to be heated. Also, excess natural gas may be burned off if there is no way to make use of it—which requires a furnace, chimney and pipes to carry it from the well to the furnace.
Thus, the typical oil field resembles a small, self-contained town in the midst of a landscape dotted with drilling rigs and/or the pump jacks, which are known as "nodding donkeys" because of their bobbing arm. Several companies, such as BJ Services, Bechtel, Esso, Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes and Halliburton, have organizations that specialize in the large-scale construction of the infrastructure and providing specialized services required to operate a field profitably.
More than 40,000 oil fields are scattered around the globe, on land and offshore. The largest are the Ghawar Field in Saudi Arabia and the Burgan Field in Kuwait, with more than 60 billion barrels [tpl]nowrap|(9.5×109 m3)[/tpl] estimated in each. Most oil fields are much smaller. According to the US Department of Energy (Energy Information Administration), as of 2003 the US alone had over 30,000 oil fields.
In the modern age, the location of oil fields with proven oil reserves is a key underlying factor in many geopolitical conflicts.[tpl]Cite book |first=Daniel |last=Yergin |title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power |year=1991 |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=0-671-50248-4 [/tpl]
The term "oilfield" is also used as a shorthand to refer to the entire petroleum industry. However, it is more accurate to divide the oil industry into three sectors:  upstream (crude production from wells and separation of water from oil), midstream (pipeline and tanker transport of crude) and downstream (refining and marketing of refined products).

Strike Out, (1969–1998), North American Harness racing champion 
Strike Out was born in 1969 at Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and is by Bret Hanover out of the mare Golden Miss.
He was purchased at a yearling auction for $15,000 by Beejay Stables of Oshawa, Ontario, a partnership between harness-racing trainer/driver John Hayes and Montreal, Quebec textile executives, the Shapiro brothers, Robert, Conrad, and Leo. For Hayes, who recognized the horse's talent, it was an opportunity for which he had been waiting a long time. 
As a two-year-old pacer, Strike Out earned more money than any horse in his age group and was named  by Harness Tracks of America (HTA) and the United States Trotting Association (USTA) as the top harness horse his age in North America. In 1972 he became the first horse to win a Canadian harness race with a $100,000 purse. That year he went on to race in the United States, capturing the important Adios Stakes in a dead heat with Jay Time,Rare dead heat in Adios Stakes the Fox Stake, the Roosevelt Futurity,Strike Out wins $81,216 Futurity the Beaver Pace and other major races all over North America, including the Prix D'Été at Montreal's Blue Bonnets Raceway. By the end of the summer, his owners had set their sights on the most prestigious race of all, the Little Brown Jug in Delaware, Ohio. 
On September 21, 1972, driven by Keith Waples, Strike Out became the first Canadian owned horse to win the Little Brown Jug. Not only did he do it in straight heats, but he won setting a world recordStrike Out wins Little Brown Jug over a half-mile track for a 3-year-old pacer in a time of 1:56 3/5. Strike Out was named by the HTA and USTA as top three-year-old.
After compiling a 29-9-1 record in 44 races, Strike Out was retired to stud at the end of the 1972 season. While retaining a half interest in him, Beejay Stables sold the $15,000 bargain-basement colt for $1.5 million. His son, Striking Image became the first 2 year old standardbred ever to run a mile in the time of 1:55. Strike Out also went on to sire 1979 Jug winner Hot Hitter.
Strike Out died on July 4, 1998 and was buried in the horse cemetery at Castleton Farms.

Vibrio is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria possessing a curved rod shape (comma shape), several species of which can cause foodborne infection, usually associated with eating undercooked seafood.  Typically found in saltwater, Vibrio spp. are facultative anaerobes that test positive for oxidase and do not form spores.  All members of the genus are motile and have polar flagella with sheaths.  Recent phylogenies have been constructed based on a suite of genes (multilocus sequence analysis).[tpl]Cite journal |title =Phylogeny and Molecular Identification of Vibrios on the Basis of Multilocus Sequence Analysis[/tpl]
The name Vibrio derives from Filippo Pacini who isolated microorganisms he called "vibrions" from cholera patients in 1854, because of their motility.

Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties, (Columbia University Press, 1996), 73. founded by Saladin and centered in Egypt. The dynasty ruled much of the Middle East during the 12th and 13th centuries CE. Saladin had been the vizier of Fatimid Egypt before he brought an end to Fatimid rule in 1171. In 1174, he proclaimed himself Sultan following the death of the Ayyubids' former master, Zengid sultan Nur al-Din.Eiselen, Frederick Carl, Sidon: A Study in Oriental History, (New York, 1907), 89. The Ayyubids spent the next decade launching conquests throughout the region and by 1183, the territories under their control included Egypt, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and the North African coast up to the borders of modern-day Tunisia. Most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem fell to Saladin after his victory at the Battle of Hattin in 1187. However, the Crusaders regained control of Palestine's coastline in the 1190s.
After the death of Saladin, his sons contested control over the sultanate, but Saladin's brother al-Adil eventually established himself as Sultan in 1200. In the 1230s, the Ayyubid rulers of Syria attempted to assert their independence from Egypt and remained divided until the Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored Ayyubid unity by taking over most of Syria, except Aleppo, by 1247. By then, local Muslim dynasties had driven out the Ayyubids from Yemen, the Hejaz, and parts of Mesopotamia. After his death in 1249, as-Salih Ayyub was succeeded in Egypt by al-Mu'azzam Turanshah. However, the latter was soon overthrown by the Mamluk generals who had successfully repelled a Crusader invasion of the Nile Delta. This effectively ended Ayyubid power in Egypt and a number of attempts by the rulers of Syria, led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo, to recover it failed. In 1260, the Mongols sacked Aleppo and wrested control of what remained of the Ayyubid territories soon after. The Mamluks, who forced out the Mongols after the destruction of the Ayyubid dynasty, maintained the Ayyubid principality of Hama until deposing its last ruler in 1341.
During their relatively short tenure, the Ayyubids ushered in an era of economic prosperity in the lands they ruled and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in the Islamic world. This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim dominance in the region by constructing numerous madrasas (schools of Islamic law) in their major cities.

Kitano owns his own talent agency and production company, Office Kitano, which launched Tokyo Filmex in 2000.
Some of Kitano's earlier films are dramas about Yakuza gangsters or the police. Described by critics as using an acting style that is highly deadpan or a camera style that approaches near-stasis, Kitano often uses long takes where little appears to be happening, or editing that cuts immediately to the aftermath of an event. Many of his films express a bleak or nihilistic philosophy, but they are also filled with humor and affection for their characters. Kitano's films leave paradoxical impressions and can seem controversial. The Japanese public knows him primarily as a TV host and comedian. He hosts a weekly television program called Beat Takeshi's TV Tackle, a kind of panel discussion among entertainers and politicians regarding controversial current events.

Manzai usually involves two performers (manzaishi)—a straight man (tsukkomi) and a funny man (boke)—trading jokes at great speed.  Most of the jokes revolve around mutual misunderstandings, double-talk, puns and other verbal gags.
In recent times, manzai has often been associated with the Osaka region, and manzai comedians often speak in the Kansai dialect during their acts. 
Yoshimoto Kogyo, a large entertainment conglomerate based in Osaka, introduced Osaka-style manzai to Tokyo audiences, and coined the term "漫才" (one of several ways of writing the word manzai in Japanese; see "etymology" below) in 1933.

John G. Hayes (1917–1998), was a harness racing driver/trainer/owner.
Born in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, he was the son of a dairy farmer who went on to become a prominent figure in harness racing and the first Canadian to be selected to the Little Brown Jug's Wall of Fame. His greatest accomplishment was in training horses in particular when he developed the great champion, Strike Out. 
A longtime director of the Canadian Trotting Association, for ten years John Hayes served as its president and was Vice-Chairman of the Ontario Racing Commission.
The managing partner of Beejay Stables in Oshawa, it had been Hayes' lifelong dream to win the Little Brown Jug. Famous for having told a newspaper reporter: "I'd rather win the Little Brown Jug than go to heaven," when he died in 1998, the Little Brown Jug itself, won by Strike Out in 1972, was placed at the head of his casket.
In 1991, John Hayes was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

[[Little Brown Jug (horse racing)]]
CATEGORIES: Recurring sporting events established in 1946, Harness races in the United States, Visitor attractions in Delaware County, Ohio, Horse racing in Ohio

The Little Brown Jug is a harness race for three-year-old pacing standardbreds hosted by the Delaware County Agricultural Society since 1946 at the County Fairgrounds in Delaware, Ohio. The race takes place every year on the third Thursday after Labor Day. Along with the Hambletonian, a race for trotters, it is one of the two most coveted races for standardbred horses. Little Brown Jug, a pacer, who won nine consecutive races and became a USTA Hall of Fame Immortal in 1975 had the world’s premium pacing event is named in his honour.THE EARLY CHAMPIONS Retrieved 2010-11-19
The founding of the jug which actually set its roots more than 50 years ago, is as unique as it is interesting. It began in 1937 in Morrow County for one year, then later moved to Delaware County fairground in 1938-1939. Some people believe it has always been in Delaware but it originally started in Morrow County.
Two years later a half-mile track was built and provided the stage for harness racing. R.K. McNamara, a local contractor, designed and built the lightning fast track. Attorney Joe Neville, whose family had been identified with the standardbred sport for many years, was successful in obtaining Grand Circuit dates for the new Delaware track. Neville, concerned over the years by the emphasis placed on the trotter, turned his efforts toward showcasing the pacers, particularly the 3-year-olds. The Little Brown Jug Society was formed to stage the Grand Circuit meeting. Then came the birth of The Little Brown Jug, named through a newspaper contest, with its previews in 1944 and 1945.
The initial jug in 1946, with a purse of $35,358, was won by Ensign Hanover with Delaware's Wayne "Curly" Smart driving. Smart, a most successful trainer-driver on the Grand Circuit, was later to become an integral part of the Jug's operation as the track superintendent.
Over the years the track monopolized the half-mile record section with world standard performances, mainly through Smart's skill in maintaining the fastest racing strip of its size in the country.
The Little Brown Jug is contested in heats. The first heat is split into several divisions, with the top finishers in each division returning to contest the second heat. A horse wins the Little Brown Jug by winning both heats. If a horse does not win both heats, a race off is conducted between the first heat division winners, and the winner of the second heat, to determine the champion.
The Little Brown Jug is the second leg of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers.
Ever since 1946 the administrators of the little brown jug have glazed the winners of the horse race on a jug.  In 2005, they ran out of room on the first jug and had to make another one.  This time, instead of making it out of clay, they made it out of plastic so it would be lighter.  The little brown jug is played during the Delaware county fair.
It has been said that the way the little brown jug is operated makes it so that once the horse has raced, it can never race well again.

[[Wakeskating]]
CATEGORIES: Towed water sports, Boardsports, Sports originating in Australia, Wakeboarding

Wakeskating is a water sport and an adaptation of wakeboarding that employs a similar design of board manufactured from maple or from fibreglass. Unlike wakeboarding, the rider is not bound to the board in any way, which gives the sport its own unique challenges. Instead, the top surface of the board is covered with griptape, (in a similar fashion to a skateboard) or a soft, high-traction, foam, usually referred to as EVA foam, covering that is kinder to riders in the inevitable crashes and also allows a rider to ride barefoot. Riders usually wear shoes while riding to afford themselves extra purchases on the board, similar to skateboarding.The speed at which riders wakeskate behind a PWC (Personal Water Craft: Jet ski), boat, cable system, or winch is generally 16 – 22 miles per hour. However, this depends on water conditions, the weight of the rider, their proficiency in the sport as well as a preference matter of the rider.
Some of the earliest activity resembling wakeskating dates back to the late 1970s and early 1980s with freeboarding or wakesurfing.  Originally, riders would surf behind boats with long boards, but eventually the sport evolved towards boards that were much shorter (ex:4'8) which allowed riders to launch airs off the wake and even ollie.  However, the watersports industry leaned strongly towards bindings, resulting in the focused evolution of wakeboarding.  Wakeskating would eventually begin to take notice in the mid 1990s, and the growth continued. It is increasingly popular in youth culture across the globe, but is prevalent mainly in its country of origin, the United States. An aspect of wakeskating that draws many aficionados to it, as opposed to wakeboarding, is progression without the need for the large and extremely expensive boats (necessary to create the wake for wakeboarders to achieve maximum air time). An alternative to using wakeboard boats to tow riders is using high powered jet skis.  This method of watercraft can provide an adequate tow, with little or no wake. Jet skis are better for shallow water or where water obstacles are available to perform tricks on. Recently, the use of a high speed winch designed for wakeskating and wakeboarding has allowed riders to bring the sports to small ponds or other waterways where boats and jet skis cannot operate.
Wakeskating tricks are inherently more technical than wakeboarding. The tricks are based firmly on skateboarding as opposed to snowboarding. Numerous tournaments and competitions exist throughout the world for the sport of wakeskating.

CATEGORIES: Judiciary of France, National supreme courts

The Court of Cassation ([tpl]lang-fr|Cour de cassation[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-fr|kuʁ.də.kɑ.saˈsjɔ̃[/tpl]) is one of France's courts of last resort having jurisdiction over all matters triable in the judicial stream with scope of certifying questions of law and review in determining miscarriages of justice. The Court is located in the Palais de Justice building in Paris.
The Court is the court of final appeal for civil and criminal matters. As a judicial court, it does not hear cases involving claims against administrators or public bodies which generally fall within the purview of administrative courts, for which the Council of State acts as the supreme court of appeal. Nor does the Court adjudicate constitutional issues; instead, constitutional review lies solely with the Constitutional Council. Thus, France does not have one senior adjudicatory body but four (including the Jurisdictional Disputes Tribunal), and collectively, these four courts form the topmost tier of the court system.
The Court was established in 1790 under the name Tribunal de cassation during the French Revolution, and its original purpose was to act as a court of error with revisory jurisdiction over lower provincial prerogative courts (Parlements).Serge Guinchard, André Varinard and Thierry Debard, Institutions juridictionnelles (= Judicials institutions), 11th edn., (Paris: Dalloz, 2011). However, much about the Court continues the earlier Paris Parlement Court.

[[Multiple granularity locking]]
CATEGORIES: Concurrency control

In computer science, multiple granularity locking (MGL) is a locking method used in database management systems (DBMS) and relational databases. 
In MGL, locks are set on objects that contain other objects.  MGL exploits the hierarchical nature of the contains relationship.  For example, a database may have files, which contain pages, which further contain records.  This can be thought of as a tree of objects, where each node contains its children.  A lock on such as a shared or exclusive lock locks the targeted node as well as all of its descendants. 
Multiple granularity locking is usually used with non-strict two-phase locking to guarantee serializability.

[[Philanthropy]]

CATEGORIES: Philanthropy

Philanthropy etymologically means "love of humanity" in the sense of caring, nourishing, developing and enhancing "what it is to be human" on both the benefactors' (by identifying and exercising their values in giving and volunteering) and beneficiaries' (by benefiting) parts. The most conventional modern definition is  "private initiatives, for public good, focusing on quality of life". This combines the social scientific aspect developed in the 20th century with the original humanistic tradition, and serves to contrast philanthropy with business (private initiatives for private good, focusing on material prosperity) and government (public initiatives for public good, focusing on law and order).These distinctions are analyzed by Olivier Zunz, Philanthropy in America: A History. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2012, pp. ???.
Instances of philanthropy commonly overlap with instances of charity, though not all charity is philanthropy, or vice versa.  The difference commonly cited is that charity relieves the pains of social problems, whereas philanthropy attempts to solve those problems at their root causes (the difference between giving a hungry man a fish, and teaching him how to fish for himself).  A person who practices philanthropy is called a philanthropist.

Teia (died 552 or 553), also known as Teja, Theia, Thila, Thela, Teias, was the last Ostrogothic king in Italy.
Apparently a military officer serving under Totila, Teia was chosen as successor and raised over a shield after Totila was slain in the Battle of Taginae (also known as the Battle of Busta Gallorum) in July 552. On his way fleeing to southern Italy, he gathered support from prominent figures within Totila's armies including Scipuar, Gundulf (Indulf), Gibal and Ragnaris to make his last stand against the Byzantine eunuch general Narses at the Battle of Mons Lactarius, south of present-day Naples, near Nuceria Alfaterna, in October 552 or early 553. The Ostrogothic army was defeated once again. Teia was slain, his brother Aligern surrendered. Scipuar and Gibal were likely also killed. Gundulf and Ragnaris escaped from the field; the latter was mortally wounded after a failed assassination by an agent of Narses.
With that defeat, organized Ostrogothic resistance ended. Although the last attested Gothic noble Widin revolted in northern Italy in 550s and was captured in 561 or 562, the Ostrogoths faded into obscurity.

[[Standard streams]]

CATEGORIES: Unix

In computer programming, standard streams are preconnected input and output streams (communication channels) between a computer program and its environment when it begins execution. The three I/O connections are called standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr). Originally I/O happened via a physically connected system console (input via keyboard, output via monitor), but standard streams abstract this. When a command is executed via a shell, the streams are typically connected to the text terminal in which the shell is running, but can be changed with redirection, particularly via a pipeline. However, daemons do not have an associated terminal or standard streams. More generally, a child process will inherit the standard streams of its parent process.

The Western Marsh-harrier (Circus aeruginosus) is a large harrier, a bird of prey from temperate and subtropical western Eurasia and adjacent Africa. It is also known as the Eurasian Marsh-harrier.
Formerly, a number of relatives were included in C. aeruginosus, which was then known as "Marsh Harrier". The related taxa are now generally considered to be separate species: the Eastern Marsh-harrier (C. spilonotus) and the possibly distinct Papuan Harrier (C. (s.) spilothorax) of eastern Asia and the Wallacea, the Swamp Harrier (C. approximans) of Australasia and the Madagascar Marsh-harrier (C. maillardi) of the western Indian Ocean islands.
The Western Marsh-harrier is often divided into two subspecies, the widely migratory C. a. aeruginosus which is found across most of its range, and C. a. harterti which is resident all-year in north-west Africa.

[[Railroad car]]

CATEGORIES: Rolling stock

A railroad car or railcar (American and Canadian English),[tpl]efn|name=US usage[/tpl], railway wagon or railway carriage (UK and IUR), is a vehicle used for the carrying of cargo or passengers on a rail transport system (a railroad/railway). Such cars, when coupled together and hauled by one or more locomotives, form a train. Alternatively, some passenger cars are self-propelled in which case they may be either single railcars or make up multiple units.
The term "car" is commonly used by itself in American English when a rail context is implicit. Indian English sometimes uses "bogie" in the same manner,Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary: bogie though the term has other meanings in other variants of English.
Although some cars exist for the railroad's own use – for track maintenance purposes, for example – most carry a revenue-earning load of passengers or freight, and may be classified accordingly as passenger cars or coaches on the one hand or freight cars (or wagons) on the other.

Moral rights are rights of creators of copyrighted works generally recognized in civil law jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some common law jurisdictions. They include the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work."moral, adj.". OED Online. September 2011. Oxford University Press. 25 October 2011. The preserving of the integrity of the work bars the work from alteration, distortion, or mutilation. Anything else that may detract from the artist's relationship with the work even after it leaves the artist's possession or ownership may bring these moral rights into play. Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. Even if an artist has assigned his or her copyright rights to a work to a third party, he or she still maintains the moral rights to the work.Sundara Rajan, Mira T.

Phlox ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|f|l|ɒ|k|s[/tpl]; Greek φλόξ "flame"; plural "phlox" or "phloxes", Greek φλόγες phlóges) is a genus of 67 species of perennial and annual plants in the family Polemoniaceae. They are found mostly in North America (one in Siberia) in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Some flower in spring, others in summer and fall. Flowers may be pale blue, violet, pink, bright red, or white. Many are fragrant.
Fertilized flowers typically produce one relatively large seed. The fruit is a longitudinally dehiscent capsule with three or more valves that sometimes separate explosively.[tpl]cite book|title=Flowering plants, Dicotyledons: Celastrales, Oxalidales, Rosales, Cornales, Ericales|author=Klaus Kubitzki|publisher=Springer|year=2004|page=311|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=O-tHGAaaf2cC&pg=PA311&lpg=PA311&dq=polemoniaceae+dehiscence&source=bl&ots=S0is6tGltd&sig=HMQFiZLDMxmqmcnFlmOw89G9c9s&hl=en&ei=wiWkTv_xDO_J0AHuuM3RBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
Some species such as P. paniculata (Garden Phlox) grow upright, while others such as P. subulata (Moss Phlox, Moss Pink, Mountain Phlox) grow short and matlike.
The foliage of Phlox is a food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Dot Moth, Gazoryctra wielgusi, Hummingbird Hawk-moth and Schinia indiana (which feeds exclusively on P. pilosa).  Phlox species are also a popular food source for groundhogs, rabbits and deer.

[[List of basilicas]]
CATEGORIES: Ecclesiastical basilicas, Lists of church buildings

This is a complete list of basilicas of the Roman Catholic Church. A basilica is a church with certain privileges conferred on it by the Pope.
Not all churches with "basilica" in their title actually have the ecclesiastical status, which can lead to confusion, since it is also an architectural term for a church-building style.
In the 18th century, the term took on a canonical sense, unrelated to this architectural style. Basilicas in this canonical sense are divided into major ("greater") and minor basilicas. Today only four, all in Rome, are classified as major basilicas: the major basilicas of St John Lateran, St Peter, St Paul outside the Walls, and St Mary Major. The other canonical basilicas are minor basilicas.
By canon law no Catholic church can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom.Robert F. McNamara, Minor Basilicas in the United States  The Basilica di San Nicola da Tolentino was the first minor basilica to be canonically created, in 1783. The 1917 Code of Canon Law officially recognised churches using the title of basilica from immemorial custom as having such a right to the title of minor basilica. Such churches are referred to as immemorial basilicas.http://www.gcatholic.org/basilicas/bas001-excerpts.pdf

Thierry Daniel Henry ([tpl]IPA-fr|tjɛʁi ɑ̃ʁi[/tpl]; born 17 August 1977) is a French footballer who plays as a striker for New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer. Henry was born in Les Ulis, Essonne (a suburb of Paris) where he played for an array of local sides as a youngster and showed great promise as a goal-scorer. He was spotted by AS Monaco in 1990 and signed instantly, making his professional debut in 1994. Good form led to an international call-up in 1998, after which he signed for the Serie A defending champions Juventus. He had a disappointing season playing on the wing, before joining Arsenal for £11 million in 1999.
It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer. Despite initially struggling in the Premier League, he emerged as Arsenal's top goal-scorer for almost every season of his tenure there. Under long-time mentor and coach Arsène Wenger, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all competitions. The Frenchman won two league titles and three FA Cups with the Gunners; he was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year twice, was named the PFA Players' Player of the Year twice, and the FWA Footballer of the Year three times. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain, leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final.
In June 2007, after eight years with Arsenal, he transferred to Barcelona for a fee of €24 million. His first honours with the Spanish club came in 2009 when they won the La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League treble. He went on to achieve an unprecedented sextuple by also winning the Supercopa de España, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. In total, Henry has been named in the UEFA Team of the Year five times. In 2010, he joined the New York Red Bulls of the Major League Soccer, and won the Eastern Conference title with them in 2010. He returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012.  In 2013 Henry with the New York Red Bulls won the MLS Supporters' Shield.
Henry enjoyed similar success with the French national team, having won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000 and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. In October 2007, he surpassed Michel Platini's record to become France's top goal-scorer of all time. Henry retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Off the pitch, Henry is an active spokesperson against racism in football, partially due to his own experiences. He married English model Nicole Merry in 2003 and had a daughter with her, but they divorced in 2007. Henry was also one of the top commercially marketed footballers; he was ranked ninth in the world in 2006. [tpl]TOC limit[/tpl]

Mount Lycabettus, also known as Lycabettos, Lykabettos or Lykavittos ([tpl]lang-el|Λυκαβηττός[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-el|likaviˈtos|pron[/tpl]), is a Cretaceous limestone hill in Athens, Greece. At 277 meters (908 feet) above sea level, the hill is the highest point in the city that surrounds it. Pine trees cover its base, and at its two peaks are the 19th century Chapel of St. George, a theatre, and a restaurant.
The hill is a popular tourist destination and can be ascended by the Lycabettus Funicular, a funicular railway which climbs the hill from a lower terminus at Kolonaki (The railway station can be found at Aristippou street). Lycabettus appears in various legends. Popular stories suggest it was once the refuge of wolves, (lycos in Greek), which is possibly the origin of its name (means "the one hill that is walked by wolves"). Mythologically, Lycabettus is credited to Athena, who created it when she dropped a mountain she had been carrying from Pallene for the construction of the Acropolis after the box holding Erichthonius was opened.
The hill also has a large open-air theater at the top, which has housed many Greek and international concerts. Among the artists who have performed at the Lycabettus theater included Ray Charles, Joan Baez, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Paco De Lucia, Al Di Meola, John Mc Laughlin, Gary Moore, Peter Gabriel, Black Sabbath, Nick Cave, Pet Shop Boys, Deep Purple, UB 40, Placebo, Radiohead, Moby, Massive Attack, Faithless, Whitesnake, Tracy Chapman, Patti Smith, Vanessa Mae, Brian Ferry, Tito Puente, Buena Vista Social Club and Scorpions.

His drawings in black ink, influenced by the style of Japanese woodcuts, emphasized the grotesque, the decadent, and the erotic. He was a leading figure in the Aesthetic movement which also included Oscar Wilde and James A. McNeill Whistler. Beardsley's contribution to the development of the Art Nouveau and poster styles was significant, despite the brevity of his career before his early death from tuberculosis.

Aconcagua ([tpl]IPA-es|akoŋˈkaɣwa[/tpl]) is the highest mountain  in the Western and Southern Hemispheres at [tpl]convert|6960.8|m|ft[/tpl]. It is located in the Andes mountain range, in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, and lies 112 kilometres (70 mi) northwest of its capital, the city of Mendoza. The summit is also located about 5 kilometres from San Juan Province and 15 kilometres from the international border with Chile. Aconcagua is the highest peak in both the Western and Southern Hemispheres. It is one of the Seven Summits.
Aconcagua is bounded by the Valle de las Vacas to the north and east and the Valle de los Horcones Inferior to the West and South. The mountain and its surroundings are part of the Aconcagua Provincial Park. The mountain has a number of glaciers. The largest glacier is the Ventisquero Horcones Inferior at about 10 km long, which descends from the south face to about 3600 m altitude near the Confluencia camp.[ref]
Servei General d'Informacio de Muntanya, 2002, "Aconcagua 1:50,000 map", published by Cordee[/ref] 
Two other large glacier systems are the Ventisquero de las Vacas Sur and Glaciar Este/Ventisquero Relinchos system at about 5 km long.  The most well-known is the north-eastern or Polish Glacier, as it is a common route of ascent.
The mountain was created by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American plate during the geologically recent Andean orogeny; but it is not an active volcano.Simkin, T. and Siebert, L. (2002-). What is the world's highest volcano? Smithsonian Institution, Global Volcanism Program. Accessed 22 August 2012.

Girly girl is a slang term for a girl or woman who chooses to dress and behave in an especially feminine style, such as wearing pink, using make-up, using perfume, dressing in skirts, dresses and blouses, and talking about relationships and other activities which are associated with the traditional gender role of a girl.Linda Duits, Multi-Girl-Culture (2008) p. 141
Though the term is sometimes used as a term of disdain, it can also be used in a more positive way, particularly in terms of exploring one of a range of gender positions.Duits, p. 136 Being a 'girly girl' can then be seen as a fluid and partially embodied position - a form of discourse taken up, discarded or modified for tactical/strategic ends.M.

The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 ([tpl]lang-ru|Микоян и Гуревич МиГ-23[/tpl]; NATO reporting name: Flogger) is a variable-geometry fighter aircraft, designed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau in the Soviet Union. It is considered to belong to the Soviet third generation jet fighter category, along with similarly aged Soviet fighters such as the MiG-25 "Foxbat". It was the first attempt by the Soviet Union to design look-down/shoot-down radar and one of the first to be armed with beyond visual range missiles, and the first MiG production fighter aircraft to have intakes at the sides of the fuselage. Production started in 1970 and reached large numbers with over 5,000 aircraft built. Today the MiG-23 remains in limited service with various export customers.
The basic design was also used as the basis for the Mikoyan MiG-27, a dedicated ground-attack variant. Among many minor changes, the MiG-27 replaced the MiG-23's nose-mounted radar system with an optical panel holding a laser designator and a TV camera. Ground-attack variants of the MiG-23 were also produced, and these generally saw better export success, retaining more multi-mission capability.

[[Mons pubis]]

CATEGORIES: Pelvis

In human anatomy, and in mammals in general, the mons pubis (Latin for "pubic mound"), also known simply as the mons, and known specifically in females as the mons Venus or mons veneris (Latin for "mound of Venus"), is a rounded mass of fatty tissue situated over the pubic bone.[tpl]cite book|title=New Oxford American Dictionary|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=mons pubis|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mons%20pubis|publisher=Merriam–Webster|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=mons pubis|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=mons+pubis&submit.x=0&submit.y=0|publisher=American Heritage Dictionary|accessdate=2013-09-19|year=2011[/tpl] Its location is specifically anterior to the pubic symphysis. The size of the mons pubis varies with the level of hormone and body fat, and it is more apparent in females. After puberty, it generally becomes covered with pubic hair and enlarged.
In human females, the mons pubis forms the anterior portion of the vulva. It divides into the labia majora (literally "larger lips") on either side of the furrow, known as the pudendal cleft, that surrounds the labia minora, clitoris, urethra, vaginal opening, and other structures of the vulval vestibule. The fatty tissue of the mons pubis is sensitive to estrogen, causing a distinct mound to form with the onset of puberty. This pushes the forward portion of the labia majora out and away from the pubic bone.

The oystercatchers are a group of waders forming the family Haematopodidae, which has a single genus, Haematopus.

The exception to this is the Eurasian Oystercatcher and the South Island Oystercatcher, both of which breed inland, far inland in some cases. In the past there has been a great deal of confusion as to the species limits, with discrete populations of all black oystercatchers being afforded specific status but pied oystercatchers being considered one single species.Hockey, P (1996) Family Haematopodidae (Oystercatchers) in del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Sargatal, J.

[[Pratincole]]

CATEGORIES: Glareolidae

The Pratincoles or Greywaders are a group of birds which together with the coursers and Egyptian Plover make up the family Glareolidae.  They have short legs, very long pointed wings and long forked tails.
Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground.  Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.
Their flight is fast and graceful like a swallow or a tern, with many twists and turns to pursue their prey.  They are most active at dawn and dusk, resting in the warmest part of the day.
Like the coursers, the pratincoles are found in warmer parts of the Old World, from southern Europe and Africa east through Asia to Australia. Species breeding in temperate regions are long distance migrants.
Their two to four eggs are laid on the ground in a bare scrape.
The Australian Pratincole, the only species not in the genus Glareola, is more terrestrial than the other pratincoles, and may be intermediate between this group and the coursers.
The name "Pratincole" comes from the term pratincola coined by German naturalist Wilhelm Heinrich Kramer from the Latin words prātum meadow and incola resident.[tpl]cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of British Bird Names |last=Lockwood |first=W B |year=1993 |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0-19-866196-2[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Behavioural syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors, Casual sex, Human sexuality, Psychiatric diagnosis, Sexual addiction, Sexual arousal, Sexual health, Sexuality

Hypersexuality is extremely frequent or suddenly increased sexual urges or sexual activity.
Although hypersexuality can be caused by some medical conditions or medications, in most cases the cause is unknown. Mental health problems such as bipolar disorders can give rise to hypersexuality,[tpl]cite web|url=http://bipolar.about.com/cs/hypersex/a/aa_hypersex.htm |title=About.com Bipolar Disorders |publisher=Bipolar.about.com |accessdate=2012-06-22[/tpl] and alcohol and some drugs can affect social and sexual inhibitions in some people. A number of theoretical models have been used to explain or treat hypersexuality. The most common one, especially in the popular media, is the sexual addiction approach, but sexologists have not reached any consensus. Alternative explanations for the condition include compulsive and impulsive behavioral models.
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization includes "Excessive Sexual Drive" (coded F52.7)[tpl]cite web|url=http://thcc.or.th/ICD-10TM/gf50.htm |title=2012 ICD-10 Diagnosis Code F52.7 : Excessive sexual drive |accessdate=2013-02-22[/tpl]—which is divided into satyriasis for males and nymphomania for females—and "Excessive Masturbation" (coded F98.8).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/F01-F99/F90-F98/F98-/F98.8 |title=2012 ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code F98.8 : Other specified behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence |publisher=Icd10data.com |accessdate=2012-06-22[/tpl] A proposal to include a diagnosis called hypersexual disorder, simply describing the symptom without implying any specific theory, is under consideration for inclusion in the appendix of the DSM, but not in the main list of official diagnoses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/SexualDysfunctions.aspx |title=DSM-5 Development Page for Sexual Dysfunctions |publisher=Dsm5.org |accessdate=2012-06-22[/tpl]
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) rejected a proposal to add sexual addiction to its list of psychiatric disorders, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).

The Wallace Line (or Wallace's Line) is a faunal boundary line drawn in 1859 by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace that separates the ecozones of Asia and Wallacea, a transitional zone between Asia and Australia. West of the line are found organisms related to Asiatic species; to the east, a mixture of species of Asian and Australian origin is present. The line is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who noticed this clear division during his travels through the East Indies in the 19th century. The line runs through Indonesia, between Borneo and Sulawesi (Celebes), and through the Lombok Strait between Bali and Lombok.  The distance between Bali and Lombok is small, about [tpl]convert|35|km[/tpl].  The distributions of many bird species observe the line, since many birds do not cross even the smallest stretches of open ocean water. Some bats have distributions that cross the line, but other mammals are generally limited to one side or the other; an exception is the crab-eating macaque. Other groups of plants and animals show differing patterns, but the overall pattern is striking and reasonably consistent.
Flora do not follow the Wallace Line to the same extent as fauna.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01647.x[/tpl]

[[Land reform in Kerala]]
CATEGORIES: History of Kerala (1947–present), Land reform, Real property law

Due to the ancient land relations and taxation and regulation under the British Raj, at the time of independence, India inherited a semi-feudal agrarian system, with ownership of land concentrated in the hands of a few individual landlords. Since independence, there has been voluntary and state initiated/mediated land reforms in several states. The most notable and successful example of land reforms are in the states of West Bengal and Kerala. The Land Reforms Ordinance was a law in the state of Kerala, India by  K. R. Gowri Amma minister in the first EMS government.Land Reforms Act no longer relevant, says Industries Secretary
The EMS government was the first communist state government popularly elected to power in India, in the southern state of Kerala. Soon after taking its oath of office, the government introduced the controversial Land Reforms Ordinance, which was later made into an act.  This, along with an Education Bill, raised a massive uproar from the landlord classes.  The popular slogan for the radical socialists was "the land for tillers", which sent shockwaves through the landlord classes in the country.  The ordinance set an absolute ceiling on the amount of land a family could own. The tenants and hut dwellers received a claim in the excess land, on which they had worked for centuries under the feudal system. In addition, the law ensured fixity of tenure and protection from eviction. These ground-breaking measures caused the premature death of the state government, as the central government, under Jawaharlal Nehru, used article 356 to dismiss it, alleging the breakdown of law and order. The land reforms in Kerala imparted drastic changes to the political, economic and social outlook.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Different types of feudal relations existed in Travancore-Cochin and Malabar at the time of the formation of the state.  The landless farmers and those who were evicted from their land wanted to get their grievances redressed.  The clamour for changes gathered strength.  The government which came to power in 1957 introduced the Land Reforms Bill in the Legislative Assembly.  The Agrarian Relations Bill introduced in 1958 was passed with minor amendments.  The legislature passed subsequent land reform bills in 1960, 1963, 1964, and 1969. But the historical land reform act, which put an end to the feudal system and ensured the rights of the tenants on land, came into force on 1 January 1970.  However, cash crop plantations had been exempted from its purview. There have been many amendments to the act since, the latest having been in 2012.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/KLR-Act-amendment-could-grave-situation-for-result-fragment-of-estatesplantation-sector/articleshow/17081837.cms

[[Brown-necked Raven]]
CATEGORIES: Corvus, Ravens, Birds of Africa, Birds of Asia, Birds of Iran, Birds of Turkey, Birds of Pakistan, Birds of Israel, Birds of Kenya, Birds of Uzbekistan, Birds of Western Sahara

The Brown-necked Raven (Corvus ruficollis) is a larger bird (52–56 cm in length) than the Carrion Crow though not as large as the Common Raven. It has similar proportions to the common raven but the bill is not so large or deep and the wings tend to be a little more pointed in profile. The head and throat are a distinct brownish-black giving the bird its English name, while the rest of the plumage is black glossed with purple, blue or purplish-blue. The feathers of this species often fade quite quickly to a brownish black (even the truly black feathers) and the bird can look distinctly brown by the time it moults. The feet, legs and bill are black. The Dwarf Raven was formerly considered a subspecies (Corvus ruficollis edithae) but this bird now appears to be closer to the Pied Crow (C. albus) than this species. Hybrids between this species and the Pied Crow seem to reinforce their close relationship. This species is found principally in Somalia and neighbouring areas.
This species has a wide range across virtually the whole of North Africa, down as far as Kenya, the Arabian peninsula and up into the Greater Middle East and southern Iran. It lives in a predominantly   desert environment visiting oases and palm groves.
Food consists of a wide range of items, including carrion, snakes, locusts and other grasshoppers, stranded fish (in coastal areas), grain stolen from bags, dates and other fruits. It is quite fearless when not persecuted but is quick to become wary and shy if too much attention is paid to it. A 2009 Israeli study showed the species to cooperatively hunt lizards, with birds blocking exits while others hunted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8388000/8388073.stm|title=Clever ravens cooperatively hunt |last=Walker|first=Matt|date=December 1, 2009|work=BBC Earthnews website|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2 December 2009[/tpl]
The nest is very much like the Common Raven's, and may be found in trees, on cliffs or in old and ruined buildings. The Dwarf Raven seems to prefer thorn trees for its nest building. There are usually 4-5 eggs laid and incubated over 20–22 days. The young usually leave the nest by the 37th or 38th day and can fly well by 42–45 days.
The voice is very similar to the Common Raven's consisting mainly of croaks, though higher in pitch; and a harsh "karr-karr-karr" very much like a Carrion Crow too. In flight, it will utter a "kuerk-kuerk" call.

[[Federal holidays in the United States]]

In The US, a federal holiday is an authorized holiday which has been recognized by the US government. Every year on a US federal holiday, non-essential federal government offices are closed, and every federal employee is paid for the holiday. Private-sector employees required to work on a legal holiday may receive holiday pay in addition to their ordinary wages.
Federal holidays are designated by the United States Congress in Title V of the United States Code ([tpl]usc|5|6103[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/6103.shtml |title=Cornell University Law School: US Code Collection. 6103 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=February 5, 2013[/tpl] Congress has authority to create holidays only for federal institutions (including federally owned properties) and employees, and for the District of Columbia. However, as a general rule other institutions, including banks, post offices, and schools, may be closed on those days.  In various parts of the country, state and city holidays may be observed in addition to the federal holidays.

[[Instruction pipeline]]
CATEGORIES: Instruction processing

An instruction pipeline is a technique used in the design of computers to increase their instruction throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time). The basic instruction cycle is broken up into a series called a pipeline. Rather than processing each instruction sequentially (one at a time, finishing one instruction before starting the next), each instruction is split up into a sequence of steps – different steps can be executed concurrently (by different circuitry), and indeed in parallel (at the same time).
Pipelining increases instruction throughput by performing multiple operations at the same time (in parallel), but does not reduce instruction latency (the time to complete a single instruction from start to finish) as it still must go through all steps. Indeed, it may increase latency due to additional overhead from breaking the computation into separate steps and worse, the pipeline may stall (or even need to be flushed), further increasing latency. Pipelining thus increases throughput at the cost of latency, and is frequently used in CPUs, but avoided in realtime systems, where latency is a hard constraint.
Each instruction is split into a sequence of dependent steps.  The first step is always to fetch the instruction from memory; the final step is usually writing the results of the instruction to processor registers or to memory.  Pipelining seeks to let the processor work on as many instructions as there are dependent steps, just as an assembly line builds many vehicles at once, rather than waiting until one vehicle has passed through the line before admitting the next one.  Just as the goal of the assembly line is to keep each assembler productive at all times, pipelining seeks to keep every portion of the processor busy with some instruction.  Pipelining lets the computer's cycle time be the time of the slowest step, and ideally lets one instruction complete in every cycle.
The term pipeline is an analogy to the fact that there is fluid in each link of a pipeline, as each part of the processor is occupied with work.

Henri Pirenne (23 December 1862 – 25 October 1935) was a Belgian historian. A medievalist of Walloon descent, he wrote a multivolume history of Belgium in French and became a national hero. He also became prominent in the nonviolent resistance to the Germans who occupied Belgium in World War I.
Henri Pirenne's reputation today rests on three contributions to European history: for what has become known as the Pirenne Thesis, concerning origins of the Middle Ages in reactive state formation and shifts in trade; for a distinctive view of Belgium's medieval history; and for his model of the development of the medieval city.
Pirenne argued that profound social, economic, cultural, and religious movements in the long-term resulted from equally profound underlying causes, and this attitude influenced Marc Bloch and the outlook of the French Annales School of social history. Though Pirenne had his opponents, notably Alfons DopschDopsch, The Economic and Social Foundations of European Civilization (tr, 1937). who disagreed on essential points, recent historians of the Middle Ages usually take Pirenne's main theses, however much they are  modified, as starting points.

Methodenstreit (German for "method dispute"), in intellectual history beyond German-language discourse, was an economics controversy carried on for about a decade around 1890, between that field's Austrian School and the (German) Historical School. On an intellectual level it concerned whether any science (as opposed to only history) could explain the dynamics of human action; politically, it reflected conflict between the minarchism of the early Austrian School and the welfare state advocated by the Historical School.
In it, Carl Menger led the supporters of the Austrian School's view, and Gustav von Schmoller proponents of the Historical School's.
(In German-speaking countries, the original of this Germanism is not specific to the one controversy—which is likely to be specified as Methodenstreit der Nationalökonomie, i.e. "Methodenstreit of economics".)

Ignacio Zaragoza Seguín, (March 24, 1829 – September 8, 1862) was a  general in the Mexican army, best known for defeating invading French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862 (now celebrated in both the United States and Mexico as the Cinco de Mayo).
Zaragoza was born in the early Mexican Texas village of Bahía del Espíritu Santo (now Goliad, Texas, in the United States) in what was then the Mexican state of Coahuila y Texas.  He was the son of Miguel G. Zaragoza and María de Jesús Seguín, who was a niece of Erasmo Seguín and cousin of Juan Seguín.  The Zaragoza family moved to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, in 1834 and thence to Monterrey, Mexico, in 1844, where young Ignacio entered a seminary.
During the political unrest of the 1850s, Zaragoza joined the army supporting the cause of the Liberal Party, in opposition to dictator Antonio López de Santa Anna.  Zaragoza rose to command an army of volunteers that in 1855 defeated Santa Anna and led to the reestablishment of a constitutional democratic government in Mexico.
Zaragoza served as Secretary of War from April through October 1861, in the cabinet of Benito Juárez.  He resigned in order to lead the Army of the East (Ejército de Oriente) against the Europeans who, using the Mexican external debt as a pretext under the Treaty of London concluded earlier that year, had invaded Mexico.
When the forces of Napoleon III invaded in the French intervention in Mexico, Zaragoza's forces fought them first at Acultzingo on April 28, 1862, where he was forced to withdraw.  Zaragoza understood the favorable defensive positions outside of the city of Puebla, and with a force that was smaller and not as well equipped as his opponent, he beat back repeated French assaults upon the Mexican positions at Forts Loreto and Guadalupe.  The French were forced to retreat to Orizaba.
His famous quotation, Las armas nacionales se han cubierto de gloria ("The national arms have been covered with glory"), is used to remember the battle, and comes from the single-line letter he wrote to his superior, President Juárez, informing him of the victory.  It was included, along with Zaragoza's likeness, on Mexican 500-peso banknotes from 1995-2010 (Series D).
Shortly after his famous victory, Zaragoza was struck with typhoid fever, of which he died at the age of 33. He was buried in San Fernando Cemetery in Mexico City.

Hecataeus of Miletus ([tpl]lang-el|Ἑκαταῖος[/tpl];Named after the Greek goddess Hecate c. 550 BC – c. 476 BCLivius: Hecataeus of Miletus, Jona Lendering), was an early Greek historian of a wealthy family. He flourished during the time of the Persian invasion. After having travelled extensively, he settled in his native city, where he occupied a high position, and devoted his time to the composition of geographical and historical works. When Aristagoras held a council of the leading Ionians at Miletus to organize a revolt against the Persian rule, Hecataeus in vain tried to dissuade his countrymen from the undertaking.Herodotus 5.36, 125[tpl]clarify|date=April 2011|reason=meaning of what document the reference tries to point to not obvious[/tpl] In 494 BC, when the defeated Ionians were obliged to sue for terms, he was one of the ambassadors to the Persian satrap Artaphernes, whom he persuaded to restore the constitution of the Ionic cities.Diodorus Siculus. 10.25[tpl]clarify|date=April 2011|meaning of what document the reference tries to point to not obvious[/tpl]  Hecataeus is the first known Greek historian,[tpl]cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C.

[[Court of record]]

CATEGORIES: Courts by type, Common law

In common law jurisdictions, a court of record is a trial court in which a court clerk or a court reporter takes down a record of proceedings.  That written record (and all other evidence) is preserved at least long enough for all appeals to be exhausted, or for some further period of time provided by law (for example, in some states, death penalty statutes provide that all evidence must be preserved for an extended period of time).  Most courts of record have rules of procedure,see rules of evidence, rules of civil procedure, and rules of criminal procedure and therefore they require that most parties be represented by counsel lawyers (specifically, attorneys holding a license to practice law) before the specific tribunal.  In contrast, in courts not of record, oral proceedings are not recorded, and the judge makes his or her decision based on memory.  In most "not of record" proceedings, the parties can and usually do appear personally, without lawyers.  For example, most small claims courts, traffic courts, a justice court presided over by a Justice of the Peace, many administrative tribunals that make initial governmental administrative decisions such as government benefit determinations, and the like are not courts of record.
In many states, statutes provide that the power to fine or imprison lies only with courts of record.
"Of record" and "not of record" are two polar extremes of a spectrum, and there is a transition zone between.  For example, in proceedings before executive branch agencies of the United States federal government, fully formal proceedings of record are governed by the "formal adjudication" or "on the record" provisions of 5 U.S.C. §§ 554, 556, and 557, while informal proceedings or "not on the record" proceedings are governed by § 555.  However, many proceedings have intermediate character, with some "of record" characteristics but not others.
In some classes of cases, after a determination by an inferior or lower tribunal not of record, a party may take a first level appeal to a tribunal that is of record.  For example, many government administrative agencies provide a level of intra-agency review before a board of appeals that conducts its proceedings on a more formal basis than the proceedings before the initial hearing officer.  In most cases, this first level appeal is "trial de novo" (or a 'hearing de novo'), in a tribunal of record.  This is not an appeal, as such, but a new proceeding which completely supersedes the result of the prior trial.  Often, the review tribunal will not permit introduction of new evidence, or may have evidence rules that are quite restrictive.  When the first-level adjudication is made by an executive branch agency, and after all intra-agency procedures are exhausted, it is often possible to go to a court to seek judicial review of the judgment of the agency.
The primary function the record is to provide certified copies of the record of proceedings for appellate review.  The record from a trial court includes the evidence introduced by the parties, and some form of record of the proceeding itself, which includes copies of all papers filed by the parties, and a transcripts of any trial, and may include an audio or videotape of hearings, appearances, arguments of motions.  Exhibits introduced in evidence may also be maintained in the court record, at least for a certain period of time after the case has been tried, after which the evidence may be returned to the parties or destroyed.   If either party takes an appeal, the lower court produces a copy with a unique seal to authenticate the formal record.

The Eight Immortals ([tpl]zh|c=八仙|p=Bāxiān|w=Pa¹hsien¹[/tpl]) are a group of legendary xian ("immortals; transcendents; saints") in Chinese mythology. Each Immortal's power can be transferred to a power tool (法器) that can bestow life or destroy evil. Together, these eight tools are called the "Covert Eight Immortals" (暗八仙 àn ~). Most of them are said to have been born in the Tang or Song Dynasty. They are revered by the Taoists and are also a popular element in the secular Chinese culture. They are said to live on a group of five islands in the Bohai Sea, which includes Penglai Mountain-Island.
The Immortals are:
For their names in Chinese characters and Wade-Giles, see the individual pages in the list above.
In literature before the 1970s, they were sometimes translated as the Eight Genies. First described in the Yuan Dynasty, they were probably named after the Eight Immortal Scholars of the Han.

Carol I (20 April 1839 – 27 September (O.S.) / 10 October (N.S.) 1914), born Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was the ruler of Romania from 1866 to 1914. He was elected Ruling Prince (Domnitor) of the Romanian United Principalities on 20 April 1866 after the overthrow of Alexandru Ioan Cuza by a palace coup. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire (1878) in the Russo-Turkish War, he declared Romania a sovereign nation (the country had been under the nominal suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire until then). He was proclaimed  King of Romania on [tpl]OldStyleDate|26 March|1881|14 March[/tpl]. He was the first ruler of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen dynasty, which ruled the country until the proclamation of a republic in 1947.
During his reign, Carol I personally led Romanian troops during the Russo-Turkish War and assumed command of the Russo/Romanian army during the siege of Plevna. The country achieved full independence from the  Ottoman Empire (Treaty of Berlin, 1878) and acquired Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria in 1913. Domestic political life, still dominated by the country's wealthy landowning families organized around the rival Liberal and Conservative parties, was punctuated by two widespread peasant uprisings, in Wallachia (the southern half of the country) in April 1888 and in Moldavia (the northern half) in March 1907.
He married Elisabeth of Wied in Neuwied on 15 November 1869. They only had one daughter, Maria, who died at the age of three.
Carol never produced a male heir, leaving his elder brother Leopold next in line to the throne. In October 1880 Leopold renounced his right of succession in favour of his son William, who in turn surrendered his claim six years later in favour of his younger brother, the future king Ferdinand.

[[Domestic partnership]]

CATEGORIES: State recognition of same-sex relationships

A domestic partnership is a legal or interpersonal relationship between two individuals who live together and share a common domestic life but are neither joined by marriage nor a civil union.  In some jurisdictions, such as Australia, New Zealand, the American states of Oregon, Washington (available until June 30, 2014), Nevada, and California, a domestic partnership is almost equivalent to marriage, or to other legally recognized unions, while in other jurisdictions such as the American states of Wisconsin and Maine, domestic partnerships may confer lesser relationship rights than other jurisdictions' civil unions and more than de facto cohabitation. The terminology for such unions is still evolving, and the exact level of rights and responsibilities conferred by a domestic partnership varies widely from place to place.
Some legislatures have voluntarily established domestic partnership relations by statute instead of being ordered to do so by a court. Although some jurisdictions have instituted domestic partnerships as a way to recognize same-sex unions, domestic partnerships may involve either different-sex or same-sex couples.
In some legal jurisdictions, domestic partners who live together for an extended period of time but are not legally entitled to common-law marriage may be entitled to legal protection in the form of a domestic partnership. Some domestic partners may enter into domestic partnership agreements in order to agree contractually to issues involving property ownership, support obligations, and similar issues common to marriage.  (See effects of marriage and palimony.) Beyond agreements, registration of relationships in domestic partnership registries allow for the jurisdiction to formally acknowledge such agreements as valid relationships with limited rights, although agreements and registries have often been legalized in separate legislation.
One of the purposes of domestic partnership relation is to recognize the contribution of one partner to the property of the other. In the common law, devices such as the constructive trust are available to protect spouses in legal or common-law marriages. In civil law jurisdictions, such trusts are generally not available, prompting courts to find alternative ways to protect the partner who contributes to the other's property.

In family law, effects of marriage is a legal term of art used to describe all of the rights and obligations that individuals may be subject and entitled to if they are in a common-law marriage, an annulled marriage, domestic partnership or a civil union.
Thus, even if the underlying marriage is held to be void there may still be rights and obligations that continue and are recognized by court order. An example may be an annulled marriage where the court awards alimony to the weaker, poorer or less well educated spouse to allow them a period of time to go back to school or re-enter the work force.
There are a few positive and negative influences of marriage on an individual.  First of all, an individual becomes excited that they will begin to share their life with someone who cares for them, and whom they feel comforted by.  They will feel excited to know that soon they will be starting a family of their own, and that they will become parents of their own children.  Research has shown that those individuals who live a stable marital relationship tend to live longer, have a better physical health, better functional health at old age and better emotional health than those in troubled marriages or who are divorced.
On the other hand, there a few negative influences of marriage on an adult.  An adult can become stressed out on the fact that they will need to make compromises and sacrifices, in order to form a good marital relationship.  This can lead to a loss of hobbies, because there are restrictions about what the individuals can do; and these restrictions are for both the men and women in the relationship.  The adult may develop a sense of stress because they have a lot of responsibility ahead of them.  In addition, the individuals in the relationship can become upset by the fact that they have to make sure that their relationship has no betrayals, and it is kept loyal, throughout the couple’s lives.

Perry starred as Dylan McKay on the TV series Beverly Hills, 90210, a role he played from 1990–1995, and then from 1998–2000. Much publicity was garnered over the fact that even though he was playing a sixteen-year-old when 90210 began, Perry was actually in his mid-twenties at the time. Perry returned to 90210 in 1998 (this time billed as a permanent "Special Guest Star") and remained with the series until its conclusion in 2000.

[[Choanoflagellate]]
CATEGORIES: Protista, Flagellates

The choanoflagellates are a group of free-living unicellular and colonial flagellate eukaryotes considered to be the closest living relatives of the animals. As the name suggests, choanoflagellates (collared flagellates) have a distinctive cell morphology characterized by an ovoid or spherical cell body 3–10 µm in diameter with a single apical flagellum surrounded by a collar of 30–40 microvilli (see figure). Movement of the flagellum creates water currents that can propel free-swimming choanoflagellates through the water column and trap bacteria and detritus against the collar of microvilli where these foodstuffs are engulfed. This feeding provides a critical link within the global carbon cycle, linking trophic levels. In addition to their critical ecological roles, choanoflagellates are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists studying the origins of multicellularity in animals. As the closest living relatives of animals, choanoflagellates serve as a useful model for reconstructions of the last unicellular ancestor of animals.

[[Morchella]]

CATEGORIES: Morchellaceae, Edible fungi

Morchella, the true morels, is a genus of edible mushrooms closely related to anatomically simpler cup fungi. These distinctive mushrooms appear honeycomb-like in that the upper portion is composed of a network of ridges with pits between them. The ascocarps are prized by gourmet cooks, particularly for French cuisine. Commercial value aside, morels are hunted by thousands of people every year simply for their taste and the joy of the hunt.
Morels have been called by many local names; some of the more colorful include dryland fish, because when sliced lengthwise then breaded and fried, their outline resembles the shape of a fish; hickory chickens, as they are known in many parts of Kentucky; and merkels or miracles, based on a story of how a mountain family was saved from starvation by eating morels. In parts of West Virginia, they are known as "molly moochers." Other common names for morels include sponge mushroom. Genus Morchella is derived from morchel, an old German word for mushroom, while morel itself is derived from the Latin maurus meaning brown.

[[Ascocarp]]

CATEGORIES: Mycology, Fungal morphology and anatomy

An ascocarp, or ascoma (plural: ascomata), is the fruiting body (sporocarp) of an ascomycete fungus.  It consists of very tightly interwoven hyphae and may contain millions of asci, each of which typically contains eight ascospores.  Ascocarps are most commonly bowl-shaped, but may take on a number of other forms.

==Classification==
End of paragraph.[]

[[Ascus]]

CATEGORIES: Mycology, Fungal morphology and anatomy

An ascus (plural asci; from Greek ἀσκός "skin bag") is the sexual spore-bearing cell produced in ascomycete fungi.  On average, asci normally contain eight ascospores, produced by a meiotic cell division followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division.  However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. Monosporascus cannonballus), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. Tympanis) with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some Cordyceps, also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei.
In many cases the asci are formed in a regular layer, the hymenium, in a fruiting body which is visible to the naked eye, here called an ascocarp or ascoma.  In other cases, such as single-celled yeasts, no such structures are found. In rare cases asci of some genera can regularly develop inside older discharged asci one after another, e.g. Dipodascus.
Asci normally release their spores by bursting at the tip, but they may also digest themselves passively releasing the ascospores either in a liquid or as a dry powder.  Typically, actively discharging asci have a specially differentiated tip, either a pore or an operculum. In some hymenium forming genera, when one ascus bursts, it can trigger the bursting of many other asci in the ascocarp resulting in a massive discharge visible as a cloud of spores – the phenomenon called "puffing".  This is an example of positive feedback. A faint hissing sound can also be heard for species of Peziza and other cup fungi.
Asci, notably those of Neurospora crassa, have been used in laboratories for studying the process of meiosis, because the four cells produced by meiosis line up in regular order.  By modifying a gene coding for spore color, the biologist can study crossing over and other phenomena.
Asci of most Pezizomycotina develop after the formation of croziers at their base. The croziers help maintain a brief dikaryon. The compatible nuclei of the dikaryon merge forming a diploid nucleus that then undergoes meiosis and ultimately internal ascospore formation. Members of the Taphrinomycotina and Saccharomycotina do not form croziers.

[[Monoamine neurotransmitter]]
CATEGORIES: Neurotransmitters, TAAR1 agonists

Monoamine neurotransmitters are neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that contain one amino group that is connected to an aromatic ring by a two-carbon chain (-CH2-CH2-). All monoamines are derived from aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and the thyroid hormones by the action of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase enzymes. The function of monoamine is not clear but it is thought to trigger crucial components such as emotion, arousal, and cognition. It has however been found that monoamine neurotransmitters play an important role in the secretion and production of neurotrophin-3 by astrocytes, a chemical which maintains neuron integrity and provides neurons with trophic support.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2009.10.003 |title=Regulatory role of monoamine neurotransmitters in astrocytic NT-3 synthesis |year=2010 |last1=Mele |first1=Tina |last2=Čarman-Kržan |first2=Marija |last3=Jurič |first3=Damijana Mojca |journal=International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience |volume=28 |pages=13–9 |pmid=19854260 |issue=1[/tpl] Drugs used to increase the effect of monoamine may be used to treat patients with psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70141-7 |title=The monoamine neurotransmitter disorders: An expanding range of neurological syndromes |year=2011 |last1=Kurian |first1=Manju A |last2=Gissen |first2=Paul |last3=Smith |first3=Martin |last4=Heales |first4=Simon JR |last5=Clayton |first5=Peter T |journal=The Lancet Neurology |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=721–33 |pmid=21777827[/tpl]

[[Cycad]]
CATEGORIES: Cycads, Living fossils, Dioecious plants

'''

Cycads [tpl]IPAc-en|'|s|aI|k|ae|d|z[/tpl] are seed plants typically characterized by a stout and woody (ligneous) trunk with a crown of large, hard and stiff, evergreen leaves. They usually have pinnate leaves. The individual plants are either all male or all female (dioecious). Cycads vary in size from having trunks only a few centimeters to several meters tall. They typically grow very slowly and live very long, with some specimens known to be as much as 1,000 years old. Because of their superficial resemblance, they are sometimes confused with and mistaken for palms or ferns, but are only distantly related to either.
Cycads are found across much of the subtropical and tropical parts of the world. They are found in South and Central America (where the greatest diversity occurs), Mexico, the Antilles, southeastern United States, Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Japan, China, Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and southern and tropical Africa, where at least 65 species occur. Some can survive in harsh semidesert climates (xerophytic), others in wet rain forest conditions, and some in both.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Some can grow in sand or even on rock, some in oxygen-poor, swampy, bog-like soils rich in organic material, and some in both.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Some are able to grow in full sun, some in full shade, and some in both.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Some are salt tolerant (halophytes).
Cycads belong to the biological division Cycadophyta. The three extant families of cycads are Cycadaceae, Stangeriaceae, and Zamiaceae. Though they are a minor component of the plant kingdom today, during the Jurassic period, they were extremely common. They have changed little since the Jurassic, compared to some major evolutionary changes in other plant divisions.
Cycads are gymnosperms (naked seeded), meaning their unfertilized seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by pollination, as contrasted with angiosperms, which have enclosed seeds with more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized pollinators, usually a specific species of beetle. They have been reported to fix nitrogen in association with a cyanobacterium living in the roots. These blue-green algae produce a neurotoxin called BMAA that is found in the seeds of cycads. This neurotoxin may enter a  human food chain as the cycad seeds may be eaten by bats, and humans may eat the bats. It is hypothesized that this is a source of some neurological diseases in humans.The Tangle, Jonathan Weiner, Annals of Medicine, The New Yorker, 4-11-2005, http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/11/050411fa_fact_weiner

[[Prime Minister of Norway]]

CATEGORIES: Prime Ministers of Norway, 1873 introductions

The Prime Minister of Norway ([tpl]lang-no|statsminister[/tpl], literally "state minister") is the political leader of Norway and the Head of the Government of Norway.  The Prime Minister and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior government department heads) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Monarch, to Stortinget (Parliament), to their political party, and ultimately the electorate.
Norway has a constitution, which was adopted on 17 May 1814.[tpl]cite news |title=NORWAY'S STRUGGLE WITH HER KING.|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9507E0D9143DE533A25752C1A9679D94639FD7CF|work=The New York Times |date=11 November 1882 |language=|accessdate=3 February 2009 | format=PDF[/tpl]  The position of Prime Minister is the result of legislation. Modern Prime Ministers have few statutory powers, but provided they can command the support of their parliamentary party, they can control both the legislature and the executive (the Cabinet) and hence wield considerable de facto powers. As of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl], the Prime Minister of Norway is Erna Solberg, of the Conservative Party.

[[Wax paper]]
CATEGORIES: Paper, Cooking utensils

Wax paper (waxed paper), also known as  paraffin paper, is paper that is made moisture-proof through the application of wax.
The practice of oiling parchment or paper in order to make it semi-translucent or moisture-proof goes back at least to the middle ages. Paper impregnated or coated with purified beeswax was widely used throughout the 19th century to retain or exclude moisture, or to wrap odorous products. Gustave Le Gray introduced the use of waxed paper for photographic negatives in 1851.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://jawadonweb.com/?page_id=900|date=December 29, 2008|title=9 Inventions Edison Did Not Make|author=Jawad Shuaib|accessdate=28 October 2011[/tpl]  Natural wax was largely replaced for the making of wax paper (or paraffine paper) after Herman Frasch developed ways of purifying paraffin and coating paper with it in 1876.[tpl]Cite CAB|wstitle=Frasch, Herman[/tpl] Wax paper is commonly used in cooking, for its non-stick properties, and wrapping food for storage, such as cookies, as it keeps water out or in. It is also used in arts and crafts.

[[Polishing]]
CATEGORIES: Decorative arts, Grinding and lapping, Industrial processes, Wood finishing techniques

Polishing is the process of creating a smooth and shiny surface by rubbing it or using a chemical action, leaving a surface with a significant specular reflection (still limited by the index of refraction of the material according to the Fresnel equations.)[tpl]Citation | title = Polish | url = http://www.answers.com/polishing | accessdate = 2008-01-04[/tpl]. In some materials (such as metals, glasses, black or transparent stones) polishing is also able to reduce diffuse reflection to minimal values. When an unpolished surface is  magnified thousands of times, it usually looks like mountains and valleys. By repeated abrasion, those "mountains" are worn down until they are flat or just small "hills." The process of polishing with abrasives starts with coarse ones and graduates to fine ones.
Polishing with very fine abrasive differs physically from coarser abrasion, in that material is removed on a molecular level, so that the rate is correlated to the boiling point rather than to the melting point of the material being polished.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Correlation to melting and boiling points are disputed in the literature.|date=November 2013[/tpl]

[[Asystole]]

CATEGORIES: Death, Medical emergencies, Causes of death, Cardiac dysrhythmia

In medicine, asystole [tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|t|əl|iː[/tpl], colloquially known as flatline, is a state of no cardiac electrical activity, hence no contractions of the myocardium and no cardiac output or blood flow. Asystole is one of the conditions that may be used for a medical practitioner to certify clinical or legal death.
Asystole is treated by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) combined with an intravenous vasopressor such as epinephrine (adrenaline). Sometimes an underlying reversible cause can be detected and treated (the so-called 'H's and T's', an example of which is hypokalaemia). Several interventions previously recommended—such as defibrillation (known to be ineffective on asystole, but previously performed in case the rhythm is actually fine ventricular fibrillation) and intravenous atropine—are no longer part of the routine protocols recommended by most major international bodies.AHA Cardiac Recussitation Guidelines, 2010: http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/122/18_suppl_3/S729  Asystole may be treated with 1 mg epinephrine by IV every 3-5 minutes as needed.  Vasopressin 40 units by IV every 3-5 minutes may be used in place of the first and/or second doses of epinephrine, but doing so does not enhance outcomes.  
Survival rates in a cardiac arrest patient with asystole are much lower than a patient with a rhythm amenable to defibrillation; asystole is itself not a "shockable" rhythm. Out-of-hospital survival rates (even with emergency intervention) are less than 2 percent.http://journals.lww.com/surveyanesthesiology/Citation/2008/10000/Medical_Futility_in_Asystolic_Out_of_Hospital.44.aspx

[[Seedsnipe]]
CATEGORIES: Thinocoridae, Bird families

The seedsnipes are a small family, Thinocoridae, of small gregarious waders which have adapted to a herbivorous diet. The family is divided into two genera, Attagis and Thinocorus, each containing two species. The family has a South American distribution, in the Andean and Patagonian regions. The relationships with other families within the order Charadriiformes are uncertain, it has been suggested that the Plains Wanderer of Australia, the jacanas and the painted snipes  are their closest relatives.van Tuinen, Marcel; Waterhouse, David & Dyke, Gareth J. (2004): Avian molecular systematics on the rebound: a fresh look at modern shorebird phylogenetic relationships. Journal of Avian Biology 35(3): 191-194. The Plains Wanderer in particular has a similar feeding ecology, although differs markedly in breeding biology. The family's common name is misleading, as they do not resemble true snipe, having short bills on small heads, and seeds do not form a major part of the diet.Fjeldså, J. (1996) "Family Thinocoridae (Seedsnipes)" in  del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Sargatal, J. (editors). (1996). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 3: Hoatzin to Auks. Lynx Edicions. ISBN 84-87334-20-2
They resemble grouse, quail and sandgrouse, only with long wings. The seedsnipes in the genus Thinocorus are smaller, ranging in size from a sparrow to a snipe, whereas the genus  Attagis are larger, the size of a ptarmigan.   They have short legs (but long toes) and tails. The colour of their  plumage is generally cryptic. There is some sexual dimorphism in the plumage of the Thinocorus species, the males have grey faces, necks and breasts.
Seedsnipes inhabit a variety of harsh environments, including grasslands, grass steppes, semi-arid deserts and alpine habitats. The Rufous-bellied Seedsnipe ranges as far up as to the snowline (5500 m).
Their 2–3 eggs are laid in a shallow scrape on the ground.

Black-and-white, often abbreviated B/W or B&W, is a term referring to a number of monochrome forms in visual arts.
Black-and-white  images are not usually starkly contrasted black and white. They combine black and white in a continuum producing a range of shades of gray. Further, many prints, especially those produced earlier in the development of photography, were in sepia (mainly for archival stability), which yielded richer, more subtle shading than reproductions in plain black-and-white. Color photography provides a much greater range of shade, but part of the appeal of black and white photography is its more subdued monochromatic character.

Väinö Tanner (12 March 1881 – 19 April 1966) was a leading figure in the Social Democratic Party of Finland, and a pioneer and leader in the cooperative movement in Finland. He was Prime Minister of Finland in 1926–1927.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.valtioneuvosto.fi/hakemisto/ministerikortisto/ministeritiedot.asp?nro=391 |title=Ministerikortisto |publisher=Valtioneuvosto[/tpl] 
Tanner was born in Helsinki.  He did not participate in the Finnish Civil War.  When the war ended he became Finland's leading Social Democratic Party (SDP) politician, and a strong proponent of the parliamentary system.  His main achievement was the rehabilitation of the SDP after the Civil War.  Väinö Tanner served as Prime Minister (1926–1927), Minister of Finance (1937–1939), Foreign Minister (1939–1940), and after the Winter War Minister of Trade (1940–1942).  This final move was due to Soviet pressure.
Väinö Tanner's legacy is in his directing the Finnish working class from the revolutionary ideal towards pragmatic progress through the democratic process.  Under his leadership the Social Democrats were trusted to form a minority government already less than 10 years after the bloody civil war. Tanner’s minority socialist government passed a series of important social reforms during its time in office, which included a liberal amnesty law, reduced duties on imported foods, and pension and health insurance laws.Democratic socialism: a global survey by Donald F. Busky
During President Relander's brief illness Tanner, who held the post of prime minister, was even the acting President and Commander-In-Chief.  In this role he even received the parade of the White guards on the 10th anniversary of the White victory. This was perceived as a remarkable development at the time. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Social Democrats formed several coalition governments with the Agrarian party (see, for example, Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., A Small Giant of the Finnish History / Suomen historian pikkujättiläinen, Helsinki:  WSOY, 2003). In the Winter War Väinö Tanner was the foreign minister. 
Väinö Tanner's leadership was very important in forming the grounds and creating the Spirit of the Winter War which united the nation.
To accommodate the Soviet Union when the Continuation War ended, Väinö Tanner was tried for responsibility for the war in February 1946, and sentenced to five years and six months in prison.Political Paavo, Time, December 6, 1948
After the Continuation War, and while still in prison, Tanner became the virtual leader of a faction of the SDP which had strong support from the USA.  This faction eventually came out on top after a great deal of internal party strife lasting for much of the 1940s.

Åbo Akademi University ([tpl]lang-sv|Åbo Akademi[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-sv|ˈoːbu akadeˈmiː[/tpl]) is the only exclusively Swedish language university in Finland. It is located in Turku (Åbo is the Swedish name of the city). [tpl]As of|2004[/tpl], there are 7 941 students and a staff consisting of 1125 people. The university has activities not only in Turku, but also in Vaasa, Jakobstad, Helsinki and on Åland. Åbo Akademi was a private institution until 1981, when it was turned into a public institution.
Åbo Akademi should not be confused with the Royal Academy of Åbo, which was founded in 1640, but moved to Helsinki after the Turku fire of 1827 and is today known as the University of Helsinki.
Åbo Akademi was founded by private donations in 1918 as the third university in Finland, both to let Turku again become a university town and because it was felt that the Swedish language was threatened at the University of Helsinki. The Finnish University of Turku was founded 1920, also by private donations and for similar reasons.
As the only uni-lingually Swedish multi-faculty university in the world outside Sweden and consequently the only one in Finland, Åbo Akademi University is responsible for higher education for a large proportion of the Swedish-speaking population. This role has many implications on the education and research as well as on the social environment. As there are few students in most subjects, cooperation between the subjects and with other universities is very important.
A significant minority of the students are Finnish-speaking. While Turku in itself is mostly Finnish, the university provides a strong Swedish environment. Most of the students, regardless of original language, will be functionally bilingual when finishing their studies.
The university has a policy that non-Swedish speaking applicants from the Nordic countries are required to participate in a Swedish language test, in order to prove their ability to successfully study in Swedish. Applicants from non-Nordic countries can, however, choose between Swedish or English language tests.

He was a professor of Forestry 1911–34; director-general for Finland's Forest and Park Service 1934–1943; prime minister in 1922, 1924, and 1937–1939; chairman of the National Progressive Party 1933–1943; and Member of Parliament. 
Forest researcher Cajander came to politics in 1922 when president Ståhlberg asked him to take office of prime minister. He had not earlier participated actively in politics. Ståhlberg invited him as prime minister second time in January 1924. Cajander's short-lived cabinets were merely caretakers before parliamentary elections.
Cajander joined in 1927 National Progressive Party and in 1928 he was chosen as minister of defence. Cajander was elected to the Parliament in 1929. When Kyösti Kallio was elected President in 1937, Cajander was asked as the chairman of the National Progressive Party to form majority government. Cajander formed a coalition government of the two largest parties in the parliament - Social Democrats and Agrarian League. Cajander was idealist who did not believe yet in August 1939 that Soviet Union would attack Finland. Partly for this reason the Finnish Army was forced to the fight inadequately equipped.
Cajander's name is remembered for "Model Cajander", the fashion of many Finnish soldiers in Winter War: the army was poorly equipped, so conscripts were given a utility belt, an emblem to be attached to the hat — to comply with the Hague Conventions — and, hopefully, a rifle. Otherwise, they had to use their own clothes and equipment.

Friedrich Freiherr von Wieser[tpl]German title|Freiherr[/tpl] ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈviːzɐ|lang[/tpl]; July 10, 1851 – July 22, 1926) was an early (so-called "first generation") economist of the Austrian School of economics. Born in Vienna, the son of Privy Councillor Leopold von Wieser, a high official in the war ministry, he first trained in sociology and law. In 1872, the year he took his degree, he encountered Austrian-school founder Carl Menger's Grundsätze and switched his interest to economic theory.Joseph A. Schumpeter, Ten Great Economists From Marx to Keynes, 1951, Appendix 2, page 298, reprinted from The Economic Journal, vol. xxxvii, no. 146, June 1927. Wieser held posts at the universities of Vienna and Prague until succeeding Menger in Vienna in 1903, where, with brother-in-law Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, he shaped the next generation of Austrian economists including Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek and Joseph Schumpeter in the late 1890s and early 20th century. He became Austrian finance minister in 1917.
Wieser is renowned for two main works, Natural Value,Der Natürliche Werth, 1889; Natural Value, 1893, translated into English by Christian A. Malloch, edited with an introduction by William Smart. which carefully details the alternative-cost doctrine and the theory of imputation, and his Social Economics (1914), an ambitious attempt to apply it to the real world. His explanation of marginal utility theory was decisive, at least terminologically: It was his term [tpl]lang|de|Grenznutzen[/tpl] (building on von Thünen's Grenzkosten) that developed into the standard term, "marginal utility," not William Stanley Jevons's "final degree of utility" or Menger's "value." His use of the modifier "natural" indicates that he regarded value as a "natural category" that would pertain to any society, no matter what institutions of property had been established.Mark Blaug, Great Economists Before Keynes, 1986, page 280.
The economic calculation debate started with his notion of the paramount importance of accurate calculation to economic efficiency.  Prices to him represented, above all, information about market conditions, and are thus necessary for any sort of economic activity.  A socialist economy, therefore, would require a price system in order to operate.
He also stressed the importance of the entrepreneur to economic change, which he saw as being brought about by “the heroic intervention of individual men who appear as leaders toward new economic shores.” This idea of leadership was later taken up by Joseph Schumpeter in his treatment of economic innovation.
Unlike most other Austrian School economists, he rejected classical liberalism, writing that “freedom has to be superseded by a system of order.” This vision—and his general solution to the role of the individual in history—is best expressed in his final book, The Law of Power, published in his last year of life,  a sociological examination of political order.

Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, Baron Dunira PC FRSE (28 April 1742, Arniston, Midlothian – 28 May 1811, Edinburgh) was a Scottish advocate and Tory politician. He was the first Secretary of State for War and became, in 1806, the last person to be impeached in the United Kingdom, for misappropriation of public money. Although acquitted, he never held public office again.[tpl]cite web|title=Henry Dundas' private papers bought for Scots archive|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18687274|publisher=BBC News Scotland|accessdate=7 May 2013|location=Glasgow|date=3 July 2012[/tpl]
Dundas was a key actor in the encouragement of the Scottish Enlightenment, in the prosecution of the war against France, in opposing the abolition of slavery, and in the expansion of British influence in India, dominating the affairs of the East India Company. An accomplished machine politician and scourge of the Radicals, his deft and almost total control of Scottish politics during a long period when no monarch visited the country, led to him being pejoratively nicknamed King Harry the Ninth, the "Grand Manager of Scotland" (a play on the masonic office of Grand Master of Scotland), the "Great Tyrant" and "The Uncrowned King of Scotland".
He is commemorated by one of the most prominent memorials in Edinburgh, the 150-foot high, Category A listed Melville Monument at St Andrew Square, in the heart of the New Town he helped to establish.

[[History of the United States (1776–89)]]
CATEGORIES: History of the United States (1776–89)

Between 1776 and 1789, the United States emerged as an independent country, creating and ratifying its new constitution, and establishing its  national government. In order to assert their traditional rights, American Patriots seized control of the colonies and launched a war for independence. The Americans declared independence in July 1776 proclaiming "all men are created equal."  Congress raised the Continental Army under the command of General George Washington, forged a military alliance with France, and captured the two main British invasion armies. Nationalists replaced the governing Articles of Confederation to strengthen the federal government's powers of defense and taxation with the Constitution of the United States in 1789, still in effect today.

[[Theory of imputation]]

CATEGORIES: History of economic thought, Value theory, Austrian School

In economics, the theory of imputation, first expounded by Carl Menger, maintains that factor prices are determined by output prices.
This is the opposite of the labor theory of value maintained by classical economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo.
The imputation theory was important because it addressed the question of economic value.  Marginalist economists such as Carl Menger and Frank Fetter of the Austrian School maintained that value was not made up of the factors that made up a good; instead, it was made up of the most valuable use that the last unit of the good could be put to—the marginal utility of the finished good.
While it was easy to maintain that this was the value of goods consumed by the end user (lower-order goods), it was harder to make this case for higher-order goods which had no end user and merely went into the making of lower-order goods.  In effect, higher-order goods do have end users, the manufacturers of lower-order goods.  It was these people whose marginal utility decided the factor prices, and their products were valued on their marginal utility to the end users.  Thus the factors of production were as sensitive to marginal utility as consumer goods themselves.

Marken is a peninsula in the Markermeer, in the Netherlands and a former island in the Zuiderzee, located in the municipality Waterland in the province North Holland. It is the namesake of the Markermeer, the body of water which surrounds it. The former island is nowadays connected to the North Holland mainland by a causeway. Also, Marken is a well-known tourist attraction, well known for its characteristic wooden houses. For some time during the later 19th and early 20th centuries, Marken and its inhabitants were the focus of considerable attention by folklorists, ethnographers and physical anthropologists, who regarded the small fishing town as a relic of the traditional native culture that was destined to disappear as the modernization of the Netherlands gained pace.H.W.

Nuri Pasha al-Said (1888 – July 15, 1958) ([tpl]lang-ar|نوري السعيد[/tpl]) was an Iraqi politician during the British Mandate and during the Kingdom of Iraq. He served in various key cabinet positions, and served seven terms as Prime Minister of Iraq.
From his first appointment as prime minister under the British mandate in 1930, Nuri was a major political figure in Iraq under the monarchy. During his many terms in office, he was involved in some of the key policy decisions that shaped the modern Iraqi state. In 1930, during his first term, he signed the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, which, as a step toward greater independence, granted Britain the unlimited right to station its armed forces in and transit military units through Iraq. It also gave legitimacy to British control of the country's oil industry. While the treaty nominally reduced British involvement in Iraq's internal affairs, this was only to the extent that Iraq's behavior did not conflict with British economic or military interests. This agreement led the way to nominal independence as the Mandate ended in 1932. Throughout his career Nuri was a supporter of a continued and extensive British role within Iraq. These policies were always matters of great contention.
Nuri was a controversial figure with many enemies, and had to flee Iraq twice in the aftermath of coups. By the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958, he was deeply unpopular. His policies, regarded as pro-British, were believed to have failed in adapting to the country's changed social circumstances. Poverty and social injustice were widespread, and Nuri had become a symbol of a regime that failed to address these issues, choosing a course of repression instead to protect the interests of the well-off. On 15 July 1958, the day after the republican revolution, he attempted to flee the country disguised as a woman, but was captured and killed.

CATEGORIES: 1765 births, 1810 deaths, Italian engravers

Luigi Schiavonetti (1 April 1765 – 7 June 1810), Italian reproductive engraver and etcher, was born at Bassano in Venetia.
After having studied art for several years he was employed by Testolini, an engraver of very indifferent abilities, to execute imitations of Bartolozzi's works, which he passed off as his own. In 1790, Testolini was invited by Bartolozzi to join him in England, and, it having been discovered that Schiavonetti, who accompanied him, had executed the plates in question, he was employed by Bartolozzi and became an eminent engraver in both the line and the stipple manner. Among his early works are four plates of subjects from the French Revolution, after Peter Paul Benazech.
Schiavonetti engraved a drawing of Maria Cosway that her husband, the artist Richard Cosway, had drawn.[tpl]cite news | title = How England first saw Bonaparte: a painting by Francesco Cossia commissioned by Maria Cosway in 1797 was the first true portrait of Napoleon to be seen in England.

He also produced a "Mater Dolorosa" after Van Dyck, and Michelangelo's cartoon of the Battle of Cascina depicting the "Surprise of the Soldiers on the Banks of the Arno." From 1805 to 1808, he was engaged in etching William Blake's designs to Blair's Grave, which, with a portrait of the artist engraved by Schiavonetti after T Phillips, R.A., were published in 1808. The etching of Stothard's "Canterbury Pilgrims" was one of his latest works, and on his death the plate was taken up by his brother Niccolo, and finally completed by James Heath.

John Boydell (19 January 1720 (New Style) – 12 December 1804) was an 18th-century British publisher noted for his reproductions of engravings. He helped alter the trade imbalance between Britain and France in engravings and initiated a British tradition in the art form. A former engraver himself, Boydell promoted the interests of artists as well as patrons and as a result his business prospered.
The son of a land surveyor, Boydell apprenticed himself to William Henry Toms, an artist he admired, and learned engraving. He established his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time. Boydell did not think much of his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others, becoming a print dealer as well as an artist. He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind. To spark reciprocal trade, he commissioned William Wollett's spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson's Children of Niobe, which revolutionised the print trade. Ten years later, largely as a result of Boydell's initiative, the trade imbalance had shifted, and he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts.
In the 1790s, Boydell began a large Shakespeare venture that included the establishment of a Shakespeare Gallery, the publication of an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays, and the release of a folio of prints depicting scenes from Shakespeare's works. Some of the most illustrious painters of the day contributed, such as Benjamin West and Henry Fuseli.
Throughout his life, Boydell dedicated time to civic projects: he donated art to government institutions and ran for public office. In 1790 he became Lord Mayor of London. The French Revolutionary Wars led to a cessation in Continental trade at the end of the 1790s and without this business, Boydell's firm declined and he was nearly bankrupt at his death in 1804.

Gaetano Apolline Baldassarre Vestris (18 April 1729 – 1808), French ballet dancer, was born in Florence and made his debut at the opera in 1749.
Born of an Italian theatrical family, he studied dance with Louis Dupré at the Royal Academy in Paris, later joining the Paris Opéra where he served as dancing master to Louis XVI. Vestris was the first dancer to discard the mask and to use his face in mime.	
By 1751 his success and his vanity had grown to such a point that he is reported to have said, "There are but three great men in Europe--the king of Prussia, Voltaire and I." He was an excellent mimic as well as dancer. From 1770 to 1776 he was a master and composer of ballets, retiring, in favour of Jean Georges Noverre, with a pension.
Vestris married a dancer, Anna Heinel (1753–1808), of German origin, who had a wonderful success at the opera. He reappeared at the age of seventy-one on the occasion of his grandson's debut.
Gaetano had several children who also became dancers.  His illegitimate son Auguste Vestris (1760–1842) was also considered the greatest male dancer of his time. Auguste made his debut at 12 with the Paris Opéra and was the company’s leading dancer for 36 years. Auguste Vestris's son, Auguste Armand Vestris (1788–1825), husband of Lucia Elizabeth Vestris, took to the same profession and made his debut at the opera in 1800, but left Paris for England, Italy and Vienna and never reappeared in France. Gaetano's brother, Angiolo Vestris (1730–1809), married Marie Rose Gourgaud, the sister of the actor Dugazon. Their sister Thérèse was better known for her lovers than for her dancing.

Jean-Henri Gourgaud (15 November 1746 – 19 October 1809), French actor under the stage name Dugazon, was born in Marseille, the son of Pierre-Antoine Gourgaud, the director of military hospitals there and also an actor.
He began his career in the provinces, making his debut in 1770 at the Comédie Française, where he aspired to leading comedy roles. He pleased the public at once and was made sociétaire in 1772. Dugazon was an ardent revolutionist, helped the schism which divided the company, and went with Talma and the others to what became the Théâtre de la République. After the closing of this theatre and the dissolution of the Comédie Française, he took refuge at the Théâtre Feydeau until he returned to the restored Comédie in 1799. He retired in 1805, and died insane at Sandillon.
Dugazon wrote three mediocre comedies of a political character, performed at the Théâtre de la République. He married, in 1776, Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre, but was soon divorced and then married again.
Dugazon's sister, Marie Rose Gourgaud (1743–1804), was an actress who first played at Stuttgart, where she married Angelo Vestris, brother of Gaétano Vestris, the dancer. Under the protection of the dukes of Choiseul and Duras, she was commanded to make her debut at the Comédie Française in 1768, where she created important parts in a number of tragedies.

[[Just-in-time compilation]]
CATEGORIES: Compiler construction, Emulation software, Virtualization software

In computing, just-in-time compilation (JIT), also known as dynamic translation, is compilation done during execution of a program – at run time – rather than prior to execution.[tpl]sfn|Aycock|2003[/tpl] Most often this consists of translation to machine code, which is then executed directly, but can also refer to translation to another format.
JIT compilation is a combination of the two traditional approaches to translation to machine code – ahead of time compilation (AOT), and interpretation – and combines some advantages and drawbacks of both.[tpl]sfn|Aycock|2003[/tpl] Roughly, JIT compilation combines the speed of compiled code with the flexibility of interpretation, with the overhead of an interpreter and the additional overhead of compiling (not just interpreting). JIT compilation is a form of dynamic compilation, and allows adaptive optimization such as dynamic recompilation – thus in principle JIT compilation can yield faster execution than static compilation. Interpretation and JIT compilation are particularly suited for dynamic programming languages, as the runtime system can handle late-bound data types and enforce security guarantees.

Point of sale (also called POS or checkout, during computerization later becoming electronic point of sale or EPOS) is the place where a retail transaction is completed. It is the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or services. At the point of sale the retailer would calculate the amount owed by the customer and provide options for the customer to make payment. The merchant will also normally issue a receipt for the transaction.
The POS in various retail industries uses customized hardware and software as per their requirements. Retailers may utilize weighing scales, scanners, electronic and manual cash registers, EFTPOS terminals, touch screens and any other wide variety of hardware and software available for use with POS. For example, a grocery or candy store uses a scale at the point of sale, while bars and restaurants use software to customize the item or service sold when a customer has a special meal or drink request.
The modern point of sale is often referred to as the point of service because it is not just a point of sale but also a point of return or customer order. Additionally it includes advanced features to cater to different functionality, such as inventory management, CRM, financials, warehousing, etc., all built into the POS software. Prior to the modern POS, all of these functions were done independently and required the manual re-keying of information, which can lead to entry errors.

[[Universal suffrage]]

CATEGORIES: Suffrage, Equality rights

Universal suffrage (also universal adult suffrage, general suffrage or common suffrage) consists of the extension of the right to vote to adult citizens (or subjects), though it may also mean extending that right to minors (Demeny voting) and non-citizens. Although suffrage has two necessary components, the right to vote and opportunities to vote, the term universal suffrage is associated only with the right to vote and ignores the frequency that an incumbent government consults the electorate. Where universal suffrage exists, the right to vote is not restricted by race, sex, belief, wealth, or social status.
In 1893 New Zealand became the first nation in the world to grant universal, male and female adult suffrage.  Historically, however, universal suffrage usually referred to adult male suffrage. France was the first nation that announced universal male suffrage; it had the first national system that abolished all property requirements as a prerequisite for allowing men to register and vote. Republican France first instituted full male suffrage in 1792. France and Switzerland have recognized full male suffrage continuously since 1848 (for resident male citizens). The German Empire implemented full male suffrage from 1871.
In most countries, full universal suffrage followed about 10 to 20 years after full male suffrage. Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1945, Italy (1946), Belgium (1948), and Switzerland (1971 in federal elections and 1990 in all cantonal elections).
In the first modern democracies, governments restricted the vote to those with property and wealth, which almost always meant a minority of the male population. In some jurisdictions, other restrictions existed, such as requiring voters to practice a given religion. In all modern democracies, the number of people who could vote has increased progressively with time. In the 19th century in Europe, Great Britain and North America, there were movements advocating "universal male suffrage". The democratic movement of the late 19th century, unifying liberals and social democrats, particularly in northern Europe, used the slogan Equal and Common Suffrage.
Universal suffrage requires the right to vote to be granted to all citizens. Some countries, however, do not allow certain categories of citizens to vote. This includes felony disenfranchisement and disfranchisement based on resident status.

[[Geometrization conjecture]]
CATEGORIES: Geometric topology, Riemannian geometry, 3-manifolds, Conjectures

In mathematics, Thurston's geometrization conjecture states that certain three-dimensional topological spaces each have a unique geometric structure that can be associated with them. It is an analogue of the uniformization theorem for two-dimensional surfaces, which states that every simply-connected Riemann surface can be given one of three geometries (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic).
In three dimensions, it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topological space. Instead, the geometrization conjecture states that every closed 3-manifold can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that each have one of eight types of geometric structure.  The conjecture was proposed by [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink=William Thurston|first=William|last= Thurston|year= 1982[/tpl], and implies several other conjectures, such as the Poincaré conjecture and Thurston's elliptization conjecture.  
Thurston's  hyperbolization theorem implies that Haken manifolds satisfy the  geometrization conjecture.  Thurston announced a proof in the 1980s and since then several complete proofs have appeared in print.
Grigori Perelman sketched a proof of the full geometrization conjecture in 2003 using Ricci flow with surgery.
There are now several different manuscripts (see below) with details of the proof. The Poincaré conjecture and the spherical space form conjecture are corollaries of the geometrization conjecture, although there are shorter proofs of the former that do not lead to the geometrization conjecture.

[[Green sulfur bacteria]]
CATEGORIES: Phototrophic bacteria, Bergey's volume 4

The green sulfur bacteria are a family of obligately anaerobic photoautotrophic bacteria. Most closely related to the distant Bacteroidetes, they are accordingly assigned their own phylum.
Green sulfur bacteria are nonmotile (except Chloroherpeton thalassium, which may glide) and occur in spheres, rods, and spirals.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl] Photosynthesis is achieved using bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) c, d, or e, in addition to BChl a and chlorophyll a, in chlorosomes attached to the membrane.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl] They use sulfide ions, hydrogen or ferrous iron as an electron donor and the process is mediated by the type I reaction centre and Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. Elemental sulfur deposited outside the cell may be further oxidized. By contrast, the photosynthesis in plants uses water as the electron donor and produces oxygen.
Chlorobium tepidum has emerged as a model organism for the group; although only 10 genomes have been sequenced, these are quite comprehensive of the family's biodiversity. Their 2-3 Mb genomes encode 1750-2800 genes, 1400-1500 of which are common to all strains. The apparent absence of two-component histidine-kinases and response regulators suggest limited phenotypic plasticity. Their small dependence on organic molecule transporters and transcription factors also indicate these organisms are adapted to a narrow range of energy-limited conditions, an ecology shared with the simpler cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus
A species of green sulfur bacteria has been found living near a black smoker off the coast of Mexico at a depth of 2,500 m in the Pacific Ocean.  At this depth, the bacterium, designated GSB1, lives off the dim glow of the thermal vent since no sunlight can penetrate to that depth.
Green sulfur bacteria appear in Lake Matano, Indonesia, at a depth of about 110–120 m. The population may include the species Chlorobium ferrooxidans.

CATEGORIES: 1400 births, 1453 deaths, People from Picardy, Joan of Arc, 15th-century historians, 15th-century French writers

Enguerrand de Monstrelet (c. 1400 – 20 July 1453), was a French chronicler. 
He was born in  Picardy, most likely into a family of the minor nobility.
In 1436 and later he held the office of lieutenant of the gavenier (i.e. receiver of the gave, a kind of church rate) at Cambrai, and he seems to have made this city his usual place of residence. He was for some time bailiff of the cathedral chapter and then provost of Cambrai.Wijsman, Hanno.History in Transition. Enguerrand de Monstrelet’s Chronique in Manuscript and Print (c.1450-c.1600). Academia.edu. Retrieved July 23, 2012 He was married and left some children when he died.
Little else is known about Monstrelet except that he was present, not at the capture of Joan of Arc, but at her subsequent interrogation with Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. Continuing the work of Froissart, Monstrelet wrote a Chronique, which extends to two books and covers the period between 1400 and 1444, when, according to another chronicler, Mathieu d'Escouchy, he ceased to write. But following a custom which was by no means uncommon in the Middle Ages, a clumsy sequel, extending to 1516, was formed out of various chronicles and tacked onto his work.
Monstrelet's own writings, dealing with the latter part of the Hundred Years' War, are valuable because they contain a large number of documents which are certainly, and reported speeches which are probably, authentic. The author, however, shows little power of narration; his work, although clear, is dull, and is strongly tinged with the pedantry of its century, the most pedantic in French history. His somewhat ostentatious assertions of impartiality do not cloak a marked preference for the Burgundians in their struggle with France.
Among many editions of the Chronique may be mentioned the one edited for the Société de I'histoire de France by M Douet d'Arcq (Paris, 1857–1862), which, however, is not very good. See A Molinier, Les Sources de I'histoire de France, tomes iv. and v. (Paris, 1904).

[[Auguste Molinier]]
CATEGORIES: 1851 births, 1904 deaths, French archivists, French historians, French librarians, French medievalists

August Molinier (30 September 1851 - 19 May 1904) was a French historian.
He was born at Toulouse. He was a pupil at the École des Chartes, which he left in 1873, and also at the École des Hautes Études; and he obtained appointments in the public libraries at the Mazarine (1878), at Fontainebleau (1884), and at Sainte-Geneviève, of which he was nominated librarian in 1885.
He was a good palaeographer and had a thorough knowledge of archives and manuscripts; and he soon won a first place among scholars of the history of medieval France. His thesis on leaving the École des Chartes was his [tpl]lang|fr|Catalogue des actes de Simon et d'Amauri de Montfort[/tpl] (inserted in vol. xxxiv of the [tpl]lang|fr|Bibliothèque de l'École des Chartes[/tpl]), an important contribution to the history of the Albigenses. This marked him out as a capable editor for the new edition of [tpl]lang|fr|L'histoire générale de Languedoc[/tpl] by Dom Vaissète: he superintended the reprinting of the text, adding notes on the feudal administration of this province from 900 to 1250, on the government of Alphonse of Toulouse, brother of St Louis (1220–1271), and on the historical geography of the province of Languedoc in the Middle Ages.
He also wrote a [tpl]lang|fr|Bibliographie du Languedoc[/tpl], which was awarded a prize by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, but remained in manuscript. He also published several documents for the Société de l'Orient Latin ([tpl]lang|fr|Itinera hierosolymitana[/tpl], in collaboration with Ch. Kohler, 1885); for the Société de l'Histoire de France ([tpl]lang|fr|Chronique normande du XIVe siècle[/tpl], assisted by his brother Émile, 1883); for the [tpl]lang|fr|Collection de textes relatifs à l'enseignement de l'histoire[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|fr|Vie de Louis le Gros[/tpl], by Suger, 1887); for the [tpl]lang|fr|Collection des documents inédits[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|fr|Correspondance administrative d'Alfonse de Poitiers[/tpl], 1894–1900); for the Recueil des historiens de la France ([tpl]lang|fr|Obituaires de la province de Sens[/tpl] 1904, 1906), etc., and several volumes in the [tpl]lang|fr|Recueil des catalogues des bibliothèques publiques de France[/tpl].
Applying to the French classics the rigorous method used with regard to the texts of the Middle Ages, he published the Pensées of Pascal, revised with the original manuscript (1887–1889), and the Provinciales (1891), edited with notes. In 1893 he was nominated professor at the [tpl]lang|fr|École des Chartes[/tpl], and gave a successful series of lectures which he published ([tpl]lang|fr|Manuel des sources de l'histoire de France au Moyen âge[/tpl], 1902–1906). He also taught at the [tpl]lang|fr|École pratique des hautes études[/tpl]. He died after a short illness, leaving in manuscript a criticism on the sources of the [tpl]lang|la|Speculum historiale[/tpl] of Vincent de Beauvais.
His elder brother, Charles (born 1843), is also of some importance as an historian, particularly on the history of art and on the heresies of the Middle Ages. He was appointed professor of history at the university of Toulouse in 1886.
A younger brother, Émile (1857–1906), became an assistant in the print-room at the Bibliothèque Nationale, and afterwards joined the staff at the Musée du Louvre, of which he eventually became keeper, retiring in 1902. He was a well-known connoisseur of art. He organized the famous Exposition rétrospective held at the Petit Palais in 1900, and published a number of expert volumes on enamels, ceramics and furniture.

[[Windhoek Declaration]]

CATEGORIES: Human rights, Documents, 1991 in Africa, African journalism, Freedom of the press

The Windhoek Declaration is a statement of press freedom principles put together by African newspaper journalists in 1991. The Declaration was produced at a UNESCO seminar, "Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press," held in Windhoek, Namibia, from April 29 to May 3, 1991; it was later endorsed by the UNESCO General Conference. The context for the meeting was set by the various crises Africa had faced during the 1980s; it was inspired by the move toward democratisation in the region that followed those crises, as well as the end of the Cold War.
In short, the Declaration was the outcome of a long and frank look at the problems of African print media. The document enumerates instances of intimidation, imprisonment, and censorship across Africa. With a strong belief in the connection between a fully independent press and successful participatory democracy, the document calls for free, independent and pluralistic media throughout the world. The Declaration also asserts that a free press is essential to democracy and a fundamental human right. At the same time, the seminar participants highlighted the practical problems of journalists in Africa, particularly those related to acquiring up-to-date equipment, building inter-company cooperation, and providing adequate training.
Because the declaration is overwhelmingly directed at the printed media as independent broadcasting was not much of a phenomenon back then, the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the declaration - held also in Windhoek - were used by activists to propose and adopt a new document that would address issues specific to broadcasting, the African Charter on Broadcasting. In Africa, radio is the medium that reaches the biggest number of people.
The date of the Declaration's adoption, May 3, has subsequently been declared as World Press Freedom Day. The document has been viewed as widely influential, as the first in a series of such declarations around the world, and as a crucial affirmation of the international community's commitment to freedom of the press. Subsequently several similar documents were drafted in other parts of the developing world: The Alma-Ata Declaration for central Asia, Sana'a Declaration for the Middle East, and the Santiago Declaration for Latin America and the Caribbean. At the tenth anniversary of the Windhoek Declaration, however, the United Nations jubilee statement noted the fragility of press freedom in the face of political violence or authoritarianism. 
The years since 1991 provide ample reason for worry. In countries that suffer repression, like Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe, or systemic violence, like Liberia, see a concomitant rise in instances of censorship and press intimidation.

UNESCO marks World Press Freedom Day by conferring the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize on a deserving individual, organization or institution that has made an outstanding contribution to the defence and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world, especially when this has been achieved in the face of danger. Created in 1997, the prize is awarded on the recommendation of an independent jury of 14 news professionals. Names are submitted by regional and international non-governmental organizations working for press freedom, and by UNESCO member states.
The Prize is named in honour of Guillermo Cano Isaza, a Colombian journalist who was assassinated in front of the offices of his newspaper, El Espectador, in Bogotá, on 17 December 1986. Cano's writings had offended Colombia's powerful drug barons.
UNESCO also marks World Press Freedom Day each year by bringing together media professionals, press freedom organisations and UN agencies to assess the state of press freedom worldwide and discuss solutions for addressing challenges. Each conference is centred around a theme related to press freedom, including good governance, media coverage of terrorism, impunity and the role of media in post-conflict countries.
The 2011 World Press Freedom Day celebration was held in Washington, D.C., USA on May 1-3. It was the first time the United States had hosted the World Press Freedom Day celebration. The theme of the event was 21st Century Media: New Frontiers, New Barriers. The event affirmed fundamental principles of media freedom in the digital age—the ability of citizens to voice their opinions and access diverse, independent information sources—20 years after the original declaration was made in Windhoek, Namibia.

The four species of avocets [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|v|ə|s|ɛ|t[/tpl] are a genus, Recurvirostra, of waders in the same avian family as the stilts. 
Avocets have long legs and long, thin, upcurved bills (giving their scientific name Recurvirostra) which they sweep from side to side when feeding in the brackish or saline wetlands they prefer. The plumage is pied, sometimes also with some red. 
Members of this genus have webbed feet and readily swim. Their diet consists of aquatic insects and other small creatures. 
They nest on the ground in loose colonies.  In estuarine settings they may feed on exposed bay muds or mudflats.
The Pied Avocet is the emblem of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
The four species, all in the genus Recurvirostra, are:
In a large colony they are aggressively defensive and chase off any other species of birds that try to nest among or near them. That causes the annoyed remark "Avocet : Exocet" from some British birdwatchers.BBC TV 1 program The One Show, 7-7.30 pm 16 January 2008
They had been extinct in Britain for a long time because of land reclamation of their habitat and persecution by skin and egg collectors, but during or soon after World War II started breeding on reclaimed land near the Wash which was returned to salt marsh to make difficulties for any landing German invaders.

Stilt is a common name for several species of birds in the family Recurvirostridae, which also includes those known as avocets. They are found in brackish or saline wetlands in warm or hot climates.  
They have extremely long legs, hence the group name, and long thin bills. Stilts typically feed on aquatic insects and other small creatures and nest on the ground surface in loose colonies.
Most sources recognize 6 species in 2 genera, although the White-backed and Hawaiian stilts are occasionally considered subspecies of the Black-necked Stilt.  The generic name "Himantopus" comes from the Greek meaning "strap-leg".[tpl]cite book|last=Jobling|first=James|title=Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names|year=2010|publisher=Helm|location=London|isbn=978-1-4081-2501-4|page=191[/tpl]

[[Johann Joachim Eschenburg]]
CATEGORIES: 1743 births, 1820 deaths, German literary critics, People from Hamburg, Braunschweig University of Technology faculty

Johann Joachim Eschenburg (December 7, 1743 – February 29, 1820) was a German critic and literary historian.
He was born and educated at Hamburg, going on to study at the University of Leipzig and University of Göttingen. In 1767 he was appointed tutor, and subsequently professor, at the Collegium Carolinum in Braunschweig (today TU Braunschweig). The title of Hofrat was conferred on him in 1786, and in 1814 he was made one of the directors of the Carolinum.
He is best known for his efforts to popularize English literature in Germany. He published a series of German translations of the principal English writers on aesthetics, such as Charles Burney, Joseph Priestley and Richard Hurd; and also produced the first complete translation in German prose of Shakespeare's plays (William Shakespear's Schauspiele, 13 vols., Zürich, 1775–1782). This is virtually a revised edition of the incomplete translation published by Christoph Martin Wieland between 1762 and 1766.
Besides editing, with memoirs, the works of Friedrich von Hagedorn, Zachariä and other German poets, he was the author of a Handbuch der klassischen Literatur (1783); Entwurf einer Theorie und Literatur der schönen Wissenschaften (1783); Beispielsammiung zur Theorie und Literatur der schönen Wissenschaften (8 vols, 1788–1795); Lehrbuch der Wissenschaftskunde (1792); and Denkmäler altdeutscher Dichtkunst (1799). Most of these passed through several editions.
Eschenburg was also a poet, and some of his hymns, e.g. Ich will dich noch im Tod erheben and Dir trau ich, Gott, und wanke nicht, remain well-known.

EUR is a residential and business district in Rome, Italy located south of the city centre. The area was originally chosen in 1930s as the site for the 1942 world's fair which Benito Mussolini planned to open to celebrate twenty years of Fascism, the letters EUR standing for Esposizione Universale Roma. The project was originally called E42 after the year in which the exhibition was planned to be held. EUR was also designed to direct the expansion of the city towards the south-west and the sea, and to be a new city centre for Rome.Robert A. Stern, Classicismo moderno, Di Baio Editore, 1990 The planned exhibition never took place due to World War II.

CATEGORIES: Electronics

Cryotronics is the production of electronics that utilize superconductivity, and is not to be confused with cryoelectronics or cryolectronics.  The simplest use of cryotronics is the cryotron, which is a switch.  Rapid single flux quantum digital electronics technology is a good example of cryotronics, as it is based on superconductors. Additionally, the sensitive amplifiers used in radio telescopes are cooled using liquid helium to reduce thermal noise. Cryotronics includes creating,
1.supersensitive miniature receivers for detecting weak radio signals.
2.a crytron switch depends on the effect of inducing persistent current in a closed superconducting circuit for eg.ring

[[Cryotron]]

CATEGORIES: Switches, American inventions

The cryotron is a switch that operates using superconductivity.[ref]
</ref> The cryotron works on the principle that [[magnetic field]]s destroy superconductivity. This simple device consists of two superconducting wires ( e.g. tantalum and niobium) with different critical temperature (Tc). The cryotron was invented by [[Dudley Allen Buck]] of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory.
As described by Buck,[ref]
</ref> a straight wire of [[tantalum]] ( having lower Tc) is wrapped around with a wire of [[niobium]] in a single layer coil. Both wires are electrically isolated from each other. When this device is immersed in a liquid [[helium]] bath both wires become superconducting and hence offer no resistance to the passage of electric current. Tantalum in superconducting state can carry large amount of current as compared to its normal state. Now when current is passed through the niobium coil (wrapped around tantalum) it produces a magnetic field, which in turn reduces (kills) the superconductivity of the tantalum wire and hence reduces the amount of the current that can flow through the tantalum wire. Hence one can control the amount of the current that can flow in the straight wire with the help of small current in the coiled wire. We can think of the tantalum straight wire as a "gate" and the coiled niobium as a "control".
The article by Buck  includes descriptions of several logic circuits implemented using cryotrons, including: one stage of a binary adder, carry network, binary accumulator stage, and two stages of a cryotron stepping register.
A planar cryotron using thin films of lead and tin was developed in 1957 by John Bremer at GE’s General Engineering Lab in Schenectady, New York, USA. This was one of the first integrated circuits, although using superconductors rather than semiconductors. In the next few years a demonstration computer was made and arrays with 2000 devices operated. A short history of this work is in the November 2007 newsletter of the IEEE History Center.[ref]
</ref>
Matisoo [ref]
</ref> developed a version of the cryotron incorporating a [[Josephson junction]] switched by the magnetic field from a control wire. He also explained the shortcomings of traditional cryotrons in which the superconductive material must transition between superconducting and normal states to switch the device, and thus switch relatively slowly.

[[Transformation problem]]
CATEGORIES: Marxist theory

In 20th-century discussions of Karl Marx's economics, the transformation problem is the problem of finding a general rule by which to transform the "values" of commodities (based on their socially necessary labour content, according to his labour theory of value) into the "competitive prices" of the marketplace. This problem was first introduced by Marx in chapter 9 of the draft of volume 3 of Capital, where he also sketched a solution. The essential difficulty was this: given that Marx derived profit, in the form of surplus value, from direct labour inputs, and that the ratio of direct labour input to capital input varied widely between commodities, how could he reconcile this with the tendency toward an average rate of profit on all capital invested?

[[Royal Uncle Cao]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese gods, Health gods

The youngest of the Eight Immortals, Royal Uncle Cao or Cao Guojiu ([tpl]zh|曹國舅|p=cáo guó jiù|w=Ts'ao Kuo-ch'iu[/tpl]) is named one of the following:
He was said to be the uncle of the Emperor of the Song Dynasty, being the younger brother of Empress Dowager Cao (曹太后 cáo tàihòu). 
In historic records, there were several Emperor-consorts Caos in the Song Empire, but only one became empress: Cishengguangxian Empress (慈聖光獻皇后 cí shèng guāng xiàn huáng hoù) (1015–1079), the wife of the fourth Song emperor, Rénzōng (仁宗), none of whose children became an emperor. 
However, this does not render the historical existence of the "Royal Uncle Cao" impossible as in pre-modern China, the address "uncle" also meant "brother-in-law". Sometimes specified as "Wife-uncle" (妻舅 qī jiù) or as a respect, "Little Uncle" (舅子 jiù zǐ). Císhèngguāngxiàn Empress did have a younger brother named Cao Yi in historical record. But the given name of Royal Uncle Cao being Yi as well could be a post hoc.
Cao Guojiu's younger brother Cao Jingzhi (曹景植 cáo jǐng zhí) was a bully, but no one dared to prosecute him because of his powerful connections, not even after he killed a person. Royal Uncle Cao was so overwhelmed by sadness and shame on his brother that he resigned his office and left home.

[[Lan Caihe]]

Lan Caihe ([tpl]zh|c=藍采和|p=Lán Cǎihé|w=Lan Ts'ai-ho[/tpl]) is the least defined of the Eight Immortals in Chinese mythology. Lan Caihe's age and sex are unknown. Lan is usually depicted in sexually ambiguous clothing, but is often shown as a young boy or girl carrying a bamboo flower basket.
Stories of Lan's behaviour are often bizarrely eccentric. Some sources dress Lan Caihe in a ragged blue gown, and refer to them as the immortal patron of minstrels. In another tradition, Lan is a female singer whose song lyrics accurately predict future events.
Lan is often described as carrying a pair of bamboo castanets which they would clap and make a beat with by hitting the ground, they would then sing to this beat and a group of onlookers would follow and watch in amazement and entertain themselves. After these performances they would give them lots of money as they asked for it, Lan Cai. They would then string this cash and coins on a long string of money that they carried. As they walked the coins would fall off. They would not care, other beggars would then take the money.
They are often described as wearing only one shoe and other foot being bare, in the Winter it was said they slept naked in the snow and it melted and in the summer it was said they stuffed their clothes full and wore thick clothes despite the heat.
Like all the other immortals they were often said to be in a drunken stupor and left this world by flying on a heavenly swan or crane into heaven. One day while in a tavern, they had supposedly gotten up to go to the bathroom. But before leaving they flew off on the crane or swan and stripped off their clothes on the way up.

[[History of Parliamentarism]]

CATEGORIES: Political systems

The origins of the modern concept of prime ministerial government go back to the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1800) and The Parliamentary System in Sweden 1721 - 1772, that coincided with each other.
In theory, power resided in the monarch, who chaired cabinet and chose ministers.  In
reality, King George I's inability to speak English led the responsibility for chairing cabinet to go to the leading minister, literally the prime or first minister. The gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament's role in controlling government, and in deciding who the king could ask to form a government. By the nineteenth century, the Great Reform Act of 1832 led to parliamentary dominance, with its choice invariably deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government. 
Other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the Westminster Model of government, with an executive answerable to parliament, but exercising powers nominally vested in the head of state, in the name of the head of state. Hence the use of phrases like Her Majesty's government or His Excellency's government. Such a system became particularly prevalent in older British dominions, many of whom had their constitutions enacted by the British parliament. Examples include Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Irish Free State and the Union of South Africa, though these parliaments themselves have often evolved or were reformed from their British model: the Australian Senate, for instance, more closely reflects the US Senate than the British House of Lords; whereas there is no upper house in New Zealand.

[[Sturgeon]]

CATEGORIES: Sturgeons, Commercial fish

 
Sturgeon is the common name used for some 25 species of fish in the family Acipenseridae, including the genera Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus. The term includes over 20 species commonly referred to as sturgeon and several closely related species that have distinct common names, notably sterlet, kaluga and beluga. Collectively, the family is also known as the true sturgeons. Sturgeon is sometimes used more exclusively to refer to the species in the two best-known genera, Acipenser and Huso.
One of the oldest families of bony fish in existence, sturgeon are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. They are distinctive for their elongated bodies, lack of scales, and occasional great size: sturgeons ranging from 7–12 feet (2-3½ m) in length are common, and some species grow up to [tpl]convert|18|ft|m|1[/tpl]. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders, spawning upstream and feeding in  river deltas and estuaries. While some are entirely freshwater, a very few venture into the open ocean beyond near coastal areas.
Several species of sturgeons are harvested for their roe, which is made into caviar — a luxury food which makes some sturgeons pound for pound the most valuable of all harvested fish. Because they are slow-growing and mature very late in life, they are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and to other threats, including pollution and habitat fragmentation. Most species of sturgeons are currently considered to be at risk of extinction, making them more critically endangered than any other group of species.

Lü Dongbin ([tpl]zh|t=呂洞賓|w=Lü Tung-Pin[/tpl]; born 796) was a Tang Dynasty Chinese scholar and poet who has been elevated to the status of an Immortal in the Chinese cultural sphere, worshipped especially by the Taoists.  Lü is one of the most widely known of the group of deities known as the Eight Immortals and considered by some to be the de facto leader. (The formal leader is more likely said to be Zhongli Quan or sometimes Iron-Crutch Li.) He is also a historical figure who was mentioned in the official history book "History of Song". Lü is widely considered to be one of the earliest masters of the tradition of Neidan, or Internal alchemy. He is depicted in art as being dressed as a scholar and he often bears a sword on his back that dispels evil spirits.

Heinrich Brüning ([tpl]Audio|Heinrich Brüning.ogg|listen[/tpl]) (26 November 1885 – 30 March 1970) was Chancellor of Germany during the Weimar Republic from 1930 to 1932. He was the longest continuously serving  Chancellor of the Weimar Republic.
Shortly after Brüning took office he was confronted by an economic crisis caused by the Great Depression. Brüning responded with tightening of credit and a rollback of all wage and salary increases. These policies increased unemployment and made Brüning highly unpopular, losing him support in the Reichstag.
Invoking President Paul von Hindenburg's constitutional powers, Brüning established a so-called presidential government, basing his administration's authority on presidential emergency decrees which were instituted without prior consent of the Reichstag.
Brüning remains a controversial figure in Germany's history. His use of emergency decrees and ambivalent policies toward the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), at times opposing them and at other times cooperating with them, contributed to the demise of the Weimar Republic.

[[Exterior derivative]]

CATEGORIES: Differential forms, Differential operators, Generalizations of the derivative

On a differentiable manifold, the exterior derivative extends the concept of the differential of a function to differential forms of higher degree. The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Élie Cartan; it allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.
If a k-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal k-parallelepiped, then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a (k+1)-parallelepiped.

[[Appeal to spite]]

CATEGORIES: Appeals to emotion

An appeal to spite (also called argumentum ad odium)[tpl]cite web| title= Emotional Appeal |first= G. N. |last= Curtis |url= http://www.fallacyfiles.org/emotiona.html |quote= Appeal to Hatred (AKA, Argumentum ad Odium) [/tpl] is a fallacy in which someone attempts to win favor for an argument by exploiting existing feelings of bitterness, spite, or schadenfreude in the opposing party. It is an attempt to sway the audience emotionally by associating a hate-figure with opposition to the speaker's argument.
Fallacious ad hominem arguments which attack villains holding the opposing view are often confused with appeals to spite. The ad hominem can be a similar appeal to a negative emotion, but differs from it in directly criticizing the villain —that is unnecessary in an appeal to spite, where hatred for the villain is assumed.

The substance has been used as a popular perfume fixative since ancient times and is one of the more expensive animal products in the world. The name originates from the Sanskrit word for "testicle", [tpl]Unicode|muṣká[/tpl], and has come to encompass a wide variety of aromatic substances with similar odors despite their often differing chemical structures.
Until the late 19th century, natural musk was used extensively in perfumery until economic and ethical motives led to the adoption of synthetic musk, which is now used almost exclusively.[tpl]cite book | title = Synthetic Musk Fragrances in the Environment (Handbook of Environmental Chemistry) | first = Gerhard G.

Marie-Anne Charlotte de Corday d'Armont (27 July 1768 – 17 July 1793), known to history as Charlotte Corday ([tpl]IPA-fr|kɔʁdɛ|lang[/tpl]), was a figure of the French Revolution. In 1793, she was executed under the guillotine for the assassination of Jacobin leader Jean-Paul Marat, who was in part responsible, through his role as a politician and journalist, for the more radical course the Revolution had taken. More specifically, he played a substantial role in the political purge of the Girondins, with whom Corday sympathized. His murder was memorialized in a celebrated painting by Jacques-Louis David which shows Marat after Corday had stabbed him to death in his bathtub. In 1847, writer Alphonse de Lamartine gave Corday the posthumous nickname l'ange de l'assassinat (the Angel of Assassination).

The ground jays or ground choughs belong to a distinct group of the passerine order of birds in the genus Podoces of the crow family Corvidae. They inhabit high altitude semi-desert areas from central Asia to Mongolia.
Ground jays show adaptations to ground living such as long, strong legs adapted to fast running and the ability to leap and bound onto boulders and rocks with great agility. Their long, curved thick bills are adapted for digging and probing. 
While capable of flight (which they do infrequently and relatively weakly), they prefer running, and will readily perch on trees and bushes also.

Cholula is a city and district located in the center west of the state of Puebla, next to the city of Puebla de Zaragoza, in central Mexico. Cholula is best known for its Great Pyramid, with the Nuestra Señora de los Remedios sanctuary on top and its numerous churches. The city and district are divided into two, San Pedro Cholula and San Andrés Cholula, which together are officially called the Distrito Cholula de Rivadavia. Surrounding the city proper is a number of more rural communities which belong to the municipalities of San Andrés and San Pedro. The city itself is divided into eighteen neighborhoods or barrios, each with a patron saint. This division has pre-Hispanic origins as does the division into two municipalities. The city is unified by a complicated system of shared religious responsibilities, called cargas, which function mostly to support a very busy calendar of saints' days and other festivals which occur in one part or another almost all year round. The most important of these festivals is that dedicated to the Virgin of the Remedies, the patron of the city in its entirety, which occurs at the beginning of September.

Walter Perry Johnson (November 6, 1887 – December 10, 1946), nicknamed "Barney" and "The Big Train", was a Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. He played his entire 21-year baseball career for the Washington Senators (1907–1927). He later served as manager of the Senators from 1929 through 1932 and for the Cleveland Indians from 1933 through 1935.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/305482/Walter-Johnson|title=Walter Johnson|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=July 27, 2012[/tpl]

[[Helicoplacus]]

CATEGORIES: Echinoderms, Prehistoric invertebrates, Cambrian animals

Helicoplacus (often misspelled Helioplacus) is the earliest well-studied fossil echinoderm. Fossil plates are known from several regions. Complete specimens were found in Lower Cambrian strata of the White Mountains of California. 
The animal was a cigar-shaped creature up to [tpl]convert|7|cm|in[/tpl] long that stood upright on one end. Unlike more typical echinoderms such as sea stars, Helicoplacus does not have fivefold symmetry. Instead, there is a spiral food groove on the outside along which food was moved to a mouth that is thought to be located on the side. The respiratory system appears to be primitive. Although the animal does not look like a typical echinoderm, the plates are composed of the characteristic calcareous plates known as stereom that are common to all echinoderms. The ambulacrum is similar to that of the Edrioasteroidea; as a result, Helicoplacoidea may belong to Pelmatozoa. 
Other contemporaneous echinoderms are known to have existed from their dissociated plates, but other than a few possible edrioasteroids, Helicoplacus is the earliest echinoderm that is well enough preserved to analyze its characteristics. One much earlier form called Arkarua has been hypothesized to be an ancestral echinoderm because of its fivefold symmetry. But Arkarua appears to lack both stereoms and a mouth.
Helicoplacoids seem to have existed for about 15 million years[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] in the Lower Cambrian, around [tpl]mya|525[/tpl].[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]
Helicoplacoids are thought to have been suspension feeders living at moderate depths in highly-oxygenated water with strong enough currents to ensure a steady food supply. They are typically found in greenish shales and are rarely found in shallow water sandstones and limestones.

[[Freezing rain]]
CATEGORIES: Precipitation, Weather hazards, Snow or ice weather phenomena, Road hazards

Freezing rain is the name given to rain that falls when surface temperatures are below freezing.  Unlike a mixture of rain and snow, ice pellets (both of which are sometimes called "sleet"), or hail, freezing rain is made entirely of liquid droplets. The raindrops become supercooled while passing through a sub-freezing layer of air many hundreds of feet above the earth, and then freeze upon impact with any surface they encounter.Glossary of Meteorology. F. Retrieved on 2008-02-17. The resulting ice, called glaze, can accumulate to a thickness of several centimeters. The METAR code for freezing rain is FZRA.
A storm that produces a significant thickness of glaze ice from freezing rain is often referred to as an ice storm. Freezing rain is notorious for causing travel problems on roadways, breaking tree limbs, and downing power lines. It is also known for being extremely dangerous to aircraft since the ice can effectively 'remould' the shape of the airfoil and flight control surfaces.

[[Nutcracker (bird)]]
CATEGORIES: Nucifraga, Bird genera

The nutcrackers (Nucifraga) are a genus of three species of passerine bird, in the family Corvidae, related to the jays and crows. One, the Spotted Nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), occurs in Europe and Asia. The next, the Large-spotted Nutcracker (Nucifraga multipunctata) occurs in the Himalayas and is sometimes considered a subspecies of the Spotted.  The last, the Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), occurs in western North America.
The most important food resources for both these species are the seeds (pine nuts) of various Pines (Pinus sp.), principally the cold-climate (far northern or high altitude) species of white pine (Pinus subgenus Strobus) with large seeds: P. albicaulis, P. armandii, P. cembra, P. flexilis, P. koraiensis, P. parviflora, P. peuce, P. pumila, P. sibirica and P. wallichiana, and also the pinyon and lacebark pines in subgenus Ducampopinus. In some regions, where none of these pines occur, the seeds of Spruce (Picea sp.) and hazelnuts (Corylus sp.) form an important part of the diet too. The bills of these birds are specialized tools for extracting seeds from pine cones.
Surplus seed is always stored for later use, and it is this genus that is responsible for the re-establishment of their favoured pines over large areas either burnt in forest fires or cleared by man.  The Nutcracker can store as many as 30,000 pine nuts in a single season, remembering the location of as many as 70% of their stash, even when buried in snow.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jmqk1
Various insects are also taken, including bee and wasp larvae, and also birds' eggs and nestlings, and carrion if it is found.
Nesting is always early in this genus, so as to make the best use of pine nuts stored the previous autumn. The nest is usually built high in a conifer. There are normally 2-4 eggs laid and incubated for 18 days. Both sexes feed the young which are usually fledged by about 23 days and stay with their parents for many months, following them to learn food storage techniques.
None of the species are migratory, but they will leave their usual ranges if a cone crop failure causes a food shortage.

The hammer and sickle (☭) are a part of communist symbolism and their usage indicates an association with communism, a communist party, or a communist state. This symbol features a hammer and a sickle overlapping each other. The two tools symbolize the urban industrial workers and the rural agricultural workers respectively, and their overlapping symbolizes the unity of the two as the working class. This emblem was conceived during the Russian Revolution. Many flags and emblems have since incorporated the symbol, with some including additional locally-relevant symbolism.

The Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore (English: Basilica of Saint Mary of the Flower) is the main church of Florence, Italy. Il Duomo di Firenze, as it is ordinarily called, was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style to the design of Arnolfo di Cambio and completed structurally in 1436 with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi. The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink bordered by white and has an elaborate 19th-century Gothic Revival façade by Emilio De Fabris.
The cathedral complex, located in Piazza del Duomo, includes the Baptistery and Giotto's Campanile. The three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major attraction to tourists visiting the region of Tuscany. The basilica is one of Italy's largest churches, and until development of new structural materials in the modern era, the dome was the largest in the world. It remains the largest brick dome ever constructed.

[[Grandparent visitation]]

CATEGORIES: Family law in the United States

Grandparent visitation is a legal right that grandparents in some jurisdictions may have to have court-ordered contact (or visitation) with their grandchildren. In the United States, all 50 states have a "grandparent visitation" statute that allows grandparents to ask a court to grant them the legal right to maintain ongoing contact with their grandchildren. State laws vary greatly, and some states do not guarantee that the grandparents will be able to obtain a court order granting them visitation. The rationale behind these laws is that sometimes, especially with the death of a parent or in a family that has undergone divorce, the children may not have the opportunity to have contact with the non-custodial parent and his relatives, thus fostering continued familial bonds. Those opposing this view say that court-ordered grandparent visitation infringes upon the fundamental right of fit parents to raise their child in the manner that they see fit (including the right to decide with whom the child will associate).

Johann Dominicus Fiorillo (October 13, 1748 – September 10, 1821) was a German painter and historian of art.
Fiorillo, a son of Italian composer Ignazio Fiorillo, was born at Hamburg. He received his first instructions in art at an academy of painting at Bayreuth; and in 1761, to continue his studies, he went first to Rome, and next to Bologna, where he distinguished himself sufficiently to attain in 1769 admission to the academy. Returning soon after to Germany, he obtained the appointment of historical painter to the court of Brunswick.
In 1781 he removed to Göttingen, occupied himself as a drawingmaster, and was named in 1784 keeper of the collection of prints at the university library. He was appointed professor extraordinary in the philosophical faculty in 1799, and ordinary professor at Göttingen University in 1813. During this period he had made himself known as a writer by the publication of his Geschichte der zeichnenden Künste, in 5 volumes (1798–1808). This was followed in 1815 to 1820 by the Geschichte der zeichnenden Künste in Deutschland und den vereinigten Niederlanden, in 4 volumes. These works, though not attaining to any high mark of literary excellence, are esteemed for the information collected in them, especially on the subject of art in the later Middle Ages. Fiorillo practiced his art almost until his death, but has left no memorable masterpiece. The most noticeable of his painting is perhaps the Surrender of Briseis.
He died at Göttingen.

In programming languages,   encapsulation is used to refer to one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combinationMichael Lee Scott, Programming language pragmatics, Edition	2, Morgan Kaufmann, 2006, ISBN 0-12-633951-1, p. 481:  "Encapsulation mechanisms enable the programmer to group data and the subroutines that operate on them together in one place, and to hide irrelevant details from the users of an abstraction."Nell B. Dale, Chip Weems, Programming and problem solving with Java, Edition 2, Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2007, ISBN 0-7637-3402-0, p. 396 thereof:
Some programming language researchers and academics use the first meaning alone or in combination with the second as a distinguishing feature of object-oriented programming, while other programming languages which provide lexical closures view encapsulation as a feature of the language orthogonal to object orientation.
The second definition is motivated by the fact that in many OOP languages hiding of components is not automatic or can be overridden; thus, information hiding is defined as a separate notion by those who prefer the second definition.

Among the political ideals held by the sans-culottes were popular democracy, social and economic equality, affordable food, rejection of the free-market economy, and vigilance against counter-revolutionaries.Darline Levy (1981) Women in Revolutionary Paris 1789–1795 (University of Illinois Press, August 1, 1981). Translated by Harriet Applewhite, Mary Johnson. Pg 144. Quotation: "The sans-culottes (...) campaigned for a more democratic constitution, price controls, harsh laws against political enemies, and economic legislation to assist the needy."  During the peak of their influence, roughly 1792 to 1795, the sans-culottes provided the principal support behind the two far-left factions of the Paris Commune, the Enragés and the Hébertists.Patrice Higonnet (1998) Goodness beyond Virtue: Jacobins during the French Revolution (Harvard University Press, October 25, 1998). Pg 118. Quotation: In the summer of 1793 the sans-culottes, the Parisian enragés especially, accused even the most radical Jacobins of being too tolerant of greed and insufficiently universalist. From this far-left point of view, all Jacobins were at fault because all of them tolerated existing civil life and social structures. Darline Levy (1981) Women in Revolutionary Paris 1789–1795 (University of Illinois Press, August 1, 1981). Translated by Harriet Applewhite, Mary Johnson. Pg 145. Quotation: They were also allied with the Enragés, the most extreme spokesmen on the left for the interests of the Parisian sans-culottes.  Led by populist revolutionaries such as Jacques Roux and Jacques Hébert, the sans-culottes were rallied to provide critical support for the radical and far-left factions of the successive revolutionary governments. Shifting crowds of militant sans-culottes also provided the strength behind some of the more violent and visceral events of the revolution, such as the September massacres in 1792. When the moderate bourgeois Jacobin Club took over the National Convention in 1793, many sans-culottes even supported the Committee of Public Safety and Maximilien Robespierre's bloody Reign of Terror.
By early 1794, however, radicalism was rapidly losing influence and political legitimacy in the National Convention. It was not long before Robespierre and the Jacobins turned on the far-left factions of the National Convention as well as their radical sans-culottes supporters. Several important leaders of the Enragés and Hébertists were imprisoned and executed by the very revolutionary tribunals they had supported. With the absence of effective leadership, and having lost their favor with the Jacobins, the sans-culottes withered. Within a year of the execution of Robespierre and the Thermidorian Reaction, the militants were forcibly – and permanently – suppressed by the conservative new government, the French Directory.Soboul (1972), pp. 258–259.

[[List of delegates to the Continental Congress]]

CATEGORIES: Continental Congressmen, Lists of political office-holders in the United States, 18th century-related lists

The Continental Congress was a convention of delegates from the Thirteen Colonies that became the governing body of the United States during the American Revolution. The Biographical Directory of the United States Congress lists 343 men who attended the Continental Congress, including the future U.S. Presidents         George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe, along with another 90 who were elected as delegates but never served.Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 40–44. The Congress met from 1774 to 1789 in three incarnations.
The First Continental Congress, which met briefly in Philadelphia in 1774, consisted of 56 delegates from twelve of the Thirteen Colonies that would become the United States.Burnett, Continental Congress, 32. Convened in response to the Coercive Acts passed by the British Parliament in 1774, the delegates organized an economic boycott of Great Britain in protest and petitioned the king for a redress of grievances.
By the time the Second Continental Congress met in 1775, shooting in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) had begun. Moderates in the Congress still hoped that the colonies could be reconciled with Great Britain, but a movement towards independence steadily gained ground. Congress established the Continental Army (June 1775), coordinated the war effort, issued a Declaration of Independence in July 1776, and designed a new government in the Articles of Confederation, which were ratified in 1781.
The ratification of the Articles of Confederation gave the Congress a new name: the Congress of the Confederation, which met from 1781 to 1789. The Confederation Congress helped guide the United States through the final stages of the war, but in peacetime the Congress declined in importance. Under the Articles, the Confederation Congress had little power to compel the individual states to comply with its decisions. Increasingly, delegates elected to the Congress declined to serve, the leading men in each state preferred to serve in state government, and the Congress had difficulty establishing a quorum. When the Articles were replaced by the United States Constitution, the Confederation Congress was superseded by the United States Congress.

[[Wholesale price index]]

CATEGORIES: Price indices

The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) is the price of a representative basket of wholesale goods. Some countries (like India and The Philippines) use WPI changes as a central measure of inflation. However, United States now report a producer price index instead.
The Wholesale Price Index or WPI is "the price of a representative basket of wholesale goods". Some countries use the changes in this index to measure inflation in their economies, in particular India – The Indian WPI figure was released weekly on every Thursday . But since 2009 it has been made monthly. It also influences stock and fixed price markets. The Wholesale Price Index focuses on the price of goods traded between corporations, rather than goods bought by consumers, which is measured by the Consumer Price Index. The purpose of the WPI is to monitor price movements that reflect supply and demand in industry, manufacturing and construction. This helps in analyzing both macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions.

CATEGORIES: Corvette classes, Active corvettes of Sweden, Visby-class corvettes, 2000s ships

The Visby is the latest class of corvette to be adopted by the Swedish Navy after the Göteborg and the Stockholm class corvettes. The ship's design heavily emphasizes low visibility or stealth technology. The first ship in the class is named after Visby, the main city on the island of Gotland. The class has received widespread international attention because of its capabilities as a stealth ship.
The ships are designed by Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) and built by Kockums AB.[tpl]cite web|last=Mack|first=Ben|title=Sweden Builds World's First Stealth Ships|work=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|date=2009-02-12|url=http://blog.wired.com/cars/2009/02/sweden-build-wo.html|accessdate=2009-02-12[/tpl] The first ship of the class was launched in 2000 and since then the construction was fraught with repeated delays. Finally in December 2009, the first two ships of the class were delivered to the Swedish Navy by the FMV, albeit with greatly reduced operational capability.

CATEGORIES: Law schools in the United States, Lists of law schools

Law schools in this list are categorized by whether they are currently active, proposed, or closed; within each section they are listed in alphabetical order by state, then name. Most of these law schools grant the Juris Doctor degree, which is the typical first professional degree in law in the United States.
Law schools are nationally accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA),ABA Accreditation Process and graduates of these schools may generally sit for the bar exam in any state. There are 203 ABA accredited law schools, divided between 200 with full accreditation and 3 with provisional accreditation.List of ABA approved law schools
In addition, individual state legislatures or bar examiners, like the State Bar of California, may maintain a separate accreditation system which is open to non-ABA accredited schools.  The California State Bar also accredits law schools, which the California Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE) recognizes.  Also, the CBE allows registered "Unaccredited" schools to operate and students of those schools are eligible to take the California Bar Examination upon graduation.
No correspondence or online law schools are accredited by the ABAhttp://www.abanet.org/careercounsel/faq.html ABA-CLE Career Resource Center or by state bar examiners.http://www.calbar.ca.gov/state/calbar/calbar_generic.jsp?cid=10115&id=5128#CLC Law Schools However, twelve correspondence and online law schools, although not accredited, are registered by the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California. This means that the graduates of these distance learning law schools can sit for the California Bar Examination and, under varying circumstances, the bar exams in many other states.

[[Flow measurement]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid dynamics, Measurement, Medical ultrasonography

Flow measurement is  the quantification of bulk fluid movement.  Flow can be measured in a variety of ways.
Positive-displacement flow meters accumulate a fixed volume of fluid and then count the number of times the volume is filled to measure flow. Other flow measurement methods rely on forces produced by the flowing stream as it overcomes a known constriction, to indirectly calculate flow. Flow may be measured by measuring the velocity of fluid over a known area.

[[John Marek Independent Party]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct political parties in Wales, Political parties established in 2003, Political parties disestablished in 2003

The John Marek Independent Party (JMIP) was a political party in North Wales which eventually evolved into Forward Wales. It was formed in March 2003 by John Marek, who was deselected by Labour over his criticisms of its perceived rightward march. It stood for the May 2003 elections to the National Assembly for Wales on a left-wing platform that included public ownership of the railways and greater powers for the Assembly. The media portrayed the JMIP as a real threat to Labour in North-East Wales.
The party stood in the constituencies of Wrexham and Clwyd South. The party also had a list in the North Wales region. Their candidates were:
On May 1, 2003, Marek won Wrexham with 6,539 votes or 37.7% of the vote. Elsewhere they got 2,210 or 11.8% in Clwyd South and 11,008 or 6.3% on the North Wales list. It was the only minor party to retain its deposit in the regional lists and its constituency result compared favourably with other left-wing candidates.
During its existence the JMIP forged strong links with the Scottish Socialist Party, and Tommy Sheridan spoke at its Summer Gathering in August 2003. On November 8 2003, the JMIP held a conference and re-launched itself as Forward Wales.

With origins in ancient Egypt, it was originally based on the breadth of a human hand.  The adoption of the international inch in 1959 allowed for a standardized imperial form and a metric conversion. It may be abbreviated to "h" or "hh".  Although measurements between whole hands are usually expressed in what appears to be decimal format, the subdivision of the hand is not decimal but is in base 4, so subdivisions after the radix point are in quarters of a hand, which are inches. Thus, 62 inches is fifteen and a half hands, or 15.2 hh (normally said as "fifteen-two", or occasionally in full as "fifteen hands two inches")

[[Currawong]]

CATEGORIES: Strepera, Bird genera, Birds of Australia, Cracticidae, Australian Aboriginal words and phrases

Currawongs are three species of medium-sized passerine birds belonging to the genus Strepera in the family Cracticidae native to Australasia. These are the  Grey Currawong (Strepera versicolor), Pied Currawong (S. graculina), and Black Currawong (S. fuliginosa). The common name comes from the call of the familiar Pied Currawong of eastern Australia and is onomatopoeic. They were formerly known as Crow-shrikes or Bell-magpies. Despite their resemblance to crows and ravens, they are only distantly related to the corvidae, instead belonging to an Afro-Asian radiation of birds of superfamily Malaconotoidea.
The true currawongs are a little larger than the Australian Magpie, somewhat smaller than most ravens, but broadly similar in appearance. They are easily distinguished by their yellow eyes, in contrast to the red eyes of a magpie and white eyes of Australian crows and ravens. Currawongs are also characterised by the hooked tips of their long, sharply pointed beaks.Amazing Facts about Australian Birds, by Karin Cox and Steve Parish, Steve Parish Publishing, 2008.
They are not as terrestrial as the Magpie and have shorter legs. They are omnivorous, foraging in foliage, on tree trunks and limbs, and on the ground, taking insects and larvae (often dug out from under the bark of trees), fruit, and the nestlings of other birds. They are distinguishable from magpies and crows by their comical flight style in amongst foliage, appearing to almost fall about from branch to branch as if they were inept flyers.

The Eight Immortals of Huainan (淮南八仙; pinyin: Huáinán bāxiān), also known as the Eight Gentlemen (八公 bāgōng), were the eight scholars under the patronage of Liu An (劉安 Liú Ān), the prince of Huainan during the Western Han Dynasty. They are not deified in any religions and the xian ("immortal") is used metaphorically to describe their talent. Together, they wrote the philosophical collection Huainanzi (淮南子, Huáinánzǐ, literally "The Philosophers of Huainan").

[[Canadian federalism]]
CATEGORIES: Federalism in Canada, Canadian Confederation, Federalism by country

Canadian federalism is concerned with the nature and historical development of federal systems within Canada. Canada is a federation with two distinct jurisdictions of political authority: the country-wide federal government and the ten provincial governments. It has three territorial governments in the far north that exercise delegated powers under the authority of the Parliament of Canada. All three jurisdictions are linked together by the Canadian Crown, from which all derive their sovereignty and authority; each government includes the Queen-in-Parliament, the Queen-in-Council, and the Queen-on-the-Bench. The federal parliament and the provincial assemblies are generally independent of one another in their respective areas of legislative authority.[tpl]Cite book| last=Banting| first=Keith G.| coauthors=Simeon, Richard| title=And no one cheered: federalism, democracy, and the Constitution Act| publisher=Methuen| year=1983| location=Toronto| pages=14, 16| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=sUwOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn=0-458-95950-2[/tpl] Shared sectors include agriculture and immigration, but most are either entirely within federal jurisdiction, such as foreign affairs and telecommunications, or entirely within provincial jurisdiction, such as education and healthcare.
The federal nature of the Canadian constitution was in response to the colonial-era diversity among the Maritimes and the Province of Canada, in particular the strong distinction between the French-speaking inhabitants of Lower Canada (Quebec) and the English-speaking inhabitants in Upper Canada (Ontario) and the Maritimes. Federalism enabled the co-existence of the French and English communities. John A. Macdonald, who became the first Prime Minister of Canada, at first opposed a federalist system of government, favouring a unitary system. He later supported the federal system after seeing the carnage of the American Civil War; he sought to avoid violent conflicts by maintaining a fusion of powers rather than a separation of powers.[tpl]Cite web|title = John A.

[[Grey Currawong]]
CATEGORIES: Birds of South Australia, Birds of Tasmania, Birds of Western Australia, Strepera

The Grey Currawong (Strepera versicolor) is a large passerine bird native to southern Australia and Tasmania. One of three currawong species in the genus Strepera, it is closely related to the butcherbirds and Australian Magpie of the family Artamidae. It is a large crow-like bird, around [tpl]convert|48|cm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long on average, with yellow irises, and a heavy bill, and dark plumage with white undertail and wing patches. The male and female are similar in appearance. Six subspecies are recognised and are distinguished by overall plumage colour, which ranges from slate-grey for the nominate from New South Wales and eastern Victoria and subspecies plumbea from Western Australia, to sooty black for the Clinking Currawong of Tasmania and subspecies halmaturina from Kangaroo Island. All Grey Currawongs have a loud distinctive ringing or clinking call.
Within its range, the Grey Currawong is generally sedentary, although it is a winter visitor in the southeastern corner of Australia. Comparatively little studied, much of its behaviour and habits is poorly known. Omnivorous, it has a diet that includes a variety of berries, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Less arboreal than the Pied Currawong, the Grey Currawong spends more time foraging on the ground. It builds nests high in trees, which has limited the study of its breeding habits. Unlike its more common relative, it has adapted poorly to human impact and has declined in much of its range. The habitat includes all kinds of forested areas as well as scrubland in dryer parts of the country.

The male and female are similar in appearance. Three subspecies are recognised, one of which, Strepera fuliginosa colei of King Island, is vulnerable to extinction.
Within its range, the Black Currawong is generally sedentary, although populations at higher altitudes relocate to lower areas during the cooler months.  The habitat includes densely forested areas as well as alpine heathland. It is rare below altitudes of 200 m (700 ft). Omnivorous, it has a diet that includes a variety of berries, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Less arboreal than the Pied Currawong, the Black Currawong spends more time foraging on the ground.

[[Pied Currawong]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of Australia, Strepera, Animals described in 1790

The Pied Currawong (Strepera graculina) is a medium-sized black passerine bird native to eastern Australia and Lord Howe Island. One of three currawong species in the genus Strepera, it is closely related to the butcherbirds and Australian Magpie of the family Artamidae. Six subspecies are recognised. It is a robust crowlike bird averaging around [tpl]convert|48|cm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, black or sooty grey-black in plumage with white undertail and wing patches, yellow irises, and a heavy bill. The male and female are similar in appearance. Known for its melodious calls, the species' name currawong is believed to be of indigenous origin.
Within its range, the Pied Currawong is generally sedentary, although populations at higher altitudes relocate to lower areas during the cooler months. It is omnivorous, with a diet that includes a wide variety of berries and seeds, invertebrates, bird eggs and juvenile birds. It is a predator which has adapted well to urbanization and can be found in parks and gardens as well as rural woodland. The habitat includes all kinds of forested areas, although mature forests are preferred for breeding. Roosting, nesting and the bulk of foraging take place in trees, in contrast with the ground-foraging behaviour of its relative, the Australian Magpie.

[[Letterist International]]

CATEGORIES: Lettrism, Situationist International, Psychogeography, French art movements

The Letterist International (LI) was a Paris-based collective of radical artists and theorists between 1952 and 1957. It was created by Guy Debord as a schism from Isidore Isou's Letterist group. The group went on to join others in forming the Situationist International, taking some key techniques and ideas with it.Kaufmann, Vincent (2011) Guy Debord for the Institut français. English translation Guy Debord by Martin Richet
The spelling 'Lettrist' is also common in English, but 'Letterist' was the form the French group (Internationale Lettriste) themselves preferred, and used in their 1955 sticker: 'If you believe you have genius, or if you think you have only a brilliant intelligence, write the letterist internationale.' With regard to that second word, however, most scholars prefer 'International' to 'Internationale'. Such authors and translators as Donald Nicholson-Smith, Simon Ford, Sadie Plant and Andrew Hussey all agree on the 'Letterist International' spelling.
The group was a motley assortment of novelists, sound poets, painters, film-makers, revolutionaries, bohemians, alcoholics, petty criminals, lunatics, under-age girls and self-proclaimed failures.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] In the Summer of 1953, their average age was a mere twenty years old, rising to twenty nine and a half in 1957.Internationale situationniste, no. 2, p.17. In their blend of intellectualism, protest and hedonism—though differing in other ways, for instance in their total rejection of spirituality—they might be viewed as French counterparts of the American Beat Generation, particularly in the form it took during exactly the same period, i.e. before anyone from either group achieved any real fame, and were still having the adventures that would inform their later works and ideas.

Carlos Guastavino (April 5, 1912 - October 29, 2000) was one of the foremost Argentine composers of the 20th century, his production amounted to over 500 works, most of them songs for piano and voice, many still unpublished. His style was quite conservative, always tonal and lusciously romantic. His compositions were clearly influenced by Argentine folk music. His reputation was based almost entirely on his songs, and Guastavino has sometimes been called "the Schubert of the Pampas." Some of his songs, for example Pueblito, mi pueblo, La rosa y el sauce ("The Rose and the Willow") and Se equivocó la paloma ("The Dove Was Wrong"), became national favorites. Unlike most other composers, at any time or place, Guastavino earned enough from his royalties and performing rights that he really had little need for other income.MacDonald, Callum.

[[Sterling silver]]

Sterling silver is an alloy of silver containing 92.5% by mass of silver and 7.5% by mass of other metals, usually copper. The sterling silver standard has a minimum millesimal fineness of 925.
Fine silver, for example 99.9% pure silver, is generally too soft for producing functional objects; therefore, the silver is usually alloyed with copper to give it strength while preserving the ductility and beauty of the precious metal. Other metals can replace the copper, usually with the intention of improving various properties of the basic sterling alloy such as reducing casting porosity, eliminating firescale, and increasing resistance to tarnish.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] These replacement metals include germanium, zinc and platinum, as well as a variety of other additives, including silicon and boron.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] Alloys such as Argentium sterling silver have appeared in recent decades.

Johannes G. Fritsch (27 July 1941 – 29 April 2010) was a German composer.
At the age of seven, Fritsch found a violin in the attic of his uncle's house in Bensheim-Auerbach, Germany, and began lessons with a village music teacher named Knapp. When he was ten, his family moved to Cologne, and he began studying with the principal violist in the Gürzenich Orchestra (Schürmann 1976, 20).
He studied music, sociology, and philosophy from 1961 to 1965 at the University and the Staatliche Musikhochschule in Cologne with, amongst others, Bernd Alois Zimmermann and Gottfried Michael Koenig. In the following years he applied himself to the most varied musical activities. Amongst other things he played viola in the Stockhausen-Ensemble from 1964 to 1970, and took part in the German exhibition at Expo '70, the World’s Fair in Osaka in 1970 (Lichtenfeld 2001; Schürmann 1976, 21).
Although he had begun to compose at the age of 17, Fritsch regards as his first real composition the Duett für Bratsche (Duet for Viola), for viola and tape, which had a succès de scandale when he performed it at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in 1962—one newspaper review called him a kühner Kratzer (audacious scraper) (Schürmann 1976, 20).
In 1966 Fritsch received the Förderpreis (Monetary Award) of the Federal State of North Rhine–Westphalia, and in 1971 the Prize of the Paris Biennale. Since the 1970s there have been further awards, such as the Förderpreis of the City of Cologne, and the Robert-Schumann Prize of the City of Düsseldorf.
In 1970 Fritsch was one of the founders of the Feedback Studio of Cologne (together with Rolf Gehlhaar and David Johnson), and has been since 1975 active as the chief protagonist of the "Feedback Studio Verlag," the first German composers' publishing house: He is a producer of Compact Discs, editor of the  "Feedback Studio Papers" (one of the journals dedicated to electronic music), a publisher of scores of contemporary music, and a concert manager. In 1979, 1982, 1984, and 1986 he was with WDR manager of the World Music Congresses in Vlotho (Lichtenfeld 2001).
From 1984 he was Professor of Composition at the Staatliche Hochschule für Musik in Cologne, where his students have included Volker Staub, Caspar Johannes Walter, Juan Maria Solare, Josef Rebbe, Branimir Krstic and many other composers & improvisors.
He died at the age of 68 on 29 April 2010 after a long illness (Anon. 2010).

He studied jazz piano, extended vocal techniques and baroque flute a bec. From 1980 he's working as a composer and performer of contemporary music. His work is centered on a deep research on, over and beyond "sound". He collaborated extensively with such artists as Albert Mayr, Francesco Michi, Alvin Curran, Mauro Orselli, Michiko Hirayama and others. His repertoire consists of "difficult-to-find" compositions (Riley's Keyboard Studies, Takehisha Kosugi's works, Alvin Curran's lesser known compositions). He is a dedicatee of works by Tom Johnson, Pauline Oliveros and others, and an album of those works is planned for release. His recordings are available through SILENZIO distribuzione, notably the first co-titled LP records, "Musiche Sole" (with Roberto Barbanti and Letizia Bolognesi) released by Electronikaruna.

[tpl]Other uses|Clamp (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Clamp[/tpl]
A clamp is a fastening device to hold or secure objects tightly together to prevent movement or separation through the application of inward pressure. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term cramp is often used instead when the tool is for temporary use for positioning components during construction and woodworking; thus a G cramp or a sash cramp but a wheel clamp or a surgical clamp. 
There are many types of clamps available for many different purposes. Some are temporary, as used to position components while fixing them together, others are intended to be permanent. In the field of animal husbandry, using a clamp to attach an animal to a stationary object is known as "rounded clamping." A physical clamp of this type is also used to refer to an obscure investment banking term; notably "fund clamps." Anything that performs the action of clamping may be called a clamp, so this gives rise to a wide variety of terms across many fields.
Although technically not a clamp, gripping elements mounted on the buckets of heavy duty equipment are referred to as clamps too.Attachments with Top Clamps

Natzweiler-Struthof was a German concentration camp located in the Vosges Mountains close to the Alsatian village of Natzwiller (German Natzweiler) in France, and the town of Schirmeck, about 50 km (31 mi) south west from the city of Strasbourg.
Natzweiler-Struthof was the only concentration camp established by the Nazis on present-day French territory, though there were French-run temporary camps such as the one at Drancy. At the time, the Elsass-Lothringen area in which it was established was administered by Germany as an integral part of the German Reich.
The writer Boris Pahor was interned in Natzweiler-Struthof and wrote his novel Necropolis based on this experience.

[[Far-right politics]]
CATEGORIES: Far-right politics, Political terminology

Far-right politics are right-wing politics that are considered to be further to the right of those of the mainstream centre-right on the traditional left-right spectrum. They usually involve support for social inequality and social hierarchy, elements of social conservatism, and opposition to most forms of liberalism and socialism. Both terms are commonly used to describe fascist, neo-fascist or other ideologies and organizations that feature extreme nationalist, chauvinist, xenophobic, racist, or reactionary views.Carlisle, Rodney P., ed., The Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and the Right, Volume 2: The Right (Thousand Oaks, California, United States; London, England; New Delhi, India: Sage Publications, 2005) p. 693. Some movements generally considered of far-right, such as the Nazis, have pursued oppression and genocide against groups of people on the basis of their alleged inferiority.Hilliard, Robert L. and Michael C.

The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.[tpl]harvtxt|Bang-Jensen|Gutin|2000[/tpl]
It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.
The algorithm is usually named after two of its developers, Richard Bellman and Lester Ford, Jr., who published it in 1958 and 1956, respectively; however, Edward F. Moore also published the same algorithm in 1957, and for this reason it is also sometimes called the Bellman–Ford–Moore algorithm.
Negative edge weights are found in various applications of graphs, hence the usefulness of this algorithm.[tpl]sfnp|Sedgewick|2002[/tpl]
If a graph contains a "negative cycle" (i.e. a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value) that is reachable from the source, then there is no cheapest path: any path can be made cheaper by one more walk around the negative cycle. In such a case, the Bellman–Ford algorithm can detect negative cycles and report their existence. [tpl]sfnp|Kleinberg|Tardos|2006[/tpl]

Sir William Blackstone KC SL (10 July 1723 – 14 February 1780) was an English jurist, judge and Tory politician of the eighteenth century. He is most noted for writing the Commentaries on the Laws of England. Born into a middle-class family in London, Blackstone was educated at Charterhouse School before matriculating at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1738. After switching to and completing a Bachelor of Civil Law degree, he was made a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford on 2 November 1743, admitted to Middle Temple, and called to the Bar there in 1746. Following a slow start to his career as a barrister, Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration, becoming accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750. Blackstone is considered responsible for completing the Codrington Library and Warton Building, and simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and instead embarked on a series of lectures on English law, the first of their kind. These were massively successful, earning him a total of £[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|453|1755|r=-3[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] terms, and led to the publication of An Analysis of the Laws of England in 1756, which repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works.
On 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first Vinerian Professor of English Law, immediately embarking on another series of lectures and publishing a similarly successful second treatise, titled A Discourse on the Study of the Law. With his growing fame, Blackstone successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice, also securing election as Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Hindon on 30 March 1761. In February 1766 he published the first volume of Commentaries on the Laws of England, considered his magnum opus—the completed work earned Blackstone £[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|14000|1766|r=-3[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] terms. After repeated failures, he successfully gained appointment to the judiciary as a Justice of the Court of King's Bench on 16 February 1770, leaving to replace Edward Clive as a Justice of the Common Pleas on 25 June. He remained in this position until his death, on 14 February 1780.
Blackstone's legacy and main work of note is his Commentaries. Designed to provide a complete overview of English law, the four-volume treatise was repeatedly republished in 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783. Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by Henry John Stephen, first published in 1841, was reprinted until after the Second World War. Legal education in England had stalled; Blackstone's work gave the law "at least a veneer of scholarly respectability". William Searle Holdsworth, one of Blackstone's successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that "If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that United States, and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the common law." In the United States, the Commentaries influenced John Marshall, James Wilson, John Jay, John Adams, James Kent and Abraham Lincoln, and remain frequently cited in Supreme Court decisions.

The British threepence (3d) coin, usually simply known as a threepence or threepenny bit, was a unit of currency equaling one eightieth of a pound sterling, or three pence sterling. It was used in the United Kingdom, and earlier in Great Britain and England. Similar denominations were later used throughout the British Empire, notably in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
The sum of three pence was pronounced variously [tpl]respell|THROOP|ence[/tpl], [tpl]respell|THREPP|ence[/tpl] or [tpl]respell|THRUPP|ence[/tpl], reflecting different pronunciations in the various regions and nations of the United Kingdom. Likewise, the coin was often referred to in conversation as a [tpl]respell|THROOP|nee[/tpl], [tpl]respell|THREPP|nee[/tpl] or [tpl]respell|THRUPP|nee[/tpl] bit.
Before Decimal Day in 1971 there were two hundred and forty pence in one pound sterling. Twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence, e.g. forty-two pence would be three shillings and six pence (3/6), pronounced "three and six". Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence, e.g. eight pence would be 8d.

The Pianist is a memoir of the Polish composer of Jewish origin Władysław Szpilman, written and elaborated by the Polish author Jerzy Waldorff, who met Szpilman in 1938 in Krynica and became a friend of his. The book is written in the first person, as Szpilman's memoir. It tells how Szpilman survived the German deportations of Jews to extermination camps, the 1943 destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto, and the 1944 Warsaw Uprising during World War II.[tpl]cite web | url=http://filmpolski.pl/fp/index.php/122525 | title=Film fabularny Miasto nieujarzmione (the Unsubjugated City) | publisher=Internetowa Baza Filmu Polskiego filmpolski.pl | work=Film fabularny 1945 | date=1998–2012 | accessdate=July 31, 2012 | language=Polish[/tpl]

In the same year, novelists Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz wrote a screenplay based on it, for the movie called Robinson of Warsaw (Robinson warszawski). In the next three years a number of drastic revisions were requested by the Communist Party, prompting Miłosz to quit and withdraw his name from the credits. The movie was released during the Conference of Poland's Filmographers in Wisła on November 19–22, 1949 and met with a new wave of political criticism. Further revisions were requested and new music commissioned, and the movie was re-released in popular movie theatres in December 1950 under a different title: Unsubjugated City (Miasto nieujarzmione).
Because of Stalinist cultural policy and the ostensibly "grey areas" in which Szpilman (Waldorff) asserted that not all Germans were bad and not all of the oppressed were good, the actual book remained sidelined for more than 50 years. The subsequent prints of Szpilman's memoir omitted the name of Waldorff altogether and asserted that it was authored by the subject himself. Szpilman was not a writer, according to his own son Andrzej. The latest edition was slightly expanded by Andrzej Szpilman himself and printed under a different title, The Pianist.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ksiazka.net.pl/?id=archiwum09&uid=566 | title=Pianista i Waldorff ? | publisher=Portal Księgarski | work=Książki | date=September 18, 2001 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | author=Henryk Grynberg[/tpl]
In 1998, Szpilman’s son Andrzej Szpilman republished his father's memoir, first in German as Das wunderbare Überleben (The Miraculous Survival) and then in English as The Pianist. It was later published in more than 30 languages.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In 2002, Roman Polanski directed a screen version, also called The Pianist, but Szpilman died before the film was completed.

CATEGORIES: Screens of death, Computer errors, Operating system kernels

A kernel panic is an action taken by an operating system upon detecting an internal fatal error from which it cannot safely recover.  The term is largely specific to Unix and Unix-like systems; for Microsoft Windows operating systems the equivalent term is "stop error" (or, colloquially, "Blue Screen of Death").
The kernel routines that handle panics, known as panic() in AT&T-derived and BSD Unix source code, are generally designed to output an error message to the console, dump an image of kernel memory to disk for post-mortem debugging and then either wait for the system to be manually rebooted, or initiate an automatic reboot.http://www.unix.com/man-page/FreeBSD/9/panic/ The information provided is of a highly technical nature and aims to assist a system administrator or software developer in diagnosing the problem. Kernel panics can also be caused by errors originating outside of kernel space. For example, many Unix OSes panic if the init process, which runs in userspace, terminates.HP-UX init died panicIRIX init died panic

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC; [tpl]Audio|Chinese-Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.ogg|Listen|help=no[/tpl]), also known as the People's PCC or just "The PCC", is a political advisory body in the People's Republic of China.  The organization consists of delegates from a range of political parties and organizations, as well as independent members. The proportion of representation of the various parties is determined by established convention, negotiated between the parties.
In practice, the largest and dominant party in the Conference is the Communist Party of China which has about one third of the seats.

A less common translation is "the National Congress". This translation is discouraged, as it causes confusion with the National People's Congress as well as with the National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
The organizational hierarchy of the CPPCC includes the National Committee and regional committees. Regional committees of the CPPCC include the provincial, prefecture, and county level. According to Article 19, Section 2 of the Charter of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the relationship between the National Committee and the regional committees is a relationship of guidance (no direct leadership). So are the relationships between upper-level regional committees and lower-level committees. Operating budgets on each level are independently administered by the financial administrations for the region, making the National committee and all regional committees separate individual entities. An indirect leadership, however, exists via the United Front Departments on each level.

[[Intertemporal choice]]
CATEGORIES: Decision theory, Consumer behaviour, Intertemporal economics

Intertemporal choice is the study of the relative value people assign to two or more payoffs at different points in time. Most choices require decision-makers to trade-off costs and benefits at different points in time. These decisions may be about savings, work effort, education, nutrition, exercise, health care and so forth. For nearly 80 years, economists have analyzed intertemporal decisions using the discounted utility (DU) model, which assumes that people evaluate the pleasures and pains resulting from a decision in much the same way that financial markets evaluate losses and gains, exponentially ‘discounting’ the value of outcomes according to how delayed they are in time. DU has been used to describe how people actually make intertemporal choices and it has been used as a tool for public policy. Policy decisions about how much to spend on research and development, health and education all depend on the discount rate used to analyze the decision.[tpl]cite article |last1=S. Berns | first1 = Gregory | last2=Laibson | first2 = David| last3= Loewenstein | first3 =George |title = Intertemporal choice – Toward an Integrative Framework [/tpl]
The Keynesian consumption function was based on two major hypotheses. Firstly, marginal propensity to consume lies between 0 and 1. Secondly, average propensity to consume falls as income rises. Early empirical studies were consistent with these hypotheses. However, after World War II it was observed that savings did not rise as incomes rose. The Keynesian model therefore failed to explain the consumption phenomenon and thus emerged the theory of intertemporal choice. Intertemporal choice was introduced by John Rae in 1834 in the "Sociological Theory of Capital". Later, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk in 1889 and Irving Fisher in 1930 elaborated on the model. A few other models based on intertemporal choice include the Life Cycle Income Hypothesis proposed by Modigiliani and the Permanent Income Hypothesis proposed by Friedman. The concept of Walrasian Equilibrium may also be extended to incorporate intertemporal choice. The Walrasian analysis of such an equilibrium introduces two "new" concepts of prices: futures prices and spot prices.

[[Self-assessment]]
CATEGORIES: Evaluation methods, Conceptions of self

In social psychology, self-assessment is the process of looking at oneself in order to assess aspects that are important to one's identity. It is one of the motives that drive self-evaluation, along with self-verification and self-enhancement. Sedikides (1993) suggests that the self-assessment motive will prompt people to seek information to confirm their uncertain self-concept rather than their certain self-concept and at the same time people use self-assessment to enhance their certainty of their own self-knowledge.[tpl]Citation |last=Sedikides |first=C. (1993). |title=Assessment, enhancement, and verification determinants of the self-evaluation process. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65(2), 317–338.[/tpl][tpl]Citation |last=Sedikides |first=C., & Strube, M.J.

Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 29, 209-269.[/tpl] However, the self-assessment motive could be seen as quite different from the other two self-evaluation motives. Unlike the other two motives through self-assessment people are interested in the accuracy of their current self view, rather than improving their self-view. This makes self-assessment the only self-evaluative motive that may cause a person's self-esteem to be damaged.

CATEGORIES: Junglefowls, Bird genera

Junglefowl are the four living species of bird from the genus Gallus in the Gallinaceous bird order, which occur in India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia and Indonesia.
These are large birds, with colourful male plumage, but are nevertheless difficult to see in the dense vegetation they inhabit.
As with many birds in the pheasant family, the male takes no part in the incubation of the egg or rearing of the precocial young. These duties are performed by the drab and well-camouflaged female.
The junglefowl are seed-eaters, but insects are also taken, particularly by the young birds.
One of the species in this genus, the Red Junglefowl, is of historical importance as the likely ancestor of the domesticated chicken, although it has been suggested the Grey Junglefowl was also involved.Eriksson J, Larson G, Gunnarsson U, Bed'hom B, Tixier-Boichard M, et al.

[[Fundamental attribution error]]

CATEGORIES: Cognitive biases, Attitude attribution, Social psychology

In social psychology, the fundamental attribution error, also known as the correspondence bias or attribution effect, is people's tendency to place an undue emphasis on internal characteristics to explain someone else's behavior in a given situation, rather than considering external factors. It does not explain interpretations of one's own behavior, where situational factors are more easily recognized and can thus be taken into consideration. The flip side of this error is the actor–observer bias, in which people tend to overemphasize the role of a situation in their behaviors and underemphasize the role of their own personalities. 
As a simple example, consider a situation where Alice, a driver, is about to pass through an intersection. Her light turns green and she begins to accelerate, but another car drives through the red light and crosses in front of her. The fundamental attribution error may lead her to think that the driver of the other car was an unskilled or reckless driver. This will be an error if the other driver had a good reason for running the light, such as rushing a patient to the hospital. If this is the case and Alice had been driving the other car, she would have understood that the situation called for speed at the cost of safety, but when seeing it from the outside she was inclined to believe that the behavior of the other driver reflected their fundamental nature (having poor driving skills or a reckless attitude).
The phrase was coined by Lee Ross[tpl]cite book |last=Ross |first=L. |year=1977 |chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process |editor-first=L. |editor-last=Berkowitz |title=Advances in experimental social psychology |volume=10 |pages=173–220 |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-015210-X [/tpl] some years after a now classic experiment by Edward E.

Jones wrote that he found Ross' phrase "overly provocative and somewhat misleading", and also joked: "Furthermore, I'm angry that I didn't think of it first." Some psychologists, including Daniel Gilbert, have used the phrase "correspondence bias" for the fundamental attribution error.[tpl]cite book |last=Gilbert |first=D.

[[Princelings]]
CATEGORIES: Politics of China, Crown Prince Party

The Princelings, also translated as the Crown Prince Party, are the descendants of prominent and influential senior communist officials in the People's Republic of China. It is not a political party, but an informal, and often derogatory, categorization to signify those benefiting from nepotism and cronyism, by analogy with Crown Princes in hereditary monarchies. Many of its members now hold high-level political and business positions in the upper echelons of power. However, there is currently no discernible political cohesion within the group, and as such they should not be compared to other informal groupings such as the Shanghai clique or the Tsinghua clique, which resemble inner-party factions. 
The term was coined in the early 20th century, referring to the son of Yuan Shikai (a self-declared Emperor) and his cronies. It was later used to describe the relatives of the top four nationalist families; Chiang Kai-shek's kin, Soong May-ling's kin, Chen Lifu's kin, and Kong Xiangxi's kin. After the 1950s, the term was used to describe Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek, and his friends in Taiwan.  Today's Princelings include the children of the Eight Elders and other recent senior national and provincial leaders. Opportunities are available to princelings that are not available to common people. Using their powerful connections they have the opportunity to obtain profitable opportunities for themselves and for others. The more aggressive of the princelings have amassed fortunes of hundreds of millions of dollars.[tpl]cite news|title=Billions in Hidden Riches for Family of Chinese Leader|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html|accessdate=October 27, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 25, 2012|author=David Barboza[/tpl]

[[Narcoterrorism]]
CATEGORIES: Terrorism by form

Narcoterrorism is a term coined by former President Fernando Belaúnde Terry of Peru in 1983 when describing terrorist-type attacks against his nation's anti-narcotics police. In its original context, narcoterrorism is understood to mean the attempts of narcotics traffickers to influence the policies of a government or a society through violence and intimidation, and to hinder the enforcement of anti-drug laws by the systematic threat or use of such violence. Pablo Escobar's violence in his dealings with the Colombian  government is probably one of the best known and best documented examples of narcoterrorism.
The term has become a subject of controversy, largely due to its use in discussing violent opposition to the US Government's War on Drugs.
The term is being increasingly used for known terrorist organizations that engage in drug trafficking activity to fund their operations and gain recruits and expertise. Such organizations include FARC, ELN, AUC in Colombia, PCP-SL in Peru, Hamas and TalibanDEA Digging Into Al Qaeda Drug Links, By Robert Hendin, July 18, 2008.

September 28, 2010.Hezbollah, Hamas Raise Money for ‘Terrorist Activities’ From Drug Trade in South America, Congressional Research Service Says, By Edwin Mora, June 08, 2010. CNS News.
In 2000 the U.S. began funding, continued under the U.S. Bush administration, of Plan Colombia, intending to eradicate drug crops and to act against drug lords accused of engaging in narcoterrorism, including among them the leaders of the marxist FARC and the AUC paramilitary forces. The U.S. government is funding large-scale drug eradication campaigns and supporting Colombian military operations, seeking the extradition of commanders.  
Although Al Qaeda is often said to finance its activities through drug trafficking, the 9/11 Commission Report notes that "while the drug trade was a source of income for the Taliban, it did not serve the same purpose for al Qaeda, and there is no reliable evidence that bin Laden was involved in or made his money through drug trafficking."  The organization gains most of its finances through donations, particularly those by "wealthy Saudi individuals".
Critics of the prohibition of drugs say that it is this prohibition itself which funds terrorism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.narcoterror.org/kz_oped.htm |title=The Drug War and Terrorism |publisher=Narcoterror.org |date=2009-07-16 |accessdate=2013-07-07[/tpl]

He taught at secondary schools for many years and eventually returned to the University of Oslo to receive a doctorate.
In 1899, he had his first official role in the internationalist movement when he was appointed secretary of the committee organizing an Oslo conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an organization dedicated to fostering discussion between parliamentarians of different countries.  The next year, he was made secretary of the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament and, although he gave up the position in 1909, he would play a key role in the early days of the Norwegian Nobel Institute.  During this time he was the Norwegian technical delegate to the Second Hague Peace Conference.  
Lange rejoined the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 1909 when he was appointed secretary general of the organization, a position he would retain until 1933.  As secretary general he oversaw the Union's move to Brussels, sustained it in Oslo through the challenging times of World War I, then moved it again to Geneva after the war.  He remained active in numerous other organizations as well, acting as Norway's delegate or alternate delegate to the League of Nations from its founding until 1938, writing reports and acting as a correspondent for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and participating in the Dutch sponsored Central Organisation for Durable Peace, amongst other activities.  He was often called upon for his expertise in arbitration and arms control, in particular.    
His intellectual support of internationalism was demonstrated by the first of a three volume historical treatise (Histoire de l'internationalisme).  The work, published in 1919, was said to contribute to the ideological preparation for the League of Nations."Christian Lange – Biography". Nobelprize.org Retrieved October 11, 2010 For this and all his other activities, Lange shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Hjalmar Branting in 1921.
Lange died at the age of 69, one day after the 17th anniversary of his receipt of the Nobel Prize.  He was the father of Carl Viggo Manthey Lange,  Halvard Lange and Christian August Manthey Lange.
His daughter Thora was a history and language teacher, from 1938 at Oslo Cathedral School. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany she joined the resistance movement while her husband went in exile. She was imprisoned at Grini concentration camp in September 1943, but fell ill and died at Ullevål Hospital in December.[tpl]cite book|last=Ording|first=Arne|authorlink=Arne Ording|coauthors=Johnson, Gudrun and Garder, Johan|title=Våre falne 1939-1945|publisher=Grøndahl|location=Oslo|year=1950|volume=3|page=63|url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesside&bokid=vaarefalne3&sideid=64&storleik=|chapter=Lange, Thora Manthey|accessdate=29 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|editors=Faaland, Midtvik and Sandvik|author=Midtvik, Målfrid|title=Stabekk kommunale høgre skole.

[[Management system]]
CATEGORIES: Systems theory

A management system is the framework of processes and procedures used to ensure that an organization can fulfill all tasks required to achieve its objectives.Anderson, Chris. How to Build Effective Management Systems, Bizmanualz, January 26, 2005.
For instance, an environmental management system enables organizations to improve their environmental performance through a process of continuous improvement. An oversimplification is "Plan, Do, Check, Act". A more complete system would include accountability (an assignment of personal responsibility) and a schedule for activities to be completed, as well as auditing tools to implement corrective actions in addition to scheduled activities, creating an upward spiral of continuous improvement.
Also as in the aforementioned management system, an occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS) enables an organization to control its occupational health and safety risks and to improve its performance by means of continuous improvement.
Examples of management system standards include:

[[George Colman the Elder]]
CATEGORIES: 1732 births, 1794 deaths, English dramatists and playwrights

George Colman (April, 1732 - 14 August 1794) was an English dramatist and essayist, usually called "the Elder", and sometimes "George the First", to distinguish him from his son, George Colman the Younger.
He was born in Florence, where his father was stationed as British Resident Minister (diplomatic envoy) at the court of the Grand duke of Tuscany. Colman's father died within a year of his son's birth, and the boy's education was undertaken by William Pulteney, afterwards Lord Bath, whose wife was Mrs Colman's sister. After attending a private school in Marylebone, young George was sent to Westminster School, which he left in due course for Christ Church, Oxford. Here he made the acquaintance of Bonnell Thornton, the parodist, and together they founded The Connoisseur (1754–1756), a periodical which, although it reached its 140th number, "wanted weight," as Johnson said. He left Oxford after taking his degree in 1755, and, having been entered at Lincoln's Inn before his return to London, he was called to the bar in 1757. A friendship formed with David Garrick did not help his career as a barrister, but he continued to practise until the death of Lord Bath, out of respect for his wishes.
In 1760, he produced his first play, Polly Honeycomb, which met with great success. In 1761, The Jealous Wife, a comedy partly founded on Tom Jones, made Colman famous. The death of Lord Bath in 1764 placed him in possession of independent means. In 1765 appeared his metrical translation of the plays of Terence; and in 1766, he produced The Clandestine Marriage, jointly with Garrick, whose refusal to take the part of Lord Ogleby led to a quarrel between the two authors. In the next year he purchased a fourth share in the Covent Garden Theatre, a step which is said to have induced General Pulteney to revoke a will by which he had left Colman large estates. The general, who died in that year, did, however, leave him a considerable annuity. There was a riot at the third performance of his play The Oxonian in Town on 9 November 1767, apparently sparked by a claque of card-sharpers.The Dairy of Sylas Neville 1767–1788, ed. Basil Cozens-Hardy. (London, OUP, 1950), p. 27.
Colman was acting manager of Covent Garden for seven years, and during that period he produced several "adapted" plays of Shakespeare. In 1768 he was elected to the Literary Club, then nominally consisting of twelve members. In 1771 Thomas Arne's masque The Fairy Prince premiered at Covent Garden for which Colman wrote the libretto. In 1774 he sold his share in the great playhouse, which had involved him in much litigation with his partners, to Leake; and three years later he purchased of Samuel Foote, then broken in health and spirits, the little theatre in the Haymarket. He was attacked with paralysis in 1785; in 1789 his brain became affected, and he died on the 14 August 1794. Besides the works already cited, Colman was author of adaptations of Beaumont and Fletcher's Bonduca, Ben Jonson's Epicoene and Volpone, Milton's Comus, and of other plays. He also produced an edition of the works of Beaumont and Fletcher (1778), a version of the Ars Poëtica of Horace, an excellent translation from the Mercator of Plautus for Bonnell Thornton's edition (1769–1772), some thirty plays, many parodies and occasional pieces. An incomplete edition of his dramatic works was published in 1777 in four volumes.

James Hogg (1770 – 21 November 1835) was a Scottish poet and novelist who wrote in both Scots and English. As a young man he worked as a shepherd and farmhand, and was largely self-educated through reading. He was a friend of many of the great writers of his day, including Sir Walter Scott, of whom he later wrote an unauthorized biography. He became widely known as the "Ettrick Shepherd", a nickname under which some of his works were published, and the character name he was given in the widely read series Noctes Ambrosianae, published in Blackwood's Magazine. He is best known today for his novel The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner. His other works include the long poem The Queen's Wake (1813), his collection of songs Jacobite Reliques (1819), and his two novels The Three Perils of Man (1822), and The Three Perils of Woman (1823).

Isabella Augusta, Lady Gregory (15 March 1852 – 22 May 1932), born Isabella Augusta Persse, was an Irish dramatist, folklorist and theatre manager. With William Butler Yeats and Edward Martyn, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, and wrote numerous short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced a number of books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology. Born into a class that identified closely with British rule, her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced by her writings, was emblematic of many of the political struggles to occur in Ireland during her lifetime.
Lady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind the Irish Literary Revival. Her home at Coole Park, County Galway, served as an important meeting place for leading Revival figures, and her early work as a member of the board of the Abbey was at least as important for the theatre's development as her creative writings. Lady Gregory's motto was taken from Aristotle: "To think like a wise man, but to express oneself like the common people."Yeats 2002, p. 391.

The Counties of Denmark ([tpl]lang-da|Danmarks amter[/tpl]) were former subdivisions of metropolitan Denmark, used primarily for administrative regions, with each county having its own council with substantial powers. Originally there had been twenty-four counties, but the number was reduced to roughly fourteen in 1970 - the number fluctuated slightly over the next three decades. In 2006 there were thirteen traditional counties as well as three municipalities with county status (the island of Bornholm, which was a county until 2003, became a regional municipality with county powers).  On January 1, 2007, the counties were replaced by five larger regions.
Copenhagen County comprised all the municipalities of Metropolitan Copenhagen, except Copenhagen Municipality and Frederiksberg Municipality which, on account of their peculiarity of being outside any of the traditional counties, had the equivalent of "county status". On January 1, 2007, these two municipalities lost their special status.
Greenland and the Faroe Islands are also part of the Danish Realm, but both enjoy internal autonomy. Both are largely self-governing, and each community sends two members to the Danish Parliament. The Faroe Islands obtained self-government in 1948; from 1816 to 1948 the islands had the status of a Danish county.

[[Parma wallaby]]

CATEGORIES: Macropods, Mammals of New South Wales, Marsupials of Australia

The Parma wallaby (Macropus parma) was first described by British naturalist John Gould in about 1840. A shy, cryptic creature of the wet sclerophyll forests of southern New South Wales, it was never common and, even before the end of the 19th century, it was believed to be extinct. thumb|left|150px|Macropus parma, Berlin zoo.
In 1965 workers on Kawau Island (near Auckland) attempting to control a plague of introduced tammar wallabies (a widespread and fairly common species in Australia) were astonished to discover that some of the pests were not tammar wallabies at all, but a miraculously surviving population of Parma wallabies—a species long thought extinct. The extermination effort was put on hold while individuals were captured and sent to institutions in Australia and around the world in the hope that they would breed in captivity and could eventually be reintroduced to their native habitat.
The renewed interest in the Parma wallaby soon produced another surprise: in 1967 it was found that they still existed in the forests near Gosford, New South Wales. Further investigation demonstrated that the Parma wallaby was alive and well, and although not common, was to be found in forests along the Great Dividing Range from near Gosford almost as far north as the Queensland border.
The offspring of the Kawau Island population are smaller than their fully wild relatives, even when provided with ample food: it appears that competition for limited food resources on the island selected for smaller individuals, an incipient example of the phenomenon of insular dwarfism.
The Parma wallaby is the smallest member of the genus Macropus, at between 3.2 and 5.8 kg (7 and 12 LB), less than one tenth the size of the largest surviving member, the red kangaroo. It is about a half metre in length, with a sparsely furred, blackish tail about the same length again. The fur is a reddish or greyish brown above, greyer about the head, and fading to pale grey underneath.  Presumably, individuals had been sighted many times during the years when it was "extinct", but mistaken for an especially slender and long-tailed example of the otherwise similar red-legged or red-necked pademelon.
Like the pademelons, it prefers to occupy wet sclerophyll forest with thick undergrowth, and grassy patches, although Parma wallabies are also found occasionally in dry eucalypt forest and even rainforest. It is mainly nocturnal and usually shelters in thick scrub during the day, through which it can travel at speed along the runways it makes. It emerges from cover shortly before dusk to feed on grasses and herbs in forest clearings. The Parma wallaby is largely solitary, with two or at most three animals sometimes coming together to feed in favourable circumstances. 
Although the Parma wallaby remains rare, there seems to be no immediate threat to it provided that more habitat destruction does not take place, and the population is thought to be slowly increasing

Jean-Georges Noverre (29 April 1727 – 19 October 1810) was a French dancer and balletmaster, and is generally considered the creator of ballet d'action, a precursor of the narrative ballets of the 19th century. His birthday is now observed as International Dance Day.
His first professional appearances occurred as a youth in Paris at the Opéra-Comique, at Fontainebleau, in Berlin before Frederick II and his brother Prince Henry of Prussia, in Dresden and Strasburg. In 1747 he moved to Strasbourg where he remained until 1750 before moving to Lyon. In 1751, he composed his first great work, Les Fêtes Chinoises for Marseilles. The work was revived in Paris in 1754 to great acclaim. In 1755, he was invited by Garrick to London, where he remained for two years.
Between 1758 and 1760 he produced several ballets at Lyon, and published his [tpl]Ill|fr|Lettres sur la danse et les ballets|Lettres sur la danse[/tpl]. It is from this period that the revolution in the art of the ballet for which Noverre was responsible can be dated. Prior to Noverre Ballet's were large spectacles that focused mainly on elaborate costumes and scenery and not on the physical and emotional expression of the dancers. He was next engaged by Duke Karl Eugen of Württemberg, and later Austrian Empress Maria Theresa, until 1774. In 1775, he was appointed maître des ballets of the Paris Opera at the request of Queen Marie Antoinette. He returned to Vienna in Spring of 1776 to stage ballets there but in June 1776 he returned again to Paris. He regained this post until the French Revolution reduced him to poverty. He died on 19 October 1810 at Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
Noverre's friends included Voltaire, Mozart, Frederick the Great and David Garrick (who called him "the Shakespeare of the dance"). The ballets of which he was most proud were his La Toilette de Venus, Les Jalousies du sérail, La dour corsaire and Le Jaloux sans rival. Besides the letters, Noverre wrote Observations sur la construction d'une nouvelle salle de l'Opéra (1781); Lettres sur Garrick écrites a Voltaire (1801); and Lettre à un artiste sur les flies publiques (1801).

[[Intertemporal equilibrium]]

CATEGORIES: Intertemporal economics

Intertemporal equilibrium is a notion of economic equilibrium conceived over many periods of time.
In modern economic theory, most models explicitly take into account the fact that the economy evolves over time, and that its equilibrium cannot be fruitfully analyzed from a purely static perspective. Therefore the general equilibrium of the economy is conceived as an intertemporal equilibrium, meaning that households and firms are assumed to make intertemporal decisions. That is, households are assumed to choose consumption and labor on the basis of wages, prices, utility, and wealth over their whole lifetimes, instead of considering these quantities at just one point in time. Likewise, firms are assumed to choose hiring, investment, and output on the basis of productivity and demand over the foreseeable future, instead of considering these quantities at just one point in time.
The intertemporal general equilibrium is then analyzed as the Nash equilibrium or competitive equilibrium of the intertemporal strategies of all the households and firms (and any other economic agents under consideration, such as governments).

Lorenzo Monaco (born  Piero di Giovanni; [tpl]circa[/tpl] 1370 – c. 1425) was an Italian painter of the late Gothic-early Renaissance age. He was born Piero di Giovanni in Siena. Little is known about his youth, apart from the fact that he was apprenticed in Florence. He was influenced by Giotto and his followers Spinello Aretino and Agnolo Gaddi.
In 1390 he joined the Camaldolese monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli. He was thenceforth generally known as Lorenzo Monaco (English: "Lawrence the Monk").  In the 1390s he executed three panels of the Biblioteca Laurenziana for his convent.
Starting from around 1404 his works show the influence of the International Gothic, of Lorenzo Ghiberti's earliest works and of Gherardo Starnina. From this period is the Pietà in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Florence. His works, often over a gilted background, showed in general a spiritual value, and usually did not feature profane elements.
In 1414 he painted the Coronation of the Virgin (now at the Uffizi), characterized by a great number of saints and brilliant colors. In the late part of his life, Lorenzo did not accept the early Renaissance innovations introduced by artists such as Masaccio and Brunelleschi. This is visible in the Adoration of the Magi of 1420–1422, where the now widespread geometrical perspective is totally absent. Lorenzo's works remained popular in the 1420s, as testified by the numerous commissions he received, such as the Stories of the Virgin in the Bartolini Salimbeni Chapel of Santa Trinita, one of his few frescoes.
Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Lorenzo Monaco in his Lives. According to the Florentine historian, he died from a not well identified infection, perhaps a gangrene or a tumour.

The administrative regions of Greece ([tpl]lang-el|περιφέρειες[/tpl], peripheries) are the country's first-level administrative entities, each comprising several second-level units, originally prefectures and since 2011 regional units.
The current regions were established in 1987, replacing the traditional division into broad historical–geographical regions (γεωγραφικά διαμερίσματα), which are still often used in popular discourse and in statistics. Although the post-1987 regions were mostly based on the earlier divisions, they are usually smaller and, in a few cases, do not overlap with the traditional definitions: for instance, the region of West Greece, which had no previous analogue, comprises territory belonging to the Peloponnese peninsula and the traditional region of Central Greece.
The first seven peripheries were established by the then-ruling military regime in 1971, but they were abolished after the fall of Georgios Papadopoulos in November 1973. The current regions were created by Law 1622/1986 and Presidential Decree 51/1987, and were conceived as an auxiliary regional level of the central government. With ongoing decentralization, they were accorded more powers in the 1997 Kapodistrias reform of local and regional government, and were finally transformed into fully separate entities by the 2010 Kallikratis plan (Law 3852/2010), which entered into effect on 1 January 2011. The government-appointed general secretary was replaced with a popularly elected regional governor and a regional council with 5-year terms, while many powers of the abolished prefectures were transferred to the regions. 
Bordering the region of Central Macedonia there is one autonomous region, Mount Athos (Agion Oros, or "Holy Mountain"), a monastic community under Greek sovereignty. It is located on the easternmost of the three large peninsulas jutting into the Aegean from the Chalcidice Peninsula.

[[Prefectures of Greece]]

CATEGORIES: Prefectures of Greece, Former subdivisions of Greece, Lists of country subdivisions, Greece geography-related lists

During the first administrative division of independent Greece in 1833–1836 and again from 1845 until their abolition  with the Kallikratis reform in 2010, the prefectures ([tpl]lang-el|νομοί, sing. νομός[/tpl]) were the country's main administrative unit. They are now defunct, and have been approximately replaced by regional units.
They are called departments in ISO 3166-2:GR and by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical NamesUnited Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names: Administrative Division of Greece (Working Paper N° 95), New York 2000, (PDF, 1,3 MB)]
The prefectures were the second-degree organization of local government, grouped into 13 regions or (before 1987) 10 geographical departments, and in turn divided into provinces and comprising a number of communities and municipalities. The prefectures became self-governing entities in 1994, when the first prefectural-level elections took place. The prefects were previously appointed by the government. By 2010, their number had risen to 51, of which one, the Attica Prefecture, where more than a third of the country's population resided, was further subdivided into four prefecture-level administrations (νομαρχίες, sing. νομαρχία). In addition, there were three super-prefectures (υπερνομαρχίες, sing. υπερνομαρχία) controlling two or more prefectures. 
With the Kallikratis reform, which entered into force on 1 January 2011, the prefectures were abolished. Many, especially in the mainland, were retained in the form of regional units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) within the empowered regions, which largely took over the prefectures' administrative role.

[[Buttonquail]]

Buttonquail or hemipodes are members of a small family of birds, Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to, the quails of Phasianidae. They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia. There are 16 species in two genera, with most species being found in the genus Turnix and only one being found in the genus Ortyxelos.
Buttonquails are small, drab, running birds, which avoid flying. The female is the more brightly coloured of the sexes, and initiates courtship. Unusually, the buttonquails are polyandrous, with the females circulating among several males and expelling rival females from her territory. Both sexes cooperate in building a nest in the earth, but only the male incubates the eggs and tends the young. The eggs hatch after an incubation period of 12 or 13 days, and the young are able to fly within two weeks of hatching.[tpl]cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Archibald, George W.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 101|isbn= 1-85391-186-0[/tpl]

[[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)]]

CATEGORIES: Aerospace engineering, Aerodynamics, Avionics

Flight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle's  center of mass, known as pitch, roll and yaw (quite different from their use as Tait-Bryan angles).
Aerospace engineers develop control systems for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its center of mass. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or moments about the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw.  For example, a pitching moment is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.
Roll, pitch and yaw refer to rotations about the respective axes starting from a defined equilibrium state.  The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level heeling angle on a ship. Yaw is known as "heading".  The equilibrium pitch angle in submarine and airship parlance is known as "trim", but in aircraft, this usually refers to angle of attack, rather than orientation.  However, common usage ignores this distinction between equilibrium and dynamic cases.
The most common aeronautical convention defines the roll as acting about the longitudinal axis, positive with the starboard (right) wing down.  The yaw is about the vertical body axis, positive with the nose to starboard. Pitch is about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of symmetry, positive nose up.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
A fixed-wing aircraft increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the angle of attack (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually "banks" to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is usually streamlined from nose to tail to reduce drag making it typically advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though there are instances when an aircraft may be deliberately "sideslipped" for example a slip in a fixed-wing aircraft.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

The generic name is derived from the Latin word taxus, meaning "yew", and the Greek word εἶδος (eidos), meaning "similar to."[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KeGzp-YXrPYC& |title=The New York Botanical Garden Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horticulture |volume=10 |first=Thomas H. |last=Everett |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-8240-7240-7 |page=3299[/tpl] Within the family, Taxodium is most closely related to Chinese Swamp Cypress (Glyptostrobus pensilis) and Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica).
Species of Taxodium occur in the southern part of the North American continent and are deciduous in the north and semi-evergreen to evergreen in the south. They are large trees, reaching [tpl]convert|100|-|150|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] tall and [tpl]convert|2|-|3|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] (exceptionally [tpl]convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) trunk diameter.

[[Predella]]
CATEGORIES: Painting

A predella is the platform or step on which an altar stands (*predel or *pretel langobardic = a low wooden platform that serves as a basis in a piece of furniture). In painting, the predella is the painting or sculpture along the frame at the bottom of an altarpiece. In later medieval and Renaissance altarpieces, where the main panel consisted of a scene with large static figures, it was normal to include a predella below with a number of small-scale narrative paintings depicting events from the life of the dedicatee, whether Christ, the Virgin Mary or a saint.  Typically there would be three to five small scenes, in a horizontal format.  
They are significant in art history, as the artist had more freedom from iconographic conventions than in the main panel; they could only be seen from close up.  As the main panels themselves became more dramatic, during Mannerism, predellas were no longer painted, and they are rare by the middle of the 16th century.  Predella scenes are now often separated from the rest of the altarpiece in museums. 
Examples of predellas include:

[[Marginalism]]

CATEGORIES: History of economic thought, Economic theories, Value theory, Marginal concepts

Marginalism is a theory of economics that attempts to explain the discrepancy in the value of goods and services by reference to their secondary, or marginal, utility. The reason why the price of diamonds is higher than that of water, for example, owes to the greater additional satisfaction of the diamonds over the water. Thus, while the water has greater total utility, the diamond has greater marginal utility.Rhoads, Steven E.; “Marginalism”, Concise Encyclopedia of Economics. Liberty Fund, Inc. Ed. David R. Henderson. Library of Economics and Liberty, 17 July 2007. The theory has been used in order to explain the difference in wages among essential and non-essential services, such as why the wages of an air-conditioner repairman exceed those of a childcare worker.[tpl]cite web|last=Henderson|first=David|title=Why Repairmen Earn More Than Child-Care Workers|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Marginalism.html|work=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=2 July 2012[/tpl]
The theory arose in the mid-to-late nineteenth century in response to the normative practice of classical economics and growing socialist debates about social and economic activity. Marginalism was an attempt to raise the discipline of economics to the level of objectivity and universalism so that it would not be beholden to normative critiques.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. 1987. Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task. New York: Verso, pp. 120–122. The theory has since come under attack for its inability to account for new empirical data.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. 1987. Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task. New York: Verso, pp. 123–125.
Although the central concept of marginalism is that of marginal utility, marginalists, following the lead of Alfred Marshall, drew upon the idea of marginal physical productivity in explanation of cost. The neoclassical tradition that emerged from British marginalism abandoned the concept of utility and gave marginal rates of substitution a more fundamental role in analysis.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] Marginalism is an integral part of mainstream economic theory.

Rodney George "Rod" Laver [tpl]Post-nominals|post-noms=MBE[/tpl] (born 9 August 1938 in Rockhampton, Queensland) is an Australian former professional tennis player who holds the record for most singles titles won in the history of tennis, with 200 career titles. He was ranked World No. 1 for seven consecutive years, from 1964 to 1970 (from 1964 to 1967 in the professional circuit) and also in 1961 and 1962 (by Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph). He is the only tennis player to have won the Grand Slam (all four major singles titles in the same year) twice, in 1962 and 1969, and is the only male player to have done this during the open era. He also won the Pro Grand Slam in 1967. Laver won a total of 19 Major singles titles, including 11 Grand Slams and 8 Pro Slams. Rod Laver is the third player, behind Roy Emerson and Margaret Court, to win each major singles title twice in his career. He also won a total of 9 Major doubles titles including 6 Grand Slam men's doubles and 3 Grand Slam mixed doubles.
He holds the all-time male records of 22 singles titles in a season (1962) and 7 consecutive years (1964–70) winning at least 10 singles titles per season. In addition to this he won 9 Championship Series titles (1970–75). He was the first player to win 5 Championship series titles in one season (1970) and to reach 6 finals in a season (1970). The Championship series were precursors to the current Masters 1000.
Laver won and excelled on all the surfaces of his time (grass, clay and wood/parquet), and was ranked as the best professional player in the world during the five-year period he was excluded from the Grand Slam tournaments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14489546 |title=Bud Collins on MSNBC (2006) |publisher=MSNBC |date=28 August 2006 |accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl]Alistair Campbell and others on Times Online (2004)[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Bruce Jenkins |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/13/SPGGPL4KST1.DTL |title=Bruce Jenkins in San Francisco Chronicle (2006) |work=San Francisco Chronicle  |date=13 September 2006 |accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Miller |first=David |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/01/15/stfede15.xml |title=David Miller in Daily Telegraph (2007) |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=15 January 2007 |accessdate=6 July 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=IMG Media |url=http://www.tennisweek.com/news/fullstory.sps?inewsid=528242#top |title=The Tennis Week Interview: Tony Trabert |publisher=Tennisweek.com |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Tennis/ATP/2004/08/01/565759.html |title=John Barrett and Peter Burwash (2004) |publisher=Slam.canoe.ca |date=1 August 2004 |accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tennisserver.com/lines/lines_00_12_23.html |title=Ray Bowers on Tennis Server (2000) |publisher=Tennisserver.com |date=23 December 2000 |accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=IMG Media |url=http://www.tennisweek.com/news/fullstory.sps?inewsid=503656 |title=Raymond Lee: The greatest tennis player of all time.

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is the larger of the two main unionist political parties in Northern Ireland. Founded by Ian Paisley and now led by Peter Robinson, it is the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the fourth-largest party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.
The DUP has strong links to Protestant churches, particularly the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, the church Paisley founded.
Following on from the St Andrews Agreement in October 2006, the DUP agreed with the Irish republican party Sinn Féin to enter into power-sharing devolved government in Northern Ireland. In the aftermath of the agreement there were reports of divisions within the DUP. Many of its leading members, including Members of Parliament (MPs) Nigel Dodds, David Simpson and Gregory Campbell, were claimed to be in opposition to Paisley. All the party's MPs fully signed up to the manifesto for the 2007 Assembly elections, supporting power-sharing in principle.

[[Bearing (navigation)]]

CATEGORIES: Navigation

"Bearing" is a term used (for example) in navigation, although it can also be used to refer to simply our direction of motion. Bearings can be measured in mils or degrees. In navigational terms, "bearing" is perhaps more usually the angle between our forward direction, and the direction from us to another object. It typically refers to the direction of, some object, as seen by us, compared to our current heading. In other words, it's simply the angle between our forward direction, and a line towards the object in question. The term can also be used to mean the "absolute" compass direction of an object, as seen by us.
In aerial terms, "bearing" means the actual compass direction of the forward course of our aircraft. In land navigation, bearing means the angle between a line connecting us and another object, and a north-south line.

[[Bearing (mechanical)]]

CATEGORIES: Bearings, Tribology

A bearing is a machine element that constrains relative motion and reduces friction between moving parts to only the desired motion. The design of the bearing may, for example, provide for free linear movement of the moving part or for free rotation around a fixed axis; or, it may prevent a motion by controlling the vectors of normal forces that bear on the moving parts. Many bearings also facilitate the desired motion as much as possible, such as by minimizing friction. Bearings are classified broadly according to the type of operation, the motions allowed, or to the directions of the loads (forces) applied to the parts.
The term "bearing" is derived from the verb "to bear";[tpl]Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=headwords "bearing" and "bear" |work=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, online subscription version |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate.htm |postscript=.

The simplest bearings are bearing surfaces, cut or formed into a part, with varying degrees of control over the form, size, roughness and location of the surface. Other bearings are separate devices installed into a machine or machine part. The most sophisticated bearings for the most demanding applications are very precise devices; their manufacture requires some of the highest standards of current technology.

Prometheus is an inner satellite of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980 (some time before October 25) from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe, and was provisionally designated [tpl]nowrap|S/1980 S 27[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|IAUC 3532[/tpl]
In late 1985 it was officially named after Prometheus, a Titan in Greek mythology.[tpl]sfn|IAUC 4157[/tpl] It is also designated [tpl]nowrap|Saturn XVI[/tpl] (16).[tpl]sfn|USGS: Planet and Satellite Names and Discoverers[/tpl] Pronunciation for Prometheus is [tpl]IPAc-en|p|r|ɵ|ˈ|m|iː|θ|i|ə|s[/tpl], [tpl]USdict|prō·mē′·thē·əs[/tpl]; Greek: Προμηθεύς.
This small moon is extremely elongated, measuring about 136 by 79 by 59 km. It has several ridges and valleys and a number of impact craters of about 20 km diameter are visible, but it is less cratered than nearby Pandora, Epimetheus and Janus. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Prometheus is a very porous icy body. There is a lot of uncertainty in these values, however, and so this remains to be confirmed.

CATEGORIES: Parallel computing, Inter-process communication, Virtualization software

Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) is a software tool for parallel networking of computers. It is designed to allow a network of heterogeneous Unix and/or Windows machines to be used as a single distributed parallel processor. Thus large computational problems can be solved more cost effectively by using the aggregate power and memory of many computers. The software is very portable; the source code, available free through netlib, has been compiled on everything from laptops to Crays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/|title=Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) Homepage[/tpl]
PVM enables users to exploit their existing computer hardware to solve much larger problems at less additional cost. PVM has been used as an educational tool to teach parallel programming but has also been used to solve important practical problems. It was developed by the University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Emory University. The first version was written at ORNL in 1989, and after being rewritten by University of Tennessee, version 2 was released in March 1991. Version 3 was released in March 1993, and supported fault tolerance and better portability.
PVM was a step towards modern trends in distributed processing and grid computing but has, since the mid-1990s, largely been supplanted by the much more successful MPI standard for message passing on parallel machines.   PVM is free software, released under both the BSD License and the GNU General Public License.

Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (also spelled Wyndam-Price and Wyndham-Price) is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.  Played by Alexis Denisof, Wesley first appeared in nine episodes of Buffys third season in 1999 before moving over to spin-off series Angel where he became, and remained, a main character for five seasons.  Following Angels final season, the character's story is continued in the 2007 canonical comic book series Angel: After the Fall.
Wesley is introduced as a member of the Watchers' Council—an organization which trains Slayers to fight monsters such as vampires and demons.  Created as an irritating foil for the character of Rupert Giles, he was intended to be killed off shortly after his first appearance, but the character was popular with his creators and was instead written into Angel where he joined a supernatural detective agency.  Over the course of Angel, Wesley went through dramatic character developments, becoming darker and less comedic.

[[Differential form]]
CATEGORIES: Differential forms

In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates. Differential forms provide a unified approach to defining integrands over curves, surfaces, volumes, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.
For instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is called a 1-form, and can be integrated over an interval a,b in the domain of f:
and similarly  the expression: f(x,y,z) dx∧dy + g(x,y,z) dx∧dz + h(x,y,z) dy∧dz is a 2-form 
that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:
Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx∧dy∧dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over a region of space.
The algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when acting on a k-form produces a (k+1)-form.  This operation extends the differential of a function, and the divergence and the curl of a vector field in an appropriate sense that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the general Stokes' theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as De Rham's theorem.
The general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.

Live/Dead is the first official live album released by the San Francisco-based band Grateful Dead. It was recorded over a series of live concerts in early 1969 and released later in the year on November 10. At the time of its release, Robert Christgau wrote that side two of the double album "contains the finest rock improvisation ever recorded." A landmark live album that captured the Grateful Dead's improvisations at their best—Allmusic would write that "Few recordings have ever represented the essence of an artist in performance as faithfully as Live/Dead".
It was the final album with keyboardist Tom Constanten.
The album was remastered and released with hidden bonus tracks as part of the 2001 box set The Golden Road (1965–1973), and subsequently as a stand-alone album in 2003.
The first 1:34 of "Dark Star" can be found on the previous track, "Mountains of the Moon", in the 2005 box set Fillmore West 1969: The Complete Recordings.

In linear algebra, a multilinear map is a function of several variables that is linear separately in each variable.  More precisely, a multilinear map is a function
A multilinear map of two variables is a bilinear map.  More generally, a multilinear map of k variables is called a ''k''-linear map.  If the codomain of a multilinear map is the field of scalars, it is called a multilinear form.  Multilinear maps and multilinear forms are fundamental objects of study in multilinear algebra.
If all variables belong to the same space, one can consider symmetric,
antisymmetric and alternating k-linear maps. The latter coincide if the underlying ring (or field) has a characteristic different from two,

When choosing three vectors that must be at right angles to each other, there are two distinct solutions.  This can be seen by holding your hands together, palm up, with the fingers curled. If the curl of your fingers represents a rotation from the first axis to the second, then the third axis can point either along your right thumb or your left thumb.
There are variations on the mnemonic depending on context, but all variations are related to the one idea of choosing a convention.

[[Exterior algebra]]

CATEGORIES: Algebras, Multilinear algebra, Differential forms

  

In mathematics, the exterior product or wedge product of vectors is an algebraic construction used in Euclidean geometry to study areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogs. The exterior product of two vectors u and v, denoted by u ∧ v, is called a bivector and lives in a space called the exterior square, a geometrical vector space that differs from the original space of vectors.  The magnitudeStrictly speaking, the magnitude depends on some additional structure, namely that the vectors be in a Euclidean space.  We do not generally assume that this structure is available, except where it is helpful to develop intuition on the subject. of u ∧ v can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides u and v, which in three dimensions can also be computed using the cross product of the two vectors. Also like the cross product, the exterior product is anticommutative, meaning that [tpl]nowrap|1=u ∧ v = −(v ∧ u)[/tpl] for all vectors u and v.  One way to visualize a bivector is as a family of parallelograms all lying in the same plane, having the same area, and with the same orientation of their boundaries—a choice of clockwise or counterclockwise.
When regarded in this manner the exterior product of two vectors is called a 2-blade.  More generally, the exterior product of any number k of vectors can be defined and is sometimes called a k-blade.  It lives in a geometrical space known as the k-th exterior power.  The magnitude of the resulting k-blade is the volume of the k-dimensional parallelotope whose sides are the given vectors, just as the magnitude of the scalar triple product of vectors in three dimensions gives the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by those vectors.
The exterior algebra, or Grassmann algebra after Hermann Grassmann,[tpl]harvcoltxt|Grassmann|1844[/tpl] introduced these as extended algebras (cf. [tpl]harvnb|Clifford|1878[/tpl]). He used the word äußere (literally translated as outer, or exterior) only to indicate the produkt he defined, which is nowadays conventionally called exterior product, probably to distinguish it from the outer product as defined in modern linear algebra. is the algebraic system whose product is the exterior product.  The exterior algebra provides an algebraic setting in which to answer geometric questions.  For instance, whereas blades have a concrete geometrical interpretation, objects in the exterior algebra can be manipulated according to a set of unambiguous rules. The exterior algebra contains objects that are not just k-blades, but sums of k-blades; such a sum is called a k-vector.The term k-vector is not equivalent to and should not be confused with similar terms such as 4-vector, which in a different context could mean a 4-dimensional vector. A minority of authors use the term k-multivector instead of k-vector, which avoids this confusion.  The k-blades, because they are simple products of vectors, are called the simple elements of the algebra.  The rank of any k-vector is defined to be the smallest number of simple elements of which it is a sum.  The exterior product extends to the full exterior algebra, so that it makes sense to multiply any two elements of the algebra.  Equipped with this product, the exterior algebra is an associative algebra, which means that [tpl]nowrap|1=α ∧ (β ∧ γ) = (α ∧ β) ∧ γ[/tpl] for any elements α, β, γ.  The k-vectors have degree k, meaning that they are sums of products of k vectors.  When elements of different degrees are multiplied, the degrees add like multiplication of polynomials.  This means that the exterior algebra is a graded algebra.
In a precise sense, given by what is known as a universal construction, the exterior algebra is the largest algebra that supports an alternating product on vectors, and can be easily defined in terms of other known objects such as tensors.  The definition of the exterior algebra makes sense for spaces not just of geometric vectors, but of other vector-like objects such as vector fields or functions.  In full generality, the exterior algebra can be defined for modules over a commutative ring, and for other structures of interest in abstract algebra.  It is one of these more general constructions where the exterior algebra finds one of its most important applications, where it appears as the algebra of differential forms that is fundamental in areas that use differential geometry.  Differential forms are mathematical objects that represent infinitesimal areas of infinitesimal parallelograms (and higher-dimensional bodies), and so can be  integrated over surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds in a way that generalizes the line integrals from calculus.  The exterior algebra also has many algebraic properties that make it a convenient tool in algebra itself.  The association of the exterior algebra to a vector space is a type of functor on vector spaces, which means that it is compatible in a certain way with linear transformations of vector spaces. The exterior algebra is one example of a bialgebra, meaning that its dual space also possesses a product, and this dual product is compatible with the exterior product. This dual algebra is precisely the algebra of alternating multilinear forms on V, and the pairing between the exterior algebra and its dual is given by the interior product.

Ernest André Gellner (9 December 1925 – 5 November 1995) was a British-Czech philosopher and social anthropologist, described by The Daily Telegraph when he died as one of the world's most vigorous intellectuals and by The Independent as a "one-man crusade for critical rationalism."Stirling, Paul. Ernest Gellner Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 9 November 1995; O'Leary, Brendan. "Ernest Gellner Remembered", The Independent, 8 November 1995.
His first book, Words and Things (1959) prompted a leader in The Times and a month-long correspondence on its letters page over his attack on linguistic philosophy. As the Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics for 22 years, the William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge for eight, and finally as head of the new Centre for the Study of Nationalism in Prague, Gellner fought all his life—in his writing, his teaching, and through his political activism—against what he saw as closed systems of thought, particularly communism, psychoanalysis, relativism, and the dictatorship of the free market. Among other issues in social thought, the modernization of society and nationalism were two of his central themes, his multicultural perspective allowing him to work within the subject-matter of three separate civilizations—the Western, Islamic, and Russian.

[[Jousting]]
CATEGORIES: Jousting

Jousting is a martial game or hastilude between two horsemen and using lances, often as part of a tournament.
The primary aim is to strike the opponent with the lance while riding towards him at high speed, if possible breaking the lance on the opponent's shield or armour, or by unhorsing him.
Jousting emerged in the High Middle Ages based on the military use of the lance by heavy cavalry.
It transformed into a specialised sport during the Late Middle Ages, and remained popular with the nobility both in England and Germany throughout the whole of the 16th century (while in France, it was discontinued after the death of king Henry II in an accident in 1559).[tpl]cite book | last1 = Barber | first1 = Richard | first2 = Juliet | last2 = Barker | title = Tournaments: Jousts, Chivalry and Pageants in the Middle Ages | publisher = Boydell | date = 1 January 1989 | pages = 134, 139 | isbn = 978-0-85115-470-1[/tpl] In England, jousting was the highlight of the Accession Day tilts of Elizabeth I and James I, and also was part of the festivities at the marriage of Charles I.[tpl]Sfn | Young | 1977 | pp = 201–8[/tpl]
Jousting was discontinued in favour of other equestrian sports in the 17th century, although non-contact forms of "equestrian skill-at-arms" disciplines survived. There has been a limited revival of theatrical jousting re-enactment since the 1970s.
The joust became an iconic characteristic of the knight in Romantic medievalism and hence in the depiction of the Middle Ages in popular culture. Jousting matches were notably depicted in Ivanhoe (1820).
The term joust is derived from Old French joster, ultimately from a Late Latin iuxtare "to approach, to meet". The word was loaned into Middle English around 1300, when jousting was a very popular sport among the Anglo-Norman knighthood. The synonym tilt dates ca. 1510.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC; [tpl]Zh|s=全国人民代表大会常务委员会|t=全國人民代表大會常務委員會|p=[tpl]Linktext|Quánguó| Rénmín| Dàibiǎo| Dàhuì| Chángwù Wěiyuánhuì[/tpl][/tpl]) is a committee of about 150 members of the National People's Congress (NPC) of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which is convened between plenary sessions of the NPC.  It has the constitutional authority to modify legislation within limits set by the NPC, and thus acts as a de facto legislative body.  It is led by a Chairman, China's top legislator, who is conventionally ranked third in China's political ranking system, after the General Secretary and President, which is usually one person and the Premier of the State Council of PRC. The current Chairman is Zhang Dejiang.
The NPCSC also has the power to interpret the laws of the PRC, including its constitution. In contrast to other countries in which stare decisis gives the power of both final interpretation and adjudication to a supreme court, within the People's Republic of China constitutional and legal interpretation is considered to be a legislative activity rather than a judicial one, and the functions are split so that the NPCSC provides legal interpretations while the Supreme People's Court and the Courts of Final Appeal of Hong Kong and Macau actually decide cases.  Because an interpretation of the NPCSC is legislative in nature and not judicial, it does not affect cases which have already been decided.
A notable use of the latter power occurred in 1999 during the dispute of the Right of Abode issue in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In the case, the NPCSC interpreted the Basic Law of Hong Kong in accordance with the position taken by the Hong Kong government with respect to the eligibility of permanent residency in Hong Kong.

(Translated from a note of this article on the French WP.) was a Russian composer and pianist. Scriabin's early work is characterised by a lyrical and idiosyncratic tonal language influenced by Frédéric Chopin. Later in his career, independently of Arnold Schoenberg, Scriabin developed a substantially atonal and much more dissonant musical system, which he accorded with his personal brand of mysticism. Scriabin was influenced by synesthesia, and associated colors with the various harmonic tones of his atonal scale, while his color-coded circle of fifths was also influenced by theosophy. He is considered by some to be the main Russian Symbolist composer.
Scriabin was one of the most innovative and most controversial of early modern composers. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia said of Scriabin that, "No composer has had more scorn heaped or greater love bestowed..." Leo Tolstoy once described Scriabin's music as "a sincere expression of genius."E.E. Garcia (2004): Rachmaninoff and Scriabin: Creativity and Suffering in Talent and Genius.

[[Basic law]]
CATEGORIES: Constitutional law

The term basic law is used in some places as an alternative to "constitution", implying it is a temporary but necessary measure without formal enactment of constitution. A basic law is either a codified constitution, or in countries with uncodified constitutions, a law given to have constitution powers and effect. The name is usually used to imply an interim or transitory nature, or avoid attempting a claim to being "the highest law", often for religious reasons. In West Germany the term "Basic Law" (Grundgesetz) was used to indicate that the Basic Law was provisional until the ultimate reunification of Germany. But in 1990 no new constitution was adopted and instead the Basic Law was adopted throughout the entire German territory. Basic law is entrenched in that it overrides ordinary 'statute law' passed by the legislature.
The Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China, namely Hong Kong and Macau, have basic laws as their constitutional documents. The basic laws are the highest authority, respectively, in the territories, while the rights of amendment and interpretation rest with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.

Seth Barnes Nicholson (November 12, 1891 – July 2, 1963) was an American astronomer.[tpl]cite journal|title=Obituary: Seth B.

Nicholson was born in Springfield, Illinois and was raised in rural Illinois.  He was educated at Drake University where he became interested in astronomy.
In 1914, at the University of California's Lick Observatory, while observing the recently discovered Jupiter moon Pasiphaë, he discovered a new one: Sinope, whose orbit he computed for his Ph.D. thesis in 1915.
He spent his entire career at Mount Wilson Observatory, where he discovered three more Jovian moons: Lysithea  and Carme in 1938 and Ananke in 1951, as well as a Trojan asteroid 1647 Menelaus, and computed orbits of several comets and of Pluto.
Sinope, Lysithea, Carme and Ananke were simply designated as "Jupiter IX", "Jupiter X", "Jupiter XI" and "Jupiter XII".  They were not given their present names until 1975.  Nicholson himself declined to propose names.[ref]

At Mt. Wilson, his main assignment concerned solar activity and he produced for decades annual reports on sunspot activity. He also made a number of eclipse expeditions to measure the brightness and temperature of the Sun's corona.
In the early 1920s, he and Edison Pettit made the first systematic infrared observations of celestial objects.
They used a vacuum thermocouple to measure the infrared radiation and thus the temperature of the Moon which led to the theory that the Moon was covered with a thin layer of dust acting as an insulator, and also of the planets, sunspots and stars.
Their temperatures measurements of nearby giant stars led to some of the first determinations of stellar diameters.
Nicholson, together with astronomer George Ellery Hale, lend their name to the "Hale-Nicholson law" concerning the magnetic polarity of sunspots.Astrophysics of the sun, Harold Zirin, Cambridge University Press, 1988, p.307; http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988assu.book.....Z[ref]Judit M.

Lucius Aemilius Paullus (died 216 BC) was a Roman consul twice, in 219 and 216 BC.
He served his first consulship with Marcus Livius Salinator. During this year, he defeated Demetrius of Pharos in the Second Illyrian War and forced him to flee to the court of Philip V of Macedon. On his return to Rome, he was awarded a triumph. He was subsequently charged, along with his colleague, with unfairly dividing the spoils, although he was acquitted.T. Robert S.

Joust is an arcade game developed by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. It is a platform game that features two-dimensional (2D) graphics. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.
John Newcomer led the development team, which included Bill Pfutzenrueter, Jan Hendricks, Python Anghelo, Tim Murphy, and John Kotlarik. Newcomer aimed to create a flying game with co-operative two-player gameplay, but wanted to avoid a space theme, which was popular at the time. Staff worked within the technical limitations of the hardware (originally developed two years earlier for Williams' first game, Defender), excluding concepts and optimizing the visuals.
The game was well received in arcades and by critics, who praised the gameplay. The gameplay mechanics influenced titles by other developers. Joust was followed by a sequel three years later, and was ported to numerous home and portable platforms.

Eskimo–Aleut or Eskaleut is a language family native to Alaska, the Canadian Arctic, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut, Greenland, and the Chukchi Peninsula on the eastern tip of Siberia. It is also known as Eskaleutian, EskaleuticCf. Fleming 1987:189. or Inuit–Yupik-Unangan"Due to the pejorative nature of the term 'Eskimo' in some locales, and the increasing preference for 'Unangan' as opposed to 'Aleut' in Alaska, this family may be alternately referred to as Inuit-Yupik-Unangan. The hyphenated term gives some sense of the variety of languages subsumed under this family label." Holton, Gary. 2012. Overview of Comparative Inuit-Yupik-Unangan. Retrieved 2013-11-18.
The Eskimo–Aleut language family is divided into two branches, the Eskimo languages and the Aleut language.
The Aleut language family consists of a single language, Aleut, spoken in the Aleutian Islands and the Pribilof Islands. Aleut is divided into several dialects.
The Eskimo languages are divided into two branches, the Yupik languages, spoken in western and southwestern Alaska and in easternmost Siberia, and the Inuit language, spoken in northern Alaska, in Canada, and in Greenland. The Inuit language, which covers a huge range of territory, is divided into several dialects. Neighbouring dialects of Inuit are quite similar, although those at the farthest distances from the centre in the Diomede Islands and East Greenland are quite divergent.[tpl]cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Lawrence |authorlink=Lawrence D Kaplan |editor-last=McGary |editor-first=Jane |year=1984 |title=Inupiaq and the Schools - A Handbook for Teachers |publisher=Alaska Native Language Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks[/tpl]
The proper place of one language, Sirenik, within the Eskimo family has not been settled. Some linguists list it as a branch of Yupik,"Ethnologue report for Yupik Sirenk", Ethnologue, Retrieved 2008-08-25. others as a separate branch of the Eskimo family, alongside Yupik and Inuit."Alaska Native Languages – An Overview".

The Eskimo–Aleut languages are among the native languages of the Americas. This is a geographical category, not a linguistic one. The Eskimo–Aleut languages are not demonstrably related to the other language families of North America and are believed to represent a separate, and the last, prehistoric migration of people from Asia.

Marsupial moles are a family (Notoryctidae) of marsupials of the order Notoryctemorphia. They are rare and poorly understood burrowing mammals of the deserts of Western Australia, with an ancestry going back 20 million years or so. Once classified as a monotreme, they are now known to be a marsupial. Their precise classification was for long a matter for argument, but there are considered to be only two extant species:
The two species of marsupial moles are so similar to one another that they cannot be reliably told apart in the field. 
Marsupial moles spend most of their time underground, coming to the surface only occasionally, probably mostly after rains. They are blind, their eyes having become reduced to vestigial lenses under the skin, and they have no external ears, just a pair of tiny holes hidden under thick hair. They do not dig permanent burrows, but fill their tunnels in behind them as they move.

St. Catharines (2011 population 131,400; metropolitan population 392,184) is the largest city in Canada's Niagara Region and the sixth largest urban area in Ontario, with 96.11 square kilometres of land. It lies in Southern Ontario, 51 kilometres (32 mi) south of Toronto across Lake Ontario, and is 19 kilometres (12 mi) inland from the international boundary with the United States along the Niagara River. It is the northern entrance of the Welland Canal. Residents of St. Catharines are known as St. Cathariners.
St. Catharines carries the official nickname "The Garden City" due to its 1,000 acres (4 km2) of parks, gardens and trails.
St. Catharines is situated in an area for commerce and trade since it is located between the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and the Fort Erie - US Border. Manufacturing is the city's dominant industry, as noted by the heraldic motto, "Industry and Liberality". General Motors of Canada, Ltd., the Canadian subsidiary of General Motors, was the city's largest employer, a distinction now held by the District School Board of Niagara. TRW Automotive operates a plant in the city, though in recent years employment there has shifted from heavy industry and manufacturing to services.
St. Catharines lies on one of the main telecommunications backbones between Canada and the United States, and as a result a number of call centres operate in the city.

[[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]]

CATEGORIES: Outposts of Antarctica, United States Antarctic Program, Antarctic Specially Managed Areas

The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station is a US scientific research station at the Geographic South Pole, the southernmost place on the Earth. The station is located on the high plateau of Antarctica at an elevation of 2,835 metres (9,301 feet) above sea level. 
The original Amundsen–Scott Station was built by the United States government during November 1956 as a part of its commitment to the scientific goals of the International Geophysical Year (IGY), an international effort lasting from January 1957 through June 1958 to study, among other things, the geophysics of the polar regions.
Before November 1956, there was no permanent human structure at the South Pole, and very little human presence in the interior of Antarctica at all. The few scientific stations in Antarctica were located on and near its seacoast. The station has been continuously occupied since it was built.  The Amundsen–Scott Station has been rebuilt, demolished, expanded, and upgraded several times since 1956.
Since the Amundsen–Scott Station is located at the South Pole, it is at the only place on the land surface of the Earth where the sun is continuously up for six months and then continuously down for six months. (The only other such place is at the North Pole, on the sea ice in the middle of the Arctic Ocean.) Thus, during each year, this station experiences one extremely long "day" and one extremely long "night". During the six-month "day", the angle of elevation of the Sun above the horizon varies continuously. The sun rises on the September equinox, reaches its maximum angle above the horizon on the summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, around 20 December, and sets on the March equinox.
During the six-month "night", it gets extremely cold at the South Pole, with air temperatures sometimes dropping below −73 °C (−100 °F). This is also the time of the year when blizzards, sometimes with gale-force winds, strike the Amundsen–Scott Station. The continuous period of darkness and dry atmosphere make the station an excellent place from which to make astronomical observations.
The number of scientific researchers and members of the support staff housed at the Amundsen–Scott Station has always varied seasonally, with a peak population of about 200 in the summer operational season from October to February.  In recent years the wintertime population has been around 50 people.

European settlement in the region began in the late 17th century with a French fur trading outpost on the banks of the Kaministiquia River.Brief History of Thunder Bay, City of Thunder Bay. Retrieved 5 June 2007. It grew into an important transportation hub with its port forming an important link in the shipping of grain and other products from western Canada through the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway to the east coast. Forestry and manufacturing played important roles in the city's economy. They have declined in recent years, but have been replaced by a "knowledge economy" based on medical research and education. Thunder Bay is the site of the Thunder Bay Regional Research Institute.
The city takes its name from the immense Thunder Bay at the head of Lake Superior, known on 18th-century French maps as Baie du Tonnerre (Bay of Thunder). The city is often referred to as the "Lakehead" or "Canadian Lakehead" because of its location at the end of Great Lakes navigation.Tronrud, Thorold J; Epp, Ernest A.; and others. (1995).

James W. Cockburn, [tpl]Post-nominals|country=CAN|QC[/tpl] (February 13, 1819 – August 14, 1883) was a Canadian Conservative politician, and a father of Canadian Confederation.
He was born in Berwick-Upon-Tweed on the English - Scottish border and immigrated to Canada with his father, James Cockburn Snr. (1787-1832), mother, Sarah Turnbull (1797-1867) and brother, Adam (1820-1861), at the age of 13. After attending Upper Canada College and Osgoode Hall, he established a law practice in Cobourg, Ontario. In the 1850s, Cockburn was elected to the town council. In 1861, he was elected to the Province of Canada's legislative assembly as a Reformer representing Northumberland West. Despite  elected as an opponent of the Macdonald - Cartier administration, Cockburn switched allegiances and became a supporter of Macdonald's Liberal-Conservative Party.
Cockburn attended the Quebec Conference of 1864 as a supporter of Confederation.  After Confederation, he was elected to the new Canadian House of Commons in the country's first election.  He was nominated by Sir John A. Macdonald to be Canada's first Speaker of the House of Commons, a position in which he served from 1867 to 1874.
His performance as Speaker was hindered by the fact that he spoke no French in a chamber in which both English and French were official languages. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] He did however understand French. In 1872, Cockburn was nominated for a second term as Speaker despite reservations by the Opposition that he had been too favourable to the government in his rulings. Cockburn lost his seat in the 1874 election that had been precipitated by the Pacific Scandal and that brought down the Macdonald government.
Cockburn won back his former seat in the 1878 election but did not take an active role in Parliament. He resigned in 1881 when he was appointed to collect and classify Canadian statutes. He was still working on this assignment when his death occurred on August 14, 1883. His cause of death is unknown.
He married Isabella Susan Patterson (1838-1862) in 1854 and they had three children: Sarah Isabella Cockburn (1857-1911), Francis Cockburn (1858-?) and May Cockburn (1859-?). He is buried in St. James Cemetery, in Toronto.

Nanni d'Antonio di Banco ([tpl]circa[/tpl] 1384 – 1421) was an Italian sculptor from Florence. 
He helped create the winning model for the Duomo of the Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral in Florence (1418), under the leadership of Filippo Brunelleschi, alongside Donatello. His sculpture works for the church include the Assumption of the Virgin, just over the Porta della Mandorla. 
Nanni di Banco's most famous work is perhaps the Quattro Santi Coronati (Four Saints) group, depicting the Four Crowned Martyrs, at Orsanmichele, completed about 1415 and strongly influenced by the classical tradition. The Four Crowned Martyrs were patron saints of the stonemasons' guild.
Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Nanni di Banco in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.

In fluid dynamics, the Darcy–Weisbach equation is a phenomenological equation, which relates the head loss — or pressure loss — due to friction along a given length of pipe to the average velocity of the fluid flow. The equation is named after Henry Darcy and Julius Weisbach.
The Darcy–Weisbach equation contains a dimensionless friction factor, known as the Darcy friction factor. This is also called the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor or Moody friction factor. The Darcy friction factor is four times the Fanning friction factor, with which it should not be confused.[tpl]citation| title=Oilfield Processing of Petroleum.

[[Major League Baseball Triple Crown]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball pitching, Baseball terminology, Batting (baseball), Major League Baseball trophies and awards

In Major League Baseball, a player earns the Triple Crown when he leads a league in three specific statistical categories. When used without a modifier, the Triple Crown generally refers to a batter who leads either the National or American leagues in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) over a full regular season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/miguel-cabrera-has-shot-at-triple-crown-060210|title=Cabrera has a legit shot at triple crown|last=Morosi|first=Jon Paul|date=June 4, 2010|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl]  The Triple Crown epitomizes three separate attributes of a good hitter: hitting for average, hitting for power, and producing runs.  It has been accomplished 17 times, with Miguel Cabrera being the most recent to accomplish the feat in 2012, the first since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. 
The pitching Triple Crown is accomplished by a pitcher who leads the league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2007/jul/09/cheers_jeers_as_major_league_season_hits_midway_/|title=Cheers and jeers as Major League season hits midway point|last=Connolly|first=Dan|date=July 9, 2007|work=The Post and Courier|location=Charleston, South Carolina|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl]  The pitching Triple Crown has been accomplished 38 times, including 8 since 1997. 
Generally, the Triple Crown refers to leading a specific league such as the National League (NL) or the American League (AL) in these categories.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lockwood|first=Wayne|date=December 1997|title=A Batter's Top Challenge: Winning the Triple Crown|journal=Baseball Digest|publisher=Lakeside|volume=56|issue=12|pages=60–63|issn=0005-609X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6S4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60&dq=triple+crown+baseball#v=onepage&q=triple%20crown%20baseball&f=false[/tpl] However, if a player leads all of Major League Baseball in all three categories, he might be said to have captured a "Major League Triple Crown".  Furthermore, it is not a requirement for a player to be the sole leader in each category; only a tie of first place in each category is needed in order to be eligible. Yastrzemski tied with Harmon Killebrew for the American League lead in home runs (44) when he won the Triple Crown in 1967.

Star Pointer was bred by Captain Henry P. Pointer of Spring Hill, Tennessee. His sire was Brown Hal and his dam was Sweepstakes. He broke the 2 minute mile barrier on August 28, 1897 at around 4:00 pm with quarter times of 30 sec, 29[tpl]frac|3|4[/tpl], 29[tpl]frac|1|4[/tpl], 30[tpl]frac|1|4[/tpl] for a 1:59[tpl]frac|1|4[/tpl] time.

[[Scrapie]]

CATEGORIES: Sheep and goat diseases, Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Foodborne illnesses

Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease that affects the nervous systems of sheep and goats.  It is one of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which are related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease") and chronic wasting disease of deer. Like other spongiform encephalopathies, scrapie is caused by a prion. Scrapie has been known since the 18th century (1732) and does not appear to be transmissible to humans.[tpl]cite web|last=National Scrapie Education Initiative|title=Scrapie Fact Sheet|url=http://www.eradicatescrapie.org/About%20Scrapie/Fact%20Sheet.html|publisher=National Institute for Animal Agriculture|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Rolf|first=George|title=From Sheep to Humans: Scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease|url=http://www.ecclectica.ca/issues/2002/2/george.asp|publisher=Ecclectica|accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl]
The name scrapie is derived from one of the clinical signs of the condition, wherein affected animals will compulsively scrape off their fleeces against rocks, trees or fences.  The disease apparently causes an itching sensation in the animals.  Other clinical signs include excessive lip smacking, altered gaits, and convulsive collapse.
Scrapie is infectious and transmissible among similar[tpl]what|date=January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] animals, so one of the most common ways to contain it (since it is incurable) is to quarantine and destroy those affected. However, scrapie tends to persist in flocks and can also arise apparently spontaneously in flocks that have not previously had cases of the disease. The mechanism of transmission between animals and other aspects of the biology of the disease are only poorly understood and these are active areas of research. Recent studies suggest prions may be spread through urine and persist in the environment for decades.
Scrapie usually affects sheep around three to five years of age. There appears to be the potential for transmission at birth and from contact with placental tissues. There is no evidence that scrapie is infectious to humans.Scrapie reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 12 October 2011.

[[Blacklisting]]

CATEGORIES: Informal legal terms, McCarthyism, Bullying, Shunning

A blacklist (or black list) is a list or register of entities or people who, for one reason or another, are being denied a particular privilege, service,  mobility, access or recognition.  As a verb, to blacklist can mean to deny someone work in a particular field, or to ostracize a person from a certain social circle. 
Conversely, a whitelist is a list or compilation identifying entities that are accepted, recognized, or privileged. "Whitelist" and "blacklist" are widely considered controversial terms by some[tpl]who?|date=October 2013[/tpl] because of how they reinforce an implicit association in language between "black" and "bad" on the one hand, and "white" and "good" on the other. Many institutions including colleges and universities have abandoned the terms for less charged alternatives (like "safelist," or "watchlist").
The term blacklisting may be used in a pejorative sense, implying that a person has been prevented from having legitimate access to something due to inappropriate covert actions of those who control access.  For example, a person being served with a restraining order for having threatened another person would not be considered a case of blacklisting. However, somebody who is fired for exposing poor working conditions in a particular company, and is subsequently systematically blocked from finding work in that industry, is described as having been inappropriately and often illegally blacklisted.  Blacklisting can and has been accomplished informally by consensus of authority figures, and does not necessarily require a physical list or overt written record.
Blacklisting can be formal or informal. In the employment setting, applicants who apply to numerous positions regardless of being qualified or not can soon be ignored during some or all subsequent applicant processes, This can be an informal choice made by one person or a shared formal response taken up by one office, and not an issue that would be described as blacklisting. In the past, blacklists of union members have been shared or circulated between multiple organizations to prevent hiring of employees who, rather than being incompetent, have been critical of management actions.  People have been prevented from working for decades due to being on a blacklist; in some cases the information on the blacklist was false. Construction industry workers blacklisted for 20 years

It was previously entered into the 1997 Japan Grand Prix Horror Novel competition but was eventually rejected in the final round due to its content. The novel became a surprise bestseller. It was ranked fourth by the 2000 Kono Mystery ga Sugoi!, an annual mystery and thriller guidebook, and sold over a million copies.
In 2000, one year after publication, Battle Royale was adapted into a manga series, written by Takami himself, and a feature film. The film was also controversial and successful, with it being condemned by Japan's National Diet, yet becoming one of the country's highest-grossing films. The film spawned a sequel, and two more brief manga adaptations were also created. The novel itself has been translated into Chinese, English, French, Portuguese,  Spanish, German, Italian, Russian, Norwegian and Hungarian.

[[Direct-to-video]]
CATEGORIES: Home video, Television terminology

Direct to video (also known as direct to DVD, direct to VHS, direct to digital, made for video, straight to video, shot on video, or straight to DVD) refers to the release of a film to the public immediately on home video formats rather than a theatrical release or television broadcast.[tpl]cite news|title= Big Names Look For Bright Lights In Videoland|publisher= Chicago Tribune|date=1994-12-30|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-12-30/entertainment/9412300287_1_direct-to-video-video-store-r-rated|accessdate=2010-12-07|first=Max J|last=Alvarez[/tpl] Because sufficiently inferior sequels, prequels, or midquels of larger-budget films may be released direct to video, references to direct-to-video releases are often pejorative. Despite this, direct-to-video releases have become something of a lifeline for independent filmmakers and smaller companies.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Lerman | first=Laurence | title= Independents' 'Bread and Butter' | journal= Video Business | volume=21 | issue=38 | at=Section: Video Premieres | date=September 17, 2001 |postscript =[/tpl]

[[Standard score]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical terminology, Statistical ratios

In statistics, the standard score is the (signed) number of standard deviations an observation or datum is above the mean. Thus, a positive standard score represents a datum above the mean, while a negative standard score represents a datum below the mean. It is a dimensionless quantity obtained by subtracting the population mean from an individual raw score and then dividing the difference by the population standard deviation. This conversion process is called standardizing or normalizing (however, "normalizing" can refer to many types of ratios; see normalization (statistics) for more).
Standard scores are also called z-values, ''z''-scores, normal scores, and standardized variables; the use of "Z" is because the normal distribution is also known as the "Z distribution". They are most frequently used to compare a sample to a standard normal deviate (standard normal distribution, with μ = 0 and σ = 1), though they can be defined without assumptions of normality.
The z-score is only defined if one knows the population parameters; if one only has a sample set, then the analogous computation with sample mean and sample standard deviation yields the Student's t-statistic.
The standard score is not the same as the z-factor used in the analysis of high-throughput screening data though the two are often conflated.

[[Fundamental justice]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian law, Legal terms, New Zealand law

Fundamental justice is a legal term  that signifies a dynamic concept of fairness underlying the administration of justice and its operation, whereas principles of fundamental justice are specific legal principles that command "significant societal consensus" as "fundamental to the way in which the legal system ought fairly to operate."R. v. Malmo‑Levine; R. v. Caine, 2003 3 S.C.R. 571 at para. 113. These principles may stipulate basic procedural rights afforded to anyone facing an adjudicative process or procedure that affects fundamental rights and freedoms, and certain substantive standards related to the rule of law that regulate the actions of the state (e.g., the rule against unclear or vague laws). The degree of protection dictated by these standards and procedural rights vary in accordance with the precise context, involving a contextual analysis of the affected person's interests.  In other words, the more a person's rights or interests are adversely affected, the more procedural or substantive protections must be afforded to that person in order to respect the principles of fundamental justice.Charkaoui v.  Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 SCC 9 at para. 25. A legislative or administrative framework that respects the principles of fundamental justice, as such, must be fundamentally fair to the person affected, but does not necessarily have to strike the "right balance" between individual and societal interests in general.Malmo-Levine, supra note 1 at para. 96
The term is used primarily in Canadian and New Zealand law, including in the Canadian Bill of Rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Fundamental justice, although closely associated with, is not to be confused with the concepts of due process, natural justice, and Wednesbury unreasonableness.

[[Restraining order]]
CATEGORIES: Court orders, Legal terms

A restraining order or order of protection is a form of court order that requires a party to do, or to refrain from doing, certain acts. These orders flow from the court's injunction power to grant equitable remedies. A party that refuses to comply with an order faces criminal or civil penalties and may have to pay damages or accept sanctions. Breaches of restraining orders can be considered serious criminal offences that merit arrest and possible prison sentences.  The term is most commonly used in reference to domestic violence, harassment, stalking or sexual assault.  In the United States, every state has some form of domestic violence restraining order law,http://www.abanet.org/domviol/docs/DV_CPO_Chart_8_2007.pdf and many states also have specific restraining order laws for stalkinghttp://www.abanet.org/domviol/docs/StalkingHarassment_CPO_Chart_8_2007.pdf and sexual assault.http://www.abanet.org/domviol/docs/SA_CPO_Chart_8_2007.pdf
Restraining and personal protection order laws vary from one jurisdiction to another but all establish who can file for an order, what protection or relief a person can get from such an order, and how the order will be enforced.
When the abuser does something that the court has ordered him or her not to do, or refuses to do something the court has ordered him or her to do, that is a violation of the order. The victim can ask the police or the court, or both, depending on the violation, to enforce the order.
