[[Hellenistic religion]]
CATEGORIES: Hellenistic religion, Christianity and Paganism

Hellenistic religion is any of the various systems of beliefs and practices of the people who lived under the influence of ancient Greek culture during the Hellenistic period and the Roman Empire (c. 300 BCE to 300 CE). There was much continuity in Hellenistic religion: the Greek gods continued to be worshipped, and the same rites were practiced as before. 
Change came from the addition of new religions from other countries, such as including the Egyptian God(esse)s of Isis and Serapis, and the Syrian Gods of Atargatis and of Hadad, which provided a new outlet for people seeking fulfillment in both the present life and the afterlife. The worship of Hellenistic rulers was also a feature of this period, most notably in Egypt, where the Ptolemies adopted earlier pharaonic practice, and established themselves as god-kings. Elsewhere rulers might receive divine status without the full status of a God.
Magic was practiced widely, and these too, were a continuation from earlier times. Throughout the Hellenistic world, people would consult oracles, and use charms and figurines to deter misfortune or to cast spells. Also developed in this era was the complex system of astrology, which sought to determine a person's character and future in the movements of the sun, moon, and planets. The systems of Hellenistic philosophy, such as Stoicism and Epicureanism, offered an alternative to traditional religion, even if their impact was largely limited to the educated elite.

[[Ignazio Albertini]]
CATEGORIES: 1644 births, 1685 deaths, Italian composers, Baroque composers, Italian musicians

Ignazio Albertini (Albertino) (c. 1644 – 22 September 1685) was an Italian Baroque violinist and composer.
Very little is known about Albertini's life. He may have been born in Milan, but first surfaces in Vienna, in a letter exchange between the famous violinist Johann Heinrich Schmelzer of the Viennese court and Karl II von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn, Prince-Bishop of Olomouc. Apparently, Albertini was guilty of some sort of misconduct, but both Schmelzer and the Prince-Bishop express their high opinion of him as a musician. The letter exchange dates from September 1671, so by that time Albertini was in Vienna; how he got there and what positions he occupied is unknown. That he was introduced to the Prince-Bishop, a well-known collector of music, and knew Schmelzer, one of the most important musicians at the court, seems to indicate that Albertini was much respected in Vienna. Nothing is known about his career, except that at some point he entered the service of Eleanor Gonzaga, widow of Ferdinand III, as chamber musician, and held that position until his death, which occurred in Vienna on 22 September 1685 when Albertini was murdered. The circumstances of the murder (Albertini was stabbed to death) are unknown.
As a composer Albertini is known by a single collection of music, the twelve Sonatinae (sonatas for violin and basso continuo) posthumously published in Vienna and in Frankfurt in 1692. The collection was prepared for publication by Albertini himself, but he did not live to see it printed, possibly because of the high cost of the copperplate engraving process. Albertini's sonatas are multi-sectional pieces, very varied in content and structure, and all of the highest quality. Some idea of the rich variety of forms found in the Sonatinae may be gleaned from the following examples: Sonata IX is a passacaglia in which the main theme is presented as a canon at the fifth in the first and the last sections; and statements of the ostinato sometimes overlap with formal sections of the sonata. Sonata XII, the last in the cycle, consists entirely of imitative movements, unlike other sonatas, in which imitative movements are either absent or are surrounded by free sections, such as slow lyrical arias, toccata-like movements with rapid passagework over sustained bass notes, etc. Albertini's sonatas are very demanding technically, with frequent instances of difficult fast passages, leaps, sudden changes of register and, particularly in the last sonata, double stopping. 
Apart from the Sonatinae, two works are known by name from catalogues: Sonata hyllaris ex C à 10 (from a 1699 inventory) and a suite of 7 pieces à 4.

[[Neo-medievalism]]

CATEGORIES: Political theories, Philosophical theories

Neo-medievalism (or neomedievalism) is a neologism that was first popularized by Italian medievalist Umberto Eco in his 1986 essay "Dreaming in the Middle Ages".Umberto Eco, "Dreaming the Middle Ages," in Travels in Hyperreality, transl. by W. Weaver, NY: Harcourt Brace, 1986, 61-72. Umberto Eco said "..we are at present witnessing, both in Europe and America, a period of renewed interest in the Middle Ages, with a curious oscillation between fantastic neomedievalism and responsible philological examination.."  Prior to this the term was used in Isaiah Berlin's "The Hedgehog and the Fox" Isaiah Berlin, "The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy’s View of History, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1953; New York, p.76; "those who really did believe in the possibility of some kind of return- neo-medievalists from Wackenroder and Gorres and Cobbett tp G.K. Chesterton..." to refer to a nostalgic romanticism for the simplicity and order of the medieval period.
In its modern use, it has been used by various writers such as medieval historians who see it as the intersection between popular fantasy and medieval history;David Ketterer (2004). "Chapter 18: Fantasic Neomedievalism" by Kim Selling, in Flashes of the Fantastic. as a term describing the post-modern study of medieval history;Cary John Lenehan.

The Tasman Booby (Sula dactylatra tasmani) or Lord Howe Masked Booby is a large seabird of the gannet family, Sulidae, described from bones found on Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands in the Tasman Sea (van Tets et al. 1988). It was believed to have become extinct in the late 18th century or early 19th century on Lord Howe Island because of predation by visiting sailors, with the last sight record dating from 1788, when it was already extinct on Norfolk Island.
However, this taxon has more recently (Priddel et al. 2005) been considered to be a subspecies of the Masked Booby, Sula dactylatra tasmani, still extant as a breeding species on Lord Howe Island, and more recently described as S. d. fullagari. Holdaway & Anderson (2001) attribute subfossil material from Norfolk Island simply to Sula dactylatra. Research at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch New Zealand indicates that the proposal of Priddel's team is correct, and the Masked Booby subspecies fullagari is actually the same as tasmani. The latter name, being older, would thus apply to both.Extinct seabird rediscovered in laboratory

"À force de prier" ([tpl]lang-en|"By Persistently Praying"[/tpl]) was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1963, performed in French by Greek singer Nana Mouskouri. This was the first ever appearance of a Greek artist on the Eurovision stage, Greece as a nation only joined the Contest in 1974.
Mouskouri had had her international breakthrough with the German language single "Weiße Rosen aus Athen" ("White Roses from Athens") in 1961, a song originally adapted from a Greek folk melody. The song was later translated into several different languages and went on to become one of Mouskouri's signature tunes. When she received the offer to represent Luxembourg at the Eurovision Song Contest in early 1963 she and her family had recently relocated from Athens, Greece to Paris, France, where she was signed to the Philips-Fontana label.
"À force de prier" is a ballad, with Mouskouri telling the object of her affections that she intends to have him love her "by persistently praying" for this to occur. Moskouri recorded her entry in French, German (as "Die Worte dieser Nacht"), English ("The One That Got Away") and Italian ("La notte non lo sa"). 
The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following Monaco's Françoise Hardy with "L'amour s'en va". At the close of voting, it had received 13 points, placing 8th in a field of 16.
Although "À force de prier" was only a minor international success for Mouskouri, it won her the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque in France that same year, and her Eurovision appearance also caught the attention of noted French composer Michel Legrand, who went on to write and arrange two major hits for her in the francophone markets; "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (1964) and "L'enfant au tambour" (1965).
"À force de prier" was succeeded as Luxembourgian representative at the 1964 Contest by Hugues Aufray with "Dès que le printemps revient".

{{Blacklisted-links|1=

Galt Collegiate Institute and Vocational School (GCI) is one of sixteen secondary schools in the Waterloo Region District School Board, located in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada.
GCI offers a complete academic and extra-curricular experience to a student body of more than 1,300 in a wide range of academic and vocational programs.
GCI has been designated as an historic landmark in Cambridge. The school was founded in 1852, with Michael Howe as headmaster, after it was decided to move the grammar school from Palermo to Galt. William Tassie became headmaster in 1853.    Under his leadership, the school, informally known as "Tassie's School", gained a reputation as one of the top schools in Ontario.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] It graduated many men who later rose to prominence, including Joseph E. Seagram. It was one of the first collegiate institutes in the province.
However, by 1881 Tassie's methods of teaching were deemed outdated, and the entire staff resigned. John E. Bryant became principal and new staff were hired, including Thomas Carscadden, who became principal in 1884. The school, which had formerly been a boarding school for boys, became a day school for boys and girls. There were 70 students in 1881.
In 1905 a major addition was made to the two-story building. The three-story addition, made of stone quarried from the adjacent Grand River, opened in 1906.
Carscadden stepped down as principal in 1914, a role performed by A. P. Gundry until his death in 1925. During World War I, Galt saw a larger proportion of its residents enlist in relation to its population than anywhere else in Canada. Three hundred fifty present and former students enlisted, 48 of whom died while serving. After the war, a plaque was erected in the school commemorating these 48 former students.
Also after World War I, the concept of vocational education gained popularity in Ontario.  The name of the school was changed from "Galt Collegiate Institute" to the present name, and another large addition was made to the school to accommodate vocational classes.
GCI is also home to both the French Immersion, and ESL[tpl]clarify|date=May 2013[/tpl] programs.

Armand Tokatyan (June 16, 1894 – June 12, 1960) was an operatic tenor. An Armenian born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, he travelled to Egypt with his parents where he sang in cafés to favorable response. He was then sent to Paris to study tailoring, but instead sang in Left Bank cafés. In 1914, he returned to Egypt and earned his living by again singing in the cafés. He took up operetta, soon becoming a matinee idol, then in 1919 went to Milan to pursue an opera career. His operatic debut was in 1921 at the Teatro Dal Verme in Puccini's Manon Lescaut. With the help of Italian conductor  Giuseppe Bamboschek, he joined the touring Scotti Opera Company in the United States, and was soon noticed by the Metropolitan Opera where he debuted in 1923. For many years he performed there and at many other opera houses in the US and Europe. He was proficient in numerous languages. Many recordings were made of his performances.
Dorothy Kirsten in her autobiography writes the following about Tokatyan:Dorothy Kirsten (1982). A Time to Sing. Doubleday & Company, Inc. p. 82. ISBN 0-385-14744-9
 
 I recall how grateful I was to have him as a partner for my first performance of Traviata at the Met because there had been no orchestra rehearsal. Tokatyan afforded me a sense of security, having sung Alfredo innumerable times in that theatre. His authority onstage and his ingratiating manner made me very comfortable. He seemed to be just right for the role. As Alfredo his noble appearance helped me create the illusion that I was desperately in love with him.

Tokatyan died in Pasadena, CA of a heart attack on June 12, 1960.

[[Howell Melon Festival]]
CATEGORIES: Visitor attractions in Livingston County, Michigan, Festivals in Michigan

The Howell Melon Festival is a food festival held in mid-August which showcases the Howell melon, a cantaloupe hybrid claimed to be found only in the area surrounding Howell, Michigan. The first Howell Melon Festival was held in 1960. About 50,000 people attend the three day festival each year.
In years past, the highlight of the festival was a beauty contest to elect the Howell Melon Queen. The very first Melon Queen, a beautiful nurse, won a trip to Washington, D.C. where she met with President Dwight D. Eisenhower at the White House. The news wires picked up the story of the beauty queen and the Howell melons, earning front page stories in the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times, and "that's how the Howell melon got famous", according to Dr. Louis May, organizer of the first festival.
The festival is now managed by the Howell Downtown Development Authority.  Instead of a Melon Queen, the new tradition is to elect children as Melon Prince and Princess, Mini Prince and Princess, and (the youngest category) Sprout Prince and Princess .
In the past, the festival included an ice cream eating contest and a large parade. The parade tradition which included the Shriners, was discontinued in 2008. The 50th anniversary was celebrated without a parade. For a few years, the festival organized a riverboat tour of Thompson lake. The 2012 venue will close Grand River Ave for two days to accommodate Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels performance. Howell melons are available for tasting and purchase, with up to 200,000 melons sold each year.
While the following is a wonderful story, it is a myth. 'The first Howell melons were grown by August "Gus" Schmitt, a local farmer, who was given the original seeds by an itinerant hobo during the Great Depression.

[[Dès que le printemps revient]]
CATEGORIES: Eurovision songs of Luxembourg, Eurovision songs of 1964

"Dès que le printemps revient" (English translation: "Once Spring Returns") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1964, performed in French by French singer Hugues Aufray.
The song is a ballad, with Aufray musing on how he feels when Spring begins. He sings that everyone finds love during the season, but frequently forgets it later on. As for his own situation, he sings that he hopes to find love, but also that occasionally he "wants to die" as a result of not finding it. Aufray also recorded his entry in German, as "Das alles geht vorbei", and Spanish, as "La primavera llegó".
The song was performed first on the night, preceding the Netherlands' Anneke Grönloh with "Jij bent mijn leven". As Luxembourg had performed last at the 1963 contest, this represents the rare event of a country "succeeding itself" on the Eurovision stage. At the close of voting, it had received 14 points, placing 4th in a field of 16.
It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1965 Contest by France Gall with "Poupée de cire, poupée de son".

In accordance with the Security Council's rotation rules, whereby the ten non-permanent Security Council seats rotate among the various regional blocs into which UN member states traditionally divide themselves for voting and representation purposes, the five available seats were allocated as follows:
While the first three votes were uncontroversial and even the one contested seat was settled in the first round, the race for the Latin American and Caribbean seat went on for an almost unprecedented 48 rounds of voting over the space of three weeks. In five days of ballots, the General Assembly was unable to decide between Guatemala and Venezuela, and the matter was only resolved when they both agreed to withdraw their candidacies and nominate Panama instead.

Agata della Pietà (fl. ca. 1800) was an Italian composer, singer, and teacher of music.
A foundling admitted in infancy to the Ospedale della Pietà in Venice, she received thorough musical training from her childhood in the coro, or music school, of the convent; she later became a soprano soloist, singing teacher, and school administrator. She is known to have been the soloist in motets commissioned from Giovanni Porta and Andrea Bernasconi, in whose manuscripts she is mentioned by name; she is also mentioned in an anonymous verse tribute to musicians of the Pietà cori which dates to around 1740.
Only two motet settings by della Pietà, a Novo aprili in F (inscribed to one "Louisa Della Sga Agnatta") and a setting, also in F, of Psalm 134 for compline, survive; only the instrumental bass part to the latter survives. In addition, she produced a pedagogical text, Regali per Gregoria, for one of her pupils, an alto soloist named Gregoria known to have been active between 1746 and 1777.
Along with Michielina and Santa della Pietà, della Pietà was one of three foundlings of the Ospedale known to have become a composer.  Nothing is known of her later years or of her death.

CATEGORIES: Baroque composers, Italian composers, Women classical composers, 18th-century Italian people, Year of birth uncertain, Year of death uncertain

Santa (also known as Sanza or Samaritana) della Pietà (fl. ca. 1725 – ca. 1750, died after 1774) was an Italian singer, composer, and violinist.
A foundling admitted in infancy to the Ospedale della Pietà, della Pietà received a full grounding in music from early childhood at the coro, or music school, attached to the convent. She is known to have been a contralto soloist, violinist, and composer during the tenures of Giovanni Porta, Nicola Porpora, and Andrea Bernasconi as heads of the school. She is also known to have studied violin with Anna Maria della Pietà and to have succeeded her as director of the school orchestra around 1740; at this time she performed at least six of the concertos written by Antonio Vivaldi for Anna Maria. One piece by Santa, a setting of the Vespers Psalm 113 in D, survives.
Along with Agata and Michielina della Pietà, della Pietà was one of three foundlings resident at the Ospedale to become a composer later in life. Nothing further is known about her.

[[Combo organ]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic organs

A combo organ is an electronic organ of the frequency divider type, generally produced between the early 1960s and the late 1970s. This type of organ predated, and contributed largely to, the development of modern synthesizers.  The combo organ concept, at least in the context of mass-production, is thought to have arisen from popular demand, when smaller home organs were seen in music stores.  Combo organs were probably originally developed in Italy, and some included the inner workings of transistor accordions.  They were the brainchild of necessity for portable organs of simple design, mainly for use in small groups playing jazz, pop or dance music. These groups were known in the early 1960s as combos, hence the designation for this type of organ.  Combo organs ended up having a major impact on the music scene of the mid- and late 1960s, particularly on Rock & Roll of that era.

[[Johann Paul von Westhoff]]

Johann Paul von Westhoff (1656 – buried 17 April 1705) was a German Baroque composer and violinist. One of the most important exponents of the Dresden violin school, he was among the highest ranked violinists of his day, and composed some of the earliest known music for solo violin. He worked as musician and composer as a member of Dresden's Hofkapelle (1674–1697) and at the Weimar court (1699–1705), and was also active as a teacher of contemporary languages.
Westhoff's surviving music comprises seven works for violin and basso continuo and seven for solo violin, all published during his lifetime. More works, particularly a 1682 collection of solo violin music, are currently considered lost. His work, together with that of Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber and Johann Jakob Walther, greatly influenced the subsequent generation of German violinists, and the six partitas for solo violin inspired Johann Sebastian Bach's famous violin sonatas and partitas.

Metro Auditorio ([tpl]Lang-es|Estación Auditorio[/tpl]) is a Mexico City Metro station located on line 7.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.metro.df.gob.mx/red/estacion.html?id=95|title=Auditorio|language=Spanish|accessdate=1 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|last=Archambault|first=Richard|url=http://mexicometro.org/metro/line7/auditorio/|title=Auditorio »  Mexico City Metro System|accessdate=1 August 2011[/tpl] It is one of the main metro gateways (along with Metro Polanco) to the chic and business-related neighbourhood, Polanco. The entrances to the station are on Paseo de la Reforma, one of the main thoroughfares in Mexico City.
Its symbol depicts the façade of the Auditorio Nacional ([tpl]Lang-en|National Auditorium[/tpl]), which is just above the station. The auditorium is one of the main venues for concerts, shows and entertainment in the city, so almost every weekend night, this station is used by the attendants to the events.
The station opened on 23 August 1985.[tpl]Cite web|last=Schwandl|first=Robert|url=http://www.urbanrail.net/am/mexi/mex-history.htm|title=Opening Dates for Mexico City's Subway|accessdate=1 August 2011[/tpl]
This station is also frequently used by tourists because of its proximity to many landmarks of the city, such as Chapultepec. Outside the station, just in front of the Auditorio Nacional, is the main station of the Turibus, a double deck bus that runs a touristic route that goes from Chapultepec Park to the Historic Center along Reforma.
During weekdays, this station is also one of the busiest ones of the network because it is an entrance to the business, office and financial area in Polanco.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://polanco.circulovivo.com/|title=Polanco CirculoVivo|accessdate=1 August 2011[/tpl] Outside the station there is also one of the main microbus stops in the area; these microbuses transport people coming from the metro to other business and commercial zones in the city like northern Polanco, Palmas, Santa Fe, Lomas de Chapultepec and Satélite. 
During rush hour, due to the large mass of people taking these buses outside the metro station and to the poor infrastructure of the microbus stops, heavy traffic is originated in this part of Paseo de la Reforma. Criticism has also been made to the layout of this metro station (among others of Line 7) because the heavy flows of people are not well managed; during rush hours flows of people walking in different directions often face each other causing a decrease in the speed of pedestrian traffic. Other problems concern the bottlenecks at bridges, narrow tunnels, escalators, and normal stairs due to low capacity.

[[Prime triplet]]
CATEGORIES: Classes of prime numbers, Unsolved problems in mathematics

In mathematics, a prime triplet is a set of three prime numbers of the form (p, p + 2, p + 6) or (p, p + 4, p + 6).Chris Caldwell. The Prime Glossary: prime triple from the Prime Pages. Retrieved on 2010-03-22. With the exceptions of (2, 3, 5) and (3, 5, 7), this is the closest possible grouping of three prime numbers, since every third odd number greater than 3 is divisible by 3, and hence not prime.
The first prime triplets [tpl]OEIS|id=A098420[/tpl] are
(5, 7, 11), (7, 11, 13), (11, 13, 17), (13, 17, 19), (17, 19, 23), (37, 41, 43), (41, 43, 47), (67, 71, 73), (97, 101, 103), (101, 103, 107), (103, 107, 109), (107, 109, 113), (191, 193, 197), (193, 197, 199), (223, 227, 229), (227, 229, 233), (277, 281, 283), (307, 311, 313), (311, 313, 317), (347, 349, 353), (457, 461, 463), (461, 463, 467), (613, 617, 619), (641, 643, 647), (821, 823, 827), (823, 827, 829), (853, 857, 859), (857, 859, 863), (877, 881, 883), (881, 883, 887)
A prime triplet contains a pair of twin primes (p and p + 2, or p + 4 and p + 6), a pair of cousin primes (p and p + 4, or p + 2 and p + 6), and a pair of sexy primes (p and p + 6).
A prime can be a member of up to three prime triplets - for example, 103 is a member of (97, 101, 103), (101, 103, 107) and (103, 107, 109). When this happens, the five involved primes form a prime quintuplet.
A prime quadruplet (p, p + 2, p + 6, p + 8) contains two overlapping prime triplets, (p, p + 2, p + 6) and (p + 2, p + 6, p + 8).
Similarly to the twin prime conjecture, it is conjectured that there are infinitely many prime triplets.   The first known gigantic prime triplet was found in 2008 by Norman Luhn and François Morain. The primes are (p, p + 2, p + 6) with p = 2072644824759 × 233333 − 1. [tpl]As of|2013|May[/tpl] the largest known prime triplet contains primes with 16737 digits and was found by Peter Kaiser.

Laurel River Lake, located west of Corbin, Kentucky, in the USA, is an reservoir built in 1977 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the Laurel River, a tributary of the Cumberland River, in the Daniel Boone National Forest. The lake covers parts of Laurel and Whitley counties.[tpl]cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: Thomas D. Clark, Lowell H. Harrison, and James C.

The 282 foot (86 m) high dam was built between 1964 and 1974.  It is a combination earth and rock-fill dam.  Hydropower production began in 1977. As of 2006, it produced an average annual energy of 67 gigawatt hours of hydroelectricity.
The Army Corps of Engineers and the Forest Service cooperate on developing recreational facilities around the reservoir. Today most of the lake is managed by the Forest Service as part of Daniel Boone National Forest. The Army Corps of Engineers manages the operation of the dam itself, and runs recreational facilities at the dam.
Laurel River Lake's drainage area is 282 square miles (730 km²).  The area of the lake changes based on how full it is, but it is about 19 miles (31 km) long, with 206 miles (332 km) of shoreline.  Its area ranges from about 5,600 to 6,060 acres (23 to 25 km²), with a maximum flood-control size of 6,650 acres (27 km²).  The reservoir's storage capacity (volume) also changes, but is about [tpl]convert|435,000|acre.ft|m3|lk=in[/tpl].

CATEGORIES: Supercharging, Superchargers, Engine technology, Aircraft engines

A supercharger is an air compressor that increases the pressure or density of air supplied to an internal combustion engine. This gives each intake cycle of the engine more oxygen, letting it burn more fuel and do more work, thus increasing power.
Power for the supercharger can be provided mechanically by means of a belt, gear, shaft, or chain connected to the engine's crankshaft. When power is provided by a turbine powered by exhaust gas, a supercharger is known as a turbosupercharger[tpl]cite web|url=http://rwebs.net/avhistory/opsman/geturbo/geturbo.htm |title="The Turbosupercharger and the Airplane Power Plant" |publisher=Rwebs.net |date=1943-12-30 |accessdate=2010-08-03[/tpl] – typically referred to simply as a turbocharger or just turbo.

Turbinaria ornata is a tropical brown algae of the order Fucales native to coral reef ecosystems of the South Pacific. It can quickly colonize these ecosystems due in part to its method of dispersing by detaching older and more buoyant fronds that travel on surface currents, sometimes in large rafts of many individual thalli, or fronds.  Some scientists are investigating whether the increase in density of seaweeds, and a decrease in living coral density, on coral reef ecosystems indicates a change in the health of the reef, focusing studies on this particular species of brown alga.

[[Wildwood Park, Winnipeg]]

CATEGORIES: Neighbourhoods in Winnipeg, Planned communities in Canada

Wildwood Park is a suburban community in Winnipeg that has a central green space and no front roads (only back alleys), with communal walkways, playgrounds and parks. Nearly all of the original houses are based on five variations of three basic designs, pre-fabricated in one section of the site. The site plan concept  is based on the Radburn community design of architects Henry Wright and Clarence Stein who advocated the idea of designing  neighbourhoods for the "motor age". It varies from the original in the introduction of crescents (or loops) as the local access roads. It was developed in 1946–47 by Hubert Bird and designed by Green, Blankstein, Russell (GBR). It is well known as an early example of the Radburn pattern, which has found extensive application in the second half of the 20th century. It presages the emergence of the Fused Grid that uses the same principle of filtered permeability.
Wildwood Park is in the Charleswood–Fort Garry city ward and the Pembina Trails school division of Winnipeg. It corresponds to Statistics Canada's census dissemination area 110466, in census tract 0503.00, within the Winnipeg census division, part of the Winnipeg census metropolitan area.  It comprises much of the Wildwood neighbourhood of Winnipeg, within the Fort Garry North neighbourhood cluster (according to how census data is reported for the city of Winnipeg). It is in the Fort Garry–Riverview provincial electoral division (Fort Garry until 2008), and the Winnipeg South Centre federal electoral division. Before Unicity in 1972, this was part of the Rural Municipality of Fort Garry.

Big Warrior was from the town of Tukabatchee. For most of his career he collaborated with the United States government and became wealthy. He was accused of enriching himself by mishandling annuities paid to the Creeks by the United States. 
In 1811 Big Warrior welcomed Tecumseh to Tukabatchee to deliver his message of pan-tribal unity and hostility to the United States. Nevertheless, Big Warrior remained firmly on the U.S. side during the Creek War of 1813-14. The Treaty of Fort Jackson forced harsh settlement terms on the entire Creek Nation. In the following decade Big Warrior became an opponent of further land cessions. 
Big Warrior, representing the Upper Towns of the Creek Nation, shared the leadership of the Creek National Council with Little Prince, principal chief of the Lower Towns.

As the crow flies the town is only [tpl]convert|90|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] southeast of Istanbul but by road it is [tpl]convert|200|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] around the Gulf of Izmit. It is [tpl]convert|80|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] by road from Bursa.
The town is situated with its west wall rising from the lake itself, providing both protection from siege from that direction, as well as a source of supplies which would be difficult to cut off. The lake is large enough that it cannot be blockaded from the land easily, and the city was large enough to make any attempt to reach the harbour from shore-based siege weapons very difficult.
The city was surrounded on all sides by [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of walls about [tpl]convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] high. These were in turn surrounded by a double ditch on the land portions, and also included over 100 towers in various locations. Large gates on the three landbound sides of the walls provided the only entrance to the city.
Today the walls are pierced in many places for roads, but much of the early work survives and as a result it is a tourist destination. The town has a population of about 15,000. It has been  a district center of Bursa Province since 1930. It was in the district of Kocaeli between 1923–1927 and was a township of Yenişehir (bounded to Bilecik before 1926) district between 1927–1930.
The town was an important producer of highly decorated fritware vessels and tiles in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Asadullah Rahman, the youngest Guantanamo detainee, recounted being apprehended in Samoud's compound when it was raided by American troops.
Asadullah described being sold into servitude to Samoud, when he was about ten years old.  By day he worked in Samoud's kitchen.  Asadullah said that, by night, he was forced to perform sexual services for Samoud's men.
The San Francisco Chronicle quoted Mohammed Sabir, a local police official, who confirmed that "Commander Samoud", was not associated with the Taliban, that he was a simple criminal, who terrorized the nearby villages, and whose gang numbered about thirty men.
During his Combatant Status Review Tribunal a young Guantanamo detainee named Habib Rahman, who acknowledged working as a cook for Samoud, told his Tribunal that they could ask Samoud their questions himself, as he was still a prisoner in Bagram.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
Another Guantanamo detainee, Mohabet Khan, said he was forcibly conscripted into Samoud's forces shortly before Samoud's compound was captured by the Americans.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
A third Guantanamo detainee, Shardar Khan acknowledged working as a bodyguard for Samound.
He testified that Samoud's local enemy was another militia leader named Abdul Ali, who had murdered Samoud's son.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

[[Loss-of-pressure-control accident]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear safety, Nuclear reactors, Civilian nuclear power accidents

Most commercial types of nuclear reactor use a pressure vessel to maintain pressure in the reactor plant. This is necessary in a pressurized water reactor to prevent boiling in the core, which could lead to a nuclear meltdown.  This is also necessary in other types of reactor plants to prevent moderators from having uncontrolled properties.
Pressure is controlled in a pressurized water reactor to ensure that the core itself does not reach its boiling point in which the water will turn into steam and rapidly decrease the heat being transferred from the fuel to the moderator. By a combination of heaters and spray valves, pressure is controlled in the pressurizer vessel which is connected to the reactor plant. Because the pressurizer vessel and the reactor plant are connected, the pressure of the steam space pressurizes the entire reactor plant to ensure the pressure is above that which would allow boiling in the reactor core. The pressurizer vessel itself may be maintained much hotter than the rest of the reactor plant to ensure pressure control, because in the liquid throughout the reactor plant, pressure applied at any point has an effect on the entire system, whereas the heat transfer is limited by ambient and other losses.

[[The American Diary of a Japanese Girl]]

CATEGORIES: 1901 novels, 20th-century American novels, Fictional diaries, Novels set in San Francisco, California

The American Diary of a Japanese Girl is the first English language novel published in the United States by a Japanese writer. Acquired for Frank Leslie's Illustrated Monthly Magazine by editor Ellery Sedgwick in 1901, it appeared in two excerpted installments in November and December of that year with illustrations by Genjiro Yeto. In 1902, it was published in book form by the New York firm of Frederick A. Stokes. Marketed as (and believed, with some doubts, to be) an authentic diary by an 18-year-old visitor to the United States named "Miss Morning Glory" (Asagao), it was in actuality the work of Yone Noguchi, who wrote it with the editorial assistance of Blanche Partington and Léonie Gilmour.
The book describes Morning Glory's preparations, activities and observations as she undertakes her transcontinental American journey with her uncle, a wealthy mining executive. Arriving in San Francisco by steamship, they stay briefly at the Palace Hotel before moving to a "high-toned boarding house" in Nob Hill. Through the American wife of the Japanese consul, Morning Glory befriends Ada, a denizen of Van Ness Avenue with a taste for coon songs, who introduces her to Golden Gate Park and vaudeville and is in turn initiated by Morning Glory in the ways of kimono. Morning Glory briefly takes over proprietorship of a cigar store on the edge of San Francisco Chinatown before moving to the rustic Oakland home of an eccentric local poet named Heine (a character based on Joaquin MillerWyatt, David. Five Fires: Race, Catastrophe, and the Shaping of California. Oxford University Press, 1999: 188. ISBN 0-19-512741-2). After some days there spent developing her literary skills and a romantic interest with local artist Oscar Ellis, and a brief excursion to Los Angeles, she departs with her uncle for Chicago and New York, continuing, along the way, her satirical observations on various aspects of American life and culture. The novel closes with Morning Glory's declared intention to continue her investigations into American life by taking a job as a domestic servant, thus preparing the way for a sequel.
Noguchi had in fact already written the sequel, The American Letters of a Japanese Parlor-Maid, at the time of the American Diary 's publication, but Stokes, citing lackluster sales, declined to publish the sequel, thus obliging Noguchi to defer publication until his return to Japan in 1904. There, Tokyo publisher Fuzanbo issued a new edition of The American Diary of a Japanese Girl (this time under Noguchi's own name, with an appendix documenting the book's history) as well as The American Letters of a Japanese Parlor-Maid (1905), published with a preface by Tsubouchi Shoyo. Another publisher issued Noguchi's Japanese translation of The American Diary of a Japanese Girl under the title 邦文日本少女の米國日記 in 1905. In 1912, Fuzanbo published a new edition of The American Diary with a fold-out illustration (kuchi-e) by ukiyoe artist Eiho Hirezaki, which was also sold under the imprint of London publisher and bookseller Elkin Mathews. In 2007, The American Diary of a Japanese Girl was reissued in an annotated edition by Temple University Press.

[[The Isle of Gulls]]
CATEGORIES: English Renaissance plays, 1605 plays

The Isle of Gulls is a Jacobean era stage play written by John Day, a comedy that caused a scandal upon its premiere in 1606.
The play was most likely written in 1605; it was acted by the Children of the Revels at the Blackfriars Theatre in February 1606. It was published later in 1606, in a  quarto printed by John Trundle and sold by the bookseller John Hodges. A second quarto was issued in 1633 by William Sheares.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 286.
The 1606 edition was unusual in several respects. It was not licensed by the Stationers Company, as it should have been. Changes were made after the press run had begun — the publisher's name was removed from the title page, and the characters of the "King" and "Queen" were altered to "Duke" and "Duchess." These changes have been described as "unsurprising" in light of the play's obvious political satire.Gregory M. Colon Semenza, Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance, Newark, DE, University of Delaware Press, 2004; p. 103.
The play, written in prose rather than verse, draws upon the Arcadia of Sir Philip Sidney for its plot. The problem arose from the play's satire on the political conditions and personalities of its day. The play's Arcadians and Lacedemonians were understood to be the English and the Scots (the boy actors used Scottish accents for the Lacedemonians). The title gives an unmistakably English frame of reference: a real Isle of Gulls lies in the River Thames. The character Damoetas in Day's play represented royal favorite Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset. The "King" or "Duke" wastes public funds on himself and his "Queen" or "Duchess;" he keeps corrupt counsellors and raises unworthy men to knighthood, and generally leaves the state in chaos.
The play was offensive to the new Stuart monarchy, even more so than Eastward Ho, by Ben Jonson, John Marston, and George Chapman, had been in a year earlier (1605). (The Isle of Gulls in fact mentions Eastward Ho as well as the plays written in conjunction with it, Westward Ho and Northward Ho. In Eastward Ho, Sir Petronel Flash and Gertrude are shipwrecked on the Isle of Gulls.) In the case of Eastward Ho, Jonson and Chapman went to jail; in the case of The Isle of Gulls, some of the juvenile cast members of the Blackfriars production were incarcerated in Bridewell prison for a brief interval. Day was questioned by the Privy Council, and may also have been imprisoned for a time. The child actors ended up under new management.
The published text of the play includes a Prologue, in which the actor speaking the piece is interrupted by three of the audience members sitting on the stage of the Blackfriars. (The potential disruptive influence of the spectators seated at the sides of the stage is employed in other works of the era, most notably in Francis Beaumont's 1607 satire The Knight of the Burning Pestle.) Each of the three wants a different kind of play: one demands a satire, the next a love story ("a scene of venery"), and the third a "stately penn'd history." The Prologue complains of the impossibility of pleasing them all.Lucy Munro, Children of the Queen's Revels: A Jacobean Theatre Repertory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005;  pp. 7-8.

St. John's Church in Savannah is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia.
The church was formed in 1841 from the growing Christ Church, Savannah, as part of a plan to increase Episcopal presence in Georgia and to provide for a first bishop of the diocese. In addition to his Episcopal duties, the bishop would be rector of both St. John's and Christ Church. Stephen Elliott, Jr. was consecrated as Bishop of Georgia in February 1841.
St. John's first building was consecrated in 1853. When the congregation outgrew this building, the construction was undertaken of the current building (which is situated across from the historic Green-Meldrim House - now the church's parish house). The building was designed by Calvin N. Otis of Buffalo, NY,http://books.google.com/books?id=eDOHI4b408oC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22calvin+n.+otis%22+architect+savannah&source=bl&ots=BiJPHiocBy&sig=dEiHv9tpm7tjnDbq1TU1mpIycfI&hl=en&ei=SOroTKadDsalnweUv-HwDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false and was consecrated in May 1853.
The Parish continues to use the 1928 Book of Common Prayer, but nevertheless maintains, despite the generally conservative character of its congregation, cordial relations with the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia.

[[Index Medicus]]
CATEGORIES: Publications established in 1879, Bibliographic databases, Medical literature

Index Medicus (IM) was a comprehensive bibliographic index of scientific journal articles focusing on medical science fields, published from 1879 to 2004. It was initiated by John Shaw Billings, head of the Library of the Surgeon General's Office, United States Army. This library later evolved into the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM). In the 1960s, the NLM began computerizing the indexing work by creating MEDLARS, a bibliographic database, which became MEDLINE. Index Medicus thus became the print presentation of the MEDLINE database's content, which users accessed usually by visiting a library which subscribed to Index Medicus (for example, a university scientist at the university library). It continued in this role through the 1980s and 1990s, while various electronic presentations of MEDLINE's content also evolved, first with proprietary online services (accessed mostly at libraries) and later with CD-ROMs, then with Entrez and PubMed. As users gradually migrated from print to online use, Index Medicus print subscriptions dwindled. During the 1990s, the dissemination of home internet connections, the launch of the Web and web browsers, and the launch of PubMed greatly accelerated the shift of online access to MEDLINE from something one did at the library to something one did anywhere. This dissemination, along with the superior usability of search compared with use of a print index in serving the user's purpose (which is to distill relevant subsets of information from a vast superset), caused the use of MEDLINE's print output, Index Medicus, to drop precipitously. In 2004, print publication ceased. In one sense, Index Medicus and Abridged Index Medicus still exist conceptually as content curation services that curate MEDLINE content into search subsets or database views (in other words, subsets of MEDLINE records from some journals but not others), but this is irrelevant to most use of MEDLINE.

[[Incense of India]]
CATEGORIES: Incense by region, Indian culture

India has a rich tradition of using incense in many social and religious occasions since time immemorial.  Incense sticks, also known as agarbathi (or agarbatti derived from Sanskrit word Agaravarthi, gara = odour, agar = aroma, varthi = wound ) and joss sticks, in which an incense paste is rolled or moulded around a bamboo stick, is one of the main forms of incense in India.  The bamboo method originated in India, and is distinct from the Nepal/Tibet and Japanese methods of stick making in which  a bamboo stick is not used. Though the method is also used in the west, particularly in America, it is strongly associated with India. Other main forms of incense are cones and logs and Benzoin resin ( In Sanskrit Saambraani), which are incense paste formed into pyramid shapes or log shapes, and then dried.
A uniform and codified system of incense-making first began in India. Although Vedic texts mention the use of incense for masking odors and creating a pleasurable smell, the modern system of organized incense-making was likely created by the medicinal priests of the time. Thus, modern, organized incense-making is intrinsically linked to the Ayurvedic medical system in which it is rooted.

CATEGORIES: 1892 novels, Novels by Theodor Fontane, Novels set in Germany

 
Irretrievable ([tpl]lang-de|Unwiederbringlich[/tpl], 1892, also known as Beyond Recall and No Way Back ) is one of realist Theodor Fontane's mature German novels. As with some other of Fontane's novels (including Effi Briest), its heroine is believed to be based roughly on a real person whose demise Fontane heard about, and it deals delicately with near taboo (at the time of writing) topics including adultery and suicide.
The novel has been translated twice into English. The first by Douglas Parmée in 1963 as Beyond Recall, it was re-published in 2011 by New York Review of Books as Irretrievable. In 2010 a new English translation, No Way Back, was published by Angel Classics (London). There also is a German made-for-TV movie (1968, director Falk Harnack).
As for translating this haunting novel into English, even deciding on a translation for the title presents many choices in English (irrecoverable, unrecoverable, irretrievable, unrepeatable, beyond recall, past retrieval, beyond retrieval and irreparable, just to name a few).  The subtle word-plays and linguistic motifs which add to the power of its German text are challenging to render into English.

Matthew Edward Cassar (born 16 October 1972) is a former Australian cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who represented Derbyshire from 1994 to 2000 and Northamptonshire from 2001 and 2002.
Cassar joined Derbyshire in the 1994 season and played a promising first-class game against the New Zealanders in June. However, due to him being born in Australia and therefore having to go through a period of residential qualification, he played primarily in the Second XI Championship. His debut game was against Gloucestershire, and he scored a half-century in his second innings. A regular fixture in the Second XI team until the 1997 season, by which time he had completed his qualification period, he made his breakthrough in County Cricket in that year.
He played consistently for the team until the 2000 season, when he transferred to Northamptonshire in a bid to gain higher honors. Injury curtailed his career however, and after two operations to cure a sportsman's hernia injury, which proved to be unsuccessful, he left the game at the end of the 2002 season.
Due to his injuries, Cassar then went on to follow a career in financial advising. He founded financial services companies 'Wizard Finance' and 'Derby Money' in Derby, UK. He is also a director of 'Online Mortgage Advisor', a UK mortgage information and advice website.

The unified command would have merged the medical assets of the United States Navy, Air Force, and Army and reduced the duplication of effort that currently exists.

Specifically, the Department of Defense will implement the following measures:
To implement these changes, the Department of Defense will be creating a transition team to review options and recommend steps for implementation. The implementation process is expected to take at least two years.

[tpl]nihongo|Ghost Hunt|ゴーストハント|Gōsuto Hanto[/tpl], originally titled [tpl]nihongo|Akuryō Series|悪霊シリーズ|[/tpl], is a light novel series written by Fuyumi Ono. It follows the adventures of the Shibuya Psychic Research Center as they investigate mysterious occurrences all over Japan with a team of other spiritualists and clever assistants.  Although the last novel was published in 1994, the story was left incomplete.  Speculation arose to the continuation of the series when the creator Fuyumi Ono stated in an interview that she was resuming work on a "girls' horror story" that she began long ago, even though Ono's statement has never been officially confirmed to be in reference to Ghost Hunt.
The novels were adapted into a radio drama for Akuryō Series in 1997. A manga adaptation written and illustrated by Shiho Inada began serialization in Nakayoshi in the July 7, 1998 issue where it is still on-going. The individual chapters have been collected and published in eleven tankōbon volumes by Kodansha. It is licensed for English-language release, under the name Ghost Hunt in North America by Del Rey Manga and in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi.  An anime adaptation of the manga was created by J.C.Staff and premiered on October 3, 2006 in Japan on TV Tokyo where it ran for twenty-five episodes until its conclusion. The anime is licensed for English release on Region 1 DVD by Funimation Entertainment, which also used the name Ghost Hunt.

Danailov attained notoriety during the FIDE World Chess Championship 2006 by making accusations against Topalov's opponent Vladimir Kramnik (who subsequently won the match).
On 28 September 2006, Danailov complained to the match organizers and the press about Kramnik's repeated visits to the bathroom.  He noted that the bathrooms were the only place not under audio or video surveillance, and called the frequency of the breaks "strange, if not suspicious".  Danailov suggested that Topalov would abandon the match if the concerns were not addressed.
On 4 October 2006, Danailov issued a press release that identified what it labelled "coincidence statistics" showing the percentage of times that Kramnik played a move that would be recommended by Chessbase's Fritz 9 chessplaying software in that position."Silvio Danailov accuses Kramnik of using Fritz 9", Chessbase, 4 October 2006. The press release did not state the comparable percentage for Topalov.

Intuition is the native windowing system and user interface (UI) engine of AmigaOS. It was developed almost entirely by RJ Mical.[tpl]cite book | first1=Robert J. | last1=Mical | first2=Susan| last2=Deyl | authorlink1=RJ Mical | title=Amiga Intuition Reference Manual | series=Amiga Technical Reference Series | year=1987 | publisher=Addison-Wesley | isbn=0-201-11076-8[/tpl] Intuition should not be confused with Workbench, the AmigaOS spatial file manager, which relies on Intuition for handling windows and input events.
Intuition is the internal widget and graphics system. It is not implemented primarily as an application-managed graphics library (as most systems, following Xerox' design, have done), but rather as a separate task that maintains the state of all the standard UI elements independently from the application. This makes it responsive because UI gadgets are live even when the application is busy. The Intuition task is driven by user events through the mouse, keyboard, and other input devices. It also arbitrates collisions of the mouse pointer and icons and control of "animated icons". Like most GUIs of the day, Amiga's Intuition followed Xerox's lead anteceding solutions, but pragmatically, a command line interface was also included and it extended the functionality of the platform. Later releases added more improvements, like support for high-color Workbench screens and 3D aspect. Replacement desktop file managers were also made available, such as Directory Opus Magellan, or Scalos interface.
Users may remember the initial releases for the garish blue/orange/white/black palettes. This was intentional - in a time before cheap high-quality video monitors, the Commodore tested output on the worst televisions they could find, with the goal of obtaining the best possible contrast under these worst-case conditions.

Al Bashir ibn Salim al-Harthi ([tpl]lang-ar|البشير بن سالم الحارثي[/tpl]) (executed 15 December 1889) was a wealthy merchant and plantation owner of Arab-Oromo parentage who is known for the Abushiri Revolt against the German East Africa Company in present-day Tanzania. He is credited with uniting local Arab traders and African tribes against German colonialism.
Beginning on September 20, 1888, insurrections led by Abushiri attacked German-held trading posts and towns throughout the East African territory. The German trading company, unable to control the uprising appealed to the government in Berlin for assistance. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck dispatched 34-year-old Lieutenant Hermann Wissmann as Reichskommissar to the colony. Wissmann along with a combination of German, Sudanese and Shangaen soldiers formed the core of the first Schutztruppe in the region. With naval assistance they bombarded coastal towns which allowed for German re-occupation. Also the Navy set up a blockade to deny shipments of arms and supplies to reach the rebels.
Al Bashir's forces were able to capture most of the towns along the Tanganyika coast and even took the explorers Hans Meyer and Oscar Baumann hostage. Nevertheless towards the end of 1888, much of his alliance with the local tribes had collapsed, and he was forced to hire Arab mercenaries to defend his stronghold at Jahazi, a village near Bagamoyo. German troops led by Wissmann attacked Jahazi on May 8, 1889 resulting in 106 Arab deaths. Abushiri escaped and was able to persuade members of the Yao and Mbunga tribes to continue with the rebellion. He was then able to lead new assaults on Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo. However, superior German firepower was able to repulse these attacks, and the African tribesmen soon deserted Abushiri.
Al Bashir attempted to flee to the Imperial British East Africa Company in Mombasa, but was turned over to the Germans by local tribesmen. On 15 December 1889 he was sentenced to death by a court-martial and shortly afterwards hanged in Pangani.

Lynne Janice Kosky (born 2 September 1958) is a former Australian politician and senior minister in the Parliament of Victoria.  She represented the electoral district of Altona in the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the Australian Labor Party from 1996 to 2010 and held key ministerial posts from 1999 through to her retirement from politics, including the key education and public transport portfolios.  
A sometimes controversial figure, particularly as public transport minister, and a magnet for criticism about the performance of Melbourne's metropolitan rail system, Kosky presided over the largest increases to public transport patronage in 50 years in Victoria when a substantial infrastructure deficit had been created over that period due to a bias towards funding for roads.  Kosky attracted record funding for public transport, particularly during the settling of the Victorian Transport Plan, and built a strong record of legislative reform in her ministerial posts.   On 18 January 2010, Lynne Kosky announced her intention to retire from Parliament immediately, citing "significant health problems in her family" as the reason.http://www.theage.com.au/national/public-transport-minister-lynne-kosky-quits-politics-20100118-mf66.html?autostart=1

Harold Frederick Stewart (14 December 1916[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]7 August 1995) was an Australian poet and oriental scholar. He is chiefly remembered as the enigmatic other half of Ern Malley.
Stewart's work has been associated with James McAuley and A. D. Hope, belonging to a neo-classical or Augustian movement in poetry, but his choice of subject matter is different in that  he concentrates on writing long metaphysical narrative poems, combining Eastern subject matter with his own metaphysical journey to shape the narrative.  
He is usually described by critics as a traditionalist and conservative but described himself as a conservative anarchist.  A witty and engaging letter writer, many examples have been retained by the National Library in Canberra. Leonie Kramer in The Oxford History of Australian Literature, p. 371, grades the literary quality of Ethel's letters as equal to those of Patrick White, Peter Porter and Barry Humphries.Ethel Malley in a letter to 'The Editors,' 28 October 1943, Ern Malley Collected Poems, p.1.  Stewart included the small incidental detail which provided enough background information so that Harris could imagine Ethel's social circumstances.  She writes: "When I was going through my brother's things after his death, I found some poetry he had written.  I am no judge of it myself, but a friend who I showed it to thinks it is very good and told me it should be published."

[[Cooked mode]]

CATEGORIES: Computer terminals, Unix

Cooked mode is a mode of a terminal or pseudo terminal character device in Unix-like systems in which data is preprocessed before being given to a program. In this mode the system interprets special characters such as backspace, delete and other control characters such as Control-C and Control-D. The precise definition of what constitutes a cooked mode is operating system-specific.Terminal Mode - MIT/GNU Scheme 7.7.90  The other mode is “raw mode”, also called delimiterless input, in which the data is given as-is to the program, and the system does not interpret any of the special characters.
For example, if “ABCD” is given as an input to a program through a terminal character device in cooked mode, the program gets “ABD”. But, if the terminal is in raw mode, the program gets the characters “ABC” followed by the Backspace character and followed by “D”. In cooked mode, the terminal line discipline processes the characters “ABCD” and presents only the result (“ABD”) to the program.
Technically, the term “cooked mode” should be associated only with streams that have a terminal line discipline, but generally it is applied to any system that does some amount of preprocessing.[tpl]cite web|title=Cooked mode from FOLDOC|url=http://foldoc.org/index.cgi?query=cooked+mode&action=Search[/tpl]

[[The Christy Miller series]]

CATEGORIES: Juvenile series, American Christian novels, American young adult novels

The Christy Miller Series by Robin Jones Gunn is a Christian book series for teenage girls. The book series centers on Christy Miller, a young lady from Wisconsin. In the first book of the series, young Christy visits her Aunt Marti and Uncle Bob in their California home where she meets surfer Todd Spencer. In the second book, Christy’s world changes abruptly when her parents decide to move to California. This 12 book series describes the roller coaster that is an average teenage girl’s life. Christy’s story continues in several of Robin Jones Gunn’s other books after this series. Her life with Todd continues in Christy And Todd: The College Series, and in her best friend’s (and maid of honor’s) series: The Katie Weldon Series, and Christy is also mentioned a few times in The Sierra Jensen Series (Sierra and Christy meet at a European mission trip, also mentioned in the 12th book of Christy’s series.)

http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Christy-Miller-Collection-Volume-1/Robin-Jones-Gunn/e/9781590525845/pwb=1&

1. Summer Promise:
Fourteen-year-old Christy Miller has the dream summer ahead of her in sun-kissed California, staying with her aunt and uncle at their beachfront home. Aunt Marti loves to shop, and those surfers are cute—especially Todd. Christy promised her parents she wouldn’t do anything she’d regret later, and some of her beach friends are a little wild. But Todd and his “God-Lover” friends are giving Christy a new image of all things eternal. Can this summer live up to its promise?

2. A Whisper and a Wish:
Christy’s family has moved to California just in time for her sophomore year of high school. But they’re not in Newport Beach, where she spent the summer. Instead they’re an hour and a half away and Christy has to start all over making friends. Despite an embarrassing escapade at a slumber party, things are going pretty well...until some midnight fun leads to a trip to the police station. Does God really hear every whisper? Does He know our every wish? Then why is it so hard to know who your friends really are? 

3. Yours Forever:
Christy is back at Aunt Marti and Uncle Bob’s house on the beach for the entire week between Christmas and New Year’s...and Todd  Spencer is in town, too! The cute surfer completely captured Christy’s heart last summer, and she’s eager to spend every possible minute with him. But soon Christy and her aunt are barely speaking, and it seems like all her friends are mad at her, too—including Todd! Is he hers or isn’t he? And why would God let things get so tangled? 
http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Christy-Miller-Collection-Volume-2/Robin-Jones-Gunn/e/9781590525852/pwb=1&

4. Surprise Endings:
Cheerleading tryouts are coming up, and Christy Miller is giving it all she’s got. The competition is tough and some of the girls are just rude, but Christy thinks she has a good chance to make the squad. Meanwhile prom is just around the corner, and Christy hopes her parents will make an exception to their “no dating until sixteen” rule. She’d love to go with Todd to his prom! But nothing turns out as Christy had planned. As the surprises keep coming, can Christy respond with grace...and maybe even spring a surprise of her own? 

5. Island Dreamer:
Christy Miller is spending her sixteenth birthday on Maui with her family, Todd, and Paula, her best friend from Wisconsin! What could be better? But Christy soon finds that she and Paula don’t have as much in common anymore. Paula’s obsessed with having a boyfriend...even if it means stealing Todd from Christy! Will he choose Paula over her? Or will the islands send Christy dreaming in new directions? 

6. A Heart Full of Hope:
Christy Miller is sixteen, and that means she can finally date! Rick has waited months for this, and he has a whole list of dates planned. He’s not happy about her early curfews and weekend job, but Christy knows her parents aren’t about to negotiate on those points. Really, she’s dazzled to be pursued by such a thoughtful guy. So why does she feel overwhelmed? Where does Todd fit into her life now? And can any guy really fulfill all her hopes? 
http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Christy-Miller-Collection-Volume-3/Robin-Jones-Gunn/e/9781590525869/pwb=1&

7. True Friends:
What is a true friend? Christy Miller knows she has two of them: Todd and Katie. To show how much she appreciates them, she writes to Todd, who’s off surfing in Hawaii, and she agrees to join the ski club with Katie…even though she’s scared of skiing! Fortunately, Christy and Katie can laugh as they bumble their way around the bunny slopes at Lake Tahoe. But Christy finds herself caught between new friends and her loyalty to Katie. Will Christy find a way to be a true friend when it counts most? And will she ever hear from Todd? 

8. Starry Night:
It’s Christmastime, and Christy Miller has so much going on: family time, work, and maybe, just maybe, going to the Rose Bowl Parade with a bunch of friends. If only she could answer Uncle Bob’s tough questions. Todd’s buddy Doug gives her some insight, and she starts to appreciate him in a whole new way. Rick Doyle shows up again...but is he pursuing Christy or the cutest elf at the mall? Through it all, will Christy find someone special to count the stars with? 

9. Seventeen Wishes:
It’s summer, and that means the beach and other adventures. And Christy Miller’s best friend, Katie, is always full of ideas. They’ll be camp counselors! But when Katie can’t go, Christy is bewildered and overwhelmed by her fifth-grade girls, who have boundless energy for anything except what Christy wants them to do. Do they even hear a word she says? Soon they’re playing matchmaker between Christy and Jaeson, a handsome counselor...and he doesn’t seem to mind. When Christy’s seventeenth birthday arrives later in the summer, just what will she be wishing for? 
http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Christy-Miller-Collection-Volume-4/Robin-Jones-Gunn/e/9781590525876/pwb=1&

10. A Time to Cherish:
For Labor Day weekend, Christy Miller is on a houseboat at Lake Shasta. What could be better? She’s about to find out! Before they know it, both Christy and her best friend, Katie, are receiving some unexpected male attention. But somehow these best friends are at odds just when they should be having the most fun together. Christy soon realizes that sometimes you have to stand back and let people make their own decisions, even when they’re headed for a fall. And although life is never perfect, this is definitely a time to cherish. 

11. Sweet Dreams:
Christy Miller’s senior year is delicious, especially the time she spends with Todd. But her best friend, Katie, is struggling—she’s realized she needs to break up with Michael. It’s not easy! Fortunately both Doug and Disneyland help Katie to cheer up. Christy is learning to let go and get out of the way so that her friends can become who they’re meant to be...even when it jeopardizes her own sweet dreams. 

12. A Promise is Forever:
Christy Miller’s going to Europe! It’s a three-week missions trip with Doug, Katie, and Tracy. First stop: London for some sightseeing, and then a castle in the English countryside for group training. Christy is so excited to be headed for Belfast with her friends—despite some tension among them. But when plans go topsy-turvy at the last minute, Christy must face her fears and realize that some things are more important than her own comfort...and that even when she can’t foresee the end result, a promise truly is forever.

[[Breaker bar]]
CATEGORIES: Wrenches

A breaker bar is a long non-ratcheting bar that is used with socket wrench style sockets.  Breaker bars are used to 'break loose' very tight fasteners because their additional length allows the same amount of force to generate significantly more torque than a standard length socket wrench.[tpl]rp|1,3[/tpl] The use of a breaker bar also prevents damage to the ratcheting mechanism of a socket wrench. Often, after the first 1/2 turn of a fastener, the fastener is then loose enough to be turned with a socket wrench.
An improvised bar can be made with a length of metal pipe that has a wrench inserted into one end. This (pipe) device is often called a cheater bar.
Breaker bars are used to remove lug nuts as they are applied with great torque by an impact wrench. Breaker bars are used for roadside tire replacement to offer the driver the leverage needed to loosen the bolts.

Brian Wiseman (born July 13, 1971) is a retired Canadian ice hockey forward and assistant coach.
As a novice player, Brian scored an astounding 413 goals in a single season[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl].  This broke a record held by Wayne Gretzky, and brought about national attention to the nine year-old Wiseman.
Brian owns the only retired number of the former Chatham MicMacs (now named Jr. Maroons) of the former Western Ontario Hockey League. His number 9 was retired after he left Chatham to play for the University of Michigan Wolverines. Approximately 3,600 spectators were in attendance to see Wiseman break Ed Olczyk's single season point record. Wiseman amassed 147 points in just 40 games in 1989–90.
During his career at University of Michigan, he was named Freshman of the Year in 1991, had Frozen Four appearances in 1992 and 1993 and the Wolverines were CCHA Tournament Champions in 1994.  He finished his U-M career with 248 points including a school-record 164 assists.
He was drafted by the New York Rangers in the 12th round of the 1991 NHL Entry Draft after his freshman season, but remained at U-M to complete his stellar career.
Brian would next move to play hockey professionally.  He played for the Chicago Wolves (IHL), St. John's Maple Leafs (AHL), Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL), and Houston Aeros (IHL) before retiring due to concussion problems stemming from an injury suffered during the Aeros' 1999–2000 playoff season. He helped the Houston Aeros capture the Turner Cup in the 1998–1999 season and was named the IHL's Most Valuable Player in 1999 after leading the league in scoring with 109 points.
After his playing career, he spent one season as a video coach with the Dallas Stars and another as an assistant coach at Princeton University.
In 2007, Brian Wiseman was inducted into the Chatham (Ontario) Sports Hall of Fame.

[[God Didn't Give Me a Week's Notice]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 films

"God Didn't Give Me a Week's Notice" is a 15 minute documentary by Richard Daily about Margaret Holloway, also known as "The Shakespeare Lady" of New Haven, Connecticut.
Richard Dailey attended Bennington College at the same time as Margaret Holloway.  He was three years behind her and their acquaintance was casual.  She was very talented and well known on campus.  When he found that she was homeless and panhandling on Whitney Ave in New Haven, Connecticut, he asked if he could record her performances and she agreed.  He and Holloway worked two weeks to produce a 15 minute documentary.  He then spent the next six months editing the material from his home in Paris.
As reported in the Yale Daily News, December 7, 2001:
"Set to jazzy music, the film features Holloway dramatically reciting several pieces from Euripides, Shakespeare and Chaucer. Dailey also recorded Margaret speaking about her life. Interspersed through the documentary are candid and telling stills of Holloway in various locations in New Haven."
Daily made a hand-shake agreement with Holloway that any revenue produced by the film would be divided equally between the two of them.  The Yale Daily News reported that the Dec. 9 2001 benefit screening at York Square Cinemas on Broadway was an exception. All of the proceeds from that show would be donated to Holloway.  It is unknown how much money was raised.
In the documentary, lines from Holloway's 1980 thesis run sporadically across the bottom of the screen.
"Many artists have aspired to a theater of hunger," Holloway wrote.
"Many were imprisoned, driven insane, etc. These artists know that there is no separation between the quest toward a theater of hunger and a quest toward a way of life. We continue in this quest."

[[Barium oxalate]]
CATEGORIES: Barium compounds, Oxalates, Pyrotechnic colorants

Barium oxalate, a Barium salt of oxalic acid, is a white odourless powder that is sometimes used as a green pyrotechnic colorant generally in specialized pyrotechnic compositions containing magnesium.
Though largely stable, it can be reactive with strong acids. A mild skin irritant, the substance is considered toxic when ingested, causing nausea, vomiting, renal failure and injury to the gastrointestinal tract. Its molecular structure is written as BaC2O4. The raw materials that are required to prepare Barium oxalate are oxalic acid, Barium hydroxide octahydrate, and Barium hydroxide.
It can also be prepared alternatively by using an oxalic acid solution and a Barium chloride solution, with the reaction as follows:
BaCl2 + H2C2O4 → BaC2O4↓ + 2 HCl 
It is different from most pyrotechnic colorants in that it is a reducing agent, and not an oxidizing agent. It is extremely insoluble in water and converts to the oxide form when heated.

Gudde (1946). The Solution of the Islay Problem. California Folklore Quarterly 5 (3): 298-299 (Gudde concludes that the word "islay" originated in a Salinan word slay; Islay was the Spanish version of their word).) is an evergreen shrub to tree, producing edible cherries, with shiny and spiny toothed leaves similar in appearance to holly. It is native to the chaparral areas of coastal California and northern Baja California,Germplasm Resources Information Network: Prunus ilicifolia as well as the desert chaparral areas of the Mojave desert.
Holly-leaved cherry grows 8 to 30 feet tall, with thick, alternate leaves 1 to 2 inches in length. It has small white flowers growing in clusters, similar in appearance to most members of the rose family, Rosaceae, flowering from March to May. The flowers are terminal on small stalks, with the youngest at the cluster center. The purple to black fruit is sweet,with a very thick pulp around a large single stone (drupe).
The plant is prized for cultivation, showy and easily grown from seed, and has been cultivated for hundreds of years (or more) as a food source, and tolerates twice yearly pruning when often used as a hedge. The plant likes full sun, loose open soil (porous), and tolerates drought conditions well, but needs regular watering when young. Bees are attracted to it.
Native Americans fermented the fruit into a drink used to get intoxicated. "Prunus" comes from the old Latin for "plum". "Ilici - folia means "holly like - leaves". This is the only species of the genus Prunus native to the Santa Monica Mountains that divide the Los Angeles basin from the San Fernando Valley, California.

[[P. K. Manthri]]

CATEGORIES: 1933 births, 1984 deaths, People from Kerala, People from Pandalam, Indian cartoonists, Raja Ravi Varma College of Fine Arts alumni

P. K. Manthri (real name P. K. Manthri Kumaran) (31 May 1933 – 6 December 1984) was an Indian cartoonist.
Manthri was born to Poomangalathu Kesavan and Kochikka, at Pandalam in Kerala, India. His father was a school manager and headmaster. Manthri studied painting from the Ravi Varma School of Arts, Mavelikkara. He drew cartoons mainly for Thaniniram daily, although he started drawing cartoons for Sarasan in 1950s. He also published cartoons in Asadhu, and Narmada. Later, his works appeared in Mathrubhumi, Janayugam, Malayala Nadu, Malayala Rajyam, and Manorajyam. Pachu, Kovalan, Mr. Kunju etc. are popular cartoon characters created by Manthri. Manthri himself appeared in many of his own cartoons. The beauty of his cartoon character Pachu's wife earned a lot of praise from readers, and was mentioned by Professor M. Krishnan Nair in his weekly article Sahitya Varabhalam in Kalakaumudi weekly.
Manthri was a drawing teacher by profession but he left this in 1954. For some time, he worked for Calicut papers Desabhimani and Mathrubhumi. Then he joined the government education department, while continuing to work as a cartoonist.[tpl]cite book|author=S. N. Sadasivan|title=A Social History Of India|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Be3PCvzf-BYC&pg=PA649|accessdate=16 April 2012|date=1 January 2000|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-170-0|pages=649–[/tpl] His rash criticism through cartoons - in particular, a cartoon Kudanannakkan Aalilla which targeted the irregular appointment of Arabic teachers in schools from a particular community - irritated the then education minister C. H. Muhammed Koya. As a result, Manthri was suspended from government service for two and a half years from 1969. While he was under suspension, he still drew cartoons using the pseudonym 'Thanthri'. He also published a cartoon book named Chithrahasyam during this period. Over 20,000 copies of the book were circulated. He was allowed back into government service in 1973, as per the report of the then government secretary Malayattoor Ramakrishnan, who was also a cartoonist and novelist.
Malayatoor mentioned this incident in his service story.
Manthri was responsible for making the first animated film title in Malayalam cinema. This was the movie Poocha Sanyasi, directed by Hariharan. Cartoonist and publisher Cartoonist Shankar had invited Manthri to Delhi several times to become part of the Shankar's Weekly. But Manthri was not willing to relocate to Delhi.

[[Todos los Santos Lake]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Chile, Geography of Los Lagos Region

Lake Todos los Santos (Spanish for "All Saints Lake") is a lake located in the Los Lagos Region of southern Chile, 96 km northeast of the regional capital Puerto Montt and 76 km east of Puerto Varas, within the boundaries of the Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park. It has a surface area of 178.5 km² and a maximum depth of 337 m. The Lake's National Park status has ensured protection to its environment. The catchment is largely covered with old-growth Valdivian temperate rain forests. The present form of the lake is the result of glacial and volcanic processes.
The main tributary of the lake is the Río Peulla/Río Negro, next to the Peulla locality. Its outflow at the Petrohué locality gives rise to the Petrohué River, with an average outflow of 270 m³ per second. Even though the lake has a regulating effect, it is subject to water level variations that may exceed 3 m and reflect in the discharge at the outflow. At a short distance from the Petrohué locality, the river flows through the Petrohué Waterfalls.
A regular road/boat transport service provides tourist transport between Puerto Montt/Puerto Varas in Chile and San Carlos de Bariloche on Nahuel Huapi Lake in Argentina. There are two main lake ports: Petrohué at the western end, and the village of Peulla at the eastern end; there is no road connecting these places. The lake is surrounded by steep mountains leaving only minor plains. Three snow-capped mountains are famous: the Osorno volcano in the west, the Puntiagudo to the north, and the Tronador to the east.
This lake has been known with various names in the past: Purailla, Pichilauquen, Quechocavi. In the tourist trade it is also known as Lago Esmeralda (Emerald Lake) due to the green color of its water. According to cloudiness and weather mood, the eye and the camera perceive the lake as green, blue or silvery.

[[Parvatibai Athavale]]
CATEGORIES: Indian humanitarians, Indian autobiographers, Indian women writers

Parvatibai Athavale was a close associate of Dr. Dhondo Keshav Karve, one of India's great social reformers. She made major contributions in social upliftment of women, particularly Hindu widows.
Parvatibai Athavale was born in 1870 in Devrukh, a small town in Kokan region on the west coast of India. Her maiden name was Miss Krishna Joshi. She was married at the young age of eleven with Mr. Mahadev Narayan Athavale. She gave birth to three children after her marriage but only one son (Mr. Narayan Mahadev Athavale) survived.
Later in her life, Parvatibai went to the U.S. to collect funds and donations for the widow education and upliftment, in associated with Karve. She herself became a widow early in life and had to shave off her head and stopped wearing any jewellery and took on the traditional dress of a Maharashtrian Brahmin widow, as was the tradition during those times. After working in the Widows Home, Parvatibai realised that if a change had to come, it had to be initiated by the widows themselves and to set an example, she decided to discard the signs of widowhood.  In 1912, she stopped shaving her head and gave up her widow's garb.  She says she was criticized a lot, but she did not give in to those insults.
Parvatibai Athavale has also penned down her autobiography, later translated in English by Justin E. Abbott and published in 1930, by the name of My Story: The Autobiography of a Hindu Widow,Athavale, Parvati, and Justin E. Abbott. 1930. My story: the autobiography of a Hindu widow.

The LRAC F1, officially called Lance-Roquettes AntiChar de 89 mm modèle F1 (89 mm anti-tank rocket launcher model F1) is a French reusable rocket launcher developed by Luchaire Defense SA, and manufactured in cooperation with Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Saint-Étienne and was in the 1970s marketed by Hotchkiss-Brandt.Luchaire produces the different rocket projectiles for the LRAC F1 and Manufacture Nationale-d'Armes de Saint Etienne the launcher - both firms are now part of GIAT Industries  It replaced the 89 mm M20A1 Super Bazooka in French Army service. Through the use of fiberglass and plastic in the launcher it is over 2 kg lighter when loaded than the M20A1 while having a greater effective range.  The LRAC FI is sometimes referred to as the STRIM 89mm antitank rocket launcher from the abbreviations for the private firm Societe Technique de Recherches Industrielles  de la Mecanique  that was contracted in 1964 by the French Ministry of Defence, to research a replacement for the M20A1 Super Bazooka.  In the early 1970s, two antitank weapons were placed in production for evaluation by the French Army to replace the M20A1: the 80mm ACL-APX, a recoilless cannon with a rocket assist projectile, and the 89mm LRAC F1 STRIM 89mm rocket launcher.  The STRIM design was chosen as the replacement for the M20A1 based on its higher penetration ability of its antitank ammunition and the much lower over all manufacturing costs compared to the 80mm ACL-APX system.edited by D.H.R. Archer "Jane's Infantry Weapons 1976" page 576-578The sight developed for the ACL-APX was adopted for the LRAC F1

The Battle of Osawatomie took place on August 30, 1856 when 250-300 Border Ruffians led by John W. Reid and Rev. Marvin White attacked the city of Osawatomie. John W. Reid was intent on destroying free state settlements and then moving on to Topeka and Lawrence to do more of the same. John Brown first got word that the group was coming when they shot his son Frederick. Brown with 40 or so men tried to defend the town against the pro-slavery partisans, causing heavy casualties before being forced to withdraw; the town of Osawatomie was then looted and burned. This was one event in series of skirmishes between abolitionists and pro-slavery Missourians in what has been known as Bleeding Kansas.

178P/Hug–Bell is a periodic comet in the solar system.

It was declared a comet less than two days after its initial discovery, after having its course confirmed on previous images.[tpl]cite web| publisher= ICSTARS Astronomy| title= Winter, Jennifer and Winter, Vic.

Hug-Bell's orbital period is about seven years; its orbit is eccentric, though less so than many comets. Hug-Bell's orbit lies entirely outside the orbit of Mars, but at its aphelion overlaps in solar distance with the orbit of Jupiter.  Because it never comes closer to the sun than about 2 AU, it is never expected to be a very bright comet, with a typical perihelion magnitude of 18-19.[tpl]cite web| publisher= Seiichi Yoshida July 21, 2006.| title= 178P/Hug-Bell (1999).  |url=http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/0178P/1999X1.html | accessdate=2006-10-18[/tpl]

Nitish Katara was a 25-year-old Indian business executive in Delhi, who was murdered in the early hours of 17 February 2002, by Vikas Yadav the son of influential criminal-politician D. P. Yadav. Nitish had recently graduated from the Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad, where, he had fallen in love with his classmate, Bharti Yadav, sister of Vikas.
The trial court held that Nitish's murder was an honour killing because the family did not approve their relationship. Vikas and Vishal Yadav were later found guilty by the trial Court and awarded life sentence on 30 May 2008.State vs. Vikas Yadav & Vishal Yadav, S.C. No. 78/2002 On April 2, 2014, Delhi High Court upheld the Trial Court verdict of life imprisonment to the accused.Vishal Yadav vs. State of U.P., Crl.A. 741/2008
The Yadav family never approved of the relationship between the two, and Katara received threats several times. However, he was an idealist, and believed in "standing up to injustice". On the night of 17 February 2002, the couple attended a common friend's wedding, where Yadavs's brother, Vikas, and a cousin were present as well. From there, Katara was taken for a drive by Yadav's brother Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav, and never returned. Three days later, Katara's body was found beside the highway; he had been battered to death with a hammer, diesel poured on him, and set aflame. Dr T D Dogra collected the blood samples of parents for DNA profiling to establish the identity of deceased Nithish Katara at AIIMS New Delhi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/33215738/Judgement-Nitish-Katara|title=Judgement Nitish Katara murder case|publisher=Delhi Court|accessdate=23 February 2013[/tpl]

The cardueline finches are a subfamily, Carduelinae, one of at least three subfamilies of the finch family Fringillidae, the others being the Fringillinae and the Euphoniinae. The Hawaiian honeycreepers are usually now considered in this subfamily.Groth, 2001, pp. 552–553 Cardueline finches are specialised to eating seeds, and unlike most passerine birds, they feed their young mostly on seeds, which are regurgitated.Newton, 1973, p. 31 Besides this, they differ from the other finches in some minor details of their skull. They are adept at opening seeds and clinging to stems, unlike other granivorous birds, such as sparrows and buntings, which feed mostly on fallen seeds.Groth, 2001, p. 557 Some members of this subfamily are further specialised to feed on a particular type of seed, such as cones, in the case of crossbills. Carduelines forage in flocks throughout the year, rather than keeping territories, and males defend their females rather than a territory or nest.Groth, 2001, p. 558
The following genera are those usually considered the Carduelinae:

The West Hill Cliff Railway, or West Hill Lift, is a funicular railway located in the English seaside town of Hastings. It runs largely in tunnel, and provides access to Hastings Castle and St Clement's Caves from George Street, on the town's sea front. The West Hill overlooks the sea to the south, the Old Town to the east, and the current central business district of Hastings to the west.[tpl]cite web | title = Hastings East & West Hill Railways | publisher = The Heritage Trail | url = http://www.theheritagetrail.co.uk/cliff_trams/hastings.htm | accessdate = 2009-05-14[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The line is owned and operated by Hastings Borough Council and has the following technical parameters:[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.funiculars.net/line.php?id=60 | title = West hill | publisher = Funiculars.net | accessdate = 2009-05-12[/tpl]
Construction of the line was started in 1889 by a private operator, the Hastings Lift Company. The line met with local opposition, which meant that the work took longer to complete than originally envisaged, and construction costs were over 50% higher than envisaged. The line finally opened in 1891, and was originally powered by a gas engine.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hows.org.uk/personal/rail/hast.htm | title = Hastings Cliff Railways | work = Funicular Railways of the UK | accessdate = 2009-05-12[/tpl]
The first operator went bankrupt in 1894, probably as a result of the construction delays and cost overrun. The Hastings Passenger Lift Company took over and operated the line until 1947, when Hastings Borough Council bought the line. It was converted to electric operation in 1971. To mark the railway's centenary year, the line was fully refurbished in 1991.
The West Hill Lift is complemented by the East Hill Cliff Lift, giving visitors access to Hastings Country Park.

[[Ankober (woreda)]]
CATEGORIES: Amhara Region, Districts of Ethiopia

Ankober is one of the woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Located at the eastern edge of the Ethiopian highlands in the Semien Shewa Zone, Ankober is bordered on the south by Asagirt, on the west by Basona Werana, on the north by Termaber, and on the east by the Afar Region. Towns in Ankober include Aliyu Amba, Ankober, Gorgo and Haramba.
Roads in this Ankober include one built in June 1985 to link the village of Dinki with the rest of the woreda, as part of a "Food-for-Work" program to help victims of the 1984-1985 famine. Until the road was completed, Dinki could only be reached by a two-day mule ride from Debre Berhan down steep mountain slopes. Three years after the road had been completed, two water mills had been established at the village, as well as new fruit plantations and the traditional cotton spinning and weaving industry had been revived.Patrick Webb and Joachim von Braun, Famine and Food Security in Ethiopia: Lessons for Africa (Chichester: John Wiley and Sons, 1994), pp. 60, 107, 113f

The Rooftop Singers were an American progressive folk-singing trio in the early 1960s, best known for the hit "Walk Right In". The group was composed of Erik Darling and Bill Svanoe (vocals, guitar) with former jazz singer Lynne Taylor (vocals). 
Darling put the group together in June 1962 specifically to record an updated and uptempo version of a 1929 Gus Cannon folk blues song, "Walk Right In". The trio recorded the song for Vanguard Records, with updated lyrics and an arrangement featuring paired 12-string acoustic guitars. The record became the most successful in Vanguard's history.[tpl]cite web |first= |last= |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2119|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Biography by Bruce Eder |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=9 April 2009[/tpl]
In the U.S., the song was #1  for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1963.Bronson, Fred (2003). The Billboard Book of #1 Hits, 5th Edition (Billboard Publications) It spent five weeks atop the Easy Listening chart, which would later become known as the Adult Contemporary chart.Hyatt, Wesley (1999). The Billboard Book of #1 Adult Contemporary Hits (Billboard Publications) In addition, "Walk Right In" reached both the R&B chart (peaking at #4) as well as the country music chart (peaking at #23). The song reached #1 in Australia on the Kent Music Report in 1963, and it made the Top 10 on the UK Singles Chart in the United Kingdom, peaking at #10.http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=3354[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl] The recording sold over one million copies, gaining gold disc status.
The album that contained this song was also called Walk Right In, and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Folk Recording category.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] The group was more influenced by ragtime, blues, and songster material than contemporaneous folk groups such as The Weavers, which Darling belonged to until just before he formed the Rooftop Singers. They were also less overtly political.
The group played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963. Vanguard released several further singles ,the most successful being "Tom Cat" (#20 in May of '63). Yielding to pressure from her husband, Taylor left the trio shortly after Vanguard released the group's second album, Good Time!. Darling and Svanoe then recruited Mindy Stuart to replace her. This line-up recorded one final album, Rainy River. Patricia Street replaced Stuart shortly before the Rooftop Singers formally disbanded in 1967. Darling and Street continued working as a duo into the early seventies, recording the album The Possible Dream for Vanguard.
Lynne Taylor (born in 1928) died in 1982 at age 54, and Erik Darling died on August 3, 2008, aged 74, in Chapel Hill,
North Carolina, from Burkitt's lymphoma.

[[Tension (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Music theory, Musical analysis

In music, tension is the perceived need for relaxation or release created by a listener's expectations. For example, dissonance may give way to consonance. Tension may also be produced through reiteration, increase in dynamic level, or gradual motion to a higher pitch.Kliewer, Vernon (1975). "Melody: Linear Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music", Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music, p. 290. Wittlich, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall. ISBN 0-13-049346-5.

The balance between tension and repose may be explored in musical analysis, for it is determined by the contrasts which are, "of great interest to the style analyst," and may be analyzed in several, even conflicting layers, as different musical elements such as harmony may have different levels of tension than rhythm and melody.White, John D.

[[Options spread]]

CATEGORIES: Options (finance), Derivatives (finance)

Options spreads are the basic building blocks of many options trading strategies. A spread position is entered by buying and selling equal number of options of the same class on the same underlying security but with different strike prices or expiration dates.
The three main classes of spreads are the horizontal spread, the vertical spread and the diagonal spread. They are grouped by the relationships between the strike price and expiration dates of the options involved.
Vertical spreads, or money spreads, are spreads involving options of the same underlying security, same expiration month, but at different strike prices.
Horizontal, calendar spreads, or time spreads are created using options of the same underlying security, same strike prices but with different expiration dates.
Diagonal spreads are constructed using options of the same underlying security but different strike prices and expiration dates. They are called diagonal spreads because they are a combination of vertical and horizontal spreads.

"Walk Right In" is the title of a country blues song written by musician Gus Cannon and originally recorded by Cannon's Jug Stompers in 1929, released on Victor Records, catalogue 38611.Samuel Charters. The Country Blues. New York:  Da Capo Press, 1975, p. 124. It was reissued on album in 1959 as a track on The Country Blues.
In 1962, the American folk trio The Rooftop Singers recorded a version of the song and released it as a single. The single spent two weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1963.Bronson, Fred (2003).  "Walk Right In", in The Billboard Book of #1 Hits, 5th Edition.  New York:  Billboard Publications. It spent five weeks atop the Easy Listening chart, which would later become known as the Adult Contemporary chart.Hyatt, Wesley (1999).  "Walk Right In", in The Billboard Book of #1 Adult Contemporary Hits.  New York:  Billboard Publications. In addition, "Walk Right In" reached both the R&B chart (peaking at #4) as well as the country music chart, peaking at #23. The song reached #1 in Australia on the Kent Music Report in 1963, and it made the Top 10 on the UK Singles Chart in the United Kingdom, peaking at #10.UK Singles Chart info at chartstats.com The song was included on the album Walk Right In, and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Folk Recording.
Group member Erik Darling recruited two friends to record a folk version of "Walk Right In" after hearing the original Cannon recording. Darling wanted the record to have a distinctive sound, so he and group member Bill Svanoe both played twelve string guitars on the song, although they had some difficulty in acquiring the instruments. Darling is quoted as saying that prior to the making of this record, "you couldn't buy a 12-string guitar...I ordered one from the Gibson Company, but in order to record song with two 12-strings, we had to wait for the company to build a second one for Bill!" (a left-handed model). The success of the song was a boon to Cannon, who was in his late 70s and had been forced to pawn his banjo the previous winter to pay his heating bill; he received royalties as a songwriter and saw renewed interest in his music, which led to a recording contract of his own.
Other acts who have recorded or performed "Walk Right In" include Chet Atkins, Sammy Davis, Jr., Ella Fitzgerald, Earl Grant, Al Hirt,Al Hirt, Live at Carnegie Hall Retrieved April 11, 2013. Jan & Dean, Janis Joplin, Jerry Lee Lewis, Trini Lopez, the Johnny Mann Singers, Otis Taylor, Carolina Chocolate Drops, The Ventures, Yvonne Elliman, and Dr. Hook. The Rooftop Singers' version appears on the soundtrack to the Tom Hanks film Forrest Gump. Roger Branigin's campaign adapted the song en route to his eventual victory in the 1964 Indiana gubernatorial race.

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Sarawak

Ba'kelalan is a group of nine villages in the Bario Highlands of Sarawak, Malaysia about [tpl]convert|3000|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level and 4 km from the border with Indonesian Kalimantan. The villagers belong to the Lun Bawang tribe. The villages are Buduk Nur, Long Langai, Long Lemumut, Long Ritan, Long Rusu, Pa Tawing, Buduk Bui, Buduk Aru and Long Rangat.
The name Ba’Kelalan is derived from the Kelalan River and Ba’ which means wet lands in the Lun Bawang language. Its population is about 1203 but as many as 8000 call it home. In the cool mountain climate, temperate fruits such as apples, mandarin oranges and vanilla are grown. The area also produces rice, and mountain salt is obtained from the nearby hills. The people in Ba'Kelalan are Christian, members of the Sidang Injil Borneo, and rice production has doubled since the prohibition of alcohol.
Ba'kelalan Airport has flights to Bario and to Lawas using 19-seater DHT aircraft. Road access is possible via a 125 km former logging trail from Lawas using four-wheel-drive vehicles, but the road conditions can be particularly bad in the rainy season and the journey takes at least six hours. However, in September 2009 the federal government of Malaysia approved RM50 million for the first construction phase of a road from Lawas to Ba’Kelalan to facilitate access.
Tourism has increased in recent years: Ba'kelalan now has a 9-hole natural golf course, and the settlement is also the easiest point of access for visits to Kayan Mentarang National Park in Krayan, Kalimantan.

[[Taskscape]]

CATEGORIES: Anthropology, Urban studies and planning terminology

The term taskscape is often credited to social anthropologist Tim Ingold. As Ingold has described the term: "just as the landscape is an array of related features, so – by analogy – the taskscape is an array of related activities." Taskscape, then is a socially constructed space of human activity, understood as having spatial boundaries and delimitations for the purposes of analysis. Of key importance, is that taskscape as well as landscape, is to be considered as perpetually in process rather than in a static or otherwise immutable state.
Tim Ingold coined the term in his 1993 articleIngold, Tim. (1993) "The Temporality of the Landscape", World Archaeology, 25(2): pp. 152-174 defining the spatial and temporal dimensions of the landscape in human life. He considers it as a methodological structure and analyses the temporality of the landscape in Pieter Bruegel's famous painting, The Harvesters.

Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. It is known only from Mount Talang in Sumatra, to which N. talangensis is endemic. Nepenthes talangensis was only described as a distinct species in 1994.Nerz, J. & A. Wistuba 1994. Five new taxa of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from North and West Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 23(4): 101–114. Prior to this it was placed within N. bongso and some of the older literature identifies this hybrid as N. bongso × N. inermis.
Nepenthes inermis × N. talangensis has been the subject of taxonomic confusion in the past. In an article published in 1973 on the Nepenthes of Borneo, Singapore, and Sumatra, botanist Shigeo Kurata incorrectly identified specimens of this hybrid  as belonging to N. dubia.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia.  Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.
In 1997, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek published their monograph "A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)", in which they referred to N. dubia plant material from Mount Talang (Kurata s.n. SING). Charles Clarke later identified Kurata s.n. as representing N. inermis × N. talangensis.
The natural hybrid is similar to N. dubia, but can be distinguished on the basis of several stable characters. The hybrid has a wider pitcher lid that is never relfexed beyond 90 degrees and the pitcher cup is not appressed in the lower parts as in N. dubia. In addition, the mouth of N. inermis × N. talangensis is raised towards the back as opposed to being horizontal.
In 2001, Kurata described this hybrid as a new species, N. pyriformis. Clarke rejected this interpretation in his monograph Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, published the same year. Clarke found that the type specimen of N. pyriformis, Kurata & Mikil 4230 NDC, matches the appearance of N. inermis × N. talangensis "in most respects". Following Clarke's interpretation, Kurata excluded N. pyriformis from his list of Nepenthes species the following year.Kurata, S. 2002.

CATEGORIES: Meropidae

Nyctyornis is a genus of the bee-eaters, near passerine birds in the family Meropidae. There are just two members of this group, which occur in tropical south and southeatern Asia.
The genus is basal and forms a sister group to the remaining members of the bee-eater family.Marks, BD; J.D. Weckstein, R.G. Moyle, 2007. Molecular phylogenetics of the bee-aters (Aves: Meropidae) based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence data. Molecular Phylogenetics & Evolution 45(1):23-32.
Like other bee-eaters, Nyctyornis species are colourful birds with long tails, long downturned bills and pointed wings. They are large bee-eaters (Blue-bearded is the largest of all bee-eaters), predominantly green, with a face colour as indicated by the species' name. This colour extends on to the slightly hanging throat feathers to form the “beard”.
Like other bee-eaters, they predominantly eat  insects, especially bees, wasps and  hornets, which are caught in the air, but they have a quite different strategy. They hunt alone or in pairs, rather than in flocks, and sit motionless for long periods before pursuing their prey. Blue-bearded will also clamber in foliage for insects, and bees are sometimes attract by the bright blue beard of a perched bird, presumably mistaking it for a flower. 
Their size and more rounded wings gives  Nyctyornis species a heavier flapping flight less graceful than that of the 'Merops'' genus
Like other bee-eaters, they nest in burrows tunneled into the side of sandy banks, but do not form colonies.

[[Intermeshing rotors]]

CATEGORIES: Rotorcraft, Helicopter components

Intermeshing rotors on a helicopter are a set of two rotors turning in opposite directions, with each rotor mast mounted with a slight angle to the other, in a transversely symmetrical manner, so that the blades intermesh without colliding. The arrangement allows the helicopter to function without a tail rotor, which saves power. However, neither rotor lifts directly vertically, which reduces efficiency per each rotor. The overall design compared to the more familiar main rotor + tail rotor design can exceed, equal, or fall short of single-rotor designs in various metrics (carrying capacity vs. hp; turn radius; rotor radius; disk loading).
This configuration is sometimes referred to as a synchropter.
Yaw is accomplished through varying torque, which is done by increasing collective pitch on one of the blade sets. 
Most intermeshing designs have two blades per mast.  Exceptions include the Kellett XR-10, among others. 
The arrangement was developed in Germany by Anton Flettner for a small anti-submarine warfare helicopter, the Flettner Fl 265 and later the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri. During the Cold War the American Kaman Aircraft company produced the HH-43 Huskie, for USAF firefighting purposes. One example of the Kaman K-225 experimental synchropter was fitted with a small turboshaft engine in late 1951, becoming the world's first gas turbine powered helicopter. Intermeshing rotored helicopters have high stability and powerful lifting capability. The latest Kaman K-MAX model is a dedicated sky crane design used for construction work.

[[Cover slip]]
CATEGORIES: Microscopy, Laboratory glassware

A cover slip, coverslip or cover glass is a thin flat piece of transparent material, usually square or rectangular, about 20 mm (4/5 in) wide and a fraction of a millimetre thick, that is placed over objects for viewing with a microscope.  The object is usually held between the cover slip and a somewhat thicker microscope slide, which rests on the microscope's stage or slide holder and provides the physical support for the object and slip.
The main function of the cover slip is to keep solid specimens pressed flat, and liquid samples shaped into a flat layer of even thickness.  This is necessary because high-resolution microscopes have a very narrow region within which they focus.
The cover glass often has several other functions.  It holds the specimen in place (either by the weight of the cover slip or, in the case of a wet mount, by surface tension) and protects the specimen from dust and accidental contact. It protects the microscope's objective lens from contacting the specimen and vice-versa; in oil immersion microscopy or water immersion microscopy the cover slip prevents contact between the immersion liquid and the specimen. The cover slip can be glued to the slide so as to seal off the specimen, retarding dehydration and oxidation of the specimen. Microbial and cell cultures can be grown directly on the cover slip before it is placed on the slide, and specimens may be permanently mounted on the slip instead of on the slide.[ref]

Systems immunology is a recent research field that, under the larger umbrella of systems biology, aims to study the immune system in the more integrated perspective on how entities and players participate at different system levels to the immune function.
The immune system has been thoroughly analyzed as regards to its components and function by using a very successful "reductionist" approach, but its overall functioning principles cannot easily be predicted by studying the properties of its isolated components because they strongly rely on and arise from the interactions among these numerous constituents. Systems immunology represents a different approach for the integrated comprehension of the immune system structure and function based on complex systems theory, high-throughput techniques, as well as on mathematical and computational tools.

Sonic Dream Collective was a Swedish pop band from the city of Uppsala. They had their greatest success in 1995 with the song “Oh, Baby All” which topped the Swedish national radio P3 Tracks chart. The debut album “Gravity” was also released the same year (1997 in the US).
Members of the band were singer Linn Engström, songwriter Jon Hällgren and producer Anders Wågberg.
Between 1994 and 1997 the band had their own record label Flying Duck Music together with producer Stefan Warnberg.
A close collaboration was soon established with Giovanni Sconfienza and the record label Remixed Records where the second and final album “Dustproof” was released in 1998. By then the name had been shortened to Sonic Dream.
"Dustproof" also featured a collaboration with American guitarist Raven Storm, who was recording his album at the Flying Duck studios.  Hearing Storm's playing, Wågberg decided to add a rock element to their music.  Storm recorded several guitar solos and rhythm guitar parts, but most of it, including all of the solos, were left out of the final cut due to the producers' reluctance to change the musical formula.  Storm is featured most prominently on the song "Colors of the Wind."
Their song "Love" is used in one of the Dancemania soundtracks and on Dance Dance Revolution 2nd ReMIX.

His story is told in Judges 9:26-41.“Judges 9:26-41” Gaal had occupied Shechem and boasted to Zebul, the ruler of Shechem, that he could defeat Abimelech. Zebul warned Abimelech of Gaal's plans and offered a plan to defeat Gaal. Abimelech defeated Gaal and drove him back to the gates of Shechem. Zebul subsequently drove Gaal and his remaining kinsmen from Shechem altogether. He is not mentioned thereafter in the Bible. 
Daniel I. Block suggests that he may have been one of the "Lords of Shechem", but had previously gone into exile, being unwilling to support Abimelech.Daniel I. Block, Judges, Ruth: An Exegetical and Theological Exposition of Holy Scripture, p. 325.

Glare is caused by a significant ratio of luminance between the task (that which is being looked at) and the glare source. Factors such as the angle between the task and the glare source and eye adaptation have significant impacts on the experience of glare.

[[Empress Li Zu'e]]

CATEGORIES: Northern Qi empresses, Northern Qi Buddhists, Northern Wei Buddhists, Northern Zhou Buddhists, Sui Dynasty Buddhists, Chinese Buddhist nuns

Empress Li Zu'e (李祖娥) was an empress of the Chinese dynasty Northern Qi, known at times semi-formally as Empress Zhaoxin (昭信皇后) (due to her residence being Zhaoxin Palace).  Her husband was Emperor Wenxuan (Gao Yang).
Li Zu'e was the daughter of Li Xizong (李希宗), and she was from Zhao Commandery (趙郡, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei).  She was ethnically Han.  The date that she married Gao Yang, the second son of Eastern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan, is not known, but it is known that at that time, he was the Duke of Taiyuan during the reign of his brother-in-law, Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei—and she carried the title of Duchess of Taiyuan.  She bore him two sons, Gao Yin, and Gao Shaode (高紹德).  In 549, Gao Yang took over the regency of Eastern Wei after his older brother, Gao Cheng, was assassinated by the servant Lan Jing (蘭京).  In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi (as Emperor Wenxuan).
Emperor Wenxuan, before he became emperor, also had another key consort—his concubine Lady Duan, the sister of his cousin and the powerful official Duan Shao (段韶).  (Duan Shao was born of Gao Yang's aunt, but it is not clear that Lady Duan shared the same mother, so it is not clear whether Lady Duan was his cousin.)  The officials Gao Longzhi (高隆之) and Gao Dezheng (高德政), wanting to ingratiate themselves with Duan Shao, suggested that a Han woman should not be allowed to be empress.  Emperor Wenxuan rejected their suggestion and created Li Zu'e empress, and only created Lady Duan an imperial consort.  Emperor Wenxuan also created Empress Li's son Gao Yin crown prince.  Emperor Wenxuan was violent and capricious in his behavior, fueled by his alcoholism, and often beat his consorts, although he never touched Li Zu'e.  Once, when visiting Empress Li's household, he fired an arrow at Empress Li's mother, stating, 'When I am drunk, I do not even recognize my own mother.  Who do you think you are?"  However, despite Emperor Wenxuan's violent behavior—which included battering his concubines and sometimes even killing them—he remained respectful of Empress Li herself.  In 559, he also began to have her referred to as both Kehedun (可賀頓, the Tujue title for empresses) and empress.
Emperor Wenxuan died in 559, and Gao Yin succeeded to the throne as Emperor Fei.  Empress Li became empress dowager.  However, the political climate of the time was uncertain, as there were suspicions that Emperor Wenxuan's mother, Grand Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun, would encourage her sons Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan or Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang to seize the throne.  The prime minister Yang Yin, believing that the young Emperor Fei was being endangered, discussed a plan with Empress Dowager Li to gradually strip Gao Yan and Gao Dan of power.  Empress Li discussed the plan with one of Gao Cheng's widow consorts, Li Changyi (李昌儀), who was her good friend coming from the same clan of Li. Li Changyi subsequently revealed the plan to Grand Empress Dowager Lou, who in turn relayed the news to Gao Yan and Gao Dan.  The two princes responded by arresting and executing Yang and his associates Kezhuhun Daoyuan (可朱渾道元), Song Qindao (宋欽道), and Yan Zixian (燕子獻).  Gao Yan and Gao Dan took over the reins of government, and Empress Dowager Li lost her remaining authority.  Six months later, by Grand Empress Dowager Lou's decree, Emperor Fei was deposed, and Gao Yan became emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhao).  Empress Dowager Li lost her empress dowager title, and became known as Empress Zhaoxin, because she resided at Zhaoxin Palace.  In 561, Emperor Xiaozhao killed her son Gao Yin the former emperor.
Emperor Xiaozhao died in 561, and Gao Dan became emperor (as Emperor Wucheng).  Some time after Emperor Wucheng's taking the throne, he began to force Empress Li to have a sexual relationship with him—threatening her that he would kill her son Gao Shaode if she did not agree.  Eventually, she became pregnant, and in shame, she began to refuse seeing Gao Shaode.  Gao Shaode found out that she was pregnant and became indignant.  In shame, when she bore a daughter in 562, she threw the infant away, causing the child's death.  When Emperor Wucheng found out, he became angry, and he stated, "Because you killed my daughter, I will kill your son."  He summoned Gao Shaode and, in her presence, beat him to death with the hilt of a sword.  She cried bitterly, and Emperor Wucheng, in anger, stripped her and pounded her.  She suffered severe injuries, but eventually recovered, and Emperor Wucheng expelled her from the palace to be a Buddhist nun.
In 577, Northern Qi was destroyed by its rival, Northern Zhou.  Empress Li followed the Emperor Wucheng's son Gao Wei, the penultimate emperor, to the Northern Zhou capital Chang'an, where the members of Northern Qi's imperial Gao clan were slaughtered later that year.  After Northern Zhou's own destruction in 581, Emperor Wen of Sui permitted her to leave Chang'an, and she returned to her home in Zhao Commandery.  Nothing further is known about her, including the date of her death.

John of St. Thomas, (family name João Poinsot or Johannes Poinsot, since the 1980s in American texts also John Poinsot; 9 June 1589 – 17 June 1644), was a theologian and philosopher, born at Lisbon.
Of noble parentage, he was sent early to the University of Coimbra, displayed talents of the first order, completed his humanities and philosophy, and obtained the degree of Master of Arts. He then entered the University of Louvain. Here, too, he showed remarkable ability, and won the title of Bachelor of Theology at an early age. He joined the Dominicans at Madrid in 1612 or 1613, taking the name of John of St. Thomas, by which he is known to history. As professor of philosophy and theology in a monastery at Alcalá, he soon took rank among the most learned men of the time, and was placed successively (1630 and 1640) in charge of the two principal chairs of theology in the university of that city. His renown drew the largest number of scholars that had ever attended its theological faculties.
No man enjoyed a greater reputation in Spain, or was more frequently consulted on points of doctrine and ecclesiastical matters. His theological and philosophical writings, which have gone through many editions, are among the best expositions of Thomas Aquinas's doctrine, of which he is acknowledged to be one of the foremost interpreters. Though he took an active part in the scholastic discussions of his times, his courtesy was such that he is said never to have hurt an opponent's feelings. So faithful was he to the traditions of his order and the principles of the Angelic Doctor that in his last illness he could declare that, in all the thirty years he had devoted to teaching and writing, he had not taught or written anything contrary to St. Thomas. His humility and his devotion to education caused him to refuse many dignities offered him by the Church and his order. In 1643 Philip IV offered him the office of royal confessor, a position which only religious obedience could induce him to accept. His writings comprise: Cursus philosophicus Thomisticus (9 vols.); Cursus Theologici (9 vols.), which is a commentary on the Summa Theologica of St. Thomas; Tractatus de Approbatione, Auctoritate, et Puritate Doctrinae D. Thomae Aquinatis; A Compendium of Christian Doctrine (in Spanish); and A Treatise on a Happy Death (in Spanish), written at the command of Philip IV.Quétif and Echard, Scriptores Ord.

[[Chief privacy officer]]

CATEGORIES: Business and financial operations occupations, Corporate governance, Management occupations

The Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) is a senior level executive within a business or organization who is responsible for managing the risks and business impacts of privacy laws and policies. The CPO position is  relatively new and was created to respond to both consumer concern over the use of personal information, including medical data and financial information, and laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, legislation concerning the protection of patient medical records (e.g., The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA) and the use and safeguarding of consumer financial and banking transactions (e.g., The Fair Credit Reporting Act and its Disposal Rule, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its Safeguards Rule and Financial Privacy Rule). 
It comes from the "Privacy Officer" created by European legislation on personal data ; first "Privacy officer" position was created in Germany in the 1970s (Datenschutzbeauftragter).
In the United States, the position was first established at the Internet advertising firm AllAdvantage in August 1999, when it appointed privacy lawyer Ray Everett-Church to the newly created position, starting a trend that quickly spread among major corporations, both offline and online. The role of the Chief Privacy Officer was solidified within the U.S. corporate world in November 2000 with the naming of Harriet Pearson as Chief Privacy Officer for IBM Corporation. That event prompted one influential analyst to declare, "the chief privacy officer is a trend whose time has come." news.com IBM appoints chief privacy officer
By 2001, the non-profit research organization Privacy and American Business reported that a significant number of Fortune 500 firms had appointed senior executives with the title or role of Chief Privacy Officer. The growth of the Chief Privacy Officer trend was further fueled by the European Union's passage in the late 1990s of data privacy laws and regulations that included a requirement for all corporations to have an individual designated to be accountable for privacy compliance.
By 2002, the position of Chief Privacy Officer and similar privacy-related management positions were sufficiently widespread to support the creation of professional societies and trade associations to promote training and certification programs. In 2002 the largest of these organizations, the Privacy Officers Association and the Association of Corporate Privacy Officers, merged to form the International Association of Privacy Officers, which was later renamed the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Today the IAPP holds several conferences and training seminars each year around the world, hosting thousands of association members spanning hundreds of major global corporations and government agencies, with hundreds of executives seeking certification programs in privacy management practices.

Speechless was recorded in France, Switzerland and the United States, and featured Frith with French Rock in Opposition group Etron Fou Leloublan on the first side of the LP, and Frith's New York City band Massacre on the second. It is mostly a studio album with extracts from a Massacre concert mixed into four of the tracks on side two of the LP.
Speechless has been described as a mixture of folk music, free improvisation, avant-rock and noise. Allmusic said that it is often regarded as one of Frith's best solo albums.

The Lambrettas are an English mod revival band, first active in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Named after the iconic Italian Lambretta scooter brand popular among Mods, the band was formed in Lewes. Their original line-up consisted of Jez Bird (singer/guitarist), Doug Sanders (guitarist/vocalist), Mark Ellis (bassist) and Paul Wincer (drummer).
Their biggest hit was in 1980, with a cover version of the 1950s Leiber and Stoller song, "Poison Ivy", which reached #7 in the UK Singles Chart. They scored a #12 hit with the follow-up, "Da-a-a-nce". In the same year, they released the album Beat Boys in the Jet Age, which reached #28 on the UK Albums Chart, and scored another minor hit single single, "Another Day (Another Girl)" (hastily renamed from "Page 3" after complaints from The Sun newspaper. After the Mod revival faded, subsequent singles, which included a 1982 cover of Jefferson Airplane's "Somebody to Love", and a second album, 1981's Ambience, were commercial failures. The band played their final concert in their original incarnation in London on 14 April 1982. Bird re-formed the band for a time in the 1990s.
The band reformed in 2009 and are touring the UK and Europe.

As of early 2009, crewed flights for NASA Project Constellation missions were planned to begin around 2014; an independent assessment by the Augustine Commission estimated that this would not occur until 2017-2019. The first launch of the suborbital Ares I-X launch system was in October, 2009, with a second test launch scheduled for 2012. However, on February 1, 2010, President Obama announced a proposal to cancel the Constellation program with the U.S. 2011 fiscal year budget.
Tests of the Launch Abort System were conducted in 2010.
The test flight of Ares V was planned for 2018, with lunar return flights beginning in 2019; the Augustine Commission estimated this would not actually occur until the late 2020s.

[[Captodative effect]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical reactions, Free radicals

The captodative effect involves the stabilization of radicals by the synergistic effect of an electron-withdrawing and an electron-donating group substituent in free radical reactions.[tpl]cite journal|last1 = Viehe|first1 = H. G.|first2 = Z.|last2 = Janousek|first3 = R.|last3 = Merényi|first4 = L.|last4 = Stella|title = The Captodative Effect|journal = Accounts of Chemical Research|year = 1985|volume = 18|pages = 148–154|doi = 10.1021/ar00113a004|issue = 5[/tpl] The name originates as the electron-withdrawing group (EWG) is sometimes called the "captor" group, whilst the electron-donating group (EDG) is the "dative" substituent. Olefins with this substituent pattern are sometime described as captodative.[tpl]cite book|title = Concise Dictionary of Chemistry|publisher = V&S Publishers|year = 2012|isbn = 9789381588628|page = 51|url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=LflaqbSX1xAC&pg=PA51&dq=captodative+effect&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fNu2UqeFBMm0kgXVgoHIDw&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=captodative%20effect&f=false[/tpl] Radical reactions play an integral role in several chemical reactions and are also important to the field of polymer science.
When EDGs and EWGs are near the radical center, the stability of the radical center increases. The substituents can kinetically stabilize radical centers by preventing molecules and other radical centers from reacting with the center. The substituents thermodynamically stabilize the center by delocalizing the radical ion via resonance.[tpl]cite book|title = Modern Physical Organic Chemistry|year = 2006|publisher = University Science Books|location = Sausalito, CA|isbn = 9781891389313|first1 = E.

Two Romanian armies, the Third and the Fourth, were involved in the Battle of Stalingrad, helping to protect the northern and southern flanks respectively of the German 6th Army as it tried to conquer the city of Stalingrad, defended by  the Soviet Red Army in mid to late 1942. Overpowered and poorly equipped, these forces were unable to stop the Soviet November offensive which punched through both flanks and left the 6th Army encircled in Stalingrad. The Romanians suffered enormous losses, which effectively ended their offensive capability on the Eastern Front for the remainder of the war.

[[Comadre (band)]]
CATEGORIES: Musical groups from the San Francisco Bay Area

Comadre was a screamo band from Redwood City, California, composed of former members of Heartcrosslove, One's Own Ruin, What Life Makes Us, and Light This City. Their sound is a shoot-off of hardcore and punk, played fast and chaotic with an abundance of energy, but with a large focus on melody and tunefulness as well. Their influences can perhaps best be shown by the covers the band has performed live, by groups such as Rites of Spring, Refused, Kid Dynamite, and Suicide File.
After playing a handful of shows and releasing a three-song demo under the moniker Coffin, the band changed their name to Comadre in the fall of 2004. The word "comadre," in addition to being loosely translated as "godmother," is a slang term for anyone not related by blood being a part of another's family.
Since their formation, the band has released four LPs and one EP on their own Bloodtown Recordings, Dood Records, Cosmic Note Records in Japan, and ADAGIO830 Records in Europe. They have toured the United States and Japan extensively - in America most commonly with Los Angeles-based "cinema-grind" band Graf Orlock, and in Japan with hardcore band Endzweck.
The band has also released a series of mixtapes, which feature collaborations with other bands.

The Caspian expeditions of the Rus' were military raids undertaken by the Rus' between 864 and 1041 on the Caspian Sea shores.Logan (1992), p. 201 Initially, the Rus' appeared in Serkland in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids took place in the late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged Gorgan, in the territory of present day Iran, and the adjacent areas, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by Khazar Muslims in the Volga Delta, and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes on the middle Volga.
During their next expedition in 943, the Rus' captured Bardha'a, the capital of Arran, in the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan. The Rus' stayed there for several months, killing many inhabitants of the city and amassing substantial plunder. It was only an outbreak of dysentery among the Rus' that forced them to depart with their spoils. Sviatoslav, prince of Kiev, commanded the next attack, which destroyed the Khazar state in 965. Sviatoslav's campaign established the Rus's hold on the north-south trade routes, helping to alter the demographics of the region. Raids continued through the time period with the last Scandinavian attempt to reestablish the route to the Caspian Sea taking place in 1041 by Ingvar the Far-Travelled.

J. A. van Aalst (14 October 1858, Namur - after 1914) was a Belgian customs and postal officer in China, known for chronicling the history of Chinese music and dance.
Van Aalst was a government administrator for the Chinese Imperial Government of the Qing Dynasty, who served in China during the late 19th century.  While providing service as a government official, he chronicled the history of Chinese music and dance, serving as the primary source in the western world of Chinese music until other sources emerged in the 1950s.  His most famous text is Chinese Music which was published in 1884 in Shanghai by the Statistical Dept of the Inspectorate General.  Van Aalst was an official in the employ of what later came to be called the Chinese Maritime Customs Service and was during his tenure called the Imperial Maritime Customs Service. He was appointed to Postal Secretary in 1899. His boss, Sir Robert Hart, was also a music lover, creator of one of the first brass bands in China.
The Italian composer, Giacomo Puccini, used Van Aalst's text as a primary source for the Chinese musical portion of his opera, Turandot, which was first performed in 1912 and set to Carlo Gozzi's play of the same name.

Felix Greene (21 May 1909—June 15, 1985) was a British-American journalist who chronicled several Communist countries in the 1960s and 1970s.
He was one of the first Western reporters to visit North Vietnam when he traveled there for the San Francisco Chronicle in the 1960s. Some of his material has been reproduced for A-Level history, within the Vietnam War topic.
Born in England, Greene first visited China for the BBC in 1957. He later produced documentary films, including One Man's China, Tibet, Cuba va!,, Vietnam! Vietnam! and Inside North Viet Nam. These films has been accused of giving a very rosy and one-sided view of the communist society.HYPOCRISY IN THE "PEACE" MOVEMENT: A CASE STUDY by Chris R. Tame, 1983/1990, Foreign Policy Perspectives No. 16, ISBN 1-870614-00-3 Some have argued that Greene purposely hid negative information about the extent of starvation in China. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444180004578015170039623486.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_MIDDLESecondBucket He can be seen as a Fellow traveler.How America Was Misinformed About China, Far East Economic Review, August 29th, 2007

Mr. Green had visited China regularly for many years and had great faith in both the country and in communism. He came to Dharamsala with several films, hoping to show me how happy people were in Tibet, and to explain that things were not as bad as we, the Tibetans in exile, believed. He tried to convince me that everything was okay in my country. We talked and argued for three or four days. After many hours of discussion, he finally changed his attitude on most points. In such cases, a good argument based on sincere motivation can produce a positive result, provided both parties strive to be objective.

[[IBM Tivoli Workload Scheduler]]
CATEGORIES: Job scheduling, IBM software

IBM Tivoli Workload Scheduler is a family of IBM Tivoli workload automation products that plan, execute and track jobs on several platforms and environments. It comprises two products:
Plus some ancillary applications 
Products can be integrated to schedule and monitor from a single point of control with the use of a java console called JSC (Job Scheduling Console) or in the latest versions with a web based user interface called TDWC (Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console).
Workload Scheduler for z/OS (TWSz) was originally produced in the 1970s by IBM's Nordic Laboratory in Lidingo, Sweden where it was known as OPC, which stands for "Operations Planning and Control". In 1989 the name was changed to Operations Planning and Control/Advanced (OPC/A) when many advanced features were added and the product has remained very much the same ever since. The name changed again to Operations Planning and Control/ESA (Enterprise Systems Architecture) when later adapted to work in a Sysplex Environment. After IBM bought the Tivoli company and OPC came under Tivoli's umbrella it was briefly renamed TME/10 (Tivoli Management Environment/10), then to Tivoli Workload Scheduler, but as Tivoli had previously renamed Maestro to Tivoli Workload Scheduler OPC was renamed Tivoli Workload Scheduler for z/OS. However, the name Operations Planning and Control continued to appear on the primary option panel and elsewhere until Version 8 Release 5. The TWSz version numbers jumped from Version 3 to Version 8 to align with TWSd (Maestro).
Workload Scheduler (TWSd) was originally produced by Unison Software where it was known as Maestro. Maestro was bought by the Tivoli company when they realised the need for a Unix scheduler. It was renamed Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS). IBM bought the Tivoli company and gave it the responsibility for systems management, both distributed and mainframe. Tivoli at first decided to drop OPC and, because Maestro had an agent that ran on zOS, get OPC customers to migrate to Maestro. When it became obvious that Maestro couldn't replace OPC, Tivoli brought OPC under the Tivoli Workload Scheduler name. Many of the OPC concepts were ported to Maestro.
In 1988 users of OPC (later know as Tivoli Workload Scheduler) together with support from IBM, established ASAP - TWS Education + Training (formerly known as OPC/A Users Conference Inc.) - a volunteer, user supported, not-for-profit organization which is managed by a volunteer board of directors (representatives of member companies) and administered by MeetingWorks, LLC of New London, CT.

[[Staffordshire blue brick]]

CATEGORIES: Bricks

Staffordshire blue brick is a strong type of construction brick, originally made in Staffordshire, England.
The brick is made from the local red clay, Etruria marl, which when fired at a high temperature in a low-oxygen reducing atmosphere takes on a deep blue colour and attains a very hard, impervious surface with high crushing strength and low water absorption.
This type of brick was used for foundations and was extensively used for bridges and tunnels in canal construction, and later, for railways. Its lack of porosity makes it suitable for capping brick walls, and its hard-wearing properties makes it ideal for steps and pathways. It is also used as a general facing brick for decorative reasons.  Staffordshire Blue bricks have traditionally been "Class A" with a water absorption of less than 4.5%.

After partitioning Poland in the end of 18th century, the Kingdom of Prussia and later German Empire imposed a number of Germanisation policies and measures in the newly gained territories, aimed at limiting the Polish ethnic presence in these areas. This process continued through its various stages until the end of World War I, when most of the territories were transferred to the Second Republic of Poland, which largely limited the capacity of further Germanisation efforts of the Weimar Republic until the later Nazi occupation.

Barangaroo is an inner-city suburb of Sydney, Australia. It is located on the north-western edge of the Sydney central business district and the southern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney, and was part of the territory of the Cadigal people, the traditional owners of the Sydney city region. The area was used for fishing and hunting by Australian Aborigines prior to colonial settlement. The area is inclusive of The Hungry Mile, the name harbourside workers gave to the docklands area of Darling Harbour East, where workers would walk from wharf to wharf in search of a job, often failing to find one.
In 2003, the Government of New South Wales determined that the precinct would be redeveloped from shipping and stevedoring facilities to provide more commercial office space and recreational areas. This redevelopment has moved from design contest to concept plan from 2005 to 2012. In the interim, stevedoring facilities have been relocated, some of the site remediated, and temporary alternate uses such as major events implemented, pending major development. The site is managed by an agency of the Government, called the Barangaroo Delivery Authority.
The precinct is currently being redeveloped and is expected to be entirely completed by 2023.[tpl]cite web|title=Barangaroo Timeline|url=http://barangaroo.com.au/discover-barangaroo/timeline.aspx|publisher=Barangaroo Delivery Authority[/tpl]

[[Australian Submarine Rescue Vehicle Remora]]

CATEGORIES: Submarines of the Royal Australian Navy, Deep-submergence rescue vehicles

Australian Submarine Rescue Vehicle ''Remora (ASRV Remora) was a submarine rescue vehicle used by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) between 1995 and 2006. The name comes from the remora, a small fish that can attach itself to larger marine life, and has the backronym "Really Excellent Method Of Rescuing Aussies".Stewart, Rescue system for submarines a failure''
Remora was constructed by OceanWorks International of North Vancouver, British Columbia for the RAN, based on a diving bell.Davidson & Allibone, Beneath Southern Seas, p. 166 The [tpl]convert|16.5|tonne|adj=on[/tpl] vehicle was designed to mate with a submarine's escape tower, and could do this even if the submarine had rolled up to 60 degrees from vertical. The vehicle can operate at depths over [tpl]convert|500|m[/tpl] and in currents of up to [tpl]convert|3|kn[/tpl], and was intended for use below [tpl]convert|180|m[/tpl]; the maximum safe depth for Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment. The submersible carried seven people: an onboard operator and six passengers. Those aboard Remora were kept under about five bars of pressure, and rescued submariners exited into one of two 36-man recompression chambers carried aboard the rescue ship.
Remora could be controlled from a containerised facility aboard the rescue ship, with power, control, and sensors fed through an armoured umbilical cable.Davidson & Allibone, Beneath Southern Seas, p. 167InDepth Project Management, Australian Submarine Rescue Vehicle (ASRV) Remora Fact Sheet Twelve personnel make up the surface control complement, with this number supplemented by underwater medicine specialists and divers. The entire setup (Remora, control centre, and recompression chambers) could be transported by road or sea, or loaded into C-130 Hercules aircraft.Royal Australian Navy, Submarine Rescue Vehicles Remora could be delivered to anywhere in Australia within 36 hours, and installed on a suitable vessel in another 25 hours. The Defence Maritime Services tender Seahorse Spirit was designated the main tender for Remora, although any vessel with sufficient space to carry and deploy the equipment ([tpl]convert|300|m2|adj=on[/tpl] of deck space, with [tpl]convert|8|m[/tpl] minimum width) could be used.Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 19
In December 2006, the umbilical cable parted during an exercise off Perth, trapping two men at a depth of [tpl]convert|140|m[/tpl] for 12 hours. The men were rescued, but Remora was not recovered until April 2007. The submersible was sent back to OceanWorks for repairs. Although repairs were completed, Remora did not reenter service as the Det Norske Veritas classification society refused to certify the submersible; the launch and recovery equipment did not meet updated safety standards. As of the end of 2008, Remora was in storage at Henderson, Western Australia. To cover the capability loss, the Department of Defence arranged for the British LR5 submersible to be flown to Australia if submarine rescue was required. In June 2009, LR5 was relocated to Australia on lease.Remora replacement arrives, in Australian Defence Magazine
Remora was the basis for the United States Navy's Submarine Rescue Diving Recompression System.Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 973

[[Sinkov statistic]]
CATEGORIES: Cryptographic attacks, Computational linguistics, Statistical natural language processing

Sinkov statistics, also known as log-weight statistics, is a specialized field of statistics that was developed by Abraham Sinkov, while working for the small Signal Intelligence Service organization, the primary mission of which was to compile codes and ciphers for use by the U.S. Army. The mathematics involved include modular arithmetic, a bit of number theory, some linear algebra of two dimensions with matrices, some combinatorics, and a little statistics. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Elementary-Cryptanalysis-Mathematical-Approach-Library/dp/0883856220 Amazon.com: Elementary Cryptanalysis: A Mathematical Approach 
Sinkov did not explain the theoretical underpinnings of his statistics, or characterized its distribution, nor did he give a decision procedure for accepting or rejecting candidate plaintexts on the basis of their S1 scores. The situation becomes more difficult when comparing strings of different lengths because Sinkov does not explain how the distribution of his statistics changes with length, especially when applied to higher-order grams. As for how to accept or reject a candidate plaintext, Sinkov simply said to try all possibilities and to pick the one with the highest S1 value. Although the procedure works for some applications, it is inadequate for applications that require on-line decisions. Furthermore, it is desirable to have a meaningful interpretation of the S1 values. Statistical Techniques for Language Recognition: An Introduction and Guide for Cryptanalysts

[[Golden Skillet]]
CATEGORIES: Restaurants in Virginia, Restaurants established in 1968

Golden Skillet is a fast-food chain selling fried chicken that began in Richmond, Virginia. The first Golden Skillet chicken was sold in 1964 at the downtown Richmond department store Thalhimer's. It was the recipe of Clifton W. Guthrie, who first served the recipe at a Richmond Planning Commission meeting. Thalhimer executive Newman Hamblet was there, and decided to add it to the menu at the downtown store's Richmond Room. It was originally called Chicken and Spice and Virginia Fried Chicken.
Thalhimers was featured in Women's Wear Daily when they turned a railroad dock at their Westmoreland store into a restaurant location, and it became a top profit generator for the store. Its official name was Thalhimers Golden Skillet Chicken, and the slogan was that it was "Tender as Quail! Tasty as Pheasant!" While the recipe was not published, the chicken was cooked in special pressure-cookers and the process involved soaking the chicken in salt water http://www.recipelink.com/mf/14/21835.
The first freestanding location opened in 1968 at 5811 West Broad Street in Richmond; the design included a yellow roof and giant pan-shaped sign.
By 1981, the chain had grown to over 221 restaurants and was international. Advertising featured country music artist and Virginia native Roy Clark.
Guthrie died in 1981, and the family sold to International Dairy Queen. Dairy Queen sold the chain to franchisee David Shields of North Carolina. Most of the franchised locations have eventually closed. Along the roadside, evidence of the chain still remains, as the giant pan-shaped signs remain even after locations gain new tenants. Today some original locations are still operating, including a Guthrie family owned location in south Richmond at 3206 Jefferson Davis Highway http://web.archive.org/web/20081006104534/http://www.otherstream.com/rants/deadrestaurants.html.
One of the most popular franchise owners of Golden Skillets was Wesley Yang who alone owned 45 of 221 restaurants. All 45 of his restaurants were in Hampton Roads, mainly in Virginia Beach. As of 2008 only two of his restaurants are still operating, one in Virginia Beach and the other in Portsmouth.

Czesław Młot-Fijałkowski (1892–1944) was a Polish military officer and a brigadier general of the Polish Army.
Czesław Fijałkowski was born April 14, 1892 in Okalewo (now in Rypin County), then part of the Russian Empire. In 1912 he graduated from a trade school in Skierniewice and left Congress Poland for Liège, where he joined the Leodium University. There he joined the Polish Rifle Squads organization and became the head of its local branch in Belgium. Following the outbreak of World War I he returned to Poland and joined the Polish Legions already in August 1914. He served on the front, commanding a platoon, a company and eventually a battalion of the 5th Legions' Infantry Regiment. Around that time he earned the nickname of Młot (Polish for Hammer), which afterwards became part of his surname. Following the Oath crisis of 1917 he was interned in Beniaminów, but was released in May 1918 and was allowed to join the Polnische Wehrmacht, at the same time secretly cooperating with the Polish Military Organization.
Already in November 1918 he joined the reborn Polish Army in the rank of Kapitan and took part in the defence of Cieszyn Silesia against the Czechoslovak invasion and later in the Polish–Ukrainian War. Verified in the rank of Major, in 1920 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. After almost a year of staff duties during the Polish–Soviet War, in late 1920 he became the commanding officer of the Pułtusk-based 13th Infantry Regiment and then in 1923 promoted to the rank of Colonel. A skilled peace-time commander, he held command posts in the Polish 26th Infantry Division (deputy CO; 1926–1928) and then Polish 7th Infantry Division (1928–1929). In 1930 he was again promoted, this time to the rank of brigadier general, and assigned to the Łomża-based Polish 18th Infantry Division, which he commanded until the end of the interbellum.
In 1939, during the mobilization for the War with Germany, he was named the CO of the newly formed Narew Operational Group, a Corps-sized unit that was to defend the Polish border between the Narew river and the border with Lithuania, along the Biebrza river line. With two cavalry brigades and two infantry divisions (11th and 33rd) under his command, Młot-Fijałkowski ordered his units to probe the enemy and reconnaissance the enemy territory. Thus his unit became the only Polish detachment to cross into Germany during the Polish Defensive War. However, the Modlin Army stationed to the west of his troops was forced to steadily withdraw southwards and on September 7, 1939, Młot-Fijałkowski's unit was ordered the same. However, by that time the Guderian Corps managed to defeat the Polish 18th Infantry Division and outflank the Polish unit, which had to break through with significant losses on both sides. In the effect only the cavalry brigades survived and were commanded from then on by Gen. Zygmunt Podhorski, while Młot-Fijałkowski became a member of his staff.
Together with Podhorski's improvised unit Młot-Fijałkowski reached Białowieża on September 20, where a new cavalry division Zaza was being formed. Immediately it started a fast march southwards in order to link up with other Polish units fightinf in the area of Lublin and Tomaszów Lubelski. On September 29 it finally reached the Wieprz River area, where it became a part of Gen. Franciszek Kleeberg's Independent Operational Group Polesie. With that unit Czesław Młot-Fijałkowski took part in the battle of Kock, the last major engagement of the Polish campaign.
Taken prisoner of war by the Germans, Młot-Fijałkowski spent the rest of the war in various German POW camps. Among them were the Oflag IV-B Koenigstein and Oflag VII-A Murnau, where he died April 17, 1944.

[[Cross-flow filtration]]
CATEGORIES: Unit operations, Filtration, Water filters, Membrane technology

In chemical engineering, biochemical engineering and protein purification, crossflow filtration (also known as tangential flow filtrationMillipore Technical Library: Protein Concentration and Diafiltration by Tangential Flow Filtration) is a type of filtration (a particular unit operation). Crossflow filtration is different from dead-end filtration in which the feed is passed through a membrane or bed, the solids being trapped in the filter and the filtrate being released at the other end. Cross-flow filtration gets its name because the majority of the feed flow travels tangentially across the surface of the filter, rather than into the filter. The principal advantage of this is that the filter cake (which can blind the filter) is substantially washed away during the filtration process, increasing the length of time that a filter unit can be operational. It can be a continuous process, unlike batch-wise dead-end filtration.
This type of filtration is typically selected for feeds containing a high proportion of small particle size solids (where the permeate is of most value) because solid material can quickly block (blind) the filter surface with dead-end filtration. Industrial examples of this include the extraction of soluble antibiotics from fermentation liquors.

In summer 2010, Radan attracted media attention because of a "magnetic hill" located on a road near the village of Ivanje. After initial sensationalist articles about "anti-gravity", it soon turned out that it is just an optical illusion.

Sega World Sydney was an indoor high-tech amusement park that operated for almost four years, in Sydney, Australia. The theme park was built as the flagship tenant of the Darling Walk complex in Darling Harbour, and was designed and themed by gaming company Sega as one of several SegaWorld-branded amusement parks.
Land for the park was acquired by Jacfun Pty Ltd in 1994, with the amusement park opening in 1997. The remainder of the complex was sublet to a mix of retail and entertainment tenants. By 2000, Sega had pulled out from the partnership operating Sega World, and the park was suffering from low attendance and financial losses. There were hopes that tourists visiting Sydney for the 2000 Summer Olympics would help meet the visitor breakeven point, but this did not occur, and Sega World closed in November 2000. The rides were auctioned off in 2001.
Jacfun attempted to find a new tenant to replace Sega World, but the restrictive zoning meant that more profitable revenue streams (such as office-space) were unusable. In 2003, Jacfun sold its lease of the Darling Walk site back to the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, with the lease to terminate in 2008. The site was leased to Lend Lease in 2008, with the Darling Walk building demolished and replaced with office towers.

The 1983 Embassy World Darts Championship was staged at Jollees Cabaret Club in Stoke-on-Trent from 1–8 January 1983.
The tournament saw one of the World Darts Championship's biggest upsets, when Keith Deller defeated Eric Bristow, by 6 sets to 5 in the final, to become the youngest ever World Darts Champion and the first qualifier to win the World Championship.
Deller also beat world number 3, John Lowe in the quarter-finals and defending champion and world number 2, Jocky Wilson in the semi-finals, making him the only player in history to defeat the world's top three ranked players in the World Championship.

The final featured one of darts' most memorable moments, when Bristow was left on 121. Having hit single 17 and then treble 18, Bristow decided against hitting the bullseye. Instead he hit a single 18 to leave double 16, whilst Deller was on 138. Deller had already missed seven darts at a double to win the title in the ninth set, when leading 5-3 and Bristow believed his opponent would not check out the high finish. However, Deller hit treble 20, followed by treble 18 and finally finished on double 12 to win the title. To this day commentators often refer to 138 as the "Deller checkout" if a player is left with that score.

[[Percutaneous aortic valve replacement]]
CATEGORIES: Cardiac procedures

Percutaneous aortic valve replacement (PAVR), often transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), is the replacement of the aortic valve of the heart through the blood vessels (as opposed to valve replacement by open heart surgery). The 
replacement valve is delivered via one of several access methods: transfemoral (in the upper leg), transapical (through the wall of the heart), subclavian (beneath the collar bone) and direct aortic (through a minimally invasive surgical incision into the aorta).
The catheter procedure was developed in France, initially performed in 2002 on April 16 by Prof Alain Cribier in Hopital Charles Nicolle, in Rouen.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cribier|first=A|coauthors=Eltchaninoff H, Bash A, Borenstein N, Tron C, Bauer F, Derumeaux G, Anselme F, Laborde F, Leon MB|title=Percutaneous transcatheter implantation of an aortic valve prosthesis for calcific aortic stenosis.

Giant Open Air Market was a Norfolk, Virginia based supermarket chain.  Its trademark stores were open 24 hours, and the entrance was framed with a giant arch. The arch over the store was massive and rose to over 30  feet, anchored in concrete.
The first location was located at the foot of the Campostella Bridge in Norfolk Virginia's Berkley neighborhood. The market opened in 1939 was operated by business partners Wendall P.Rosso & V. J. Mastraco. Later, a store was erected on the site in 1952. 
The chain grew to include 26 full line grocery stores and  43 "Tinee Giant" convenience stores. The stores were known for the vastness of the variety in the selections. The international line of groceries that they carried attracted national press at the time. Giant Open Air Markets would carry exotics like Chocolate Covered Ants from Japan, Pickled Eel, English Teas, Greek and French cheeses and Russian caviar as well as a huge array of Latin American foods. The sign over the front door read "Finest Foods of the World", reflecting their diverse selections. 
Giant Open Air's flagship store was store number four, located in the Ward's Corner section of Norfolk. The 150,000+ square foot Giant Open Air Market also included a large restaurant. There were banquet rooms upstairs that could host a thousand guests plus a huge balcony with a fountain. As a 24 hour store (only closed on Christmas Day) the "front door" was an "Air Curtain" with no real doors. A huge blower pushed air down as customers entered and a steel grate below captured the air and recycled it. The grate was always full of loose coins that were cleaned out once a year and donated to charity. The location was also known for massive decorations, such as was a 20' fall "waterfall" of ice in the seafood department. The stores had large bakeries that produced fresh bakery 24 hours a day.  Other accommodations for shoppers was a large portico to have their groceries loaded into their cars out of the rain, and 24 hour laundromat. The "House of Flowers" floral department was one of the top ten FTD stores in the country at its time. 
In 1986, it merged with Farm Fresh,http://www.farmfreshsupermarkets.com/FarmFresh_App/corp/history.asp another Hampton Roads grocery chain, and the name disappeared, though the giant arch still remains on the logo. The Tinee Giant convenience store chain, still has some locations in Hampton Roads.http://richmond.com/output.aspx?Article_ID=2064375&Vertical_ID=155&tier=20&position=1 In 1999, the wholesaler Supervalu purchased the company.

[[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]]

CATEGORIES: Advocacy groups, International organizations of Europe, Pharmaceutical industry trade groups, Pan-European trade and professional organizations

The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) is a Brussels-based trade association founded in 1978  representing the research-based pharmaceutical industry operating in Europe.
Through its direct membership of 34 national associations and 40 leading pharmaceutical companies, EFPIA is the voice on the EU scene of 2,200 companies committed to researching, developing and bringing new medical treatments.
Figures published in 2008 by the European Commission (Eurostat)show that the pharmaceutical industry is the industrial sector which invests most in research & development (R&D). In 2011, it invested an estimated € 27,500 million in R&D in Europe. It directly employs 660,000 people and generates three to four times more employment indirectly – upstream and downstream – than it does directly.
The key contribution of the research-based pharmaceutical industry to medical progress is to turn fundamental research into 
innovative treatments that are widely available and accessible to patients. European citizens can expect not only to live longer, but to live longer and be healthier. High blood pressure and cardiovascular disease can be controlled with anti-hypertensive medicines and cholesterol-lowering medicines, knee or hip replacements prevent patients from immobility, and some cancers can be controlled or even cured thanks to newer targeted medicines. Yet, there remain huge challenges in many disease areas such as Alzheimer, multiple sclerosis, many cancers and orphan diseases.
EFPIA also includes two specialised groups focusing on vaccines and biotechnology respectively:

Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis, known in English as Juvenal ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|uː|v|ən|əl[/tpl]), was a Roman poet active in the late 1st and early 2nd century AD, author of the Satires.  The details of the author's life are unclear, although references within his text to known persons of the late 1st and early 2nd centuries AD fix his terminus post quem (earliest date of composition).
In accord with the manner of Lucilius—the originator of the genre of Roman satire—and within a poetic tradition that also included Horace and Persius, Juvenal wrote at least 16 poems in dactylic hexameter covering an encyclopedic range of topics across the Roman world.  While the Satires are a vital source for the study of ancient Rome from a vast number of perspectives, their hyperbolic, comic mode of expression makes the use of statements found within them as simple fact problematic.  At first glance the Satires could be read as a critique of pagan Rome, perhaps ensuring their survival in Christian monastic scriptoria, a bottleneck in preservation when the large majority of ancient texts were lost.

[[Casquette]]
CATEGORIES: Cycling equipment, Caps, Hats

Casquette is French for "cap".  In cycling jargon, it is used to refer to the traditional peaked cotton cap worn by racing cyclists.
With the introduction of compulsory cycle helmets for massed-start racing, casquettes have become less common, but most professional race outfits still have them produced in team colours for wearing on the winners' podium, for wearing under a helmet in heavy rain or for sale to the tifosi.  They have also become popular as fashion items in some American cities, often with non-cycling-related designs.http://www.hipsternascar.com/2008/12/new-stuff-at-nobrakes.html
The casquette shields the head from strong sun and the peak can also make riding in the rain more comfortable, since drops do not fall directly into the eyes.  They are sometimes worn with the peak backwards, not for reasons of fashion but because the peak then protects the neck from sunburn.
A traditional way to keep the head cool when cycling in hot conditions was to put a cabbage leaf under the casquette. However, when said cabbage was not available, riders would often turn to sheaths of mesclun.
The name was also used by Royal Enfield motorcycles to describe their version of the nacelle designed by Edward Turner for Triumph motorcycles. The casquette is still used on the 2009 Royal Enfield Bullet model.

The 1994 Embassy World Darts Championship was held following 2 years of controversy within the sport of darts. After the 1993 Championships, several players decided it was time to part company with the British Darts Organisation and form their own organisation, known as the World Darts Council. By the start of this tournament, the WDC were in the closing days of their own 1994 World Championship, with Dennis Priestley going on to beat Phil Taylor in the final.
Phil Taylor, Dennis Priestley, Rod Harrington, Alan Warriner, Peter Evison, Richie Gardner, Jocky Wilson, Eric Bristow, Keith Deller, John Lowe, Bob Anderson, Cliff Lazarenko, Kevin Spiolek, Jamie Harvey, Mike Gregory and Chris Johns were the players who formed the WDC and therefore did not participate at these 1994 Championships. Mike Gregory and Chris Johns eventually decided to stay with the BDO - but were unable to play in 1994 as their change of heart came too late for them to be able to qualify.
Of the 32 players who took part in the 1994 Embassy World Championship, 17 were world championship debutants, with many having never appeared in front of TV cameras before, including eventual champion, John Part. Of the remaining 15 players in the tournament, only 8 of those had appeared in the 1993 Embassy World Championship, with the other 7 having previously appeared in the Embassy World Championship in years before 1993.
In an astonishing first round, 7 out of the 8 seeded players were knocked out - including the new BDO World Number One, Steve Beaton who had risen to the top of the rankings as a result of the defecting players. Only number 3 seed, Roland Scholten managed to win his first round match - although he went out in round 2.
As a result, players previously unheard of had a chance to make a name for themselves and Canada's John Part dropped only one set en route to the Championship. He beat Ronnie Baxter, Paul Lim, Steve McCollum and Ronnie Sharp on the way to final. Part then overwhelmed Bobby George 6-0 in the final.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/darts-george-whitewashed-part-satisfied-1398802.html |title=Darts: George whitewashed, Part satisfied |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 January 1994 |accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl]
George, despite struggling with back problems, had reached his first final in 14 years.

It also features the music video for "You Are What You Is" which was banned by MTV. A guitar solo duet between Zappa and Steve Vai taken from the song "Stevie's Spanking" was later released on You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 4. As of December 2011, the video has not yet been released on DVD.

Kelvinside railway station was located on Great Western Road, next to the current Gartnavel General Hospital in the Kelvinside area of Glasgow, Scotland.  Part of the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway services ran through the station from Glasgow city centre to Maryhill in the north of the city and beyond.  The line from the station to Crow Road railway station passes under the current site of Hyndland railway station on the Argyle and North Clyde lines.
It was a two platform station, with a nearby goods yard. Upon closure the line as part of the Beeching Axe the area has now been redeveloped with housing. The former station building was designed by Sir John James Burnet and was subjected to numerous arson  attacks while it was closed but now houses a restaurant called 'Bar Stazione'. Previously, the building housed a restaurant and bar called 'Carriages' but a fire in December 1995 left just a shell of masonry and lay as a ruin for many years before reopening in its present incarnation. 
The Caledonian Railway monogram "CR" is still carved into the stone on the building's north facade.

Bernard Bennett (31 August 1931 — 12 January 2002) was an English professional player of snooker and English billiards, for almost 30 years. Bennett played an important role, but an often unsung one, in the development of snooker and billiards during the 1970s and early 80s. This role was less as a player, than as an organiser, supporter and promoter of both games.  
Bennett turned professional in the late 60s, but did so without any significant amateur record.Everton, Clive, Guinness Book of Billiards and Snooker, 1982, p89. By entering the 1969 World Snooker Championship, and paying the almost prohibitive £100 entrance fee, Bennett enabled a straight knockout tournament to be held, although he was heavily defeated in the first round 4–25 by Rex Williams. He competed in the 1970 event but was defeated in the first round 11-8 by David Taylor. 
Bennett's efforts led to the restaging of the World Professional Billiards Championship in 1971, after a gap of 3 years. Bennett provided both the financial guarantee, the venue for the event, and the opposition, but was heavily defeated by defending champion Rex Williams 9250-4058.Everton, Clive, Guinness Book of Billiards and Snooker, 1982, pp106-107.
Bennett was a founding member of the Professional Billiards Players' Association when it was reformed in 1969, and, as well as being a player, was a well-respected administrator and coach for many years. Bennett was the owner of the Castle Club Southampton which was one of the first modern snooker centres. From here, Bennett organised many pro-am events in both snooker and billiards as well as a mini 'triangular' events featuring three professionals. The Castle Pro-Am event (which Bennett financially supported) was a popular addition to the snooker scene, and was usually held in December. Bennett, whose money was actually accrued from the building trade, went on to own other snooker clubs in the Southampton area.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene,  February 2002, p47.
As an example of how important Bennett's pro-am Castle tournament was. At the end of the 1975/76 season, Alex Higgins (second on that season's earnings) had accrued only £2250 from the three main events of the season, so his £500 from winning the 1975Everton, Clive  (Ed.) Snooker Scene, August 1976, p11. Castle Open was a welcome boost.
On home ground, at his Southampton base, Bennett inevitably played better and in the 1977/78 season he defeated both John Pulman 3-0 and Doug Mountjoy, the latter being defeated 5-2 in the Castle Professional Tournament. Bennett held eventual winnerJohn Spencer to 3-3 in the semi-final of this tournament, before he lost 5-3.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, March 1978, p19 and May 1978, p22..
Bennett played both snooker and billiards into the 1990s, retiring from professional play in 1995. His final professional match was a 5-0 loss to Alfie Burden in the World Championship qualifiers. He died in 2002 at the age of 70. As Clive Everton noted in his obituary, Bennett was unanimously regarded with affection throughout the sport.Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene,  February 2002, p47

[[Bombing of Mannheim in World War II]]

CATEGORIES: Mannheim

The German city of Mannheim in the state of Baden-Württemberg saw bombing during World War II from December 1940 until the end of the war. Mannheim saw over 150 air raids.
As part of Operation Abigail Rachel, the "first deliberate terror raid" on Germany took place on 16 December, although with poor effect even though one hundred tonnes of explosives and 14,000 incendiaries were dropped on Mannheim.Boog, pp 507, 508
The British had been waiting for the opportunity to experiment with such a raid aimed at creating a maximum of destruction in a selected town since the summer 1940, and the opportunity was given after the German raid on Coventry.

The "air-crews, rightly, regarded it as a terror raid". Incendiaries dropped by eight bombers to mark the target missed the city center and of the 100 or so aircraft, of the 134 dispatched, that did drop bombs most missed the city center. German casualties were 34 dead and 81 injured.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/diary1940_2.html|title= Royal Air Force Bomber Command Campaign Diary 1940|publisher=DeltaWeb International|date=April 6, 2005[/tpl]  The lessons learned from the large dispersal of bombs over Mannheim was to develop the "bomber stream", maximum amount of bombs over shortest time and area. Despite the lack of decisive success of this raid, approval was granted for further similar raids.
This was the start of a British drift away from precision attacks on military targets and towards area bombing attacks on whole cities.Boog, p 509
The largest raid on Mannheim was on 5 and 6 September 1943. A large part of the city was destroyed. In 1944, raids destroyed Mannheim Palace, leaving only one room undamaged out of over 500. On 2 March 1945 the RAF launched a 300-bomber attack, causing a devastating firestorm. 25,181 tons of bombs fell throughout the war.

The Strelnikoff Mary of Help of Brezje controversy or the Strelnikoff Affair ([tpl]lang-sl|Afera Strelnikoff[/tpl]) began after a depiction of Mary of Help of Brezje holding a rat instead of Jesus was published by the Slovenian music group Strelnikoff on the cover of their 1998 album Bitchcraft. The album was made in protest of the official views of the Roman Catholic Church in Slovenia and the statements of some of its highest representatives on the subject of abortion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/kultura/dediscina/kako-hitro-so-uzaljena-verska-custva.html |title=Kako hitro so prizadeta verska čustva |language=Slovene |trans_title=How Quickly Religious Sentiments Get Hurt |newspaper=Delo.si |date=18 May 2012 |first=Tanja |last=Cirman[/tpl]
The first to condemn this depiction was Franc Rode, who was the Bishop of Ljubljana at the time. This was followed by general public outcry and expressions of the inappropriateness of the misuse of one of the most known symbols of Slovenian Catholicism. The State Attorney's Office received 3,867 public protests and 1,208 requests for indictment. These were united in one that was at first rebuffed before the Celje District Court. However, the state prosecutor Elizabeta Gyorkos filled a complaint.[tpl]sl icon[/tpl] Mladina.si - provokatorji množic. Vanja Pirc. Published on 21 July 2003. Last accessed on 18 October 2006.

The term “rocker” comes from the rocking aspect of the larger links[tpl]Clarify|date=August 2012[/tpl] on each side of the suspension system. These rockers are connected to each other and the vehicle chassis through a differential. Relative to the chassis, when one rocker goes up, the other goes down.

The term “bogie” refers to the links that have a drive wheel at each end. Bogies were commonly used as load wheels in the tracks of army tanks as idlers distributing the load over the terrain. Bogies were also quite commonly used on the trailers of  semi trailer trucks. Both applications now prefer trailing arm suspensions.

[[Asphalt plant]]

CATEGORIES: Asphalt

An asphalt plant is a plant used for the manufacture of asphalt, macadam and other forms of coated roadstone, sometimes collectively known as blacktop.
The manufacture of coated roadstone demands the combination of a number of aggregates, sand and a filler (such as stone dust), in the correct proportions, heated, and finally coated with a binder, usually bitumen based or, in some cases, tar,although tar was removed from BS4987 in 2001 and is not referred to in BSEN 13108/1 .  The temperature of the finished product must be sufficient to be workable after transport to the final destination.  A temperature in the range of 100 - 200 degrees Celsius is normal.  
Increasingly, recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) is used as part of the mix.  The binder used is flammable, and the heaters are large liquid or gas fired burners. RAP is introduced after the heating process and must be accounted for in the overall mix temperature calculations.
There are three main classes of plant: batch heater, semi-continuous (or "asphalt plant"), and continuous (or "drum mix").  The batch heater has the lowest throughput, the continuous plant the highest at up to around 500 Tonnes per hour.
Supply of roadstone for large contracts is generally by tender with considerable pressure on price.  A faulty batch of roadstone must be planed up and relaid, often with additional lane rental charges, at a cost which may be orders of magnitude higher than the original price, so sophisticated control systems are a necessity.

The station was located in New Mill End but took its name from the small hamlet of Chiltern Green about a mile away.  Adjacent to it was the GNR station of Luton Hoo also located in New Mill End. The small hamlet of New Mill End is unique in having two railway stations (Chiltern Green and Luton Hoo) neither of which, after 1 December 1891, were named after the village they served.  The two lines ran side by side at this point, the Midland into Luton Midland Road, the GNR from Hatfield into Luton Bute Street.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books

The Shelton Brothers, Bob, Joe and Merle, were pioneer country musicians and renowned recording artists based out of Texas from the mid-1930s through the 1960s. They created and popularized the songs  Johnson's Old Gray Mule, Deep Elm  Blues, These Shoes Are Killing Me,  Oh Monah, Match Box Blues and My Heart Oozes Blood For You, "What's The Matter With Deep Elm", "I'm A Handy Man To Have Around" and "Henpecked Husband Blues". The Shelton Brothers (Joe and Bob) also wrote (their names appear as co-writers, but the writer was actually, individually, Sydney Robin) and were the second to record "Just Because" (Decca 46008), a song that has since been recorded numerous times by various artists including Elvis Presley who included it on his very first album titled "Elvis Presley". The original recording was by Nelstone's Hawaiians, comprising Hubert Nelson and James D. Touchstone. The song's opening line reads: Just because you think you're so pretty, just because you think you're so hot..... "Just Because" was the Shelton's first release on Decca but, due to their popularity, they went on to cut over 150 sides for the label. They also recorded sides for Victor Records and King Records. The Shelton Brothers would become one of the most successful country acts of the era.
The Shelton Brothers were also one of the earliest acts to appear on the famous Big D Jamboree which originated from the Dallas Sportatorium in Dallas, Texas. They later became an integral part of The Saturday Night Shindig which also originated from Dallas.

It was opened by the Luton, Dunstable and Welwyn Junction Railway Company in 1858, which was an extension of the Welwyn and Hertford Railway. The track to Welwyn was completed in 1860 and taken over by the Great Northern the following year. 
It was valuable to Luton people not only for passengers but also for facilitating the London market for the town's trade in plaited straw goods. The station, and the line to Welwyn, closed in 1965.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books
Following closure to passengers in 1965, the station buildings were quickly demolished despite the line remaining open for freight until 1989/1990. The site of the station was later used as a car park for Luton railway station. Throughout the years, various local pressure groups have been supportive of reopening the station as part of a viable branch line between Dunstable and Luton. In the mid-1990s, there was a debate about reopening it with either the operation of Diesel Class 158's or electric Class 319's.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
The site is currently undertaking extensive redevelopment as the new Luton Gateway transport interchange as work progresses on the building of the Luton Dunstable guided busway scheme.

[[Bell cymbal]]

CATEGORIES: Cymbals

A bell cymbal or bell splash cymbal is a small, very thick cymbal with little if any taper, used as an effects cymbal in a drum kit. The sound produced when striking the bell cymbal with a drumstick is a distinctive high-pitched ping sound with a long sustain. Some manufacturers list bell cymbals as a type of splash cymbal, others as a distinct type.
The name bell cymbal is suggestive both of its tone, which is distinctly bell like, and also the earliest examples, which were made by drummers cutting down a larger cymbal (often one damaged at the rim) so that only the bell of the cymbal remained.
Bell cymbals vary greatly in profile. In some, there is no bow at all, the entire cymbal is in the shape of a concave downwards cymbal bell, similar to the earliest examples. Others have the shape of a traditional Turkish cymbal, with a smallish bell in proportion to the size of the cymbal, and still others are intermediate between these two extremes.
Bell cymbals are most commonly six to ten inches in diameter, but larger and smaller examples are found occasionally, down to four inches, and Paiste make one at thirteen inches.

Stod is a former municipality in Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway.  The municipality originally encompassed the northern part of the present-day municipality of Steinkjer, stretching from the town of Steinkjer along the lake Snåsavatnet to the municipal border with Snåsa.  The old municipality administration was in the village of Binde.  The main church for Stod was For Church, located just south of the administrative center.

There are several other prehistoric sites, including two stone circles, one on the Nordgård farm and one at the rectory, both of which are partially destroyed.

[[Lifestyle enclave]]

CATEGORIES: Sociological terminology

Lifestyle enclave is a sociological term first used by Robert N. Bellah in his 1985 book, Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life.  In the glossary of the book, he provides the following definition: "A lifestyle enclave is formed by people who share some feature of private life. Members of a lifestyle enclave express their identity through shared patterns of appearance, consumption, and leisure activities, which often serve to differentiate them sharply from those with other lifestyles" (p. 335).  This term is contrasted with community, which Bellah et al. claim is characterized by social interdependence, shared history, and shared participation in politics.
The concept of lifestyle enclave has been used to analyze, for example, youth subcultures (Simpson 2000) and the relationship between leisure and democracy (Hemingway 1991).

[[Barito Ulu]]

CATEGORIES: Ecological experiments, Forestry in Indonesia

Project Barito Ulu is a cooperative environmental project established in 1989, between the University of Cambridge and the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry, working together with the Indonesian Institute of Sciences
Research is carried out at the Muara Rekut base-camp in Central Kalimantan, situated at the headwaters of the Barito River in the geographical centre of Borneo (114,0E, 0,06S).  It has been funded for the past ten years by the UK Home Improvement chain, Wickes.
The base-camp is situated at Muara Rekut where the Rekut and Busang rivers intersect.  There is a wide diversity of forest types surrounding the camp, lowland evergreen forest, heath forest (kerangas) and intermediate forest types as well as shifting cultivation fallows of up to 60 years of age.  Over fifty permanent plots (mostly 0.25 ha) have been set up, and there is an extensive trail system of 15 km within the main 400 hectare study site.  Recent botanical research, mainly under the direction of John Proctor, has looked at plant-soil relationships, including a large-scale forest fertilisation experiment and explaining the occurrence of the locally common heath forest formation as well as examining forest succession following shifting cultivation.  Zoological research is centred on understanding the ecology and systematics of the hybrid gibbons (Hylobates muelleri) found at the study site, but has also focussed on other large mammals as well, including birds, bats and fish.  A phenological study, now in its thirteenth year, currently has over 200 trees monitored monthly.
Travelling to the camp takes two to four days from Jakarta. For the final three hours of the journey a speedboat must be chartered to negotiate the rapids in the upper parts of the river before arriving at the camp.  It is sometimes possible to take the weekly Mission Aviation Fellowship plane to Muara Joloi, the nearest village to Rekut camp which is around one hour downstream.

[[Crown (heraldry)]]

CATEGORIES: Crowns in heraldry, Heraldic charges

A Crown is often an emblem of the sovereign state, a monarch's government, or items endorsed by it; see The Crown. Crowns may also be used by some republics.
A specific type of crown (or coronet for peerage in the British Isles) is employed in heraldry under strict rules. Indeed some monarchies never had a physical crown, just a heraldic representation, as in the constitutional kingdom of Belgium.
Crowns are also often used as symbols of religious status or veneration, by divinities (or their representation such as a statue) or by their representatives, e.g. the Black Crown of the Karmapa Lama, sometimes used a model for wider use by devotees.
A crown can be a charge in a coat of arms, or set upon the shield to signify the status of its owner.

[[Bedegraine]]
CATEGORIES: Arthurian locations

Bedegraine is a fictional location featured in some tellings of the Arthurian legend. Its chief importance is as the site of a battle where King Arthur solidifies his reign in a victory over rebel kings.
Bedegraine is first mentioned in the French Prose Merlin, a work eventually incorporated into the Lancelot-Grail cycle.Bruce, p. 61. The Merlin refers to Bedegraine as the chief city of Britain and Carmelide, the kingdom of Guinevere and Leodegrance, and describes Arthur's victory over the rebels there. Though his force is outnumbered by the rebels led by King Lot, Arthur carries the day with the secret aid of the French kings Ban and Bors. The rebel kings must retreat to their own territory to fend off Saxon invaders, and eventually recognize Arthur as their rightful overlord. The Livre d'Artus, a continuation of the Merlin, also mentions Bedegraine and places it on border between Logres and Cornwall.
Bedigraine is an important location in the Vulgate Lancelot, another section of the Lancelot-Grail. The city, here located on the border of Ireland and Carmelide, serves as one of Arthur's court cities, and becomes the setting of most of the "False Guinevere" episode, in which an impostor usurps the Queen's place and the real Guinevere must flee with Lancelot. The Battle of Bedegraine episode is an important event in Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur, which describes Arthur's defeat of the eleven rebel kings as his final step towards undisputed kingship. The 13th-century French writer Baudin Butor, who wrote on the legendary kings preceding Arthur, mentions Bedegraine as one of Vortigern's court cities.

Calmar ratio (or Drawdown ratio) is a performance measurement used to evaluate Commodity Trading Advisors and hedge funds. It was created by Terry W. Young and first published in 1991 in the trade journal Futures.[tpl]citation|periodical = Futures (magazine)|date = 1 October 1991| title = Calmar Ratio: A Smoother Tool| first = Terry W.| last = Young[/tpl]
Young owned California Managed Accounts, a firm in Santa Ynez, California, which managed client funds and published the newsletter CMA Reports. The name of his ratio "Calmar" is an acronym of his company's name and its newsletter: CALifornia Managed Accounts Reports. Young defined it thus:
Young believed the Calmar ratio was superior because
It should be mentioned that a competitor newsletter, Managed Account Reports (founded in 1979 by publisher Leon Rose), had previously defined and popularized another performance measurement, the MAR Ratio, equal to the compound annual return from inception, divided by the maximum drawdown from inception.
Although the Calmar ratio and MAR ratio are sometimes assumed to be identical, they are in fact different: Calmar ratio uses 36 months of performance data, whereas MAR ratio uses all performance data from inception onwards. Later versions of the Calmar ratio introduce the risk free rate into the numerator to create a Sharpe type ratio.  Carl R Bacon, "Practical Risk-adjusted Performance Measurement", Page 100

Southampton Terminus railway station served the docks and city centre of Southampton, England. The station was first authorised on 25 July 1834,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/hantsgaz/hantsgaz/s0004138.htm |title=Old Hampshire Gazetteer, LSWR Winchester to Southampton |publisher=Envf.port.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl] it began as the terminus of the London and South Western Railway (which was the London and Southampton Railway until the line opened). The station opened on 10 June 1839 as "Southampton", although it was not officially operational until 11 May 1840, due to the track not being fully linked between Winchester and Basingstoke.
The former terminus station was built in 1839-40 for the London & Southampton Railway, to the design of Sir William Tite. The LSWR added the large South Western Hotel which rather dwarfs the station. The line was later extended into the Ocean Dock Terminal to allow boat trains to terminate on the quayside.

CATEGORIES: Cathedrals in Italy, Churches in Mantua, Gothic architecture in Lombardy

The Cathedral of Saint Peter the Apostle ([tpl]lang-it|Duomo di Mantova[/tpl]) in Mantua, Lombardy (northern Italy), is the seat of the Diocese of Mantua.
An initial structure probably existed on the site in the Early Christian era, which was followed by an edifice destroyed by a fire in 894. The current church was rebuilt in 1395-1401 with the addition of side chapels and a magnificent Gothic facade, which can still be seen in a sketch by Domenico Morone, which is preserved in the Palazzo Ducale of the city. The belltower has seven bells tuned in the scale of Bb.
After another fire in the 16th century, Giulio Romano remade the interior but saved the facade. The latter was however replaced in 1756-1761 by the current one in the Baroque style, done in Carrara marble. Of the Renaissance edifice, its characteristics are the cusps, decorated with rose windows on the right side, which end with the Gothic bell tower.

Aleksandr Vasilievich Nazarenko ([tpl]lang-ru|Александр Васильевич Назаренко[/tpl], born in 1948 in Panevėžys) is a Russian historian who works in the Moscow State University. He heads the project "Russia and Central Europe in the Middle Ages" in the World History Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.(9 February 2008). На заседании Научной секции ИППО поздравили ее Председателя А. В. Назаренко с 60-летием, Императорское Православное Палестинское Общество (ippo.ru) (article is about 60th birthday celebration of subject)
Having studied at the university to gain doctorates in philology and history, Nazarenko revived the tenet of 19th-century Russian historiography that it's impossible to research early East Slavic history without detailed knowledge of ancient languages. Considered a disciple of Vladimir Pashuto, Nazarenko advocates tighter integration of historiography with the auxiliary disciplines of genealogy, numismatics, and sigillography. This approach allowed him to identify and publish a number of new (mostly foreign) sources on the history of Kievan Rus. 
Nazarenko's major findings were summarized in a monograph International Relations of Ancient Rus (Древняя Русь на международных путях: Междисциплинарные очерки, культурных, торговых, политических отношений IX—XII веков). Moskva: Russkiĭ fond sodeĭstviii︠a︡ obrazovanii︠u︡ i nauke, 2009 ISBN 5-91244-009-5 Upon its publication in 2009, the book won Nazarenko the Macarius Award of the Russian Orthodox Church.http://www.m-fond.ru/laureati/8/

The Rotonda di San Lorenzo is a religious building in Mantua, Lombardy (northern Italy).
It is the most ancient church in the city. It is now sunk below the level of the Piazza della Erbe. It probably stands on the site of a Roman temple that was dedicated to the goddess Venus.
It was built during the reign of the Canossa family in the late 11th century. Inspired by the Holy Sepulchre church in Jerusalem and dedicated to the martyr St. Lawrence, it has a central plan and has maintained ancient features like the matronaeum (loggia for female faithful) and frescoes of Byzantine school from the 11th-12th century. Another fresco fragment in the apse, portraying the Martyrdom of St. Lawrence, dates to 15th century. The construction, according to the Lombard tradition, is in bricks, but has two columns and other details in marble, coming from ancient edifices.
Deconsecrated, it was used for dwellings, shops and stores, and at the beginning of the 20th century it was covered by other edifices. Later it was restored and the external additions removed.

Reuss-Lobenstein was recreated in 1647 again as a lordship which it remained until 1673 when the title of lord was upgraded to count. Following the death of Count Heinrich X in 1671, Reuss-Lobenstein was ruled jointly by his three sons Heinrich III, Heinrich VIII and Heinrich X. In 1678 Reuss-Lobenstein was partitioned with Heinrich III remaining Count of Reuss-Lobenstein, Heinrich VIII becoming Count of Reuss-Hirschberg and Heinrich X becoming the Count of Reuss-Ebersdorf. Reuss-Lobenstein was partitioned for a second time in 1710 following the death of Heinrich III with Reuss-Selbitz being created for a younger son Heinrich XXVI while his eldest son Heinrich XV succeeded him as count of Reuss-Lobenstein.

[[Argument from marginal cases]]

CATEGORIES: Applied ethics, Philosophical arguments, Rights, Animal rights

The argument from marginal cases is a philosophical argument within animal rights theory regarding the moral status of non-human animals. Its proponents hold that if human infants, the senile, the comatose, and the cognitively disabled have direct moral status, animals must have a similar status, since there is no known morally relevant ability that those marginal-case humans have that animals lack. "Moral status" may refer to a right not to be killed or made to suffer, or to a general moral requirement to be treated in a certain way.Dombrowski, Daniel (1997).

[[The Martyr of Antioch]]

CATEGORIES: 1880 compositions, Compositions by Arthur Sullivan, Oratorios

The Martyr of Antioch is an oratorio (originally described as "A Sacred Musical Drama") by the English composer Arthur Sullivan.  It was first performed on 15 October 1880 at the triennial Leeds Music Festival, having been composed specifically for that event.  It formed the first half of the programme, followed by a performance of Beethoven's Mass in C and Schubert's Song of Miriam in the second half.  Sullivan was musical director of the Leeds Festival in 1880 and conducted the performance.
The Martyr of Antioch is based on the 1822 epic poem by Henry Hart Milman (the Dean of St. Paul's) concerning the martyrdom of St. Margaret of Antioch in the 3rd century.  The libretto was adapted for the occasion by Sullivan's friend and collaborator, the librettist W. S. Gilbert. Their fifth opera, The Pirates of Penzance, had premiered in London earlier that year.
Like many of Sullivan's large-scale choral works, The Martyr is theatrical in conception and was even presented as an opera by the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1898.  At the Leeds Festival of 1886, Sullivan would premiere an even more successful choral work, The Golden Legend.
The Martyr is rarely performed today, though two recordings are available.  A professional recording was made at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in 2000,[tpl]citation |last=Shepherd|first=Marc| publisher = Oakapple Press| url = http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/sullvocal-martyr.htm | title = The Martyr of Antioch (2000 recording)[/tpl]. and an amateur recording was issued by The Sir Arthur Sullivan Society in the 1980s. In addition, various selections from the work have been recorded over the past few decades.[tpl]citation |last=Shepherd|first=Marc| publisher = Oakapple Press| url =http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/sullchoral.htm#martyr | title = The Martyr of Antioch (1880)[/tpl].  During much of the 20th century, Sullivan's serious classical compositions were overshadowed by the Savoy operas, but more recently, revived interest in these works has led to recordings and more frequent performances.

[[Custom media]]
CATEGORIES: Promotion and marketing communications

Custom media (or, customer media) is a marketing term referring broadly to the development, production and delivery of media (print, digital, audio, video, events) designed to strengthen the relationship between the sponsor of the medium and the medium's audience. It is also called branded media, customer media, member media, content marketing, and custom publishing in the US; contract publishing and customer publishing in the UK. In-flight magazines, sponsored by airlines, were one of the first custom media and remain typical of the genre. While other channels have had significant success, the customer magazine is the most successful example of the genre.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] 
Typically, custom media is sponsored by a single marketer (a company, brand, association or institution) and is designed to reach a tightly focused audience of customers, members, alumni or other constituency. Custom media can be produced "in-house" by such organizations. Over the past two decades, a growing number of specialized publishing and media firms have emerged, called "custom media" or "custom publishing" companies in the US, and "customer publishers'" or '"publishing agencies" in the UK. Like advertising and other marketing services firms, the companies or divisions of traditional media companies, provide professional marketing and communications services to clients for a fee. Such out-sourced services can be limited to design and editorial responsibilities or include the complete production and distribution process. In addition, many of the companies sell advertising space within custom publications to third parties; this subsizes the cost of publication; creates a more authentic editorial environment; and allows third parties to purchase and publicizes an association with the media's sponsor, while reaching that sponsor's customers (e.g. food suppliers may purchase advertising space within a supermarket's custom media). [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] 
Custom media aims to build a relationship of trust and loyalty with the sponsor's customers, so they regard the sponsor as the vendor of choice when they make purchases. This is accomplished by providing information and, often, advice, that meets the needs and suits the preferences of the sponsor's target  market. It serves the interests of the audience, rather than overtly plugging products and services the way ads do.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

The name "Auris" is based on the Latin word for "gold", aurum.
In Europe, Toyota positioned the Auris as the replacement of Corolla hatchback, while the notchback sedan continued with the Corolla nameplate. It is not sold in North America, as the larger Toyota Matrix takes its place in the lineup.
The more luxurious Auris was also called the Toyota Blade in Japan. The Auris succeeds the Toyota Allex in Japan and the Corolla RunX.

James Robert Baker (October 18, 1946 – November 5, 1997) was an American author of sharply satirical,   predominantly gay-themed transgressional fiction. A native Californian, his work is set almost entirely in Southern California. After graduating from UCLA, he began his career as a screenwriter, but became disillusioned and started writing novels instead. Though he garnered fame for his books Fuel-Injected Dreams and Boy Wonder, after the controversy surrounding publication of his novel, Tim and Pete, he faced increasing difficulty having his work published.  According to his life partner, this was a contributing factor in his suicide.
Baker's work has achieved cult status in the years since his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published. First-edition copies of his earlier works have become collector's items. His novel Testosterone was adapted to a film of the same name, though it was not a financial success. Two other books have been optioned for films, but they have not been produced.

Institute for Personal Robots in Education (IPRE) was initiated by a $1 million grant from Microsoft Research to Bryn Mawr College and the Georgia Institute of Technology and announced in July 2006. IPRE is designing introductory computer science curricula centered around a Personal Robot. Their vision is that each student will purchase a small, inexpensive robot at the bookstore which they will use throughout their classes in exploring computer science. The hope is that the robot will cost about as much as a textbook. IPRE will develop the hardware, software, and curricular materials for these courses. 
The software being developed for introductory computer science courses is called Myro, short for My Robot, and is based in part on Pyro from Python Robotics. Myro is an interface to communicate with robots. It is designed to be used through a number of computer languages, include Python, Ruby, and Scheme.
The robot currently being used is the Scribbler from Parallax, Inc. (company) augmented with a small computer board, called the Fluke. The Fluke contains Bluetooth and a camera. This allows any robot that has a serial interface to be controlled through the low-cost Fluke.

[[Personal robot]]
CATEGORIES: Robots

A personal robot is one whose human interface and design make it useful for individuals. This is by contrast to industrial robots which are generally configured and operated by robotics specialists. A personal robot is one that enables an individual to automate the repetitive or menial part of home or work life making them more productive.
Similar to the way that the transition from mainframe computers to the personal computers revolutionized personal productivity, the transition from industrial robotics to personal robotics is changing productivity in home and work settings.
Turning a robot like ASIMO or Atlas into a universally applicable personal robot or artificial servant is mainly a 
programming task. As of 2013 vast improvements in motion planning, computer vision (esp. scene recognition), natural language processing, and automated reasoning are indispensable to make this a possibility.

The Millennium Concert (recorded on December 31, 1999 at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, Canada) was originally to be released as Alive IV in 2000 but because Kiss' parent label Mercury was swallowed by the Universal/Vivendi merger, Alive IV was shelved. 
Universal later agreed to Kiss using Mercury to release what would become The Millennium Concert as Alive IV, but then it was shelved indefinitely and the band would release the Symphony: Alive IV album released on Kiss Records/Sanctuary Records in 2003. The 72-page booklet that comes with the set mistakenly credits songwriting for "Cold Gin" to Paul Stanley instead of Ace Frehley.

[[Julian and Basilissa]]

CATEGORIES: Married couples, Saints duos, 304 deaths, 4th-century Christian martyrs, 4th-century Romans, 4th-century Christian female saints, Year of birth unknown

Saints Julian and Basilissa (died ca. 304) were husband and wife.  They were Christian martyrs who died at either Antioch or, more probably, at Antinoe, in the reign of Diocletian, early in the fourth century, on 9 January, according to the Roman Martyrology, or 8 January, according to the Greek Menaea.
Their feast day is also given as 6 January, while a group of people martyred with Julian (Celsus, Marcionilla, Anthony, Anastasius) have the feast day of January 9.
There exists no historically certain data relating to these two holy personages, and more than once this Julian of Antinoe has been confounded with Julian of Cilicia. The confusion is easily explained by the fact that thirty-nine saints of this name are mentioned in the Roman Martyrology, eight of whom are commemorated in the one month of January. But little is known of this saint, once we put aside the exaggerations of his Acts.

[[Pláhnetan]]

CATEGORIES: Icelandic rock music groups

Pláhnetan was an Icelandic rock band formed in the spring of 1993 after singer Stefán Hilmarsson, Ingólfur Guðjónsson and Sigurður Gröndal wrote several songs for Stefán’s forthcoming solo album, but the group got along so well that they decided to continue composing and even form a new band with that material under Stefán’s management.
The name Pláhnetan is a game-word, since the word pláneta means planet, but with the addition of the h, the ending part formed is hneta, which mean nut. Therefore, its name could be translated as the planut.
In those days Stefán and bassist Friðrik Sturluson were in the band Sálin hans Jóns míns while Ingólfur Guðjónsson and Sigurður Gröndal had quit their band Loðin Rotta, so they called drummer Ingólfur Sigurðsson, who up to that moment had been playing in bands like Síðan Skein Sól (a.k.a. S.S.Sól) and Rauðir Fletir.
The band contacted Steinar Berg Ísleifsson, the owner of label Skífan and got a record deal, which allowed them to released their debut album in June the same year under the title of Speis (Icelandic for Space), a work which dealt with the concept of space and got good reviews by the critics. Some of the songs became very popular and the band took the chance to tour the country to promote the album. 
After this album, singer Stefán released a solo album called Líf (Life) with the help of the band.
By 1994 Friðrik left the band and was replaced by bassist Jakob Smári Magnússon, who was known by playing in Tappi Tíkarrass, MX-21 and S.S.Sól. the new line-up released an album in June called Plast (Plastic) which featured singer Björgvin Halldórsson in the song “Ég Vissi Það”. 
By the fall Pláhnetan released one single called Sæla with the collaboration of singer Emilíana Torrini.
In 1995 they call it to the end when Stefán’s band Sálin Hans Jóns Míns started to play again.

CATEGORIES: Quilting, Textile arts of Pakistan, Culture of Sindh, Sindhi culture

Ralli quilts are traditional quilts made by women in the areas of Sindh, Pakistan, western India, and in surrounding areas. They are just now gaining international recognition, even though women have been making these quilts for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. Rallis (also known as rillis, rellis, rehlis, rallees, gindi and other names) are a cultural symbol for the regions where they are made.  The most common uses are for a single person sized bedcover  (used on the traditional wooden charpoy bed) or as small bag or eating cloth.  Traditionally rallis were made at home, from recycled and hand dyed cotton cloth, for use by the family. Now there is some commercial production of rallis as colourful quilts, table runners and cushions and pillows.  This production can be found in Sindh in Umerkot and Tharparkat as well aas in the Indian States of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
In the past decade, rallis have gained much popularity and notice.  Articles about rallis have appeared in many popular American quilting magazines and other publications.  Rallis have been exhibited for the first time in several quilt museums in the US with the first exhibit at the International Quilt Festival in Houston in 2003.  Now the International Quilt Study Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a growing collection of about 150 rallis.  Rallis were in the news as a result of the terrible flooding in Pakistan in August 2010.  Many people escaped the floods with only their families and their rallis. Women in the refugee camps used their time to make more rallis to use or to sell.

Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg ([tpl]Lang-de|Sachsen-Gotha-Altenburg[/tpl]) was a duchy ruled by the Ernestine branch of the House of Wettin in today's Thuringia, Germany. 
It was nominally created in 1672 when Frederick William III, the last duke of Saxe-Altenburg, died and Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (who had married Frederick William's cousin, Elisabeth Sophie), inherited the major part of his possessions. It was common for the Ernestine duchies to merge and split; Ernest's combined duchy was divided again after his death in 1675, and the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg proper came into existence in 1680 with the completion of this division and the accession of his eldest son, Frederick to the subdivision centered around the towns of Gotha and Altenburg.
Frederick's residence remained at the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha. He decisively secured his family's possessions with the implementation of the primogeniture in 1685. Nevertheless when the last dukes Emil August and his brother Frederick IV had both died without male heirs, the house of Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg became extinct in 1825 and quarrels arose between the three remaining Ernestine lines about the succession. 
As a result of an arbitration issued by King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony in 1826, the Ernestine duchies were rearranged and Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg was again split: 
After the abolition of German monarchies in the course of the German Revolution of 1918–1919, all former duchies became part of the newly created state of Thuringia in 1920.

CATEGORIES: 2006 rugby union tournaments for national teams, IRB Pacific Nations Cup, 2006 in New Zealand rugby union, 2005–06 in Japanese rugby union

The 2006 IRB Pacific 5 Nations was the inaugural IRB Pacific 5 Nations rugby union competition held between five Pacific Rim sides; Fiji, Japan, Samoa, Tonga and the Junior All Blacks (New Zealand's second XV). The inaugural tournament kicked off on 3 June 2006 with the Junior All Blacks proclaimed the winner after their 38–8 defeat of Japan on 24 June 2006.
Australia was invited to take part but decided against sending a team as they wanted focus on their domestic competition. However, Australia hosted two games, and Australian Rugby Union CEO Gary Flowers stated that Australia was keen to participate in the tournament from 2007 onwards. On 18 October 2006 it was announced that they would send their second XV. For this reason, the inaugural tournament was the only one to be known as the "Pacific 5 Nations", and from 2007 the competition was known as the Pacific Nations Cup.

[[Tropical Storm Carrie (1972)]]
CATEGORIES: 1972 Atlantic hurricane season, Atlantic tropical storms, 1972 in the United States, Hurricanes in New England

Tropical Storm Carrie was a strong tropical storm that affected the East Coast of the United States in early September 1972. The third tropical cyclone of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season, Carrie formed on August 29 from a complex sequence of meteorological events starting with the emergence of a tropical wave into the Atlantic in the middle of August. Tracking generally northward throughout its life, Carrie reached an initial peak intensity as a moderate tropical storm before nearly weakening back into tropical depression status. The storm began to reintensify in a baroclinic environment after turning toward the northwest; its winds of [tpl]convert|70|mph|km/h[/tpl] as it was transitioning into an extratropical system eclipsed the cyclone's previous maximum strength. The extratropical remnants of Carrie skirted eastern New England before making landfall in Maine on September 4 and dissipating over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during the next two days.
Carrie had a minimal impact on the East Coast south of New England, limited to increased swells, gusty winds, and light rainfall. The worst conditions occurred over southeastern New England, where wind gusts reached [tpl]convert|84|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and rainfall exceeded [tpl]convert|1|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. Damage was most severe along and slightly inland from the coast. Thousands of people became stranded on offshore islands of Massachusetts after dangerous conditions created by the storm prompted the suspension of steamship service. Overall damage was generally light, with total monetary losses valued at $1,780,000, and four deaths are blamed on the storm.

For almost five centuries, the German city of Frankfurt am Main was a city-state within two major Germanic states:
Frankfurt was a major city of the Holy Roman Empire, being the seat of imperial elections since 885 and the city for imperial coronations from 1562 (previously in Free Imperial City of Aachen) until 1792. Frankfurt was declared an Imperial Free City (Reichsstadt) in 1372, making the city an entity of Imperial immediacy, meaning immediately subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.
Due to its imperial significance, Frankfurt survived mediatisation in 1803. Following the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Frankfurt fell to the rule of Napoleon I, who granted the city to Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg; the city became known as the Principality of Frankfurt. The Catholic clergy Dalberg emancipated the Catholics living with the city boundary. In 1810 Dalberg merged Frankfurt with the Principality of Aschaffenburg, the County of Wetzlar, Fulda, and Hanau to form the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. After the defeat of Napoleon and the collapse of the Confederation of the Rhine, Frankfurt was returned to its pre-Napoleonic constitution via the Congress of Vienna of 1815 and became a sovereign city-state and a member of the German Confederation.
During the period of the German Confederation, Frankfurt continued to be a major city. The confederation's governing body, the Bundestag (officially called the Bundesversammlung, Federal Assembly) was located in the palace of Thurn und Taxis in Frankfurt's city centre. During the Revolutions of 1848, the Frankfurt Parliament was formed in an attempt to unite the German states in a democratic manner. It was here that Prussian king, Frederick William IV refused the offer of the crown of "Little Germany".
In 1866, the Kingdom of Prussia went to war with the Austrian Empire over Schleswig-Holstein, causing the Austro-Prussian War. Frankfurt, remaining loyal to the German Confederation, did not join with Prussia. Following Prussia's victory, Frankfurt was annexed by Prussia, becoming part of the newly formed province of Hesse-Nassau.

Annie Lorrain Smith (23 October 1854 – 7 September 1937) was a British lichenologist whose Lichens (1921) was an essential textbook for several decades. She was also a mycologist and founder member of the British Mycological Society, where she served as president for two terms.
Though born in Liverpool, her family lived in rural Dumfriessshire where her father Walter was Free Church of Scotland minister in Half Morton parish, a few miles north of Gretna Green. She had several talented siblings, including the pathologist, Professor James Lorrain Smith.
After school in Edinburgh she went abroad to study French and German, and then worked as a governess. She moved to London, started studying botany in about 1888 and went to classes at the Royal College of Science taught by D. H. Scott. He found work for her at the British Museum, but she had to be paid from a special fund because women could not be employed there officially. She identified and reported on newly collected fungi, arriving from abroad as well as from the UK, and worked in the museum's cryptogamic herbarium.
In 1904 she was one of the first women admitted to be Fellows of the Linnaean Society after a change in the society's bye-laws.
Her interest in lichenology expanded in 1906 when she agreed to complete a Monograph of the British Lichens left unfinished on the death of James Crombie. This led to her illustrated Handbook of British Lichens (1921), a key to all known British lichens, unique for the next quarter of a century. In the same year Lichens was published and was quickly established as a classic text.
She was committed to the cause of women's suffrage and women's rights. She went on working for many years and in 1931, when she was nearly seventy-seven, was awarded a civil list pension "in recognition of her services to botanical science". In 1934 came an OBE: "Miss Annie Lorrain-Smith, F. L. S. For contributions to mycology and lichenology."[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=34056|startpage=3564|endpage=3565|date=1 June 1934|accessdate=2007-11-15[/tpl]

[[Sweet Sir Galahad]]

CATEGORIES: Joan Baez songs, 1969 songs, Songs written by Joan Baez, Vanguard Records singles

"Sweet Sir Galahad" is a song written by Joan Baez that she famously performed at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, after having debuted the song on appearance in a Season Three episode of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour earlier that year. A recording of the song, first released as a single in late 1969, would lead off Baez' 1970 album One Day at a Time. The song tells the story of Baez' younger sister Mimi Fariña and her second marriage to music producer Milan Melvin.  Mimi and Milan were married at the 1969 Big Sur Folk Festival. Baez was inspired to write the song, after hearing of Melvin's courtship of Fariña, during which he came into her bedroom at night through the window. It has since become one of Baez's best-known compositions.  In her 1987 memoir And a Voice to Sing With, Baez described "Sweet Sir Galahad" as the first song she ever wrote (though she is credited as a co-writer on two tracks on her 1967 album Joan).
In 2006, Baez contributed a "re-tooled" version of the song to Volume 1 of the XM Artist Confidential CD series, available at Starbucks. In the new version, Baez briefly changes the lyric "Here's to the dawn of their days" to "Here's to the dawn of her days," a tribute to the song's subject, Baez's sister Mimi, who had died in 2001. Milan Melvin, aka "Sir Galahad", also died in 2001. 
A live version of the song appears as a bonus track on the 2006 reissue Baez' 1995 live album Ring Them Bells.
It should not be confused with the Sir Galahad song by Rick Wakeman.

According to the pseudo-historical list of 'Thirty Tyrants', the Emperor of the Gallic Empire Postumus had a son, also called Postumus, whom he nominated to be first caesar, and later even augustus and co-ruler. Postumus the Younger would have been killed together with his father in 268, during the rebellion of Laelianus (called Lollianus in the Historia).Historia Augusta (authorship disputed), Tyranni Triginta 4

George Beel (26 February 1900 – 30 December 1980) was a professional footballer who played as a centre forward. He is regarded as the best centre forward in Burnley's history and holds their records for the highest number of goals in a season and the highest number of league goals ever.
He started playing football during World War I playing for Blackpool F.C. – as he was stationed in Blackpool – in the Wartime Leagues, where he impressed enough to earn himself a trial with Manchester United in 1919. However, he did not do enough to get a contract and went to his hometown team Lincoln City in October 1919. He went on to play in the lower reaches of the Football League for Merthyr Town and Chesterfield. After scoring 23 goals in 35 games for the Spirites, many Division One teams were interested in Beel. Burnley were the quickest to make a move and signed him in the summer of 1923. He spent nine years at Turf Moor, where he scored 187 goals in 337 games in all competitions for the Clarets, being their top goal-scorer in six of those seasons and runner-up in another two.
His days at Burnley were numbered when they were relegated to Division Two after Beel had a mediocre year in front of goal. He ended up returning to Lincoln City in 1932 staying for just a year before finishing his career with a season at Rochdale. He then went on to become player-manager at non-league Tunbridge Wells Rangers and later manager of Maidstone United. He decided to stay in Maidstone for the rest of his life and was helping out with junior football throughout the 1970s right up until his death in December 1980.

Black Gold (February 17, 1921 - January 18, 1928) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse that won the 50th running of the Kentucky Derby in 1924.
Black Gold's dam, U-See-it, was owned by Al Hoots.  As a race mare, U-See-it was not fashionably bred, but she was fast.  There was only one horse the Oklahoma-bred never beat in her 6-furlong races at small western tracks: the Hall of Famer Pan Zareta.  U-See-it won 34 starts, and her purse money supported Al Hoots and his wife Rosa.  The Hootses lived in Indian territory and were well known on the Texas/New Orleans racing circuit.  In 1916, Al Hoots entered U-See-it into a claiming race in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, where she was claimed. When Hoots refused to give the mare to her new owner, he and U-See-it were banned from racing for life.  By 1917, Al was dying.  In certain versions of the story, he dreamed that if U-See-it were bred to one of the leading sires of the time, the foal she carried would win the Kentucky Derby.  In other versions, Al merely hoped that this could happen. When oil was discovered in what is now Oklahoma, Rosa Hoots (who was a member of the Osage Nation) shipped U-See-it to the Idle Hour Stock Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, where Colonel E. R. Bradley's Black Toney stood at stud.  The result was a black colt called Black Gold.  Hanley Webb (or Hedley or Harry: depends on the source), who had been a close friend of Al Hoots and also trained U-See-it, was Black Gold's trainer.  The man who groomed and exercised him was also his regular jockey, J. D. Mooney.
Beginning at the New Orleans Fair Grounds on January 8, 1923, Black Gold won nine races in 18 starts as a two-year-old, including his finale.  When he came out as a three-year-old, he won his first two races, then moved up into Stakes company in the Louisiana Derby.  He led from the start, splashing through mud to wire the field and win by six lengths.  Mrs. Hoots was reportedly offered $50,000 for her colt, but turned it down.  After shipping to Churchill Downs in the spring, Black Gold won the Derby Trial.
Black Gold went into the 1924 running of the Derby  as the favorite. In 1924, the Kentucky Derby was fifty years old and was therefore celebrated as the "Golden Jubilee Derby."  It was the first time a golden cup was presented to the winner and the first time "My Old Kentucky Home" was played before the race.  Black Gold won it with a rough trip against strong competition in the last seventy yards.  Ridden by J.D. Mooney, he was bumped and was forced to check, but recovered.  Racing four and five wide, Black Gold overtook Chilhowee to win.
Nicknamed "The Indian Horse," Black Gold did not race in the Preakness or the Belmont Stakes after the Derby.  Instead, he won two more Derbies: the Ohio State Derby, his seventh win in a row,  and the Chicago Derby.  He was the first horse ever to win the Derbies of four different states: Louisiana Derby, Kentucky Derby, Ohio Derby, Chicago Derby.
The Thoroughbred Record said of Black Gold's best season: "...about as vigorous a campaign as a horse could be called upon to undergo, one that knew no let-ups and that never dodged a single issue."
Black Gold was retired to stud, but was not fertile.  At the age of six, he was returned to the racetrack.  He started four more times without a win.  On January 18, 1928, at the age of seven, he started in the Salome Purse at the New Orleans Fair Grounds. In the stretch, he broke down and finished the race on three legs.  He was euthanized at the track.
He was buried in the infield of the Fair Grounds close to the sixteenth pole, next to his mother's old rival, Pan Zareta.  The Thoroughbred Record wrote that Black Gold was "...as game a horse as ever stood on plates, and answered the bugler's call."
A male line descendant of Eclipse, Black Gold was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1989.

[[Allan Hendry]]

CATEGORIES: 1950 births, Living people, Ufologists, American astronomers

Allan Hendry (born 1950) is an American astronomer and ufologist. UFO historian Jerome Clark calls him "one of the most skilled investigators in the history of UFO research."[tpl]cite book | authorlink = Jerome Clark | last = Clark | first = Jerome | title = The UFO Encyclopedia: 2nd Edition; Volume 1, A-K | publisher = Omnigraphics, Inc | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-7808-0097-4 [/tpl] page 481 He was the main investigator for the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) in the 1970s.
He earned a B.A. in astronomy from the University of Michigan in 1972. His wife Dr. Elaine Hendry is a physicist and UFO researcher; she was the editor-in-chief of the Journal of UFO Studies, the only currently living peer reviewed UFO periodical.
Hendry was hired for CUFOS by the organization's founder, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was seeking a full-time investigator with scientific expertise and an open-minded attitude, and who was neither a debunker nor a "UFO believer".
As the chief investigator for CUFOS during most of the 1970s, Hendry personally investigated over 1000 UFO reports. He was able to find mundane explanations for the vast majority of UFO cases, but he also judged a small percentage of cases to be unexplained. One of the most famous "unexplained" cases he investigated was the Val Johnson Incident in 1979, in which a deputy sheriff in Minnesota experienced a "collision" with an unknown object which damaged his patrol car and left him temporarily unconscious. Hendry was the primary ufologist to investigate the case; in 1980 he debated the incident with well-known UFO debunker Philip Klass at a symposium held at the Smithsonian Institution.
He was reluctant to speculate as to origins of the unexplained cases, and argued they might be explainable with further data, leading some researchers to label Hendry a "closet skeptic".see Clark, 1998 At the same time, a few noted skeptics and debunkers who had praised Hendry's scientific rigor subjected him to strong criticism for his conclusion that a handful of well-documented UFO reports seemed to defy analysis, and might represent genuine anomalies. Hendry suggested that the criticism from both camps were little more than ad hominem attacks, since they typically paid little or no attention to the substance of his research.
Hendry's magnum opus was The UFO Handbook,[tpl]cite book | title = The UFO Handbook: A Guide to Investigating, Evaluating and Reporting UFO Sightings | last = Hendry | first = Allan | isbn = 978-0-385-14348-6 | date = August 1979 | publisher = Doubleday [/tpl] a guide for other UFO investigators. In the book, Hendry castigates many mainstream scientists for what he sees as their neglecting UFO studies, but he also had strong criticism for many amateur UFO investigators, who he thought did the subject more harm than good. Clark characterized Hendry's appraisal of ufology in general as "deeply pessimistic", concluding that the subject was all but paralyzed by infighting, a lack of cooperation and standardization, and dubious claims. The UFO Handbook even earned the praise of arch-skeptic Philip J. Klass, who in a review published in The Skeptical Inquirer described the book as "one of the most significant and useful books on the subject ever published."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nicap.org/klassvufo.htm | title = Phil Klass vs. The "UFO Promoters" | authorlink = Jerome Clark | first = Jerome | last = Clark [/tpl] In an undated PBS interview (sometime after 1994, based on publication dates of a few cited books), Klass again recommends Hendry's  book, calling it "Once sic of the best."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/safarchive/3_ask/archive/qna/3282_pklass.html | title = Philip Klass Q&A | publisher = PBS | work = Ask the Scientists [/tpl]
In the early 1980s CUFOS experienced some financial difficulties, and as a result the organization could no longer afford a full-time researcher. In addition, Hendry had come to the conclusion that the methodologies used to study UFOs were ultimately frustrating, inconclusive and futile. As a result, Hendry left CUFOS and has largely avoided further involvement in UFO studies to this day.

Neji (1950-1982) was an American Champion Thoroughbred steeplechase racehorse. Foaled in England, Neji was purchased at age three by Lillian Bostwick Phipps who brought the gelding to race in the United States under future Hall of Fame trainer Pete Bostwick.
In the mid to late 1950s, Neji dominated American steeplechase racing, winning its most prestigious races, including three Grand Nationals. He was voted American Steeplechase Champion in 1955 but in 1956 his season was marred by a leg injury. However, he came back to win Champion honors in 1957 and then for a third time in 1958. The next year his owner sent him to race in England but he met with little success in his three races there. Returning to the U.S., he raced successfully in 1960 and was retired at the end of that racing season with an earnings record that stood for the next 22 years.
In 1966, Neji was inducted in the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

This led to the development of the "provokable nice guy" strategy, a peace-maker until attacked.N.R. Miller, "Nice Strategies Finish First: A Review of The Evolution of Cooperation", Politics and the Life Sciences, Association for Politics and the Life Sciences, 1985. Multiple players continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding the constant aggressor.
The peace war game is a variation of the iterated prisoner's dilemma in which the decisions (Cooperate, Defect) are replaced by (Peace, War). Strategies remain the same with reciprocal altruism, "Tit for Tat", or "provokable nice guy" as the best deterministic one. This strategy is simply to make peace on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his opponent did on the previous move. A slightly better strategy is "Tit for Tat with forgiveness". When the opponent makes war, on the next move, the player sometimes makes peace anyway, with a small probability. This allows an escape from wasting cycles of retribution, a motivation similar to the Rule of Ko in the game of Go. "Tit for Tat with forgiveness" is best when miscommunication is introduced, when one's move is incorrectly reported to the opponent. A typical payoff matrix for two players (A, B) of one iteration of this game is:
|-
! A.. B:
! Peace
! War
|-
! Peace
| ( 2, 2)
| ( 0, 3)
|-
! War
| ( 3, 0)
| ( 1, 1)
|}
Here a player's resources have a value of 2, half of which must be spent to wage war. In this case, there exists a Nash equilibrium, a mutually best response for a single iteration, here (War, War), by definition heedless of consequences in later iterations.The concept is named for its originator, John Forbes Nash, about whom a book, A Beautiful Mind, and popular film were produced. "Provokable nice guy's" optimality depends on iterations. How many are necessary is likely tied to the payoff matrix and probabilities of choosing.Industrial Organization - economics lecture in which the Peace War Game is an example. A subgame perfect version of this strategy is "Contrite Tit-for-Tat" which is to make peace unless one is in "good standing" and one's opponent is not. Good ("standing" assumed) means to make peace with good opponents, make peace when bad, or make war when good and opponent is not.Herbert Gintis, Game Theory Evolving: A Problem-centered Introduction to Modeling Strategic Behavior, Princeton University Press, 2000, p.133

Fedayi (Western [tpl]lang-hy|Ֆէտայի[/tpl] Fedayi; Eastern [tpl]lang-hy|Ֆիդայի[/tpl] Fidayi), also known as the Armenian irregular units or Armenian militia, were Armenian civilians who voluntarily left their families to form self-defense units and armed bands in reaction to the mass murder of Armenians and the pillage of Armenian villages by criminals, tribal Kurdish forces, and Hamidian guards during the reign of Abdul Hamid II in late 19th and early 20th centuries, know as the Hamidian massacres. Their ultimate goal was always to gain Armenian autonomy (Armenakans) or independence (Dashnaks, Hunchaks) depending on their ideology and the degree of oppression visited on Armenians. 
The Armenian term fedayi is derived from Arabic fedayeen: [tpl]lang|ar|فدائيون[/tpl] fidā'īyīn, literally meaning "those who sacrifice".Middle East Glossary - The Israel Project: FEDAYEE[tpl]cite book|title=The Arab-Israeli Conflict|author=Tony Rea and John Wright|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|page=43|isbn=019917170X[/tpl]

[[Field telephone]]
CATEGORIES: Military communications, Telephony equipment

Field telephones are mobile telephones intended for military use, designed to withstand wartime conditions. They can draw power from their own battery, from a telephone exchange (via a central battery known as CB), or from an external power source. Some need no battery, being sound-powered telephones.
Field telephones were first used in the First World War to direct troops. They replaced flag signals and the telegraph as an efficient means of communication. The first field telephones had a wind-up generator, used to power the telephone's ringer & batteries to send the call, and call the manually operated telephone central. This technology was used from the 1910s to the 1960s. Later the ring signal has been made electronically operated by a pushbutton, or automatic as on domestic telephones. The manual systems are still widely used, and are often compatible with the older equipment.
Field telephones operate over wire lines, sometimes commandeering civilian circuits when available, but often using wires strung in combat conditions.An account of line stringing in WW II At least as of World War II, wire communications were the preferred method for the U.S. Army, with radio use only when needed, e.g. to communicate with mobile units, or until wires could be set up. Field phones could operate point to point or via a switchboard at a command post.Signal Operations in the Corps and Army, FM 11-22, U.S. War Department, January 1945 A variety of wire types are used, ranging from light weight "assault wire," e.g. W-130 —[tpl]convert|30|lb/mi|abbr=off|disp=flip[/tpl]— with a talking range about [tpl]convert|5|mi|disp=flip[/tpl], to heavier cable with multiple pairs. Equipment for laying the wire ranges from reels on backpacks to trucks equipped with plows to bury lines.Wire and Cable Equipment, World War II

William M'Culloch (1691 – 18 December 1771) was Minister of Cambuslang during the extraordinary events of the Cambuslang Work (1742) when 30,000 people gathered in the hillsides near his church for preaching and communion. Many were there struck by their own depravity and horrified at the probable punishment after death. Trembling, wailing, great pain, nose-bleeding and other strange behaviour was followed in some cases by striking conversions when they suddenly felt accepted by Christ. This gave rise to great rejoicing and singing. It was later calculated that about 400 people had been converted, though many had backslided. The Reverend M’Culloch was a strange person to be at the centre of this phenomenon — one that was being repeated in the American Colonies at the time. He was a poor preacher and claimed never to have experienced the strong feelings of sin or conversion that so many others had reported.

The Palais de Glace is a French-style Belle Époque building in the Recoleta neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina, located at 1725 Posadas street. Modelled on the Palais des Glaces in Paris, the building was designed by J. L. Ruiz Basadre and inaugurated in 1911 as an ice skating rink and social club.
The circular ice rink occupied a central room around which were arranged theatre-style boxes and rooms for social gatherings. The refrigeration plant was housed in the basement and on the first floor was a balcony, a cafe and organ. The building has a domed roof with a large central skylight which provided natural light for the skating rink below.
As ice skating became less fashionable in the following decade, and tango gained increasing social acceptance, the Palais de Glace was converted into an elegant dance hall and played an important role in the promotion of this new dance phenomenon, initially opposed by the bourgeois elite. Many well-known tango orchestras and dancers appeared here over the years but towards the end of the 1920s the venue went into decline and in 1931 the building was taken over by the local authority and given to the Ministry of Education and Justice.  
From now on the building was used to house the National Office of Fine Arts and the annual [tpl]lang|es|Salón Nacional de Bellas Artes[/tpl] (National Exhibition of Fine Arts) was held there from 1932 until 1954. Starting in 1931 the interior of the building was remodelled by the architect and artist Alejandro Bustillo, to provide exhibition rooms whilst respecting the original design, and in 1934 three large murals were painted on the interior walls. In 1935 the exterior of the building was radically altered. 
In 1938 an exhibition of television equipment was staged here and between 1954 and 1960 the building was used as a studio annex by the television station Canal Siete. During this period the Salón Nacional was held at various venues including the National Museum of Fine Arts and the Argentine National Congress.
Since 1960 the Palais de Glace has hosted the [tpl]lang|es|Salón Nacional[/tpl] together with a range of other art exhibitions and musical events.   In 2004 the building was declared a National Historic Monument.

Some detainee's transcripts record that they reported abuse, without recording any reaction from the field grade officers they addressed.
Some detainee's transcripts record that they reported abuse, and record the Tribunal or Board's President asking whether the abuse was at the hands of American soldiers, or whether it took place in Guantanamo.
In some cases, when the detainee reported abuse, while at Guantanamo, the transcripts record that the Presidents then promised to forward the reports of abuse to an appropriate authority.
Presidents never named the authority who might investigate the abuse.  And they never told the detainee how that authority would decide whether to initiate an investigation.  They never told the detainees what measures that authority would take if they initiated an investigation and determined the detainee's report was credible.
The Department of Defense has yet to release any reports of any investigations following up the reports of abuse addressed to the officers staffing Combatant Status Review Tribunal or Administrative Review Boards.

[[Arrows A20]]
CATEGORIES: Arrows Formula One cars, 1999 Formula One season cars

The Arrows A20 was the car with which the Arrows Formula One team competed in the 1999 Formula One season.  It was driven by Pedro de la Rosa, a Spanish débutant, and Japan's Toranosuke Takagi, who moved from the defunct Tyrrell team.
The team was short of funds with the lack of a major sponsor (Danka's sponsorship having ended at the end of 1998) and the chassis was a development of the A19, which had not been too competitive itself.  Engine builder Brian Hart supplied in-house engines, but it became clear that his small resources were insufficient to compete in modern F1, and he left the team after an ownership dispute with Tom Walkinshaw.
At the start of the year a colourful Nigerian prince, Malik ado Ibrahim, bought a 25% shareholding in the team, and his T-Minus brand appeared on the cars for most of the year. However, he too could not provide sufficient funding. The idea behind the T-Minus brand was that companies and corporations would purchase the rights to use the name and they would be permitted to use the brand to promote their products. Malik stated that he had intentions to use the brand in conjunction with Lamborghini but a deal never pulled through. An Arrows employee of the time stated 'The T-Minus brand has bought in absolutely no money over the year' and carried on stating 'It was simply a dream in the Prince's head and nothing materialised.'   [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.f1rejects.com/centrale/arrows/index.html |title=Risky Business: The TWR Arrows Years 1996-2002 |publisher=F1 Rejects |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09[/tpl]
The year proved to be a disaster, as the cars were slow and unreliable, and the team ended up battling with Minardi at the back of the grid. Its only competitive showing came in the opening race of the season at Melbourne, where de la Rosa finished sixth for a point on his début, with Takagi one place back in seventh. Only this point, and newcomer BAR's poor finishing record, kept Arrows from finishing last in the Constructors' standings.
While de la Rosa proved promising, Takagi struggled with communication issues as he could not speak English at the time and left at the end of the season; he was replaced for 2000 by Jos Verstappen.

The station first went on the air in the early 1980s as a rebroadcaster of CBF in Montreal.  For many years, Radio-Canada programming had aired on privately owned affiliate CHLT.  However, in 1979, CHLT received permission to disaffiliate from Radio-Canada as soon as Radio-Canada could set up its own station there.CHLT/CKOY history Despite Sherbrooke's large size, the CBC opted not to open a full-fledged station there at first.
However, in 2000, the CBC received permission to upgrade its Sherbrooke operation to a full-fledged station, despite retaining a rebroadcaster-like call sign.CRTC Decision 2000-89 Despite officially being a station in its own right, it is still essentially a semi-satellite of CBF.  It airs its own afternoon drive show (Estrie-Express, Monday to Friday from 3 to 5 p.m.) and simulcasts CBF at all other times.

August 28, 1983 CAUSA was an acronym for "Confederation of the Associations for the Unification of the Societies of the Americas", and is also Spanish for "cause."  In the 1980s CAUSA International was active in 21 countries.

"Another church political arm, Causa International, which preaches a philosophy it calls "Godism," has been spending millions of dollars on expense-paid seminars and conferences for Senate staffers, Hispanic Americans and conservative activists. It also has contributed $500,000 to finance an anticommunist lobbying campaign headed by John T. (Terry) Dolan, chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC)." In 1986 it produced the anti-Communist documentary film Nicaragua Was Our Home.Public TV Tilts Toward Conservatives, Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting "While conservatives dismiss Bill Moyers' world-class documentaries on our constitutional checks and balances as "propaganda," they never mention PBS's airing of unabashed right-wing agitprop films such as Nicaragua Was Our Home (the pro-contra film produced by Rev. Sun Myung Moon's CAUSA, which funded the contras after Congress' ban)..."
CAUSA International promotes a worldview which it calls "Godism" as an alternative to Marxism.  People of all religions are welcome to take part in CAUSA activities. Donald Sills, a fundamentalist Christian pastor and CAUSA organizer, said:

The Palace of Peace and Reconciliation ([tpl]lang-kk|Бейбітшілік пен келісім сарайы[/tpl]), also translated as the Pyramid of Peace and Accord, is a 77 m high building in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. The structure was built 
by Sembol Construction at a cost of 8.74 billion Kazakh tenge (about $58 million) and opened in late 2006.
The pyramid portion of the building is 62 m high which sits on a 15 m high earth covered block. All of this construction is above ground level. Though the landscaping of the park rises up to cover the lower levels, these are not in fact basements.
It was designed by the British architects Foster and Partners (lead design). Turkish architectural firm Tabanlıoğlu Architects undertook construction information packages for the Foster design and engineers Buro Happold undertook lead structural and services design. The Foster team was led by architects Nigel Dancey, Peter Ridley and Lee Hallman. Sembol Construction undertook a Design and Build contract, and were ultimately responsible for the final details and finishes, some of which varied considerably from the Foster and Tabanlıoğlu (Tabanlioglu) intent. Auditorium and performance equipment design was by Anne Minors Performance Consultants and acoustics by Sound Space Design.
The structure is made up of five "storeys" of triangles, each triangle being 12 m on a side. The lower portions, three "storeys" of triangles, are clad in pale granite. The upper two rows of triangles, 4 triangles per side, form a glazed apex; instead of stone cladding the triangles of the apex feature a design of stained glass by Brian Clarke, incorporating doves.
Construction is of steel frame for the pyramid and concrete for the lower levels.  The engineers had to design the building to withstand expansion and contraction due to temperature variations of over 80°C, from -40 to over 40°C - leading to an expansion of the building of up to 30 cm.
The Pyramid was specially constructed to host the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. It contains accommodations for different religions: Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Daoism and other faiths. It also houses a 1,500-seat opera house, a national museum of culture, a new "university of civilization", a library and a research center for Kazakhstan's ethnic and geographical groups. This diversity is unified within the pure form of a pyramid, 62m (203ft) high with a 62x62m (203x203ft) base. The building is conceived as a global center for religious understanding, the renunciation of violence and the promotion of faith and human equality. 
The Pyramid of Peace expresses the spirit of Kazakhstan, where cultures, traditions and representatives of various nationalities coexist in peace, harmony and accord. Bathed in the golden and pale blue glow of the glass (colors taken from the Kazakhstan flag), 200 delegates from the world's main religions and faiths will meet every three years in a circular chamber — based on the United Nations Security Council meeting room in New York. ; Height: [tpl]convert|77|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl]p total area: 25,500 sq.m.; Accommodates: Opera Hall for 1,500 seats, The Museum of National History, The Research Center of World Religions, Library of Spiritual Religious Literature, Exhibition and conference rooms [tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=8716b3c7922d6003e1bd242a8a569655 |title=The Palace Of Peace and Concord (Pyramid), Astana, Kazakhstan by BAR - 3D Warehouse |publisher=Sketchup.google.com |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2013-11-24[/tpl]

As well as these placements, the organisation exhibited in galleries - for example in INN70 at the Hayward Gallery in London,1971 and other venues including a retrospective review at Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1977 and at documenta 6 in the same year.

CATEGORIES: German divisions of World War I, Divisions of Germany, Finnish Civil War, Military units and formations established in 1918, Military units and formations disestablished in 1919

The Baltic Sea Division ([tpl]Lang-de|Ostsee-Division[/tpl]) was a 10,000 man German military unit commanded by Rüdiger von der Goltz. The core of the division comprised two army brigades from the German eastern front: 95. Reserve Infantry Brigade (led by Colonel K. Wolff) and 2. Guards Cavalry Brigade (led by Colonel H. von Tschirsky und von Bögendorff). They were supported by additional artillery and pioneer troops, and transported to Finland by a naval squadron led by Hugo Meurer.
The military activity of the Division in Finland served part of the foreign policy of the German Empire after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Soviet Russia, signed on 3 March 1918. Germany aimed to establish a chain of satellite states in eastern Europe in order to provide raw materials for German industry and food products for the German people.
The Finnish Senate of Vaasa had requested German military aid for the Whites. The Finnish Senate paid all the financial costs of the military intervention of the Baltic Sea Division and urged the Finnish people to provide food, shelter, and any other aid needed by the Baltic Sea Division.
During the Finnish Civil War, on 3 April 1918, it landed at Hanko and moved towards Helsinki and Lahti. The Baltic Sea Division quickly took back Helsinki from the Social Democrats of Finland, who had previously deposed the official government in Helsinki. This enabled the Senate to return to Helsinki.[ref]

[[Ploughing on Sunday]]

CATEGORIES: Poetry by Wallace Stevens

"Ploughing on Sunday" is a poem from Wallace Stevens's first book of poetry, Harmonium (1923). First published in 1919, it is now in the public domain.Buttel, p. 198.

Interpretations of this poem have been both strictly metaphorical and philosophical. At one extreme is the suggestion http://knitandcontemplation.typepad.com/dao_wallace_stevens/2004/10/index.html
that the poem is about the sexual act. The Oxford English Dictionary recognizes a sense in which "to plough" means to have sexual intercourse. Its most recent citation for this use is "P. CAREY Jack Maggs (1998) xlvi. 167 Edward Constable had been..reamed, rogered, ploughed by Henry Phipps so that he could barely walk straight to the table."
A different interpretation by Helen Vendler suggests that Stevens writes about the experience of being a poet, "There, while his docile neighbors troop off to church, the poet, violating the Sabbath, blasphemously harnesses his team to plough and takes to the fields, full of indiscriminate joy in the sun and wind alike..."Vendler, p. 13.
At a philosophical extreme is the argument that the poem is about artists in North America imaginatively cultivating the reality of the New World with exuberant disregard for old European strictures. In this regard, it is comparable to "The Paltry Nude Starts on a Spring Voyage" which Vendler interprets as being about "new American art". The latter readings acknowledge the symbolism of the sun as representing reality, the moon imagination.
Stevens described the poem as a "fanfaronnade"Stevens, p. 338. and was accustomed to listening to
Dvořák,"...I had the usual Sunday evening listening to a good deal of Dvorjak". This is consistent with reading "Ploughing on Sunday" as a poetic fanfaronnade, a parallel to Dvořák's Symphony Number 9
("From the New World"). This fits well with the more philosophically-driven reading which also easily harmonizes with the references to North America and Remus (as an allusion to the founding of Rome), whereas alternate readings struggle on these points. Environmentalists might agree that North America has been "rogered" by immigration and industrial development but it's unlikely Stevens had that in mind. And if the poem were simply about the poet's joyfully exulting in his powers, why does North America (and a North American gamebird) provide the context for that, rather than any other geographical setting, such as Hartford, Connecticut, or the Western Hemisphere?
The Stevenses observed the old custom of refraining from physical labor on Sundays, not even cooking.Morse, p. 9. This will be disturbing for those who analyze poetry by reference to biography; it would pose a problem for Vendler's interpretation.
Buttel detects the influence of Walt Whitman in the poem's expansive wit, exaggeration and slap at the blue laws. He also sees in the poem Stevens's awareness of rural and frontier America and, "in Remus, to the Negroes and other reminders of the native folk tradition."Buttel, p. 199.

Sharnbrook railway station was opened in 1857 by the Midland Railway to serve the village of Sharnbrook in Bedfordshire, England. It was on the Midland's extension from Leicester to Bedford and Hitchin. 
It was situated near to Sharnbrook Summit. Here, originally there was a 1 in 119 gradient from the south taking the line to 340 feet above sea level. Around 1880, the line was quadrupled, with the new goods tracks taken through Sharnbrook Tunnel. Following this, in 1884, a long curve, the Wymington Deviation allowed the ruling gradient on the slow/goods lines to be reduced to 1 in 200.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books
It closed in 1960 and the station buildings were subsequently demolished.
The slow/goods lines were singled and put up to passenger standard in 1987.  As of 2007 they see one train a day plus occasional engineering diversions, such as on the weekend 6/7 May 2007.

He gets down to music without any pre-judgment, surrendering to any foreign or strange influences to create unerring bridges to follow his very personal direction. Eberhard Schoener's work is difficult to describe as there are too many completely diverse compositions and an array of projects and events. Such versatility is reflected in his Biography.

The Alliance for Excellent Education (AEE) is a national policy, research and advocacy organization that works to develop a national consensus and policy agenda to transform American high schools. To do this, AEE advocates at the federal level for funding and policies to ensure resources are targeted to at-risk students in middle school and high school. In addition, AEE is building a national network of allies for education to support its efforts.Alliance for Excellent Education
AEE was founded by Gerard and Lilo Leeds.  Mr. and Mrs. Leeds had retired from CMP Media, Inc., the technology publishing company they launched in 1971.  When, in 1988, the Leeds turned the management of their company over to two of their sons, they turned their attention to philanthropy and in 1990 the couple launched the Institute for Student Achievement (ISA), which works in partnership with low-performing school districts to help at-risk middle- and high-school students.Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado
Hoping to build on the success of ISA and implement it nationally, Mr. and Mrs. Leeds founded AEE in December 1999 and hired Susan Frost as the first President in 2001.  Frost had served for six years as advisor to U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley and for 11 years as executive director of the Committee for Education Funding (CEF).  As President of AEE, Frost helped identify the weaknesses in President George W. Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act and recognized key strategies for policymakers to help schools raise student achievement and graduation rates. The Alliance called on national policymakers to expand the federal role in education to high school students with initiatives in adolescent literacy, teacher and principal quality, college preparation planning, and smaller, more personalized learning communities. Legislation that embodied these recommendations was then introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives (the Graduation for All Act) and the Senate (the PASS Act). 
On August 3, 2004 Frost resigned as President of AEE.  In February 2005 former West Virginia Governor Bob Wise was hired as AEE’s second President.  Under his leadership, AEE increased in size and expanded its policies to include work in states.About Bob Wise

Psychic Detectives or Psychic Investigators is a television program produced by StoryHouse Productions for Court TV, as of 2006 in its 5th season. The program documents real-life cases of situations in which police departments have enlisted the aid of psychics in solving difficult cases. The series production does not investigate the claims of the psychics showcased or confirm their claims.  For entertainment it instead recreates some of the atmosphere surrounding psychic claims using a selection of well recognized intuitives, crime psychics, psychic detectives and supporters of paranormal beliefs.  A cross section of paranormal psychics are profiled though most are women who typically are engaged as self-described psychic mediums communicating with the dead.

CATEGORIES: Maya queens, 681 births, Year of death unknown

Lady Kʻabʻal Xook [tpl]IPA-myn|kʼaɓal ʃoːk||[/tpl] or Lady Xoc was a Maya Queen consort of Yaxchilan and is considered to have been one of the most powerful and prominent women in Maya civilization. She was the principal wife and aunt of the King Itzamnaaj B'alam II who ruled Yaxchilan from AD 681 to 742. 
She is believed by many to have been the sister of Lady Pacal. Yaxchilan is located in Chiapas, Mexico and is considered to be one of the more prominent of the Maya civilizations. Laughton reports that hieroglyphs in Yaxchilan indicate that the city was known to its citizens as ‘The Place of the Split Sky.’
Lady Xoc is best known for adorning Structure 23 in Yaxchilan with 3 lintels (Lintel 24, Lintel 25, and Lintel 26) that depict her performing rituals. Royal women of Maya civilization are often depicted via texts and iconography like lintels. However, other women of Maya culture are not depicted in this manner. Also, Lady Xoc appears in the images performing ritual sacrifices which women were not typically seen doing in ancient Maya art. It is through Lady Xoc and her lintels that we understand just how involved royal women were with Maya rituals and politics. It has even been suggested that Lady Xoc acted as a regent.

The building was a meeting place for the members of Western Federation of Miners Local No. 32. In June 1904, the Colorado National Guard shot at miners taking refuge in the union hall during the Colorado Labor Wars.[tpl]Cite journal |title=SHOTS FIRED FROM WINDOWS.; Miners Hoisted White Flag When Troops Stormed Building. |journal=The New York Times |date=June 6, 1904 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E2DB153EE033A25754C0A9609C946597D6CF  |archiveurl=http://www.rebelgraphics.org/wfmhall/NYT_Article_4_26_1904.html |archivedate=2010-01-01 [/tpl] The building bears at least nine bullet holes from the attack.
The union deeded the hall to the Victor School District in the 1920s. It was abandoned in the 1970s and used briefly in the 1980s as a restaurant.
As of 2005, two of the five beams supporting the roof have broken and the group applied for a grant from the Colorado Historical Society to replace the roof.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gazette.com/onset?id=16933&template=article.html |title=Victor hall hanging by thread |accessdate= |last=Correll |first=Deedee |date=2005-03-30 |work= The Gazette |publisher=Colorado Springs |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl]

[[Roller hockey (Quad)]]

CATEGORIES: Roller hockey, Indoor sports, Team sports, Variations of hockey, Roller skating, Ball games

Roller Hockey (Quad) or just roller hockey (in British English) or rink hockey (in American English), is a team sport that enjoys significant popularity in a number of Latin countries.
Two five-man teams (four skaters and one goalkeeper) try to drive the ball with their sticks into the opponents' goal. The ball can only be put in motion by a stick. The game has two 25-minute halves (for adults), with the clock stopping when the ball becomes dead. Each team has a one-minute timeout in each half. Each team has a minimum of six players (a backup goalie is required) and a maximum of ten.
Players use quad skates, whereas inline skates are used in inline hockey. Excessive contact between players is forbidden in rink hockey, unlike inline hockey.
Roller Hockey was a demonstration rollersport in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. There have been many world championships, Latin countries dominating the sport since the 1940s:Spain (16 World titles) including the last 5,  Portugal (15 World titles),  Italy (4 World titles) and Argentina (4 World titles). Other countries, such as France, Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, Andorra and England are regular international competitors, but rarely overcome the traditional powers.
Roller Hockey is a very fast sport, which may create a problem for TV transmissions, and new rinks are built using blue or white pavement to make the ball more visible on TV.
The most important clubs in Europe (and, arguably, the world) are SL Benfica, FC Porto, OC Barcelos and Sporting CP from Portugal, FC Barcelona, Reus Deportiu, Igualada HC and Liceo La Coruña from Spain, and occasionally Primavera Prato, Follonica and Bassano Hockey 54 from Italy. In terms of trophies won FC Barcelona is the most successful team having won nineteen European Cups.
In 2013, a world cup of roller hockey took place in Angola, for the first time on the African continent, won by Spain being the country with most victories in history.

Heuston Gate is a proposed skyscraper development for Dublin in Ireland. Heuston Gate was planned to contain at its heart a 32 storey tower, which would have been either Ireland's tallest or second tallest building depending on when the U2 Tower was completed.http://skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=1333 Designed by Paul Keogh Architects the tower was commissioned by the Office of Public Works as part of the OPW’s major urban renewal project at Military Road Kilmainham.http://www.pka.ie
It was planned to erect the tower on the western fringe of Dublin city centre facing onto Heuston Station, an important rail transport terminus from which the development gains its name. The proposal was to create a new mixed use neighbourhood and active ground level activities to encourage street life and a pedestrian-friendly public area.http://www.independent.ie/national-news/skyscrapers-scaling-new-heights-to-beat-council-cutoff-point-1280711.html It aspired to be a model of environmental sustainability, using energy saving technologies such as solar power, district heating, high insulation levels and heat recovery systems. The design was audited using the BREAM energy rating method. However, due to the economic downturn in Ireland, it was announced the project would not proceed.

Banja was separated for Banja Shekudad and Guagusa Shekudad woredas.
The woreda administration announced that by 22 March 2009, Banja had achieved 100% coverage of sanitation facilities, an increase from 0.03% in the 1990s, and 61% as recently as 2005. Through an innovative program which focussed on education of every resident of the woreda, the local Health Desk was able to convince the inhabitants of all 26 kebeles to construct enough latrines to ensure each household was no further than 6 meters from a latrine, as well as building one common latrine in every village. In addition, there are now public latrines for passers-by and boys who stay and sleep in the field herding cattle and sheep. However, only 28% of inhabitants currently have access to safe water.Hailu T., "A success story: amid grim national figures, Banja achieves 100% sanitation coverage", The Reporter (Ethiopia), 21 March 2009 (accessed 5 May 2009)

The pipeline was to be constructed jointly by E.ON Ruhrgas and Wingas, a joint venture of Wintershall, subsidiary of BASF, and Russian Gazprom.  The project was expected to cost €600 million ($759.2 million). Project was stopped in November 2008, mainly due to difficulties in financing. According to Wingas, the pipeline project was not economically sustainable; hence the halt of operations.[ref]

[[ThreeBallot]]

CATEGORIES: Electoral systems, Elections

ThreeBallot is a voting protocol invented by Ron Rivest.
ThreeBallot is an end-to-end (E2E) auditable voting system that can in principle be implemented on paper. The goal in its design was to provide some of the benefits of a cryptographic voting system without using cryptography.
It may be difficult for a vote to be both verifiable and anonymous. ThreeBallot attempts to solve this problem by giving each voter three ballots: one verifiable, and two anonymous.  The voter chooses which ballot is verifiable and keeps this secret; since the vote-counter does not know, there is a 1/3 chance of being discovered destroying or altering any single ballot.  The voter is forced to make two of his three ballots cancel each other out, so that he can only vote once.

Michael M. Merzenich (born in 1942 in Lebanon, Oregon) is a professor emeritus neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. His contributions to the field are numerous. He took the sensory cortex maps developed by his predecessors like Archie Tunturi, Clinton Woolsey, Vernon Mountcastle, Wade Marshall, and Philip Bard, and refined them using dense micro-electrode mapping techniques. Using this, he definitively showed there to be multiple somatotopic maps of the body in the postcentral sulcus, and multiple tonotopic maps of the acoustic inputs in the superior temporal plane.Brain Research 50:275-96 1973 
He led the cochlear implant team at UCSF,Med. Biol. Eng. Computing 21:241–54 1983 which transferred its technology to Advanced Bionics, and their version is the Clarion cochlear implant. He collaborated with Bill Jenkins and Gregg Recanzone to demonstrate sensory maps are labile into adulthood in animals performing operant sensory tasks.[ref]

[/ref]  This was based on Fast ForWord software they co-invented that produces improvements in children's language skills that has been related to the magnitude of their temporal processing impairments prior to training.Science 271:77–84 1996 
Merzenich was director and Chief Scientific Officer between November 1996 and January 2003.  Merzenich took two sabbaticals from UCSF in 1997 and 2004.  In 1997 he led research teams at Scientific Learning Corporation, and in 2004 at Posit Science Corporation. Currently, Merzenich's second company, Posit Science, is working on a broad range of behavioral therapies.  Their lead product is brain-training application called BrainHQ (TM).BrainHQ Merzenich is Chief Scientific Officer and on the Board of Directors at Posit Science.

The Fender Bullet Bass is an electric bass guitar model produced by Fender.  It was introduced in 1982 as a part of a new line of guitars meant to replace the outgoing Mustang and Musicmaster - Fender's so called "student" guitars.  The Bullet Bass had Mustang style pickups, but was available with a standard 34" neck in addition to the short scale 30" neck that the Mustang had.  These instruments were only produced in the USA for a couple years until Fender decided to transfer Bullet production to Japan in 1984/85.  They then fell under Fender's newly active Squier branding.
Unlike the Mustang, the Fender Bullet line has not been reissued by Fender - lending these rare instruments an air of mystery.

[[Music festival]]

CATEGORIES: Music festivals

A music festival is a festival oriented towards music that is sometimes presented with a theme such as musical genre, nationality or locality of musicians, or holiday. They are commonly held outdoors, and are often inclusive of other attractions such as food and merchandise vending, performance art, and social activities. The Pythian Games at Delphi included musical performances, and may be one of the earliest festivals known.1911 Encyclopædia Britannica[tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] During the Middle Ages festivals were often held as competitions.
Many festivals are annual, or repeat at some other interval. Some, including many rock festivals, are held only once. Some festivals are organized as for-profit concerts and others are benefits for a specific cause.
Another type of music festival is the educative type, organised annually in local communities, regionally or nationally, for the benefit of amateur musicians of all ages and grades of achievement. While entrants perform prepared pieces in the presence of an audience which includes competitors, the essential feature of this type of festival is that each participant receives verbal and written feedback, there and then, from a highly qualified, professional adjudicator—someone whom they might never meet in any other way. They also usually receive a certificate, classified according to merit, and some may win trophies. The competitive element is often played down, however, as the important aspect is that participants can learn from one another. Such festivals aim to provide a friendly and supportive platform for musicians to share in the excitement of making music. For many they provide a bridge between lessons & examinations and performing confidently in public.
The world's largest music festival is the Donauinselfest which is held for three days every year in Vienna, Austria. Each year, it attracts 2.5 to 3 million spectators.[tpl]cite web|title=Drei Millionen Besucher am Donauinselfest|url=http://derstandard.at/1339638828741/Trotz-nassen-Endes-Drei-Millionen-Besucher-am-Donauinselfest|work=http://derstandard.at|accessdate=26 March 2014|language=German[/tpl]  Milwaukee, Wisconsin's 11-day event, Summerfest, promotes itself as "The World's Largest Music Festival", a title certified by the Guinness World Records and held since 1999.

[[Underlying representation]]
CATEGORIES: Phonology

In some models of phonology as well as morphophonology in the field of linguistics, the underlying representation (UR) or underlying form (UF) of a word or morpheme is the abstract form that a word or morpheme is postulated to have before any phonological rules have applied to it.[tpl]cite book|last=Bromberger|first=Sylvain|title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2006|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|location=Detroit|pages=551-553|edition=2nd|coauthors=Morris Halle|editor=Donald M. Borchert|accessdate=2 November 2013|chapter=Phonology[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Contemporary Linguistics|year=2005|publisher=Bedord/St. Martin's|location=Boston|page=92|coauthors=John Archibald[/tpl]  By contrast, a surface representation is the phonetic representation of the word or sound. The concept of an underlying representation is central to generative grammar.[tpl]cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken|page=501|chapter=underlying (adj.)[/tpl] 
If more phonological rules apply to the same underlying form, they can apply wholly independently of each other or in a feeding or counterbleeding order. The underlying representation of a morpheme is considered to be invariable across related forms (except in cases of suppletion), despite alternations among various allophones on the surface.

"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" is a song written by Australian singer and painter Rolf Harris in 1957 which became a hit across the world in the 1960s in two recordings (1960 in Australia and the United Kingdom for the original, and 1963 with a re-recording of his song in the United States). Inspired by Harry Belafonte's calypsos, it is about an Australian stockman on his deathbed. The song is one of the best-known and most successful Australian songs.
Harris originally offered four unknown Australian backing musicians 10% of the royalties for the song in 1960, but they decided to take a recording fee of £28 among them because they thought the song would be a flop.Did you know... page 18 "Westside News", 20 February 2008 — Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
The recording peaked at No. 1 in the Australian chartsRolf Harris lyrics and was a Top 10 hit in the UK in 1960. In 1963 Harris re-recorded the song in the UK with George Martin as producer and this remake of the song reached No. 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and spent three weeks atop the easy listening chart in 1963.The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 6th Edition, 1996 Harris re-recorded his song a second time along with The Wiggles in 2000 with the introductory verse and the verse mentioning the stockman's death omitted. It is still popular today as a children's song.
The distinctive sound of Harris' original recording was achieved by the use of an instrument of his own design called the "wobble board" — a two- by three-foot piece of hardboardMasonite.Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport at Time.com, retrieved on 3/14/2008.

[[Common sole]]

CATEGORIES: Soleidae, Fish of the North Sea, Edible fish, Commercial fish, Animals described in 1758, Seafood red list

The common sole, Dover sole, or black sole, Solea solea, is a species of flatfish in the Soleidae family. 
It has a preference for relatively shallow water with sand or mud covering the bottom. 
It is found in the Eastern Atlantic ocean, from the south of Norway to Senegal, and in almost all of the Mediterranean Sea. In the winter it withdraws to the somewhat warmer waters of the Southern North Sea. 
In the UK a small sole is commercially called a "slip".
The small eyes are close to each other on the right-hand side of the body. This gives the fish the possibility of lurking half-buried in the sand for passing prey. The common sole, just like all other flatfish, hatches as an "ordinary" fish with one eye on each side of the body.  The young metamorphose to flatfish when they are about one cm long. The common sole approaches a maximum length of approximately 70 cm. 
Chefs prize Dover sole for its mild, buttery sweet flavour and versatility and for its ease of filleting. The fish yields fillets that hold together well in a variety of recipes.
The name "Dover" comes from Dover, the English fishing port landing the most sole in the 19th century.

Cecile of France (1097 – after 1145) was a daughter of Philip I of FranceIvan Gobry, Histoire des Rois de France, Philippe Ier, père de Louis VI, Paris, Pygmalion, 2003, p. 366. ISBN 2-85704-799-1 and Bertrade de Montfort.The Historia Regum Francorum Monasterii Sancti Dionysii names "Philippum et Florum et filiam unam" as children of "Philippus rex et Fulconi Rechin Andagavorum comiti uxorem", specifying that the (unnamed) daughter married "Tanchredus Anthiochenus". Her parentage is recorded by William of Tyre, who also records her marriages.Cecile of France. Medieval Lands.
Her first marriage was arranged while Bohemond I of Antioch was visiting the French court seeking support against Alexios I Komnenos. She sailed for Antioch at the end of 1106 and became Lady of TarsusSturdza, M. D. (1999).

Cecile married firstly (late 1106) Tancred, Prince of Galilee, Regent of Antioch, who succeeded in 1111 as Prince of Antioch.
While dying in 1112, Tancred made Pons of Tripoli, promise to marry her, and Tancred gave her the fortresses of Arcicanum and Rugia as a dowry. They married in 1115. In 1133, Pons was besieged at his castle of Montferrand by Imad ad-Din Zengi, atabeg of Mosul, in 1133, and Cecile appealed to her half-brother Fulk, King of Jerusalem, to come to his aid. Zengi abandoned the siege, but during a second siege in 1137, Pons was captured and killed. He was succeeded by his son with Cecile, Raymond II. Cecile died in 1145.

The Explosive Substances Act 1883 (c. 3) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  It makes it illegal to use -- or conspire or intend to use -- any explosive substance to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, whether or not any explosion actually takes place.  A person guilty of an offence under this law is liable to imprisonment for life.  
Under this Act it is also an offence, subject to imprisonment for two years, to possess explosives under suspicious circumstances, that is where you can't properly explain why you have them.  
Anyone who helps someone to commit a crime under this law by providing money, materials, premises, or any other assistance, shall be tried and punished as severely as the person who actually uses the explosives.  
Witnesses who are called during the official investigation or the trial can be arrested to prevent them from absconding, and do not have the right of silence to protect themselves from self-incrimination.  On the other hand, self-incriminating evidence from a witness can't be used in a different criminal or civil proceeding.

Walter Scott Stuart Lyon (Trevelyan 1887 – 8 May 1915)
Son of Walter F. K. and Isabella R. Lyon, of Tantallon Lodge, North Berwick.
One of the war poets. He  was one of five brothers from North Berwick, Scotland, three of whom were killed in the war and one died at Haileybury. Walter went to Balliol College, Oxford and a career as a Scottish Advocate.
He volunteered for the 9th Battalion Royal Scots before the war and was sent to Belgium in February 1915, to the trenches near Glencose Wood outside Ypres. He served as a lieutenant. Soon after he wrote two poems, Easter at Ypres and Lines Written in a Fire Trench. A few weeks later while the Second Battle of Ypres was at its fiercest, he wrote two more poems, On a Grave in a Trench, which he inscribed "English killed for Patrie", and I Tracked a Dead Man Down a Trench.
In early May Walter Lyon and the Royal Scots were in dugouts in Potijze Wood near the Menin Road, just 200 yards from the firing line. The shelling was so fierce that trees were torn up by the roots and the tops sliced by shrapnel. The stream of wounded from the wood was continuous and Walter Lyon was among the dead. A collection of his poems was published in 1916 and two are included in an anthology of Public School War Poetry called "A Deep Cry" published in 1993.
No known grave. Name listed on the Menin Gate in Ypres, panel 11.

Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack, is one of the earliest plays written by W.S. Gilbert, his first solo stage success. The work is a musical burlesque of Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore, and the music was arranged by Mr. Van Hamme.Burgess, p. 307 It opened at the St James's Theatre on 29 December 1866, the last item in a long evening, following a farce and Dion Boucicault's new play Hunted Down."The London Theatres", The London Review, 5 January 1867, p. 18  Dulcamara ran for a successful 120 nights.
The popularity of the piece encouraged further commissions for opera burlesques from Gilbert, who wrote four more between 1867 and 1869. Dulcamara and its successors all comply with the burlesque traditions of the day, with dialogue in rhyming couplets, convoluted puns throughout, and an array of attractive actresses in tights or short skirts, playing male roles, a practice Gilbert renounced as soon as he was sufficiently influential in the theatre.Stedman, Jane.

[[Henry Hensche]]
CATEGORIES: 20th-century American painters, German emigrants to the United States, 1899 births, 1992 deaths, People from Provincetown, Massachusetts

Henry Hensche (February 25, 1899 - December 10, 1992) was an American painter and teacher. Born in Gelsenkirchen,Germany, Henry Hensche came to the United States by way of the port of Antwerp, Belgium. He (Heinrich, changed to Henry)is listed on the ship's manifest as age 11 years old when he arrived at Ellis Island aboard the British steamship S.S. Kroonland on March 3, 1909, along with his sister Erna, and his father Fritz (later changed to Fred). (Hensche's birth year is often mentioned as 1898, 1899, or 1901, most likely 1898- he did not make an effort to correct this. At times his city of birth is cited as Chicago, year of birth 1901- again, Hensche made no effort to discourage that date or place of birth; perhaps due to anti- German sentiment during the World Wars).His mother is thought to have died before he was two, although this is not verified. She was either unable (deceased) or unwilling to travel to America with the family. 
At the age of 17 Hensche began to work in the stockyards. He aspired to work with Frank Lloyd Wright, the famous architect who was active in Chicago, but several of Hensche's teachers encouraged him to apply to the Art Institute of Chicago.  Hensche applied and, “I was surprised that they did take me...and that was my start in the painting world...” Hensche studied the old masters and their techniques, but was drawn to the work of the Impressionists which were on exhibit. Several students at the Institute had previously studied with Charles Webster Hawthorne at the Cape Cod School of Art. Hensche admired their techniques with color and decided to leave the Institute (which was not an easy decision) and travel to Provincetown, Massachusetts. By the spring of 1919 he had made it to the Art Students League in New York City and took classes with, among others, George Bellows.
By the summer of 1919, Hensche arrived in Provincetown. There he met Charles W. Hawthorne, who became his mentor.  Hensche recognized in Hawthorne his search for the “bright and savage colors” that he had first seen back at the Art Institute of Chicago. Hensche appreciated and embraced the Hawthorne “color note” approach to painting. He saw this as the advancement from Monet that it was. “Monet was a painter; he didn’t teach. What was needed was a way to put his principles into some kind of teachable form...in the America of that day, William Merritt Chase was the most famous teacher. He taught Hawthorne - and almost everyone else. But, he never really came to grips with the Impressionists idea. His paintings were really done in tone - in black and white - with Impressionists colors added. He never developed a clear method.”
Hensche married fellow artist Ada Rayner (an English immigrant) who had worked as a governess when she first arrived in America. They married in 1936 and maintained a home in Provincetown until their deaths (she in 1985, he in 1992).
He also studied at the National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts, the Art Students League of New York, the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, and Charles Webster Hawthorne's Cape Cod School of Art. While Hensche did study with others, Charles Hawthorne was the greatest influence on him.
After the death of Charles Hawthorne, Hensche began to teach on his own in Provincetown. It is widely believed that Hawthorne "passed the mantle" to Hensche, though this may not be the case.  In fact, several other of Hawthorne's students started schools of their own. (Mrs. Hawthorne wanted $500.00 for the name of the school and Hensche was either unable or unwilling to pay that much. He changed the name to the Cape School of Art and began teaching). It is worth of note that Hensche's Cape School was the only one of these schools to survive for any significant length of time (well over fifty years).
Hensche's work as both a painter and teacher was to advance the ideals of color as the basis for painting; as opposed to tonal painting. He was most interested in creating visual poetry in the tradition of the Claude Monet, while advancing that art movement; the true progression of art in Hensche's eyes. Hensche was at times a vocal dissident of the many art movements of the 20th Century.
Following the death of his first wife, Ada Rayner, Hensche relocated to Gray, Louisiana. He married Dorothy Billui, a former student and art teacher. Hensche died in 1992 in Louisiana, Billui-Hensche in 2002.
In 2010, former students of Henry Hensche: John Clayton, John Ebersberger, Cedric Egeli, Rob Longley, and Hilda Neily, founded the Cape School of Art in Provincetown, in an effort to pass along Henry Hensche's teachings. John Ebersberger also teaches at Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts and l'Atelier aux Couleurs in California.  Another of Hensche's students was Betty Warren, who founded her own art school at Malden Brudge, New York, in Upstate New York.

Saint Julian of Antioch (sometimes called Julian of Cilicia, Julian of Anazarbus, Julian of Tarsus) is venerated as a Christian martyr of the fourth century. His date of death is given as 305 AD (or between 305 and 311 ADhttp://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienJ/Julian_von_Tarsus.html). He is sometimes confused with another saint of the same name.
Of senatorial rank, he was killed during the persecutions of Diocletian. His legend states that he was subjected to terrible tortures and paraded daily for a whole year through various cities of Cilicia. He was then sewn up in a sack half-filled with scorpions, sand, and vipers, and cast into the sea. The sea carried his body to Alexandria, and was buried there before being moved to Antioch. 
Saint John Chrysostom preached a homily in Julian's honor at Antioch, whose basilica was said to be the final resting place for Julian's relics. 
His feast day is June 21 in the Eastern Orthodox Church, March 16 in the Roman Catholic Church.

[[Retrocausality]]
CATEGORIES: Causality, Thought experiments, Quantum mechanics, Metaphysics of science

Retrocausality (also called retro-causation, retro-chronal causation, backward causation, and similar terms) is any of several hypothetical phenomena or processes that reverse causality, allowing an effect to occur before its cause.
Retrocausality is primarily a thought experiment in philosophy of science based on elements of physics, addressing the question: Can the future affect the present, and can the present affect the past?[tpl]cite journal |last=Barry |first=Patrick |title=What's done is done... or is it? |journal=New Scientist |date=2006-08-28 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg19125710.900-whats-done-is-done-or-is-it.html |accessdate=2006-12-19[/tpl] Philosophical considerations of time travel often address the same issues as retrocausality, as do treatments of the subject in fiction, although the two terms are not universally synonymous.[tpl]cite journal |author=Faye, Jan |title=Backward Causation |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-backwards/ |date=2001-08-27, rev. 2005-08-29 |accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl]
While some discussion of retrocausality is confined to fringe science or pseudoscience, a few physical theories with mainstream legitimacy have sometimes been interpreted as leading to retrocausality.

CATEGORIES: 1939 births, 2006 deaths, American cartoonists, American magazine editors, Playboy people

Michelle Urry (28 December 1939–15 October 2006, born Michelle Dorothy Kaplan) was the cartoon editor of Playboy magazine for over 30 years.  Together with Hugh Hefner, she edited the retrospective Playboy: 50 Years The Cartoons. Among the cartoonists whose career she is credited with developing is B. Kliban.  On learning of her death, Jules Feiffer told the New York Times she was the "mother superior to cartoonists."
Urry was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  As a child, she collected comic books rather than the dolls favored by other girls of her age. She graduated from UCLA, and after running a dress shop she moved to Chicago, taking a low-level staff job with Playboy in the late 1960s. By 1971 Urry had become the magazine's cartoon editor, and she held that post until her death.
In 1974, while visiting B. Kliban in his San Francisco studio, Urry was struck by a group of Kliban's offhand cartoons of cats, bought several of them, and prodded Kliban to create a book-length collection of similar work.  www.eatmousies.com Kliban's Cat became a best-selling book the next year, and spawned a wide range of popular merchandise.
She married sculptor Stephen Urry and the couple had one child, Caleb Urry. After Stephen's death in 1993, she married Alan Trustman, a screenwriter who is best known for The Thomas Crown Affair and Bullitt.  
Aside from her primary job at Playboy, Urry served as a cartoon editor or consulting editor at many other magazines, including Good Housekeeping and Modern Maturity.www.cartoonists.net

CP-40 ran multiple instances of client operating systems – particularly CMS, the Cambridge Monitor System, built as part of the same effort. Like CP-67, CP-40 and the first version of CMS were developed by IBM's Cambridge Scientific Center (CSC) staff, working closely with MIT researchers at Project MAC and Lincoln Laboratory. CP-40/CMS production use began in January 1967. CP-40 ran on a unique, specially modified IBM System/360 Model 40.

At the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics, New Zealand had competed with Australia in a combined team called Australasia.
The New Zealand team consisted of four competitors including the first woman to represent New Zealand at the Olympic Games, Violet Walrond who was only aged 15 at the time. The team can be considered one of the most successful ever as all team members finished 5th or better in at least one of their events. The opening flagbearer was hurdler Harry Wilson.

Chalciporus piperatus, commonly known as the peppery bolete, is a small pored mushroom of the family Boletaceae found in mixed woodland in Europe and North America. It has been recorded under introduced trees in Brazil, and has become naturalised in Tasmania and spread under native Nothofagus cunninghamii trees. A small bolete, the fruit body has a [tpl]convert|1.6|–|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] orange-fawn cap with cinnamon to brown pores underneath, and a [tpl]convert|4|–|9.5|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] high by [tpl]convert|0.6|–|1.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] thick stipe. The rare variety hypochryseus, found only in Europe, has yellow pores and tubes.
Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790 as Boletus piperatus, it is only distantly related to other members of the genus Boletus and was reclassified as Chalciporus piperatus by Frédéric Bataille in 1908. The genus Chalciporus was an early branching lineage in the Boletaceae and appears to be related to boletes with parasitic properties. Previously thought to be ectomycorrhizal (a symbiotic relationship that occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species), C. piperatus is now suspected of being parasitic on Amanita muscaria. The flesh of C. piperatus has a very peppery taste, and can be used as a condiment or flavouring.

[[To Be a Pilgrim]]
CATEGORIES: Christian hymns, 17th-century songs

"To be a Pilgrim" (also commonly known as "He who would Valiant be") is the only hymn John Bunyan is credited with writing but is indelibly associated with him. It first appeared in Part 2 of Pilgrim's Progress, written in 1684. The hymn recalls the words of Hebrews 11:13: "...and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth." 
The words were modified extensively by Percy Dearmer for the 1906 The English Hymnal.The English Hymnal, London: Oxford University Press, 1906 
At the same time it was given a new tune by British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams using the traditional Sussex melody "Monk's Gate". The hymn has also been sung to the melody "Moab" (John Roberts, 1870) and "St. Dunstans" (Charles W. Douglas, 1917).
For a time, Bunyan's original version was not commonly sung in churches, perhaps because of the references to "hobgoblin" and "foul fiend." However, one commentator has said: "Bunyan's burly song strikes a new and welcome note in our Hymnal. The quaint sincerity of the words stirs us out of our easygoing dull Christianity to the thrill of great adventure."The Hymnal 1940 Companion, New York: The Church Pension Fund, 1949, p. 331. Recent hymn books have tended to return to the original, for example, the Church of England's Common Praise and the Church of Scotland's Church Hymnary 4th Edition (Hymns of Glory, Songs of Praise).

[[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003]]
CATEGORIES: 2003 in law, Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, 2003 in the United Kingdom

The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 is a law in the United Kingdom which made it unlawful to, amongst other things, transmit an automated recorded message for direct marketing purposes via a telephone, without prior consent of the subscriber.  
This is somewhat similar to the US National Do Not Call Registry. However, it includes all electronic communications such as email or SMS mobile phone messages.  
One of the key points of this legislation is that it is unlawful to send someone direct marketing who has not specifically granted permission (via an opt-in agreement) unless there is a previous relationship between the parties. Organisations cannot merely add people's details to their marketing database and offer an opt out after they have started sending direct marketing. For this reason the regulations offer more consumer protection from direct marketing.
The regulations can be enforced against an offending company or individual anywhere in the European Union. The Information Commissioner's Office has responsibility for the enforcement of unsolicited e-mails and considers complaints about breaches. A breach of an enforcement notice is a criminal offence subject to a fine of up to £500,000 depending on the circumstances.

[[The Fellow]]

CATEGORIES: 1985 racehorse births, 2008 racehorse deaths, Cheltenham Gold Cup winners, Cheltenham Festival winners, Racehorses trained in France, French steeplechase racehorses, National Hunt racehorses

The Fellow (1985–2008) was an AQPS top-class National Hunt racehorse in the early 1990s. He won the 1994 Cheltenham Gold Cup and narrowly lost the 1991 and 1992 renewals. He also won the 1991 and 1992 King George VI Chase and the 1991 Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris. Along with Mandarin, he is one of only two horses to win both the latter race and the Gold Cup. A full brother to French Horse of the Century Al Capone II, The Fellow was trained in France by François Doumen, ridden by the Polish jockey Adam Kondrat, and owned by the Marquesa De Moratalla.
The Fellow first came to prominence in Britain when he ran in the 1990 King George VI Chase as a young five-year-old, although the previous month he had won the Group One Prix La Haye Jousselin at Auteuil Hippodrome in France.  He finished third in the King George behind Desert Orchid and Toby Tobias, then ran in a French hurdle race before returning to the UK to run in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was still a young horse and went off at 28/1. However, despite his age he was only beaten a short-head into second place by Garrison Savannah and defeated a number of good horses including Desert Orchid, Cool Ground and Celtic Shot. In fact, BBC commentator Sir Peter O'Sullevan (possibly biased through being a friend of the horse's owner) thought that The Fellow was going to just get up to win the race.
During the summer of 1991, The Fellow won the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris as well as two other chases. He returned to the UK for another tilt at the King George VI Chase. In a close finish, he just beat Docklands Express and Remittance Man, with Desert Orchid falling when beaten in his last race before retirement. The Fellow then tried again to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup the following spring. In this race, he lost again by a short head, this time to Cool Ground with Docklands Express in third.
The next season, he won two further races at Auteuil before running in the Hennessy Gold Cup, where he was a good third under top-weight behind Sibton Abbey and Jodami. He then retained his King George VI Chase crown.  Although he won the race by 6 lengths, he was outpaced entering the home straight and didn't look like the winner at the second last.  He went straight to Cheltenham to try to finally win the Gold Cup.  He went off the short-priced 5/4 favourite. However, he was well-beaten back in fourth behind Jodami. His jockey, Adam Kondrat, was heavily criticised by members of the racing press who felt he had kept the horse too far off the pace.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] Especially scathing in his criticism was John McCririck. The Fellow then was sent off the 7/2 favourite for the Whitbread Gold Cup but finished fifth.
The following season, The Fellow's best performances in his first six races of the season were four thirds. He failed to retain the King George, finishing third behind Barton Bank and Bradbury Star, and then came third in the Racing Post Chase behind Antonin.  However, in that race he had stayed on well at the end of the race and was giving substantial amounts of weight away to all of his rivals bar Docklands Express, where it was only 5 pounds. Barton Bank, one of the favourites for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, was injured shortly before the race, which improved The Fellow's chances of winning. He went off 7/1 third favourite. Jodami's mistake at the last fence ended any chance of him stopping The Fellow, who won by a length and a half. Peter Scudamore said about the ride the horse was given: " ...and beautifully ridden by Adam Kondrat, who understandably was very hurt by the illinformed, illjudged comments about his previous Gold Cup defeats." The Sporting Life National Hunt Review 1993/94 The weights for the Grand National are decided well in advance of the Gold Cup. This left The Fellow with 11 stone and 4 pounds to carry. However, the National is a race where the higher weights have a dire record. Additionally, torrential rain made the ground heavy. The Fellow tired after Becher's Brook and fell heavily at the Canal Turn.
The Fellow won a race at Auteuil Hippodrome in the summer of 1994 but was well beaten in other races. This included a final effort at the King George VI Chase, where he was pulled up behind Algan. Ironically, that horse had the same trainer and owner as The Fellow. His last race was at Auteuil on 18 June 1995, where he was pulled up.

Velos (Greek: Τ/Β Βέλος, "Arrow") was a [tpl]sclass|Niki|destroyer[/tpl] that served in the Royal Hellenic Navy from 1907 to 1926.
The ship, along with her three sister ships, was ordered from Germany in 1905 and was built in the Vulcan shipyard at Stettin.
During World War I, Greece did not enter the war on the side of the Triple Entente until 1917 and, due to Greece's neutrality the four Niki-class ships had been seized by the Allies in October 1916, taken over by the French in November and served in the French Navy from 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the Aegean Sea. 
 Velos saw action in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922).  In 1918, after the Armistice of Moudros, Velos entered the Dardanelles with the Allied fleet and was, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Petros Voulgaris, the first Greek warship to enter Constantinople.  In 1919, she conducted escort missions in the Black Sea carrying Greek refugees from Pontus. 
Velos was stricken in 1926, while the two remaining Niki-class ships were refurbished.
The name was carried by another ship, the [tpl]sclass|Fletcher|destroyer|2[/tpl] Velos, which served from 1959 to 1991, and is now a museum.

Shinuzoka announced before the 2006 event that it would be his final appearance as a competitor, saying "my decision has been taken: it’s my last Dakar. But I still hope to enjoy myself one last time behind the steering wheel. To win? No, that’s not my goal. After that, I don’t yet know what I’ll do but I do know that we need new talents in Japan.

[[Behavioral contrast]]

CATEGORIES: Behavioral concepts

Behavioral contrast refers to a change in the strength of one response that occurs when the rate of reward of a second response, or of the first response under different conditions, is changed. For example, suppose that a pigeon in an operant chamber pecks a key for food reward. Sometimes the key is red, sometimes green, but food comes with equal frequency in either case. Then suddenly pecking the key when it is green brings food less frequently. Positive contrast is seen when the rate of response to the red key goes up, even though the frequency of reward in red remains unchanged. Likewise, increasing the reward to green tends to reduce the response rate to red (negative contrast). This sort of contrast effect may occur following changes in the amount, frequency, or nature of the reward, and it has been shown to occur with various experimental designs and response measures (e.g. response rate, running speed).Mackintosh, N.

[[Courtyard house]]
CATEGORIES: House types, Courtyards

A courtyard house is a type of house — often a large house — where the main part of the building is disposed around a central courtyard. Many houses that have courtyards are not courtyard houses of the type covered by this article. For example, large houses often have small courtyards surrounded by service rooms or corridors, but the main rooms are not disposed around a courtyard. Blenheim Palace in England is an example of such a house. 
The main rooms of a courtyard houses often open onto the courtyard, and the exterior walls may be windowless and/or semi-fortified and/or surrounded by a moat. Courtyard houses of this type occupy an intermediate position between a castle or fortress, where defence is the primary design consideration, and more modern plans in which defence is not a consideration at all. In England the courtyard house was a popular design for large houses in the sixteenth century, after noblemen had stopped building themselves castles, but before thoughts of defence were altogether forgotten in the planning of country houses.

The Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot was a major battle of the Haitian Revolution.
The battle took place at the fort of Crête-à-Pierrot (in Haitian Creole Lakrèt-a-Pyewo), east of Saint-Marc in the Artibonite River valley. General Charles Leclerc's French colonial army besieged the heavily barricaded fort, which was defended by Haitian forces under Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The fort was significant as it controlled access into the Cahos Mountains. The defenders, running short of food and munitions, eventually abandoned the fort but were able to force their way through the French lines and into the Cahos Mountains. The French, although gaining control of the fort, had suffered heavy losses, including the death of General Charles Dugua. Alexandre Petion, a mixed-race French general, played an important role in the capture of the fort when he managed to deploy his cannon on a hill overlooking the Haitian position. 
Following the battle, Dessalines temporarily swore allegiance to France and joined his forces with Leclerc's, leading Toussaint Louverture, the Haitian leader, to agree to surrender. Though a defeat for the Haitians, the battle demonstrated their fighting qualities and showed that they could cause significant casualties to regular European forces. When disease disabled much of the French army, Dessalines once again returned to the field, now as the leader of the Haitian forces after the arrest and death of Louverture, and the story of the stubborn resistance of the Haitians at La Crête à Pierrot helped give his troops confidence.

[[Three Hundred Words]]

CATEGORIES: Spoken word, English poems, Cricket on the radio, Cricket culture, Cricket poetry

"Three Hundred Words" is a poem that showcases a number of Roy Harper's literary techniques and characteristics.
According to Harper's spoken introduction on his 1992 Live album, Born in Captivity II, (re-released in 1993 as Unhinged) "Three Hundred Words" was written for a benefit concert for Lancashire batsman, Graeme Fowler. It not only concerns one of Harper's most oft-cited loves, cricket (see  "When An Old Cricketer Leaves The Crease", on the album HQ), it also picks up the themes of England, combining historical reminiscences with current events, using minor observations to make major (political) statements, breaking rhymes across lines, and using clever mixed metaphors. It is, therefore, quintessentially Harper.

The John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum or John M. Parker Agricultural Center is a 6,756-seat multi-purpose arena in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA. It hosts local sporting events, livestock shows and concerts. It was opened in 1937 and sat 12,000 people at its peak. At the time of its construction, it was 6 feet larger than Madison Square Garden, which made it the biggest coliseum in the United States. It is named after John M. Parker, 27th Governor of Louisiana, who pushed to move the campus to its current location during his tenure.http://pages.rediff.com/john-m--parker-agricultural-coliseum/1188491
For the first few years of the coliseum's existence, it hosted Louisiana State University Tigers basketball games, along with the Huey Long Field House, which it replaced. In the 1950s, it became the primary home of the LSU Tigers basketball team. In the 1960s, the Coliseum was home to Pete Maravich-led basketball teams and it was his prominence that led to the construction of the LSU Assembly Center which now bears his name. The basketball team's final season playing in the coliseum was 1971. 
The former LSU boxing team held matches at Parker Coliseum and the Huey Long Field House. The 1949 LSU boxing team went undefeated in regular season play and finished the year by beating South Carolina in front of 11,000 fans in Parker Coliseum, en route to its first and only national title.http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=205700727
Today, it has reverted to its original purpose as a host of agricultural events, such as rodeos and livestock shows.http://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/our_offices/departments/Livestock_Show_Office/

[[Infinite-period bifurcation]]
CATEGORIES: Bifurcation theory

In mathematics, an infinite-period bifurcation is a global bifurcation that can occur when two fixed points emerge on a limit cycle. As the limit of a parameter approaches a certain critical value, the speed of the oscillation slows down and the period approaches infinity. The infinite-period bifurcation occurs at this critical value. Beyond the critical value, the two fixed points emerge continuously from each other on the limit cycle to disrupt the oscillation and form two saddle points.

[[Pierre Picaud]]
CATEGORIES: Impostors, 19th-century French people, People from Nîmes

Pierre Picaud was a 19th-century shoemaker in Nîmes who may have been the basis for the character of Edmond Dantès in Alexandre Dumas, père's novel, The Count of Monte Cristo. In 1807, Picaud was engaged to marry a rich woman, but three jealous friends — Loupian, Solari, and Chaubart — falsely accused him of being a spy for England (a fourth friend, Allut, knew of their conspiracy, but did not report it).H. Ashton-Wolfe,  p.19 He was imprisoned in the Fenestrelle fortress for seven years, not even learning why until his second year there.H. Ashton-Wolfe, p.20-21 During his imprisonment he ground a small passageway into a neighboring cell and befriended a wealthy Italian priest named Father Torri who was being held there.H. Ashton-Wolfe, p.22 A year later, a dying Torri bequeathed to Picaud a treasure he had hidden in Milan.H. Ashton-Wolfe, p.23 When Picaud was released after the fall of the Imperial government in 1814, he took possession of the treasure, returned under another name to Paris and spent 10 years plotting revenge against his former friends.
Picaud first murdered Chaubart, or had him murdered.H. Ashton-Wolfe, p.27 Picaud's former fiancée had, two years after his disappearance, married his former friend Loupian, who became the subject of his most brutal revenge. Picaud tricked Loupian's daughter into marrying a criminal, whom he then had arrested. Loupian's daughter promptly died of shock. Picaud then burned down Loupian's restaurant, or arranged to have it burned down, leaving Loupian impoverished.H. Ashton-Wolfe, p.28 Next, he poisoned Solari to death and either manipulated Loupian's son into stealing some gold jewelry or framed him for committing the crime.H. Ashton-Wolfe p.29 The boy was sent to jail, and Picaud stabbed Loupian to death. He was himself then abducted by Allut and killed.
Allut's deathbed confession forms the bulk of the French police records of the case. The detailed description of Picaud's experiences in prison, which could not have been known to Allut, were supposedly dictated to him by the ghost of Father Torri.H. Ashton-Wolfe p.33

[[Radio drama in Japan]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese radio drama

Radio drama in Japan has a history as long as that of radio broadcasting in that country, which began in 1925. Some consider the first Japanese radio drama to have been "[tpl]nihongo|Kirihitoha|桐一葉||The Falling Paulownia Leaf[/tpl]" which was a radio broadcast of a stage play. Others consider the Japanese translation of Richard Hughes's "Danger" or [tpl]nihongo|Tankō no Naka|炭坑の中||Down the coal pit[/tpl] to be the first true radio drama to be broadcast in Japan. The Japanese public broadcaster, NHK, also had a special radio drama theatrical company that is the origin of the voice acting phenomenon in Japan that continues to this day. 
In the 1950s, authors like [tpl]nihongo|Shinichiro Nakamura|中村真一郎|[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Kiyoteru Hanada|花田清輝|[/tpl], and others who belonged to the "[tpl]nihongo|junbun gaku|純文学||"pure literature movement"[/tpl] penned many experimental radio dramas.  These radio dramas caught the attention of various Eastern European countries, and as a result, these works were translated and rebroadcast. As with most countries, radio drama broadcasts have become less common after the advent of television.
In Japan today, it is common for popular television dramas, light novels, manga series, anime series or video games to have main plot lines, plot continuations, sequels or small side stories released in the form of audio dramas.
These audio dramas are alternatively called drama CDs (ドラマCD), radio dramas (ラジオドラマ), or sound dramas (サウンドドラマ).
Today they are released on Compact Disc, however in the past they were released on vinyl and audio cassette. Before the advent of videocassette recorders, drama recordings were the only way to revisit an animated television series. Recordings often featured recapitulations of plotlines along with theme songs from anime series.  This is still employed by current audio dramas, for example the first Sailor Moon audio drama CD has the characters getting into a shiritori battle with Zoisite featuring the names of minor characters and place settings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kurozuki.com/takeuchi/anime/drama01.html |title=Sound Drama: Sailor Moon 1 |publisher=Kurozuki.com |date=1998-06-20 |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl]
Audio drama plotlines may also be re-used in other media. An example of this are audio dramas like Benitokage from Sakura Taisen which was later produced as a stage show; then used as a basis for an episode in direct-to-video anime release. Another example would be how the audio drama Getter Robo : The Moon Wars was used as the starting point for the OVA series Change!! Getter Robo: The Last Day of the World
Most modern audio dramas consist of either side stories or parody stories, though an audio drama may be both.  Side stories are usually extensions of main plotlines such as plotlines that were featured in manga that have not appearead in an anime.  Parody stories feature characters getting into humorous predicaments or scenes that may be too risqué for television.  For example, one Sailor Moon audio drama featured a scene where Haruka Tenoh filled in at a gay bar.   
Recent trends in merchandising anime shows have had audio dramas come out as pretexts for the development of anime series and can substantially precede the appearance of an anime version. Sometimes they are released before an animated version of an anime series in order to introduce fans to the characters and voice actors. (An example of this was the manga series Angel Sanctuary which had a drama CD come out well before its direct-to-video anime release.)

Thomas Clare (20 August 1883 – 6 May 1940) was an English cricketer: a right-handed batsman and right arm fast bowler who played two first-class games for Worcestershire, almost five years apart, in the 1920s. Both matches were at Amblecote.
His highest score of 34 came against Lancashire in the second innings of his debut in August 1920. This constituted exactly half of Worcestershire's paltry total of 68; the county lost by an innings inside two days having been routed by a career-best 7/34 from James Tyldesley.[ref]

Kuh-e Bandaka (or Kohe Bandaka, Bandako, or incorrectly Koh-i-BandakorRobin Hartshorne, "Bandako", American Alpine Journal, 1966.) is one of the highest peaks of the Hindu Kush mountain range in northeastern Afghanistan. It is northeast of Kabul and west of Chitral. Separated by a relatively low pass from the core of the Hindu Kush, it is the highest mountain entirely within Afghanistan, and the most topographically prominent peak in all of Afghanistan.
On September 22, 1960, the second German expedition to visit the Hindu Kush made the
first ascent of Kuh-e Bandaka. The members of the expedition were Wolfgang von Hansemann, Dietrich Hasse, Siegbert Heine, and Johannes Winkler, all from West Berlin; all attained the summit. They made four camps, with their base camp in the Dare-Sachi Valley at an altitude of [tpl]convert|4100|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The expedition also made multiple first ascents in the Pagar Valley of the Hindu Kush, and made meteorological and geological observations and sketch maps.  
There have been over fifteen subsequent ascents, via a variety of routes; however there have been no recorded ascents since 1977.Himalayan Index (Alpine Club)

Happy Arcadia is a musical entertainment with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert and music originally by Frederic Clay that premiered on 28 October 1872 at the Royal Gallery of Illustration. It was one of four collaborations between Gilbert and Clay between 1869 and 1876. The music is lost. The piece is a satire on the genre of pastoral plays in which the characters, who each wish that they could be someone else, have their wish granted, with unhappy results.
Gilbert and Sullivan later produced a popular comic opera, Iolanthe in which two of the characters, Strephon and Phyllis, are "Arcadian" shepherds. Phyllis, like Chloe, is torn between two suitors. The character of Lycidas also anticipates the character of Archibald Grosvenor in Patience, who is cursed with perfect beauty.

Zorrozaurre (in Basque, Zorrotzaurre) is an artificial peninsula located within the Deusto district of Bilbao, Spain. It was formed during the 1950s and the 1960s, when a canal was built to facilitate navigation in the estuary of Bilbao. The project was stopped in 1968 with 400 meters left to finish, forming the current peninsula. The area reached its heyday during this decade, with many industries moving there. However, during the industrial crisis of the 1980s that struck the city, many industries were forced to shut down or relocate, and only a handful of them survived to this day.
A plan has been approved to renew the neighborhood, the project will be designed by British Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid.

[[Sd.Kfz. 10]]

CATEGORIES: World War II half-tracks, Half-tracks of Germany

The Sd.Kfz. 10 (Sonderkraftfahrzeug - special motorized vehicle) was a German half-track that saw very widespread use in World War II. Its main role was as a prime mover for small towed guns such as the 2 cm FlaK 30, the 7.5 cm leIG, or the 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank gun. It could carry eight troops in addition to towing a gun or trailer.
The basic engineering for all the German half-tracks was developed during the Weimar-era by the Reichswehr's Military Automotive Department, but final design and testing was farmed out to commercial firms with the understanding that production would be shared with multiple companies. Demag was chosen to develop the smallest of the German half-tracks and spent the years between 1934 and 1938 perfecting the design through a series of prototypes.
The chassis formed the basis for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light armored personnel carrier. Approximately 14,000 were produced between 1938 and 1945, making it one of the most widely produced German tactical vehicles of the war.

Swan Valley High School is a public high school located in Saginaw, Michigan, USA.  They are part of the Tri-Valley Central Conference.  Swan Valley has been part of the Mid-Michigan B, TVC East, TVC West, and the TVC Central conferences since its start in 1971. Swan Valley's original mascot was the Panthers which soon changed to the Vikings. When the new high school was built the mascot needed to be changed because there was already a high school in the area that were panthers.  The sports teams of Swan Valley were then divided up between the Vikings and the Valkyries to show individual support for both male and female teams. Later the sports teams were simply called the Vikings and the Lady Vikes.  The school now runs on a trimester based year changing from using semesters after Superintendent Dr. Syrek retired.

CATEGORIES: 1986 singles, Belinda Carlisle songs, Debut singles, I.R.S. Records singles, Pop rock songs, RPM Top Singles number-one singles, 1986 songs

"Mad About You" is a pop song written by Paula Jean Brown, James Whelan and Mitchel Young Evans, produced by Michael Lloyd, for Belinda Carlisle's debut solo album Belinda. It was released as the album's first single, in 1986, as a CD single (one of the first ever marketed), 7" single and a 12" single. It was her first hit after leaving the Go-Go's, peaking at number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and at number one on the Canadian Singles Chart.
The year that the song was released, Carlisle married Morgan Mason, who appears with Belinda in the video for "Mad About You". The guitar solo on the song was performed by Andy Taylor (of Duran Duran), who also appears in the video.
Paula Jean Brown (who took Jane Wiedlin's spot in the band just before it broke up) co-wrote the song with Jim Whelan, and Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey sang back-up vocals. "Mad About You" was one of a very few songs that were being considered to be on the fourth (unrecorded) Go-Go's album. The Go-Go's split and "Mad About You" and two other songs co-written by Paula Jean Brown wound up on Belinda instead.
The single's B-side, "I Never Wanted a Rich Man", was also featured on Carlisle's first long playing work (it closed Side 1 on the vinyl edition). The extended version of "Mad About You", originally on the A-side of the 12" single, was then included on the album compact disc re-release by Virgin in 2003.

Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is the study of dissolved gases in transformer oil.Herbert G. Erdman (ed.), Electrical insulating oils, ASTM International, 1988 ISBN 0-8031-1179-7, p. 108
Insulating materials within transformers and electrical equipment break down to liberate gases within the unit. The distribution of these gases can be related to the type of electrical fault, and the rate of gas generation can indicate the severity of the fault. The identity of the gases being generated by a particular unit can be very useful information in any preventative maintenance program.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nttworldwide.com/tech2102.htm |title=DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS OF MINERAL OIL INSULATING FLUIDS |accessdate=November 2, 2011[/tpl]
The collection and analysis of gases in an oil-insulated transformer was discussed as early as 1928. Many years of empirical and theoretical study have gone into the analysis of transformer fault gases. 
DGA usually consists of sampling the oil and sending the sample to a laboratory for analysis. Mobile  DGA units can be transported and used on site as well; some units can be directly connected to a transformer. Online monitoring of electrical equipment is an integral part of the smart grid.

Whaling in Iceland began with spear-drift whaling which was practiced from as early as the 12th century and continued in a relic form until the late 19th century. The relationship with whales is reflected in the Icelandic language: hvalreki is the word for  "beached whale", while also meaning something good that is unexpectedly yours or at your disposal.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] However, modern commercial whaling was introduced to Iceland by companies from other nations in the late 19th century.

Peter Humphries  Clark (March 29, 1829 in Cincinnati, Ohio – June 21, 1925) was one of Ohio’s most effective black abolitionist writers and speakers. He became the first teacher engaged by the Cincinnati black public schools in 1849, and the founder and principal of Ohio’s first public high school for black students in 1866. Because of these accomplishments, he was named the nation’s primary black public school educator. He was also widely recognized for being a political activist who empowered black voters in Ohio. 
Peter’s father, Michael Clark, was a successful barber and sent his son to private schools because of the absence of public schools. After his father’s death in 1849, Peter took over the barber shop for a short time. Later that same year black schools were authorized by the Ohio legislature. This was largely due to the efforts of Peter’s uncle, John Gaines. Peter became the first teacher in the black school. He was fired in 1853 by the white Board of Education for publicly praising Thomas Paine. 
During the next four years, Peter was an abolitionist publisher, editor, writer, and speaker. He participated in the Ohio Conventions of Colored Men, and edited and published his own weekly newspaper. He was appointed secretary of the 1853 National Convention of Colored Men, by Frederick Douglass. In 1854 he married Francis Ann Williams. In 1857 he was rehired by the black trustees of the colored schools and made principal of the Western District School in Cincinnati. 
He became principal of Gaines High School in 1866 and held that post until 1886, when he was fired on political grounds.Gaines High School & Peter H. Clark, historical marker at school site, Ohio Historical Society He left Cincinnati in 1887 to serve as principal of the Alabama State normal and Industrial School, and in 1888 went to St. Louis where he taught at the segregated Sumner High School for twenty years.Walter Herz, Reflections on a Journey Toward Racial Reconciliation sermon delivered April 4, 2004

The Border Route Trail is a [tpl]convert|65|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long hiking trail that crosses the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) in the far northeast corner of Minnesota (Arrowhead) and follows the international border between Minnesota and Ontario, Canada. It connects with the Superior Hiking Trail on its eastern terminus and with the Kekekabic Trail on its western end at the Gunflint Trail (Cook Cty. Road 12). In addition to the eastern and western termini, the Border Route Trail can be accessed through several spur and connecting trails, allowing for hiking trips ranging from short day-hikes to multiday backpacking expeditions. 
The Border Route Trail Association was incorporated in 2004 to coordinate the maintenance and increase public awareness of the trail. The National Park Service is pursuing a re-route in northern Minnesota which will include the Border Route Trail into the North Country Trail.
The trail was planned and built in the early 1970s by the Minnesota Rovers Outing Club with the help of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the US Forest Service. It was the first long-distance, wilderness backpacking and hiking trail in Minnesota planned and constructed by volunteers.

Hayley Spicer, a witness who was at the party told TVNZ "A fight just broke out next to us and I got pushed against the wall 'cause some guy was here and he pushed me... ...I pushed him and he just went whack and hit me."  Another witness, Tepaea Gear, also claimed to see a fight break out: "And then I see weapons and I just go inside 'cause I see one fella he's got a golf club. So I just run go for the phone and pretty much when I come out there's two fellas knocked out."[tpl]cite web | title = Police fed up with drunken youths | work = TVNZ | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411419/856707 | date = 2006-10-16[/tpl] People spilled out of the party onto Nelson Street and began to throw missiles and damage parked cars; Newstalk ZB described the event as a "rampage".[tpl]cite web | title = Youths run riot in Blenheim | work = Newstalk ZB | url = http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=105614 | date = 2006-10-15[/tpl]
Police sergeant Mike Western stated that the partygoers were blocking traffic and causing a potentially dangerous situation as Nelson Street is also a state highway linking Blenheim with Nelson. "There were probably 150 kids, everyone was drunk and they were throwing bottles.

Arrests were made until 3:30 am and police said more arrests could follow, 22 people, between the ages of 15 and 22 were charged with offences including disorderly behaviour, wilful damage, resisting police, assaulting police and possession of an offensive weapon. They were put into the police station's holding cells, some joining prisoners already being held there.[tpl]cite web | title = Several in court after party turns into riot | work = The New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10406115 | date = 2006-10-16[/tpl]
Cory Hampton, a labourer, pleaded guilty to one charge of disorderly behaviour and one of assaulting police.  When appearing in court the following Monday, he was convicted and fined $500. A number of other people involved in the riot were fined $250 after charges of disorder and wilful damage. Senior sergeant Tony Sampson said that "A number of the partygoers who were largely responsible for the violence and disorderly behaviour, those people have been involved in similar incidents in town over recent weeks and months," One motor sales company on Nelson Street suffered damage worth several thousand dollars and another incurred minor damage to windscreen wipers. Blenheim police and witnesses believe alcohol was a major factor in the riot.

The Vijayanagara metropolitan area comprised the urban core of the imperial city and the surrounding principalities of the capital of the Vijayanagara empire in the time period spanning early 14th. century to the middle of 16th. century C.E.
Abdur Razzak, the Persian traveller who visited Vijayanagara in 1440 C.E. wrote of six fortifications before reaching the gates of the royal palace. The areas between the first and second and between the second and third fortification was large and contained agricultural fields, gardens and many residences. From the notes of Robert Sewell it becomes clear that between the third fortification up to the actual fortress, one came across countless people, shops, bazaars. From their accounts the area of the greater metropolitan area of Vijayanagara was about 540 km² which is about 25 times larger than the area comprising the main administrative, sacred and royal centers. The tourist zone itself is limited to the inner urban core.
Over the years, archaeological surveys have helped document over 700 sites spanning a time frame from 3rd. century BCE to early 2nd. millennium, including ash mounds, settlements, megalithic cemeteries, temples and sites of rock art. It is clear that the Vijayanagara area was well settled for a period long before the formation of the empire. Surveys conducted by the Vijayanagar Metropolitan Survey has estimated that the real size of the metropolitan city may have been some 650 km² of which a 120 km² area immediately surrounding the core area called the Intensive Survey Area has been the focus of study.

The Alliance Laurentienne was a political organization founded by Raymond Barbeau on January 25, 1957. It was an early organization of the contemporary independence movement of Quebec but, unlike the majority of those to come, it adopted somewhat right-wing, even corporatist politics. It was also attached to the Catholic faith, as opposed to the secularism of most future sovereigntist groups. Its manifesto is however a proponent of love between peoples and ethnicities.
Its own vision of a "Free Quebec" was called "Laurentie" (thus the name of the movement) and from 1957 to 1962, it published a magazine under that title. The independence intellectual André D'Allemagne was one of its members before, frustrated with its right-wing tendencies, he left to create the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale (RIN). The RIN, officially neutral on the left-right spectrum, had many militants with beliefs ranging from socialism to social democracy.

Chvorinov's Rule is a mathematical relationship first expressed by Nicolas Chvorinov in 1940,"Theory of the Solidification of Castings", Giesserei, 1940, Vol 27, p 177-186 that relates the solidification time for a simple casting to the volume and surface area of the casting. In simple terms the rule establishes that under otherwise identical conditions, the casting with large surface area and small volume will cool more rapidly than a casting with small surface area and a large volume. The relationship can be written as:Askeland.

It is most useful in determining if a riser will solidify before the casting, because if the riser solidifies first then it is worthless.Degarmo, p. 282.

The Moscow Helsinki Group (also known as the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group, [tpl]lang-ru|Московская Хельсинкская группа[/tpl]) is an influential human rights monitoring non-governmental organization, originally established in what was then the Soviet Union;"The Moscow Helsinki Group 30th Anniversary: From the Secret Files" (a selection of translated KGB/CPSU documents discussing MHG) http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB191/index.htm it still operates in Russia.
It was founded in 1976 to monitor the Soviet Union's compliance with the recently signed Helsinki Final Act of 1975, which included clauses calling for the recognition of universal human rights. Its pioneering efforts inspired the formation of similar groups in other Warsaw Pact countries and support groups in the West. In Czechoslovakia, Charter 77 was founded in January 1977; members of that group would later play key roles in the overthrow of the communist dictatorship in Czechoslovakia. In Poland, a Helsinki Watch Group was founded in September 1979. Eventually, the collection of Helsinki monitoring groups inspired by the Moscow Helsinki Group formed the International Helsinki Federation.

The first "official" Mindspawn release was the album Null Infinite, which was released in 2001, although two CDR releases Darkness Weaves and Conversing With Zardoz were released in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Although still "active" as Mindspawn, Gene Williams currently produces and composes for film and television with Steve Smith of Dirty Vegas fame. Recent work includes divergent subjects that range from the theme for the TV series "Standoff (TV series)" to the feature film "The Boys & Girls Guide to Getting Down" by Paul Sapiano. Mindspawn is still performing live as of 2010.
The Mindspawn name was chosen as an ambiguous play on words, the two "meanings" being Mind's Pawn and Mind Spawn. Beyond the obvious no further meaning has ever been intended. The sound composed/created by Mindspawn varies from soundscapes and industrial ambience to so-called dark ambient, including claustrophobic film music and sound categorized as space music. Mindspawn sound has been aptly referred to as sound sculptures or sonic tapestries. In addition to releasing audio CDs, Mindspawn has also designed sound for use by other artists and film composers.

The Scottish United Trades Councils Labour Party, also known as the Scottish Trades Councils Independent Labour Party, was a Scottish labour party.
The party originated in a meeting held in Edinburgh on 8 August 1891 with representatives of various trades councils and local labour organisations.  67 delegates attended, claiming to represent 84,500 members.  The meeting agreed to sponsor the Parliamentary and local candidacies of labour movement activists who were independent of both the Conservative Party and of the Liberal Party.  Keir Hardie convinced the meeting to also campaign for the payment of MPs and councillors.  The meeting established an executive, with one representative of each trades council, plus a member of the Scottish Labour Party.  R. Chisholm Robertson, a miner from Stirlingshire and a rival of Hardie, was appointed as Secretary.W. Hamish Fraser, Scottish popular politics: from radicalism to Labour, pp.129-133
The executive attempted to form local labour representation committees, based on the membership of the trades councils.  This was sufficiently successful that a national movement known as the "Scottish United Trades Councils Labour Party" was established.  Its platform included calls for an eight-hour day, universal suffrage, land nationalisation and limited industrial nationalisation, and a local option on temperance.  However, the new party agreed not to sponsor any candidates where there was a chance that a Conservative might beat a Liberal or a radical.
At the 1892 general election, the party sponsored four candidates: John Wilson in Edinburgh Central, Robert Brodie in Glasgow College, Chisholm Robertson in Stirlingshire and Robert Cunninghame-Graham in Glasgow Camlachie.  Between them, the candidates won 2,313 votes.  The party also actively supported nine left-wing Liberal candidates, including one Crofter.  Some of the candidates were also sponsored by the Scottish Socialist Federation.
The party organised a further conference after the election, presided over by Cunninghame-Graham.  It sponsored two candidates for local elections in Glasgow.  That year, the Independent Labour Party was formed, and in March the party dissolved, advising members and branches to affiliate to the new organisation, which many did.F. W. S. Craig, Minor Parties at British Parliamentary Elections
In late 1893, Henry Hyde Champion attempted to reform the party as part of a disagreement with Hardie, but the Scottish Labour Party firmly opposed this, and the venture was a complete failure.David Howell, British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, p.151

[[Broadcast calendar]]

CATEGORIES: Calendars, Specific calendars, Television terminology

The broadcast calendar is a standardized calendar used primarily for the planning and purchase of radio and television programs and advertising.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvb.org/planning_buying/179695/5658 |title=Broadcast Calendar / Nielsen Survey Dates |publisher=TVB |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]  Every week in the broadcast calendar starts on a Monday and ends on a Sunday, and every month has either four or five such weeks. Broadcast calendar months thus have either 28 or 35 days.
The key link between the broadcast and Gregorian calendars is that the first week of every broadcast month always contains the Gregorian calendar first of the month. For example, if January 1 falls on a Saturday, then the broadcast calendar year would begin on the preceding Monday, December 27. Broadcast January would then have five weeks, ending on January 30, and the four weeks of broadcast February would begin on January 31. The number of weeks in a broadcast month is based on the number of Sundays that fall in that month with the period ending on the last Sunday of the month.
Days and weeks in a broadcast calendar are often referred to by number rather than name, as in Week 47, Day 3. Since each week starts on a Monday, day three is always a Wednesday, while week 47 is always the 47th week of the broadcast calendar year. The Gregorian equivalent in a given year can be looked up on any number of published calendars that are freely available for download on the Web.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rab.com/public/reports/broadcastCalendar.cfm?type=nm |title=Broadcast Calendars |publisher=RAB.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
Broadcast calendar years can have either 52 or 53 weeks.  A broadcast calendar will have 53 weeks in a leap year where January 1 falls on a Saturday or Sunday, or in a common year where January 1 falls on a Sunday.  In the 21st century, 53-week broadcast calendar years are 2006, 2012, 2017, 2023, 2028, 2034, 2040, 2045, 2051, 2056, 2062, 2068, 2073, 2079, 2084, 2090, and 2096.
The broadcast calendar often closely matches certain specialized financial calendars, such as the 4-4-5 calendar, but the length of a broadcast month can vary year to year. The broadcast year differs in most years from the ISO week year, although both start the week on Monday, because ISO starts with the week containing the first Thursday (and January 4) instead of the first Sunday (and January 1).

The St Kilda Sea Baths are located at the beach.
The St Kilda Pier is another landmark. The pier is terminated by the St Kilda Pavilion, an eccentric Edwardian building in the mould of English pier pavilions which is considered of high cultural importance to Melburnians. It was recently reconstructed and listed on the Victorian Heritage Register after burning down. The pier has a long breakwater which shelters St Kilda Harbour and hosts a Little Penguin colony.St Kilda Penguins Accessed 13 May 2007 
St Kilda Beach is one of the 46 bayside beaches which are monitored by EPA Victoria for water quality.

A French division under General Donatien de Rochambeau was advancing down a ravine (the Ravine-à-Couleuvres), towards the city of Lacroix, Haiti. The leader of the Haitian revolutionary forces, Toussaint Louverture, temporarily stopped his advance toward the city of Gonaïves after a bloody struggle, which was a short distance from Lacroix.

It is written in an archaic, Rabelaisian style, with Barnes's own illustrations in the style of Elizabethan woodcuts.
Barnes appears as Dame Evangeline Musset, "who was in her Heart one Grand Red Cross for the Pursuance, the Relief and the Distraction, of such Girls as in their Hinder Parts, and their Fore Parts, and in whatsoever Parts did suffer them most, lament Cruelly".Barnes, 6.

[[Depth chart]]
CATEGORIES: Diagrams

In sports, a depth chart is used to show the placements of the starting players and the secondary players. Generally a starting player will be listed first or on top while a back-up will be listed below. Depth charts also tend to resemble the actual position locations of certain players.[tpl]cite book|author1=Howie Long|author2=John Czarnecki|title=Football For Dummies, USA Edition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=an8ZIHOMda0C&pg=PA244|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=12 May 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01265-9|pages=244–|quote=A depth chart lists the starting lineups for both teams by their positions on offense and defense.[/tpl] 
The typical Major League Baseball depth chart consists of  a list of players at each position, with the starter or first-string player listed first, followed by replacement and platoon players.  For fantasy baseball, typical preseason projection systems such as PECOTA construct depth charts that specify not just the order of the players at each position (starter, replacement or bench player) but also the amount of playing time each person at that position will have. For example, at first base one player may be projected as playing 60 percent of the innings, and another 40 percent for the coming season, while at catcher one player may be projected as playing 80 percent of the innings, and another 20 percent.  For pitchers, the depth charts project the number of innings each roster player will pitch.

[[Kenyan Premier League]]

CATEGORIES: Kenyan Premier League, Football leagues in Kenya, National association football premier leagues

The Kenyan Premier League (known as the Tusker Premier League for sponsorship reasons) is the top tier in the Kenyan football league system. It was formed in 1963 under the Kenya Football Federation but is now controlled by the Football Kenya Federation. All member clubs are fully professional.
The league was mostly stable until the late 1990s and since then its performance has not been even average. Until today, many of the league clubs have little or no finances to support themselves. However, since SuperSport became an official league partner, the league has taken on a more serious role with teams becoming professional and the majority of the clubs managing to get shirt sponsorships. This has seen the level of competition improve compared to the past.
The most successful clubs in the league are A.F.C. Leopards (formerly Abaluhya FC) and Gor Mahia, who have both won the league title a record 13 times.

[[National Park Service rustic]]
CATEGORIES: Rustic architecture in the United States, American architectural styles, United States National Park Service

National Park Service rustic — sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture — is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service (NPS) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment. Since its founding in 1916, the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings. The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world, reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture. Architects, landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes. Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures, including entrance gateways, hotels and lodges, park roads and bridges, visitor centers, trail shelters, informational kiosks, and even mundane maintenance and support facilities. Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

[tpl]nihongo|Higashi Honganji|東本願寺|Higashi Hongan-ji[/tpl], or, the Eastern Temple of the Original Vow, is one of two dominant sub-sects of Shin Buddhism in Japan and abroad, the other being Nishi Honganji (or, 'The Western Temple of the Original Vow'). It is also the name of the head temple in Kyoto, a collection of buildings built in 1895 after a fire burned down the previous temple.Popular Buddhism In Japan: Shin Buddhist Religion & Culture by Esben Andreasen, pp. 11, 38-39, 101 / University of Hawaii Press 1998, ISBN 0-8248-2028-2 As with many sites in Kyoto, these two complexes have more casual names and are known affectionately in Kyoto as [tpl]Nihongo||お西さん|Onissan|Dear Mr. West[/tpl] and [tpl]Nihongo||お東さん|Ohigashisan|Dear Mr. East[/tpl].
Higashi Honganji was established in 1602 by the Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu when he split the Shin sect in two (Nishi Honganji being the other) in order to diminish its power.
During the Twentieth Century it was troubled by political disagreements, financial scandals and family disputes, and has subsequently fractured into a number of further sub-divisions (see Ohigashi schism).  The largest Higashi Honganji grouping, the Shinshu Otaniha has approximately 5.5 million members, according to statistics.  However within this climate of instability the Higashi Honganji also produced a significant number of extremely influential thinkers, such as Soga Ryojin, Kiyozawa Manshi, Kaneko Daiei and Haya Akegarasu amongst others.

Founded in 1952, Air India Football Club is one of the oldest institutional sides in the country. Though never considered as frontrunners in the I-League, the Mumbai based club has often proved to be a thorn in the flesh for many top sides. They used to play in NFL 2nd Division but got promoted to Premier Division and have maintained their position there till now. Generally a low budget side, Air India’s best finish in the National Football League (now I-League) came in the 1997-1998 season when they were placed sixth in the table and their coach Bimal Ghosh received the Best coach award.
Four times champions in the local league in Mumbai, Air India are best known for nurturing youngsters into big time players. Many of these boys have played with distinction for bigger teams in the later years.http://the-aiff.com/pages/club/index.php?Aboutclub=40&ClubDetail=40

The [tpl]nihongo|Ōoku|大奥|great interior[/tpl] refers to the harem of Edo Castle, the section where the women connected to the reigning Shogun resided. Similar areas in the castles of powerful Daimyo were also referred to by this term.The Satsuma Domain employed this term
This included the shōgun's mother, wife, and concubines. Rumored to house several thousand women, including maids and servants at one point, the Ōoku was, as much as any other part of Edo Castle, a focal point of political intrigue for the Tokugawa shogunate.
There were no male adults admitted onto the floor of the Ōoku without the Shōgun. The corridor through which the Shōgun entered was called [tpl]nihongo|Osuzu Rōka|御鈴廊下|[/tpl] "passage of the bells", derived from the ringing of the bells to announce the entrance of the Shōgun. This corridor was the only route which connected the Ōoku to rest of Edo Castle, and it was usually locked.
Later, a second corridor was built as the escape route against disasters such as fires or earthquakes.
A lady in the rank of an [tpl]nihongo|Otoshiyori|御年寄|[/tpl] or [tpl]nihongo|Jōrō Otoshiyori|上臈御年寄|[/tpl] held the reins of power in the Ōoku, and she attained the influence equivalent to a Rōjū in Edo Castle.
The Ōoku was built inside the Edo Castle in 1607 by Tokugawa Hidetada. He passed a special law for the Ōoku to completely separate it from the outside world. Therefore, noblewomen living in the Ōoku couldn't leave the castle without permission. This system lasted for nearly 200 years.

[[The Double-D Avenger]]
CATEGORIES: 2000s comedy films, 2001 films

The Double-D Avenger is a 2001 American comedy film by William Winckler.http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2011/07/30/classic-anime-gets-star-treatment/
This film, first released in fall 2001, written, produced and directed by cult filmmaker William Winckler, is a campy spoof of "Wonder Woman" about a costumed superwoman who uses her super bust to fight crime.http://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/the-double-d-avenger-1200544072/http://www.horrortalk.com/reviews/504-the-double-d-avenger-joe-bob-briggs-presents.html
It's of special interest to cult movie fans since it's the only "reunion film" of Russ Meyer's famous actresses Kitten Natividad (Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens), Haji (Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!) and Raven De La Croix (Up!).
The story focuses on big busty Chastity Knott (Natividad) who must use her new amazing abilities as the super-stacked costumed crime fighter, The Double-D Avenger, to stop villainous bikini bar owner Al Purplewood (Larry Butler) and his sexy, murderous strippers. The movie is full of live-action comic-book action, sexual innuendo, Russ Meyer-inspired camera angles focusing on the female character's breasts, and other "off color" verbal and visual gags. Remarkably, there is no nudity in the picture. 
Variety critic Dennis Harvey gave the film a very positive review noting its "a cheerfully silly ode to larger-than-life femininity."
The fun film runs 77 minutes, in color, and is suggested for audiences over 18. It has been a
success in the U.S. theatrically and on video and DVD, and is also a hit internationally, with a French-language version in France ("Double D Avenger Les Appas De La Justiciere") and a Japanese-language version in Japan ("The Double-D Avenger / MegaPie Oba Ranger"). A second DVD version was released by Elite Entertainment, titled "Joe Bob Briggs Presents The Double-D Avenger," which features audio commentary by famous drive-in movie critic Joe Bob
Briggs. A special DVD two-pack has also been released by Elite, "A Double Dose of Joe Bob Briggs," featuring the Joe Bob commentary version of "The Double-D Avenger" packaged with Joe Bob's commentary on "Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter."
Key Cast & Crew include: Kitten Natividad, Haji, Raven De La Croix, G. Larry Butler ("Frankenstein Vs. the Creature From Blood Cove"), Bill Winckler, Forrest J Ackerman, Mimma Mariucci, Sheri Dawn Thomas, Lunden De Leon.  Cinematographer/Editor Raoul J.

The Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge is a concrete double arch bridge located in Williamson County, Tennessee, [tpl]convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the northern terminus of the Natchez Trace Parkway. It is [tpl]convert|479.1|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long and carries the two-lane Natchez Trace Parkway [tpl]convert|44.2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] over State Route 96 and a heavily wooded valley. The [tpl]convert|177.4|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long main span is symmetrical, while the [tpl]convert|140.8|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long second arch is not, due to the slope of the valley at the southern end of the bridge. The bridge is unique in that it does not use spandrel columns to support the deck from the arch. Rather than being evenly distributed along the arch's length, the weight of the bridge is concentrated at the crown of the arch. The lack of spandrel columns results in a clean, unencumbered appearance.
The bridge, also known as the Natchez Trace Parkway Arches, is the first segmentally constructed concrete arch bridge in the United States. The arches comprise 122 hollow box segments precast in nearby Franklin, each of which was about [tpl]convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long and weighed between [tpl]convert|26|and|41|MT|ST|sp=us[/tpl] . The deck consists of 196 precast post-tensioned trapezoidal box girder segments, each typically [tpl]convert|2.6|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long. The sections atop the crown of the arch are [tpl]convert|3.9|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] deep. The foundations and piers of the bridge were cast in place.
The bridge was designed by Florida-based Figg Engineering Group and built by PCL Civil Constructors Inc., a subsidiary of PCL Constructors Inc. The arches and deck were constructed using a balanced cantilever method. Each arch was supported by temporary cable stays anchored from the top of the piers and the valley sides until it was fully built. This procedure was chosen in place of conventional shoring towers so that environmental damage to the valley would be minimized.[tpl]cite web | title=Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge over Tennessee Route 96.|url=http://www.pcl.com/projects/Archived/5500600/index.aspx[/tpl] The bridge cost US$11.3 million to build,[tpl]Structurae|id=s0002401|title=Natchez Trace Parkway Arches[/tpl] and was completed in October 1993. It was officially opened on March 22, 1994.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gelhardt.com/samples/finley/project13.htm |title= Finley McNary Bridge Engineering Projects[/tpl]
The bridge has won many awards for its design, including a Presidential Award for Design Excellence in 1995,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.figgbridge.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/IRMAProjectSite.woa/wa/view?site=Figg%20Engineering%20Group&section=Bridge%20Gallery&page=Natchez |title= Figg Engineering Group[/tpl] and an Award of Merit from the Federal Highway Administration in 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/EIHD/natchez.htm |title=Excellence in Highway Design 1997|publisher=Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation[/tpl] The Eleventh International Bridge Conference named it the single most outstanding achievement in the bridge industry for 1994.[tpl]cite web|title=International Bridge Conference: Bridge Awards.|url=http://www.eswp.com/bridge/awards.htm[/tpl] The bridge "impressed the... jury with its aesthetically striking double-arch design, which shows exceptional sensitivity to the historical context of the site."[ref]

CATEGORIES: Bananas, Tropical agriculture, History of Central America

The Union of Banana Exporting Countries ([tpl]lang-es|Unión de Países Exportadores de Banano[/tpl] or UPEB) was a Central/South American cartel inspired by OPEC. In 1974 Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama joined together in an attempt to form a banana exporting country cartel focusing on exports to the North American market.[tpl]cite book | last =Lafeber | first =Walter | year =1993 | title =Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America | publisher =W. W. Norton & Company | isbn =0-393-30964-9[/tpl] p. 207-208. The Philippines was the only major exporter of bananas to the United States which did not join.[ref]
 p. 181[/ref] The market for banana exports to Europe at this time was quite separate, with European countries being supplied largely by former European (mainly French and British) colonies in the Caribbean, which had privileged access to the European market.
Banana prices had gone up little in 20 years. A United Nations study had recently concluded that no more than seventeen cents of each United States dollar spent by North Americans on bananas went to producing countries. At the time bananas were monopolized by three US companies: United Brands Company (formerly United Fruit), Standard Fruit, and the Del Monte Corporation.
UPEB proposed an export tax of one dollar for every forty-pound box of bananas exported. The monopolies protested and threatened to withdraw their operations. There was also a glut on the world banana market and Ecuador, the leading producer, refused to enact the tax. Former President of Costa Rica José Figueres stated that Standard Fruit's property should be nationalized if the monopolies refused to pay the tax. Standard Fruit threatened the new President, Daniel Oduber that if there were any more threats, the company would pull out of Costa Rica. Costa Rica dropped its demand to 25¢ a crate.[ref]

[[Concept musical]]
CATEGORIES: Musical theatre

A concept musical is a musical where the show's metaphor or statement is more important than the actual narrative. Also known as a deconstructed or bookless musical, the concept musical has its roots in the plays with music that Bertolt Brecht wrote with Kurt Weill and other composers. While the genre's exact definition is debated, it is generally agreed that the concept musical's theme often provides social commentary and further room for exploration of form and structure. Characters may be isolated from one another, reflecting and commenting upon themselves through song. There is a strong focus on visual presentation, representation, and imagery when staging a concept musical.
Concept musicals were first introduced in the 1940s, though two shows compete for the title of 'first concept musical:' Allegro and Love Life. The form began to flourish in the late 1960s, with the advent and subsequent popularity of Man of La Mancha, Cabaret, and Hair. Stephen Sondheim, the most prolific author of concept musicals, created Company in 1970, bringing the genre to the forefront of the commercial realm. Director-choreographer Bob Fosse and producer-director Harold Prince were equally instrumental in making defining contributions to the concept musical. Modern examples of the concept musical include Assassins and Avenue Q. Shows ranging from Fiddler on the Roof to Sweeney Todd have been argued as being concept musicals, though there is little critical agreement. 
The concept musical has direct ties to the megamusical, which has similar roots in the Andrew Lloyd Webber work Cats, and the similarly plotless revue. Mirroring the social upheaval of the 1960s and beyond, the concept musical as a form provided a means of expression and experimentation for musical theatre writers and audiences alike.

Patrick Chamusso (born in 1949 in Mozambique) is a member of the African National Congress party of South Africa who participated in the militant actions of the organization during the apartheid era. 
One of three sons, Patrick came to live in South Africa when as a teenager he followed his migrant worker father to work in the mines of South Africa performing odd jobs.  After his father's death, Chamusso's mother remarried and bore another daughter.  He worked in various jobs on the mines and later found work as a house painter and street photographer.Patrick's Story from Two Sisters
When he was 28, he got a job at the Sasol's synthetic fuel plant at Secunda (Secunda CTL), the largest coal liquefaction plant in the world, located several hours east of Johannesburg.  Although not formally educated, he advanced quickly and ended up as a driver, a position that was well-paid.  His main job was to fetch coal from a neighboring mine and bring it into the refinery.  A talented soccer player who had formerly played for local leagues, his abilities later made him popular among his co-workers and in the community.
Chamusso was arrested in 1980 by South African Special Branch for conspiring with the ANC to bomb the Secunda refinery, a crime he insisted he did not commit.  He was later released without charges being laid. He reported that he had been tortured whilst a prisoner.  He fled to Mozambique where he joined Umkhonto we Sizwe, the militant arm of the ANC.Apartheid's Song from LA Weekly
After military training, he returned to South Africa where he single-handedly carried out a second, partly successful, bombing at Secunda, which - as was intended - resulted in no casualties.  After a massive manhunt, he was arrested and ultimately sentenced to 24 years in prison on Robben Island.  In 1994, as the apartheid system began to be dismantled, having served 10 years Chamusso was released under the new government's amnesty policy.Patrick Chamusso Biography from Working Title Films
After his release, Chamusso married a woman named Conney, and the couple had three children, in addition to fostering 80 AIDS orphans at their home in Mpumalanga.
Chamusso rose to world prominence in October 2006, when Catch a Fire, a biographical film depicting his struggle against the system of Apartheid in South Africa, was released.

Postcode 3000 was a planning policy for Melbourne, Australia coordinated by the City of Melbourne and supported by the state government, then under the newly elected Premier Jeff Kennett (LIB) .
The policy, which began in 1992, was aimed at increasing residential development in the Melbourne city centre including the central business district and St Kilda Road and was run through the mid to late 1990s.
The policy provided incentives for people living in the central area.  Nonda Katsalidis award winning design for Melbourne Terrace Apartments combined with a new desire for New York Loft Style living stimulated interest in consumers, and the first wave of lived in boutique apartments and trendy converted old buildings and warehouses.  Subsequent waves of developments saw the conversion of unnocupied lower grade office buildings and construction of new apartment towers.  The fruits of these efforts eventually spilled out into the neighbouring suburbs of Southbank and Melbourne Docklands and later Carlton (in the form of university accommodation).
After implementation, the populations of these areas increased dramatically and produced 3000 new apartments before the end of the decade.City of Melbourne - Strategic planning - Postcode 3000  The policy had the additional benefit of reducing total office occupancy and vacancy rates space (which were previously at their highest rates in decades), which in turn fuelled further construction in the commercial office space.

Many Higashi Hongan-ji scholars trace their line of thought to Kiyozawa Manshi, including such men as Akegarasu Haya (1877-1954), Kaneko Daiei (1881-1976), Soga Ryōjin (1875-1971) and Maida Shuichi (1906-1967). Some of his essays were translated into English, such as the book December Fan,Kiyozawa Manshi. December Fan: The Buddhist Essays of Manshi Kiyozawa translated by Nobuo Haneda. Kyoto: Higashi Honganji, 1984. OCLC 20248970 and have found a Western readership. Kiyozawa was instrumental to the establishment of Shinshū University in Tokyo in 1901. The university is now known as Ōtani University, and is located in Kyoto near Higashi Hongan-ji. Kiyozawa served as the first dean of the university.
In his life, however, Kiyozawa was an ambivalent figure. He was emblematic of both the need for modernization, and its pitfalls. He was not popular with the members of his temple, who considered his Dharma messages too difficult to understand. Accordingly, many of his disciples were branded heretics. Kiyozawa himself died of tuberculosis quite young and therefore some consider his thought to be immature and incomplete. Even today, many conservative Shin thinkers see Kiyozawa as being emblematic of what had gone wrong with the Ōtani school.

Akegaras was a former head of administration of the Higashi Hongan-ji who was a major inspiration to the formation of the Dobokai Movement.Popular Buddhism In Japan: Shin Buddhist Religion & Culture by Esben Andreasen, pp. 46,71,72 / University of Hawaii Press 1998, ISBN 0-8248-2028-2
In 1949 Akegarasu focused Shin practice in the direction of faith alone, declaring in a statement to his disciples: "First shinjin, second shinjin, third shinjin." This is basically the moment where Dobokai became official, although the movement did not receive official recognition until 1962. The early roots for the Dobokai Movement faith movement began in 1947 as the shinjinsha, or, 'true person community'.

 Mitchigamea or Michigamea or Mitchigamie were a tribe in the Illinois Confederation. Not much is known about them and their origin is uncertain. Originally they were said to be from Lake Michigan, perhaps the Chicago area. Mitchie Precinct, Monroe County in Southwestern Illinois takes its name from their transient presence nearby, north of the French Fort de Chartres in the American Bottom along the Mississippi.Combined History of Randolph, Monroe and Perry Counties, Illinois, J. L. McDonough & Co., Philadelphia, 1883, pg. 395 One of their villages in the American Bottom, inhabited from 1730 until 1752, is one of the region's premier archaeological sites; it is known as the "Kolmer Site".Brown, Margaret Kimball.  National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Kolmer Site.  National Park Service, n.d., 3.
It is suggested that the people later moved to Arkansas under pressure from the Iroquois. Their most well known leader was Chief Chicagou.  In 1673, Marquette and Joliet needed a translator from Miami-Illinois to understand the Michigamea; most contact was in Plains Sign Language. Jean-Bénard Bossu provides two sentences from the mid-18th century which according to John Koontz indicate that Michigamea was a Siouan language of the Mississippi branch.

[[Delano Park (Decatur)]]
CATEGORIES: Parks in Decatur, Alabama, 1887 establishments in the United States

The Delano Park, operated by the Decatur Parks and Recreation Board, is the oldest park in the city of Decatur, Alabama. 
It was created in 1887, as part of a master plan to "re-invent" the City of Decatur, then New Decatur.  The city created the "Decatur Land Improvement and Furnace Company" for this specific purpose.  The company employed a landscape architect by the name of Nathan Franklin Barrett to design a whole new city that had been ravaged by a Yellow Fever epidemic and the Civil War.  The park was designed to be the focal point of the entire plan.  
The park, named after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was dedicated in the 1930s by Roosevelt himself and later named in his honor as part of a newspaper contest, which sought to commemorate his vision for municipal parks across America. The land was donated to the city of Albany as part of the New Deal, which included a large plan to develop the poverty-ridden city. 
The park remained mostly a solitary attraction on the fringe of downtown as the only large park in town during that era.  This changed in the mid-1950s when the new Decatur High School constructed a new school building to replace an overcrowding "Riverside" High School building.
The far eastern end once consisted of a swimming pool called the "Blue Haven".  This pool has since been filled in, and the Decatur High marching band now uses a practice field that was created over the former swimming area.
The middle portion of the park contains a children's playground, the new "Splash Pad", and a ditch with a concrete bridge donated to the park.  The bridge was moved in the 1930s from Ferry Street to accentuate the beauty of the park and has been a favorite location for young and old alike ever since.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.decaturparks.com/pubParksDelano.asp| title = Delano Park  | year = 2009 | publisher = Decatur-Morgan County CVB [/tpl]

[[Peter Anders (tenor)]]

Peter Anders  (July 1, 1908 – September 10, 1954) was a German operatic tenor who sang a wide range of parts in the German, Italian, and French repertories. He began by singing lyric roles and later undertook dramatic roles with equal success.
Anders was born in Essen and studied at the Berlin Music Academy with Ernst Grenzebach, and later privately with Lula Mysz-Gmeiner, whose daughter Susanne he married. In 1931, he appeared in Berlin in La belle Hélène, and made his operatic debut the following year in Heidelberg, as Jacquino in Fidelio. 
He sang in Darmstadt (1933–35), Cologne (1935–36), Hannover (1937–38), and then at the Munich State Opera (1938–40), where he took part in the creation of Richard Strauss's Friedenstag. He returned next to Berlin and sang at the Berlin State Opera from 1940 until 1948. His repertory at that time included lyric roles such as Belmonte, Tamino, Lyonel, Hans, Hoffmann, Leukippos, Alfredo and Rodolfo. 
Beginning in 1949, Anders undertook such heavier roles as Florestan, Max, Tannhäuser, Lohengrin, Walther, Siegmund, Radames,  Otello, with equal success. 
He made a few guest appearances at the Royal Opera House in London, the La Monnaie in Brussels and the San Carlo in Naples, as well as appearing at the Glyndebourne Festival. 
Anders sang not only an impressive range of operatic roles but also appeared in several operetta parts. He performed regularly on German radio and in concert and was also active in oratorio and lieder recitals. 
He became a favorite of Adolf Hitler's regime and was not required to serve in the armed forces during the Second World War - instead entertaining German troops and participating in propaganda events. These activities tainted his reputation in the post-war world.  
While at the height of his career, Anders died in a car accident in Hamburg at the age of 46. He made many recordings which have been reissued on CD.

Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Albert Henry Hime KCMG, PC (29 August 1842 – 13 September 1919) was a Royal Engineers officer and later a prominent politician in the Colony of Natal.
He was born in County Wicklow. In May 1866 he married Josephine Searle in Plymouth, and three months later moved to Bermuda to work on a causeway there.  Lieutenant Hime began drafting up his plan for the Causeway in 1867, and it would take four years before the project was finished.  When it was finished, Hime delivered a report to Governor Lefroy in front of some 6,000 residents (approximately half of the population), describing his accomplishment as "solid and substantial...without any attempt at ornament" which would have increased the project's cost (the cost of construction,  £27,000, was £2,000 more than the colonial government raised in total revenues that year).  Lefroy responded that Hime's name would become part of Bermuda's history, and that the young lieutenant would have a promising career.  Hime was awarded a service of plate from the colonial government.
In 1878, Hime designed and built the Natal Mounted Police Headquarters on Alexandra Road.http://pmb-midlands.kzn.org.za/pmb-midlands/about/16.html  On 9 June 1899, he was appointed as the Prime Minister of Natal, a position which he held until 17 August 1903.
By the end of 1902, Hime had been appointed a Privy Counsellor, and had been awarded both an honorary Doctorette of Law by the University of Edinburghhttp://www.registry.ed.ac.uk/graduations/Honorary_Grads/1901_1910.htm and the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh, Scotland.  By this point, his full title was Lieutenant-Colonel The Right Honourable Sir Albert Henry Hime R.E., R.F., K.C.M.G., Prime Minister of Natal.

Lucie Delarue-Mardrus   (born in Honfleur, 3 November 1874 - died, 26 April 1945 ) was a French journalist, poet, novelist, sculptor, historian and designer.   She was a prolific writer who produced more than 70 books.
In France, she is best known for her poem beginning with the line "L'odeur de mon pays était dans une pomme" ("In the smell of an apple I held my native land.") Her writings express her love of travel and her love for her native Normandy. L'Ex-voto (1932), for example, describes the life and milieu of the fishermen of Honfleur at the opening of the twentieth century.
She was married to the translator J. C. Mardrus from 1900 to 1915, but her primary sexual orientation was toward women. She was involved in affairs with several women throughout her lifetime, and she wrote extensively of lesbian love.
In 1902-03 she wrote a series of love poems to the American writer and salon hostess Natalie Clifford Barney, published posthumously in 1957 as Nos secrètes amours (Our Secret Loves).Souhami, 179.  She also depicted Barney in her 1930 novel, L'Ange et les Pervers (The Angel and the Perverts), in which she said she "analyzed and described Natalie at length as well as the life into which she initiated me".
The protagonist of the novel is a hermaphrodite named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soirées. Barney appears as "Laurette Wells", a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover, loosely based on Barney's real-life attempts at regaining her relationship with her former lover, Renée Vivien.Livia, 22-23.
One admirer wrote to describe Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, stating in part;
"She is adorable. She sculpts, mounts to horse, loves a woman, then another, and yet another. She was able to free herself from her husband and has never embarked on a second marriage or the conquest of another man."

[[Tim Tweats]]

CATEGORIES: 1974 births, Living people, English cricketers, Derbyshire cricketers, Staffordshire cricketers

Timothy Andrew Tweats (born 18 April 1974) is a former English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Derbyshire between 1992 and 1999, and for Staffordshire in 2000.
He made his debut for Derbyshire in a loss against Glamorgan, though, playing as a lower-middle order batsman, he barely disgraced himself, being caught at 24.
He did not play first-class cricket again until the 1995 season, spending all of 1993 and a significant portion of 1994 in the Second XI. A slow starter upon his return, he excelled in the 1997 season, where he hit his debut first-class century, before making a career-best score of 189, and finishing high in the batting averages for the season. During his high-scoring innings, Kim Barnett partnered him to a county record second-wicket stand of 417, a record which stands to this day.
In 2000 Tweats played for Staffordshire.
Tweats is currently head of Business and IT at Alleynes High School.

Primarily, it is a type of meatloaf  or cold cut embedded with pimento-stuffed green olives.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-17/entertainment/0906150176_1_supermarkets-and-delis-jell-o-jellhttp://books.google.com/books?id=SJhrqEuJoRIC&pg=PA276&dq=%22olive+loaf%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iHcdUu_ZKOq0iwKVvICYBw&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22olive%20loaf%22&f=false A secondary meaning is that of olive bread, a bread where the loaf of bread is laced with whole olives.http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/10595/asparagus-sundried-tomato-and-olive-loaf
The  luncheon meat often also contains garlic, basil or sweet peppers for additional flavor.[tpl]fact|date=August 2013[/tpl] Olive loaf is a loaf-type luncheon meat, traditionally cooked in a loaf pan as opposed to a sausage cooked in a casing. Higher quality olive loaf is primarily beef and pork while less expensive olive loaf contains mostly chicken or turkey.[tpl]fact|date=August 2013[/tpl] Since most less expensive bologna is made from similar meats, and since many companies now cook olive loaf in sleeves to give it a round appearance, it is a common misconception that olive loaf is a sausage like bologna.[tpl]fact|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Olive loaf is similar to pimento loaf, the primary difference being the addition of pickles in place of olives.

[[Benjamin Pavy]]
CATEGORIES: 1874 births, Louisiana state court judges, American people of French descent, 1943 deaths, Louisiana Democrats, Louisiana lawyers, People from Opelousas, Louisiana, Cancer deaths in Louisiana, American Roman Catholics

Benjamin Henry Pavy (October 16, 1874 – April 1943) was a state district court judge in St. Landry and Evangeline parishes, Louisiana, who was gerrymandered out of office in 1936 through the intervention of his political rival, the powerful U.S. Senator Huey Pierce Long, Jr. He is widely believed to be one of the reasons why Huey Long was shot, because shortly before Long died, he passed a law gerrymandering his district so that it included more Long supporters, a way to defeat him in the 1936 elections. One of Pavy's sons-in-law, Carl Austin Weiss. Sr., M.D., was the alleged assassin of Long though the Pavy and Weiss families have long disputed that assertion.
Pavy (pronounced PAH VEE) was born in Coulee Croche in St. Landry Parish to Alfred Henry Pavy (died 1908) and the former Laperle Guidry. He was educated in the schools of Opelousas, the seat of St. Landry Parish. He had a brother, Felix Octave Pavy, Sr. (died 1962), an Opelousas physician who was a member of the St. Landry Parish Police Jury (county commission in most states) and thereafter the Louisiana House of Representatives, having served from 1932–1936, during the time of the Long assassination.
On November 4, 1896, Pavy wed the former Ida Veazie of Opelousas. Their children included three sons, Alfred Veazie Pavy (1899–1979) and the twins Albert Lionel Pavy (1902–1986) and Alfred Dudley Pavy (1902–1930), and four daughters, Yvonne Louise Pavy Weiss Bourgeois (1908–1963), Marie Aline Pavy (1911–1998), Evelyn Laperle Pavy (1904–1974), and Ida Catherine Pavy Boudreaux (born April 22, 1922).
Pavy was employed at the age of seventeen in the parish clerk of court's office. He worked there again when his father was elected as the St. Landry Parish clerk of court. He began his law practice in Opelousas in 1901, after having read law in the office of his future father-in-law, Edward P. Veazie. Pavy was elected as Democrat to the Sixteenth District judgeship in 1910 — at the time there were no Republicans competitive in Louisiana — and served until a change in the district lines caused him not to run again. The new lines placed the anti-Long St. Landry Parish in a revised district with pro-Long voter majorities in Acadia, Lafayette, and Vermilion parishes.
Elton J. Doucet (1901–1992), younger brother of legendary St. Landry Parish Sheriff Cat Doucet, recalled Judge Pavy in a 1991 interview: "All the farmers and all the poor people was {sic} for Huey P. Long. The Pavys couldn't get nothing {sic} they wanted from Huey. If he was your friend, he'd help you. If you were his enemy he'd stomp you down."[tpl]cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.org/la/orleans/newspapers/00000058.txt|title="Weiss's Body May Hold Clue," October 17, 1991|publisher=New Orleans Times-Picayune|accessdate=December 15, 2010[/tpl]
Huey Long repeated to news reporters an old claim that Edward Veazie had an African American mistress and allegedly warned Judge Pavy that if Pavy continued to oppose him, Long would announce that Pavy's family was tainted with "coffee blood." The charge would also have infuriated the former Yvonne Pavy's husband, Dr. Weiss.
Long also moved to have Marie Pavy dismissed from a position as a third-grade teacher in Eunice in Evangeline Parish. Marie lived for more than a year with her widowed sister Yvonne Weiss before a change in school administration permitted her to resume her teaching duties. Long also ordered the dismissal of Paul Pavy, Ben Pavy's brother, from his job as principal of Opelousas High School.
Both Judge and Mrs. Pavy died of cancer. They are interred at the St. Landry Catholic Church Cemetery in Opelousas.

[[Tightwad Hill]]

CATEGORIES: California Golden Bears football, Geography of Berkeley, California, Landforms of the San Francisco Bay Area

Tightwad Hill is the popular name for Charter Hill, the hill rising to the east of California Memorial Stadium at the University of California, Berkeley.  Tightwad Hill is so named as it affords a free view of the stadium's field, allowing fans of the Golden Bears to see the game live, even if the stadium is sold out or if they don't want to buy tickets.  The hill usually has its occupants, even when the stadium sports empty seats.   
Tightwad Hill is part of Charter Hill, the area behind campus that also encompasses the Big "C".  Tightwad Hill rises steeply about 100 feet above the east rim of the stadium, to a relatively flat area where spectators perch.  Created when Memorial Stadium was built in 1923, Tightwad Hill was created from the dirt removed during the excavation of lower Strawberry Canyon. The first time fans were seen on the hill for Cal games was in 1924. Since then, U.C. Berkeley students, staff, faculty, and the public have enjoyed fall days on the Hill, cheering for the Golden Bears and enjoying the view of the U.C. campus, downtown Berkeley, and the central San Francisco Bay. 
There are and have been many unique features on the hill over the years. Some of the current items include: 
- A bench that was built in a tree over 15–20 years ago
 - Trash cans and recycling bins to help keep the hill looking spotless following games 
 - Terraces formed into the steep hillside to facilitate seating
 - "The Tightwad Country Club", which is the seating area below the Tightwad Hill sign
 - "The Pit", which is an area filled with broken glass below the lowest seating area on the main part of the Hill.
 - "Tightwad Country Club Bench 2.0", which is an updated version of the bench that was in the same spot from 2004 to 2007 nailed to the base of a tree below the Country Club. The new bench made its debut during the 115th Big Game on October 20th, 2012.
In 2006, the Regents of the University of California began considering a major renovation of Memorial Stadium.  One plan proposed the construction of a new seating structure, the so-called "Eastside Seating Structure" on the promenade on the east side of the stadium.  If this were to be built, it could block views of the field from Tightwad Hill, possibly eliminating this unusual and colorful tradition. An organization called "Save Tightwad Hill" sued the University, claiming that the Environmental Impact Report for the Stadium project did not adequately analyze the impacts of the planned improvements on historic resources and scenic views. The group eventually settled with the University.  Under the terms of the agreement the University agreed in concept to preserve Tightwad Hill as an important Cal Football tradition, and to include representatives of Tightwad Hill in the design process for east side improvements. 
Green Day mentioned the hill's name in a song on their fourth album, Insomniac, but it is in reference to a hill that overlooks the football field at their high school and not the hill overlooking Memorial Stadium. Green Day has had a colorful history in and around the Berkeley area, having started their career there as an underground punk band.
Tightwad Hill will celebrate its 90th season in 2013.

The season started off with the club trying to rebound from a 5–11 season under now sophomore coach Lovie Smith. Smith was eager to lead his young team to a Super Bowl, but a preseason injury to starting quarterback Rex Grossman spelled disaster for the Bears.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2132968 |title=Second major injury in two years for Bears QB – NFL – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2005-08-13 |accessdate=2012-08-05[/tpl]

It has closed for refurbishment several times, most recently between December 2005 and July 2007. The name derives from the distinctive dome on top of a three-storey tower over the entrance.
The Dome is an Edwardian building and one of the oldest working cinemas in England, and was opened in 1911 (Brighton's Duke of York's Picture House was opened in 1910). It was opened by Swiss impresario Carl Adolf Seebold. It was originally named The Kursaal — a German word translating as "cure hall". The Kursaal was used as a health centre and entertainment complex by visitors to the seaside town. At the time it contained the Coronation Hall, which was used for roller skating, exhibitions, concerts and events, and the Electric Theatre, the first cinema run for paying audiences in West Sussex.
Following the outbreak of World War I leading residents of the town objected to the German name and after a competition with a prize of £1.00, the Cinema was renamed "The Dome".

Sanders trophy for Most Valuable Player (MVP).[tpl]cite news|title=Sciarra, Settles Share MVP Award|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=Dec 4, 1974|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/645660842.html?dids=645660842:645660842&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Dec+04%2C+1974&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Sciarra%2C+Settles+Share+MVP+Award&pqatl=google|page=F6[/tpl]      
Upon graduation in 1970 from B.C. Elmore High School in Houston, Texas, Gene was recruited by Notre Dame, Stanford University, University of Texas, Texas A&M, Oklahoma University, University of Nebraska, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and others.  He began his freshman year as a starting defensive linebacker with the UCLA Bruins in 1971 under the direction of coach Franklin Cullen Pepper Rodgers.
According the UCLA 1972 "The Spirit Of College Football" publication, as a pre-law major sophomore, he was "rated a fine prospect and figures to back up Tom Daniels at RLB.  He's tough and has a good speed, but obviously needs varsity game experience.  Lettered in football under coach Wendell Mosley at B.C. Elmore High School in Houston, Texas.  He won All-District honors at linebacker and also saw action at fullback."  He is listed on the 1971 UCLA Alphabetical Roster as being jersey #59, 6'2", 226 pounds, and 19 years old.
In 1973, Gene was a junior majoring in Political Science. The "1973 UCLA Football News Media Guide" states this about Gene Settles: "Started in 5 games a linebacker last year and is tabbed to be starter at LLB this fall. He tied with James Bright as the team's most prolific tackler last year with 79.  Had an excellent Spring practice and showed good leadership qualities. A solid all-around player, he continues to show steady improvement.  Was a starting linebacker on 1971 Frosh team."   
In 1974 UCLA hired-on a new coach with top credentials by the name of Dick Vermeil. According to the "1974 UCLA Football News Media Guide", Spencer "Gene" Settles was a senior majoring in Economics.  "He was a defensive inside linebacker (ILB), starting five games at left linebacker last year.  He filled in when Rick Baska was injured in third game of the season (Michigan State) and did a fine job, bringing down 48 opposition ball carriers.  Had a good Spring practice but was hampered by a sprained ankle for most of the practice period.  He emerged as number two ILB behind Fulton Kuykendall but should challenge for starting position. He is a solid and valuable performer.  Timed in 5.0 seconds for 40 yards without pads.  Started 5 games at linebacker slot as sophomore and made 79 tackles after starting at LB for 1971 Frosh."
Spencer Gene Settles was born in Houston, Texas on 25 February 1953 to the late Paul Silas and Martha Ann Tate Settles.

[[Cy Est Pourtraicte, Madame Ste Ursule, et Les Unze Mille Vierges]]

CATEGORIES: Poetry by Wallace Stevens

"Cy est Pourtraicte, Madame Ste Ursule, et les Unze Mille Vierge" is a poem in Wallace Stevens's first book of poetry, Harmonium. It was first published in 1915 in the magazine Rogue, so it is in the public domain.Buttel, p. 97. See also the LibriVox site for the complete public domain poems of Wallace Stevens. Butell characterizes it as one of the first two poems (the other is "Tea") to "successfully combine wit and elegance".Butell, p. 87. They are the earliest poems to be collected later in Harmonium.

The poem describes a woman and her prayer ceremony in a garden, and the Lord's religiously unorthodox response. If the "true subject" of the poem is an erotic moment, the "poetry of the subject" is a delicate poetic bouquet.(For more on this distinction see "Le Monocle de Mon Oncle".) Or one might follow Joan Richardson in viewing it as a record of Stevens's relationship with his wife, Elsie, disguised as a mock-medieval legend to "throw anyone who might be curious completely off the scent."http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/12/21/home/stevens-richardson.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Elsie did not like the poem's "mocking spirit", and one editor, Harriet Monroe, wrote a rejection letter to Stevens in 1915 that characterizes this and other submitted poems as "recondite, erudite, provocatively obscure, with a kind of modern-gargoyle grin to them --- Aubrey-Beardsleyish in the making." She advised him to "chase his mystically mirthful and mournful muse out of the nether darkness."Bates, pp. 73-4.
Bates speculates that the poem's title comes from a fifteenth-century French translation of the Legenda Aurea. It would have identified a simple woodcut of the martyrdom of Saint Ursula and her eleven thousand followers at the hands of the Huns. He sees the poem as lifting the veil which obscures "the subliminal side of religious piety."Bates, p. 73.

CATEGORIES: Buddhism in Japan, Pure Land Buddhism

The Ohigashi schism (お東騒動) was a religious schism in the Higashi Honganji subsect of the Japanese Buddhist sect Jodo Shinshu, which occurred in 1969 after a reformist group created internal divisions in the subsect.
The Dobokai Movement (同朋会運動), a reform group within Higashi Honganji, officially began on the 700th memorial of Shinran Shonin in 1962, though its roots were in a movement started in 1947 by a group of practitioners calling themselves the shinjinsha, or, 'true person community'.Popular Buddhism In Japan: Shin Buddhist Religion & Culture by Esben Andreasen, pp. 26, 69-73 / University of Hawaii Press 1998, ISBN 0-8248-2028-2 Two of its major leaders were Akegarasu Haya and Kiyozawa Manshi. 
The goal of the movement was to awaken and unite members of Higashi Honganji in the tradition of Mahayana Buddhism as laid forth by Shinran Shonin due to internal conflict over differences of  doctrinal opinion; such as over the idea of shinjin, and whether the Pure Land was to be entered in death or in this life. The Dobokai movement based itself largely on the Tannisho (a collection of sayings attributed to Shinran Shonin with commentaries by Yuien-bo, one of Shinran's disciples), and the idea of cutting through spiritual differences. 
The movement split Higashi Honganji into four different groups. Higashi Honganji-ha no longer owns the physical property of Higashi Honganji, which has been seized by another religious group entirely called Otani-ha that changed the temple's name to "Shinshū Mausoleum". Meanwhile, the treasure of Higashi Honganji-ha at the time, amounting to about $200 million in donations, was seized for use by a "nonprofit organization" which does not maintain any temples. In 2012 a court ruled that this money must be returned.

The Litchfield Female Academy in Litchfield, Connecticut, founded in 1792 by Sarah Pierce, was one of the most important institutions of female education in the United States. During the 30 years after its opening the school enrolled more than 2,000 students from 17 states and territories of the new republic, as well as Canada and the West Indies. Some 1,848 students known to have attended the school have been identified through school lists, diaries and journals, correspondence, as well as art and needlework done at the school.  Many more, unidentified to date, attended, especially before 1814, when formal attendance lists were first kept.  The longevity of the school, the size of the enrollments, the wide geographic distribution of the student body, the development of the curriculum and the training of teachers, all distinguish it from the numerous other female academies of the Early Republic. The young women were exposed to ideas and customs from all the relatively isolated parts of the new nation, developing a more national perspective than most Americans of the period.
More than 80 percent of the students were from out of town and boarded with families throughout Litchfield, under Sarah Pierce’s supervision.  The young women were well integrated into the social, religious and cultural life of the town, known for its staunch Federalist politics and Congregational religious practice.  Prominent residents, including the Reverend Lyman Beecher, Senator Uriah Tracy, Colonel Benjamin Tallmadge, Julius Deming, and the Oliver Wolcott family, had family, social, political and business networks which helped attract students to Litchfield. 	These well-known men also gave occasional lectures and talks to the students. The Reverend Beecher taught religion in exchange for free tuition for his children.  The leading men of the town and their wives judged the compositions, maps, art and needlework shown at the school’s annual exhibitions, adding to the school’s fame.
The school rose to prominence at the same time at the Litchfield Law School, operating simultaneously in Litchfield, CT and founded by Tapping Reeve in 1784.  Students often attended each school from the same families - sons attending the Litchfield Law School and daughters attending the Litchfield Female Academy.  The close proximity of the two schools also resulted in numerous marriages between Law School and Female Academy students.

Pierre Bastien (born 1953 in Paris) is a French musician, composer, and experimental musical instrument builder. He began building mechanical-based musical instruments at an early age, using items such as metronomes, cymbals, and pulleys. In 1977 he began collaborating with Pascal Comelade and composing music for dance companies. He performed in ensembles such as Operation Rhino, Nu Creative Methods, and Effectifs de Profil.
In 1986 he formed his own orchestra, Mecanium, composed of Meccano machines which play various instruments, such as Chinese lute, Moroccan bendir, Javanese saron, koto, and violin. These machines were often driven by the rotation of old turntables. By the 1990s Mecanium consisted of up to 80 machine 'musicians', and toured various art and music festivals, including events in Norway, Australia, Japan, Canada, Poland, and the United States.
Bastien has collaborated with artists such as Robert Wyatt, Jac Berrocal, Jaki Liebezeit, Pierrick Sorin, Lukas Simonis and Issey Miyake. He has released material on record labels such as Lowlands, Rephlex, Tigersushi, and Alga Marghen. He has also completed a doctorate on 18th century French literature, his thesis being on pre-surrealist Raymond Roussel.

[[Ratio spread]]
CATEGORIES: Options (finance), Derivatives (finance)

Ratio-spread is a strategy in options trading that involves buying some number of options and selling a different number of other options of the same underlying market and (usually) the same expiration date, but of a different strike price. 
Ideally, this strategy should be used when either A) the implied volatility of the options expiring in a particular month has recently moved sharply higher and is now beginning to decline, or B) the trader believes for whatever reason that the underlying market of the option(s) will move steadily in his favor during the life of the option.  The trader will use call options in this strategy if he believes the underlying market will move steadily higher, and put options if he believes the market will move steadily lower.
In the case of call options, the trader will buy some number of options having striking price X and write (sell) a larger number of options having striking price Y, where Y is greater than X.  In the case of put options, the trader will buy some number of options having striking price A, but write (sell) a larger number of options having striking price B, where B is less than A.
The "straight" ratio-spread describes this strategy if the trader buys and writes (sells) options having the same expiration.  If, instead, the trader executes this strategy by buying options having expiration in one month but writing (selling) options having expiration in a different month, this is known as a ratio-diagonal trade.
As with all option spreads, the trader in a ratio-spread will strongly prefer to buy options having a distinctly lower implied volatility than the options he is writing (selling).

Peter ("Pete") Dickson Pfitzinger (born August 29, 1957 in Camden, New Jersey) is a former American distance runner, who later became an author and exercise physiologist. He is best known for his accomplishments in the marathon, an event in which he represented the United States in two Summer Olympic Games: the Los Angeles Olympics (where Pfitzinger finished 11th) and the 1988 Seoul Olympics (where he placed 14th).
In the 1984 Olympic Marathon Team Trials in Buffalo, New York, Pfitzinger cemented his place among the best American marathoners of all time in stirring fashion by taking the lead halfway through the race, relinquishing it in the final mile, then storming past the heavily favored Alberto Salazar in the final fifty yards to win the race. Pfitzinger won the San Francisco Marathon in 1983 and 1986.http://www.arrs.net/HP_SFrMa.htm
Pfitzinger is the co-author (with Scott Douglas) of two highly popular training books for distance runners - Advanced Marathoning and Road Racing for Serious Runners. He is also a senior writer for Running Times Magazine.
Pfitzinger is a 1979 graduate of Cornell University. He also holds a Master of Business Administration from Cornell's Johnson Graduate School of Management and a Master of Arts in exercise science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
Pfitzinger's wife Christine is also a former world-class runner. The Pfitzingers have lived in New Zealand - Chrissey's country of origin - since the mid-1990s.

Gietmann, Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. "Gilles-Marie Oppenordt".  He specialized in interior architecture and decoration, though he has been connected with the furniture of Charles Cressent.There are designs for clock cases veneered with Boulle marquetry of tortoiseshell and brass; a single signed drawing for a piece of furniture, a bureau plat in the manner of André Charles Boulle in red chalk, survives, in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, New York; it is illustrated in Theodore Dell, The Frick Collection: V. Furniture, 1992: fig. 2 p.209; on the basis of the drawing, the design of the famous pair of commodes delivered for the Grand Trianon by Boulle in 1708 and 1709 (illustrated at André Charles Boulle) has been tentatively connected to Oppenordt by M.P.

The U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) is the primary provider of materiel to the United States Army. The Command's mission includes the research & development of weapons systems as well as maintenance and parts distribution.
It was established on 8 May 1962 and was activated on 1 August of that year as a major field command of the U.S. Army. Lieutenant General Frank S. Besson, Jr., who directed the implementation of the Department of Army study that recommended creation of a "materiel development and logistics command", served as its first commander.
AMC operates research and development engineering centers; Army Research Laboratories; depots; arsenals; ammunition plants; and other facilities, and maintains the Army’s prepositioned stocks, both on land and afloat. 
The command is also the Department of Defense Executive Agent for the chemical weapons stockpile and for conventional ammunition.
AMC is responsible within the United States Department of Defense for the business of selling Army equipment and services to allies of the United States and negotiates and implements agreements for co-production of U.S. weapons systems by foreign nations. 
AMC is currently headquartered at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, and is located in approximately 149 locations worldwide, including more than 49 American States and 50 countries. AMC maintains employment of upwards of 70,000 military and civilian employees.
The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission decision relocated AMC to Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. Personnel began relocating to Redstone in 2006 and the command was be completely relocated by summer 2011.

In finance, the Chen model is a mathematical model describing the evolution of interest rates. It is a type of "three-factor model" (short rate model) as it describes interest rate movements as driven by three sources of market risk. It was the first stochastic mean and stochastic volatility model and it was published in 1994 by economist Lin Chen, a Harvard doctorate, former US Federal Reserve Board economist, and professor of Yonsei University of Korea and Nanyang Tech University of Singapore.
The dynamics of the instantaneous interest rate are specified by the stochastic differential equations:[tpl]Clarify|needs to explain symbols in equations that follow|date=August 2009[/tpl]
In an authoritative review of modern finance (Continuous-Time Methods in Finance: A Review and an Assessment),  Chen model is listed along with the models of Robert C. Merton, Oldrich Vasicek, John C. Cox, Stephen A. Ross, Darrell Duffie, John Hull, Robert A. Jarrow, and Emanuel Derman as a major term structure model.
Different variants of Chen model are still being used in financial institutions worldwide. James and Webber devote a section to discuss Chen model in their book; Gibson et al. devote a section to cover Chen model in their review article. Andersen et al. devote a paper to study and extend Chen model. Gallant et al. devote a paper to test Chen model and other models; Wibowo and Cai, among some others, devote their PhD dissertations to testing Chen model and other competing interest rate models.

Southern Sierra Miwok is an Utian language spoken by the Native American people called the Southern Sierra Miwok of Northern California.  Southern Sierra Miwok is a member of the Miwok language family along with Lake Miwok, Coast Miwok (extinct), Saclan (extinct), Plains Miwok (extinct), Northern Sierra Miwok and Central Sierra Miwok.  The Miwok languages are a part of the larger Penutian language stock.  The original territory of the Southern Sierra Miwok people is similar to modern day Mariposa County, California. The Southern Sierra Miwok language is nearly extinct with only a few speakers existing today.Golla, Victor. California Indian Languages. Berkeley: University of California, 2011. Print. However, as of 2012, an active revitalization program is underway.
The name Miwok comes from the Sierra Miwok word miwwik meaning "people" or "Indians".  It was originally used in 1877 for the Plains and Sierra Miwok people, but was later reassigned to its current usage in 1908 to describe the set of Utian languages distinct from the western Coastanoan (Ohlone) languages.

[[Historiated initial]]
CATEGORIES: Iconography of illuminated manuscripts, Book design, Iconography

A historiated initial is an enlarged letter at the beginning of a paragraph or other section of text, which contains a picture. Strictly speaking, an inhabited initial contains figures (human or animal) that are decorative only, without forming a subject, whereas in a historiated initial there is an identifiable figure or a specific scene. Both sorts became very common and elaborate in luxury illuminated manuscripts. These initials were first seen in the Insular art of the early 8th century. The earliest known example is in the Saint Petersburg Bede, an Insular manuscript of 731-46, and the Vespasian Psalter has another.[tpl]sfn|Brown|2007|p=10[/tpl]
The size and decoration of the initial further gives clues to both its importance and location. Letters that began a new section of a text or a particularly noteworthy section might receive more flourishes and space. In luxury manuscripts an entire page might be devoted to a historiated initial.[tpl]sfn|Clemens|Graham|2007|p=29[/tpl] Both the size and the ostentatiousness of a manuscript reflect both on the status of the manuscript and on its owner. Manuscripts meant for everyday use or use by friars or university students often possessed little illumination, and hardly any elaborate historiated initials or flourishes. By contrast, manuscripts commissioned by wealthy patrons or for a wealthy monastery often possessed gold or silver illuminations, whereas simpler examples just used pen and ink.

In a second trial that concluded in November, 2008 (the first had ended in a mistrial), Elashi was convicted of terrorism financing crimes related to financial dealings with the Palestinian group Hamas. Elashi is appealing the verdict. He and his co-defendants contend that the Holy Land Foundation funded legitimate humanitarian aid in Palestinian territories rather than Hamas.Convicted in Terrorism Financing Trial http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/us/25charity.html New York Times, November 24, 2008
In 2002, Elashi was indicted, along with Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, a senior member of Hamas, for directing funds toward the group, which the U.S. Department of State has designated a terrorist organization.[ref]

InfoCom shared personnel, office space, and board members with the Holy Land Foundation, and both received investments from Hamas leader Marzook.[ref]

Elashi was arrested in December 2002 and charged with conspiracy, money laundering, and dealing in the property of a designated terrorist. The government later allowed the case against Elashi and his codefendants to be split into two cases. In 2004, Elashi and two of his brothers were convicted for illegally shipping computer shipments to Syria and Libya, which were U.S. State Department-designated state sponsors of terrorism.CORPORATION AND ITS OPERATORS SENTENCED IN FEDERAL COURT http://www.justice.gov/usao/txn/PressRel06/elashi_bayan_ghassan_basman_infocom_sent_pr.htmlU.S. Department of Justice, October 13, 2006 On October 13, 2006, Elashi was sentenced to seven years in prison.CORPORATION AND ITS OPERATORS SENTENCED IN FEDERAL COURT http://www.justice.gov/usao/txn/PressRel06/elashi_bayan_ghassan_basman_infocom_sent_pr.html U.S. Department of Justice, October 13, 2006 The second cased ended in a mistrial in 2007,in Holy Land Foundation trial http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2007/10/22/Mistrial-in-Holy-Land-Foundation-trial/UPI-69401193094134/ UPI, October 22, 2007 but Elashi and his codefendants were convicted after a retrial, in November 2008.

Elashi was originally housed at Federal Correctional Institution, Seagoville, because there was a requirement stating that the convicted men in the affair must stay around the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex area so the men could aid their lawyers with their appeals.

[[Attribute-value system]]

CATEGORIES: Knowledge representation, Specific models

An attribute-value system is a basic knowledge representation framework comprising a table with columns designating "attributes" (also known as "properties", "predicates," "features," "dimensions," "characteristics" or "independent variables" depending on the context) and rows designating "objects" (also known as "entities," "instances," "exemplars," "elements" or "dependent variables").  Each table cell therefore designates the value (also known as "state") of a particular attribute of a particular object.

V: Hävitetty (Chapter V - Ravaged) is the fifth full-length album by Finnish pagan metal band Moonsorrow. It was released on January 10, 2007 through Spinefarm Records. As a joke by the band, the name "Homosika" (gay pig) was released as the working title for "Viides Luku - Hävitetty".
Hävitetty follows up on the sound established on Moonsorrow's previous studio album, Verisäkeet. The album consists of only two songs, each exceeding 25 minutes in length, and act as organic compositions with recurring musical themes which are gradually built upon up to climaxes.  While the folk instruments and choirs of prior albums are still present, Hävitetty has a more prominent black metal influence; for example it features tremolo picking and blast beats. In the New York Times, the album was called "an engrossing hourlong album,"[ref]

[[Miglitol]]
CATEGORIES: Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, Piperidines, Polyols

Miglitol is an oral anti-diabetic drug that acts by inhibiting the ability of the patient to break down complex carbohydrates into glucose. It is primarily used in diabetes mellitus type 2 for establishing greater glycemic control by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides) into monosaccharides which can be absorbed by the body.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601079.html |title=Migliotl: MedlinePlus Drug Information |author= |date=1 September 2010 |work=MedlinePlus |publisher=National Institudes of Health |accessdate=13 April 2013[/tpl]
Miglitol inhibits glycoside hydrolase enzymes called alpha-glucosidases.  Since miglitol works by preventing digestion of carbohydrates, it lowers the degree of postprandial hyperglycemia. It must be taken at the start of main meals to have maximal effect.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/020682s010lbl.pdf|title=Glyset (miglitol) tablets label - Accessdata FDA|author= |date=August 2012 |work=Drugs@FDA|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=13 April 2013[/tpl]     Its effect will depend on the amount of non-monosaccharide carbohydrates in a person's diet.
In contrast to acarbose (another alpha-glucosidase inhibitor), miglitol is systemically absorbed; however, it is not metabolized and is excreted by the kidneys.
Recent study on rats by shrivastva et al showed that miglitol has antioxidant effect and hypocholesterolemic effect.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11745-012-3753-3 |title=Lipid Lowering and Antioxidant Effect of Miglitol in Triton Treated Hyperlipidemic and High Fat Diet Induced Obese Rats |year=2013 |last1=Shrivastava |first1=Atul |last2=Chaturvedi |first2=Upma |last3=Singh |first3=Shiv Vardan |last4=Saxena |first4=Jitendra Kumar |last5=Bhatia |first5=Gitika |journal=Lipids |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=597–607 |pmid=23334955[/tpl]

[[8×56mmR]]

CATEGORIES: Pistol and rifle cartridges

The 8x56mmR or 8 x 56 R M30S (C.I.P. civil designation) cartridge was adopted in the 1930s by both Austria and Hungary as a replacement for the 8×50mmR Mannlicher cartridge. It was originally created for the Steyr-Solothurn light machine gun as the M30. Later the cartridge was adopted for use in rifles in 1931 as the M31 to replace the 8x50mmR Mannlicher cartridge.  The updated cartridge coincided with an update to the Steyr-Mannlicher M1895 rifle in which the barrel length was reduced and the chamber re-cut to accept the new cartridge, and was the cartridge chosen by Hungary for the 35M rifle as a replacement for the Mannlicher M1895.  The 8x56mmR was also used in updated versions of Austrian and Hungarian machine guns such as the Solothurn 31M and Schwartzlose 07/31M.
This ammunition was made at a variety of plants as well as countries, including Austria, Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.

[[The Royal Tenenbaums (soundtrack)]]
CATEGORIES: Film soundtracks, 2001 soundtracks

The soundtrack to ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' features a score composed by Mark Mothersbaugh. Also featured are a variety of rock songs from the 1960s through 1990s.
There have been two soundtrack album releases for The Royal Tenenbaums. The first, in 2001, omitted some songs; notably, Paul Simon's "Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard," Van Morrison's "Everyone," John Lennon's "Look at Me," The Mutato Muzika Orchestra's version of The Beatles' "Hey Jude," two tracks by The Rolling Stones ("She Smiled Sweetly" and "Ruby Tuesday"), and Erik Satie's "Gymnopédie no. 1".
In 2002, the soundtrack was re-released with three songs not found on the 2001 release, but the two songs by The Rolling Stones were not included, because, while the band allows their music to be used in films, they rarely allow the songs to appear on soundtracks. The Van Morrison track, which served as the closing credits song, was also still missing. Additionally, the "Lindbergh Palace Hotel Suite," credited as original music by Mark Mothersbaugh on the 2001 release, was retitled on the 2002 soundtrack release as "Sonata for Cello and Piano in F Minor," performed by The Mutato Muzika Orchestra.
The adapted Cello sonata was originally written by the Romanian composer George Enescu, although it has been erroneously credited to the French composer Maurice Ravel. The confusion might come from the fact that the two composers were friends and attended the same composition classes.

It reached #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and # 7 on the Hot Soul Singles Chart. Though released on the 1971 album, Al Green Gets Next to You, the song was written in late 1968 and intended to be released on the 1969 album, Green Is Blues.

Billy and the Boingers Bootleg is the fifth collection of the comic strip series Bloom County by Berkeley Breathed.  It was published in 1987.
It is preceded by Bloom County Babylon and followed by Tales Too Ticklish to Tell.
The book includes a flexi disc with two Billy and the Boingers songs: "I'm A Boinger" and "U-Stink-But-I-♥-U." "U-Stink-But-I-♥-U" was performed by New Jersey hardcore band Mucky Pup who also rerecorded the song for their second album, A Boy In A Man's World. The track remains the band's signature song and is still played live to close out their shows.
The cover artwork contains parodies of the covers of two of the best-selling rock albums of 1986/87: the front cover is a send-up of Bruce Springsteen's box set "Live/1975–85"; the back cover includes a spoof of U2's "The Joshua Tree" (the original blurry/"narrow-heads" version of the cover; the spoof deliberately imitates these traits).  In both cases, the band member(s) in the original artwork are substituted with members of Billy and the Boingers.

CATEGORIES: Eurovision songs of Luxembourg, Eurovision songs of 1966

Ce soir je t'attendais (Tonight, I Waited for You) was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1966, performed in French by French singer Michèle Torr.
Torr had had her breakthrough on the francophone music scene as a 16 year old in 1963 with her second single Dans mes bras, oublie ta peine (In my Arms, Forget Your Pain). At the time she was signed to the French subsidiary of Mercury Records. 
Ce soir je t'attendais is an up-tempo pop track, with Torr telling her lover about her feelings of anticipation as she waited for him to arrive at her house. She sings that she had planned a romantic evening, but was slightly concerned due to the manner in which they had left each other the last time they were together. In any event, her confidence that he would come, paid off. 
Torr recorded her entry in five languages: French, German (Er kommt heute Abend zu mir), English (Only Tears are Left for Me), Spanish (Te esperaba), and Italian (Stasera ti aspettavo).
The song was performed fourth on the night (following Belgium's Tonia with Un peu de poivre, un peu de sel and preceding Yugoslavia's Berta Ambrož with Brez besed). At the close of voting, it had received 7 points, placing 10th in a field of 18.
It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1967 Contest by Vicky with L'amour est bleu. Michèle Torr went on to represent Monaco at the 1977 Contest with Une petite française.

Rasmussen's aneurysm is a pulmonary artery aneurysm adjacent or within a tuberculous cavity. It occurs in up to 5% of patients with such lesions. It may lead to rupture and haemorrhage. It is named after Fritz Valdemar Rasmussen. It is quoted as the cause of hemoptysis in tuberculosis patients.
While the "classic" terminology relates the lesion to cavitary tuberculosis, the term is now used for the anatomic aneurysm associated with other destructive lung lesions.  Even when the pulmonary aneurysm is present, the actual bronchial  bleeding may be from the bronchial artery, rather than from the pulmonary artery.

[[List of mammals of Singapore]]

CATEGORIES: Fauna of Singapore, Lists of biota of Singapore, Lists of mammals by location, Mammals of Southeast Asia

Mammals in Singapore currently number about 50 species. Since the founding of modern Singapore in 1819, over 90 species have been recorded, including large species such as Tigers, Leopards and Asian Elephants. Most of these have since become extinct largely due to rapid urban development, with occasional large mammals such as Asian Elephants swimming across the Straits of Johor from Johor, Malaysia.
Many surviving species have critically low population numbers, the most seriously endangered being the Cream-coloured Giant Squirrel, last sighted in 1995 and now possibly extinct. The Banded Leaf Monkey is also down to around 30 individuals. However, some species may be rediscovered in more remote parts of the country, such as the Malaysian Porcupine which was found on Pulau Tekong in 2005.
The most commonly seen native mammals are the Long-tailed Macaque and the Plantain Squirrel. The largest terrestrial mammal that can still be found is the Wild Pig, which is common on the offshore islands of Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong, but also found on the mainland. The largest mammals in Singapore, however, are marine creatures such as Dugongs and Dolphins. The Colugo is also doing well, but these are rarely seen due to their elusiveness and camouflage.

It's Nice Up North is a 2006 comedy documentary made by comedian Graham Fellows as his alter ego John Shuttleworth.
It was filmed by photographer Martin Parr and edited by Fellows on his laptop on a very low budget.
In the film, Shuttleworth travels to the Shetland Islands to test his theory that the further north in Great Britain you go the nicer people are, Shetland being the most far north part of the UK. He meets various Shetland people in unrehearsed situations. Many assume him to be a real person and not a comic creation, though some scenes are acted, particularly parts with famous local tour guide Elma Johnson.
It had a limited theatrical release in some art-house and community cinemas around the UK in 2006, including some screenings in Shetland, with Fellows answering questions after the showing. The film was released on DVD in the same year.
The film has also been shown on Sky Arts.

Cliviger is a civil parish in the Borough of Burnley, in Lancashire, England. It is situated to the southeast of Burnley, and northwest of Todmorden, having a population of roughly 2,500..Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Burnley Retrieved 4 February 2010 Although the whole parish lies within the Borough of Burnley it is actually split between three postal towns, with a few farms lying in either the Todmorden or Bacup postal areas.
Nowadays, it is mainly a dormitory area for people working in Burnley and other towns in East Lancashire and West Yorkshire.
Contrary to popular (and in some cases mistaken local) belief there is no village of "Cliviger". The principal settlements within the parish are Walk Mill, Southward Bottom, Overtown, Mereclough and Holme Chapel.
It is also a popular misconception that Cliviger is "one of" or "the second" largest civil parish in England. Whilst undoubtedly it does cover a relatively large area, there is no firm evidence to confirm this claim. The tendency in England is for parishes to become larger the further north they are situated; this is because the populace tends to become more thinned out in areas such as Cumbria and Northumbria. The largest civil parish in England is that of Simonburn in Northumbria, which absoutely dwarfs Cliviger in the area that it covers [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl].

CATEGORIES: Political satire, Tax resistance, Works by Astrid Lindgren, Swedish short stories, 1976 short stories, 1976 in Sweden, Taxation in Sweden, Works originally published in Swedish newspapers

"Pomperipossa in Monismania" (also called Pomperipossa in the World Of Money) is a satirical story written by the Swedish children's book author Astrid Lindgren in response to the 102% marginal tax rate that she incurred in 1976. It was published starting on 3 March 1976 in the Stockholm evening tabloid Expressen and created a major debate about the Swedish tax system.
The marginal tax rate above 100%, dubbed the 'Pomperipossa effect', was due to tax legislation that required self-employed individuals to pay both regular income tax and employer's fees.
The story, a satirical allegory about a writer of children's books in a distant country, led to a stormy tax debate and is often attributed as a decisive factor in the defeat of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, for the first time in 40 years, in the elections later the same year. She, however, continued to support the party for all her life.

CATEGORIES: 1500s paintings, Paintings by Raphael

Saint Catherine of Alexandria is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. In the painting, Catherine of Alexandria is looking upward in ecstasy and leaning on a wheel - an allusion to the breaking wheel (or Catherine wheel) of her martyrdom.Capgrave, John, and Karen A. Winstead. 2011. The life of Saint Katherine of Alexandria. Notre Dame, Ind: University of Notre Dame Press.
It was painted circa 1507, shortly after Raphael's arrival in Florence and shows the young artist in a transitional phase. The depiction of religious passion in the painting is still reminiscent of Pietro Perugino. But the graceful contrapposto of Catherine's pose is typical of the influence of Leonardo da Vinci on Raphael, and is believed to be an echo of Leonardo's lost painting Leda and the Swan.
This picture was partially used on the cover of The Smashing Pumpkins album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.

[[Mainstage]]

CATEGORIES: Passaic County, New Jersey

Mainstage was a short-lived rock music club in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey.  Mainstage's claim to fame was a short booking run of national and international Metal bands.  In the year and a half of existence, many local bands made the club their home as they pursued their dreams of being rock stars.  Mainstage gained popularity with musicians due to its unique booking policy, which put local talent on stage with their punk rock heroes, such as Multi-Platinum rockers The Ataris, Punk Legends Regan Youth, European sensation, Bring Me The Horizon and numerous more.
Mainstage was apparently built,owned, and operated by a college student, Joe, and a bunch of his friends who dubbed as security guards, stage hands, snack chefs, and booking agents.  The management was heavily criticized by the town counsel and police department for being so young.  Joe the owner claimed they were jealous of the club's instant success.  Additionally, Joe was personally criticized for his ignorance to towards the town officials and lack of cooperation with law enforcement.
Mainstage will best be remembered as the spot where NJ legends Folly played there last show for a crowd of over 1000.  Guests reportedly came from up to 5 states away to see the epic conclusion to a Jersey veteran band's last curtain call.
In the end, Mainstage was shut down by the town due to an advertising violation.   Regardless, Mainstage had the last laugh.  Management reportedly went on to open several other venues, and artist management offices is Maplewood and Hoboken among others.  It is also rumored that the Mainstage company bought a share in a Miami, FL nightclub co, explaining the title Mr. Miami that is under Joe's photo on the Maplewood facility (The Garden State Music Factory) MySpace page.
The company had a website - MAINSTAGENJ.COM which does not work anymore.  Rumors constantly emerge about the company starting a new concert venue, studio, or something totally new.  Their name sporadically appears on promotional fliers for some area bars, nightclubs and events.

The school motto is "First on the Pacific." The campus is the only historic landmark school in the district and the only one operating in the city. Following the dismissal of the entire faculty in 1999, it became the first school in Northern California to embrace and convert its curriculum to the concept of small learning communities. It was the first in California to start a school-based student health clinic. In response to the AIDS pandemic, it was the first school in California to distribute free condoms to students.

This is a list of mountains in Wales over 2,000 feet.
Nuttalls are hills in England and Wales that are at least [tpl]convert|2000|ft[/tpl] high with a relative height of at least [tpl]convert|15|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. The list was compiled by John and Anne Nuttall and published in The Mountains of England & Wales.[tpl]cite book |author=John & Anne Nuttall |title=The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 1: Wales |edition= 2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Cicerone (publisher) |location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria |isbn=978-1-85284-304-5[/tpl]
Hewitts are hills in England, Wales and Ireland that are at least 2,000 ft high with a relative height of at least [tpl]convert|30|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. This list was compiled by Alan Dawson and originally published in The Relative Hills of Britain[tpl]cite book |author=Alan Dawson |year=1992 |title=The Relative Hills of Britain |url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/marilyns/ |publisher=Cicerone Press |location=Milnthorpe |isbn=978-1-85284-068-6[/tpl] under the name Sweats.

Other than the inclusion of Ireland, the only difference between Nuttalls and Hewitts is that hills with a relative height between 15 and 30 m are Nuttalls but not Hewitts. This corresponds to roughly a quarter of all Nuttalls, and the exclusion of these least prominent Nuttalls was one of the reasons why the list of Hewitts was produced.
In the tables below, rows have been coloured according to which list(s) the hills are on. Hills that are additionally Marilyns or that are on the list of hills with a 600 m drop are also distinguished. In the parent column, the prominence parent is used where possible. The prominence parent of a peak can be found by dividing the island or region in question into territories by tracing the runoff from the key col of every higher peak. The prominence parent is the higher peak in whose territory the original peak resides.[tpl]cite web |url=http://peaklist.org/theory/theory.html |title=Prominence Theory |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |author=Aaron Maizlish |year=2003[/tpl] Prominence parentage data is unavailable for Nuttalls and Hewitts, so the hills' parent Marilyns are shown. The parent Marilyn of a hill is the Marilyn whose territory a peak resides in.
There are 190 Nuttalls on the list, of which 138 are Hewitts, and 53 are Marilyns.

HyperCam is a screencasting program made and created by Hyperionics (hyperionics.com). It captures the action from a Microsoft Windows screen and saves it to an AVI (Audio Video Interleaved) or WMV (Windows Media Video) or ASF (Advanced Systems Format) movie file. HyperCam will also record all sound output, and sound from the system microphone can also be recorded.
HyperCam is primarily intended for creating software presentations, tutorials, demonstrations, walkthroughs, and other various tasks the user wants to demonstrate. The latest versions also capture overlay video and can re-record movies and video clips (e.g. recording videos playing in Windows Media Player, RealVideo, QuickTime, etc.). Beginning with version 3.0, HyperCam also includes a built-in editor for trimming and merging captured AVI, WMV, ASF files.
The unregistered versions of HyperCam 2 and HyperCam 3 apply a digital watermark to the upper-left corner of each recorded file and will ask the user to register on every startup. Base registration, which costs $39.95, will eliminate this watermark.
Hyperionics has now made HyperCam 2 a permanent free download, saying that it now has a free license for "worldwide use".

CATEGORIES: Tripura, Tripuri culture, Northeast Indian cuisine, Indian cuisine by culture, Tripuri cuisine

Tripuri cuisine is the type of food predominantly served in the northeast Indian state of Tripura. The Tripuris are essentially nonvegetarians and hence the main courses are mainly prepared using meat, but with the addition of vegetables. Traditional Tripuri cuisine is known as Mui Borok. Tripuri food has a key ingredient called Berma, which is dried and fermented fish. The food is considered to be healthy as it is prepared without oil. Flavor wise, Berma is more on the sour side. Tripuri food such as bangui rice and fish stews, bamboo shoots, fermented fish, local herbs, and meat roasts are extremely popular within and outside the state.

The group released one album, Come Into Knowledge (1977), which is now considered a classic among rare groove collectors, artists (such as PM Dawn and A Tribe Called Quest who have used RAMP samples in their music) and Roy Ayers fans. Featuring the vocals of Sharon Matthews and Sibel Thrasher, the album was recorded in New York and California. The group were a vehicle for the songwriting talents of Roy Ayers and Edwin Birdsong.  Released in 1977, the set featured a version of Roy Ayers' "Everybody Loves The Sunshine" along with the 'rare groove' track "Daylight". The 12" vinyl release of the album used to (and still does) command very high prices as the album had originally never been released on any other format. The album was eventually re-released on CD in 2007.
The group split up shortly afterwards, but reformed in 2006 for new tours and recordings. 
RAMP performed June 30, 2007, with Washington, DC, jazz pianist Will Rast at Central Park SummerStage in New York City.
In 2008, the song "Daylight" was featured on Grand Theft Auto IV's fictional Soul/R&B radio station The Vibe 98.8.

The Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association (MVBA) is a community-based amateur commercial basketball league in Southern Philippines sanctioned by the country's National Sports Association for basketball, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP).  The league is made up of teams from the Visayas and Mindanao.  Formal operations began on February 25, 2006 with the opening of the ML Kwarta Padala First Conference at the MSU-IIT Gym in Iligan City, Lanao del Norte.  Forward Mark Bonifacio of Montana Pawnshop-Davao made the first basket in league history during the opening game versus PacMan-GenSan.
The league is a brainchild of multi-titled coach and Cebu City Councilor Raul "Yayoy" D. Alcoseba, who wanted to have a Vis-Min league managed by Vis-Min people and based in the area.  With the financial backing of sports patron Michel J. Lhuillier, the dream became a reality in late 2005 as Alcoseba and his staff began the groundwork by talking to potential team owners and sponsors.
Former FIBA referee Jose "Boy" Murillo and PBA legend Wilfredo "Willy" Generalao were named as the MVBA's two co-equal commissioners, with Murillo in charge of the Visayas games and Generalao in Mindanao.  Gov. Oscar S. Moreno, team owner of Misamis Oriental, was unanimously elected as the MVBA's Chairman.
In 2008, it merged with the National Basketball Conference (NBC), and Third Force Inc. (TFI) to form the new Liga Pilipinas.

The archives were founded in 1991 and are located in the building of the Swiss National Library. The foundation can be tracked back to the last will of the writer Friedrich Dürrenmatt, who died in 1989. Dürrenmatt gave his literary remains to the state, but under the condition that the state establishes a national archive for literature. 
The Swiss Literary Archives today contain around 100 important literary estates and premortal-estates and about 120 partial estates and collections, including material from:

[[Inis Beag]]
CATEGORIES: Anthropology, Sexology, Fictional islands

Inis Beag (Gaelic: "Little Island") is a remote island off the coast of Connemara, Ireland, near the Aran Islands. It contains a small, isolated Gaelic-speaking Irish Catholic community which  cultural anthropologist John Cowan Messenger observed in his study "Sex and Repression in an Irish Folk Community". During the period of his study between 1958 and 1966, Inis Beag supported a population of around 350, mostly living by subsistence farming and fishing. Its true identity is almost certainly Inisheer.
Messenger's study of this community has often been cited by anthropologists and sexologists as an example of extreme sexual repression. Inis Beag had no formal sex education, and sexual intercourse was treated by both sexes as a necessary evil which must be endured for the sake of reproduction. Phenomena such as menstruation and menopause were regarded with fear and disgust. Breast-feeding was avoided. Not only was premarital sex almost non-existent, but kissing, caressing, and any affection was seen as too sexual and was therefore prohibited. Nudity was extremely private, to the extent that even a married couple conducted intercourse in the dark and fully clothed, except for genitals. Sex was also practiced only in the missionary position. Any variation of sex was seen as deviant and sinful.
Bathing was also "unknown" and the average age at marriage was 36 for men and 25 for women. A man was considered a "boy" until age 40. Dogs were also whipped for licking their genitals.Jonathan Margolis, "O: The intimate history of the orgasm", 2003. P219 The repressive atmosphere, according to the researchers, led to high levels of masturbation, drinking, and alcohol-fueled fights.

[[Lady Elizabeth's Men]]
CATEGORIES: English early modern theatre companies, 17th-century English male actors, 1632 disestablishments

The Lady Elizabeth's Men, or Princess Elizabeth's Men, was a company of actors in Jacobean London, formed under the patronage of King James I's daughter Princess Elizabeth. From 1618 on, the company was called  The Queen of Bohemia's Men, after Elizabeth and her husband the Elector Palatine had their brief and disastrous flirtation with the crown of Bohemia. (In the winter of 1618–19, the two had their brief reign as the King and Queen of Bohemia, to start the Thirty Years' War.)
The company received its royal patent on 27 April 1611; it is thought to have been composed largely of former child actors from the children's troupes — the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul's — who were now grown to manhood. They may have started out playing at the Swan Theatre. On 29 August 1611, the company signed a bond with Philip Henslowe; they would rely on Henslowe for financing and would in the future act at Henslowe's new theatre, the Hope. 
Soon after their inception, the company was performing in the provinces; but by 1612 they were back in London, and in that year played four times at Court. The Honest Man's Fortune was one of their early offerings; the cast list added to that play in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679 names the actors Nathan Field, Joseph Taylor, Robert Benfield, William Ecclestone, Emanuel Read, and Thomas Basse.
In 1613, Lady Elizabeth's Men combined with the Children of Whitefriars; the combined troupe performed A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, by Thomas Middleton, at the Swan in 1613. Sometime in the next year or so, they joined in another combination with Prince Charles's Men. The company acted Ben Jonson's Bartholomew Fair at the newly built Hope Theatre on 31 October 1614.Actor Robert Dawes joined the troupe in 1614; his individual contract with the company is the only such document that survives from the era — and its rigorous terms show something of how Henslowe did business.
In 1615 the company had a falling-out with Henslowe, and as a result drew up a list of their grievances, the "Articles of Oppression against Mr. Hinchlowe."Gurr, Shakespearean Stage, p. 58 and ff. Most of their complaints were financial in nature — that Henslowe loaned them money on extortionate terms, and the like; but they also accused Henslowe of withholding play scripts that the actors had paid for, and of having "broken and dismemb'red five companies" in three years.
After Henslowe's death in 1616, the Lady Elizabeth's Men dissolved their bond with Prince Charles's Men, and left London to tour the provinces; they are absent from the extant records of the London theatres for roughly six years. During this era, they lost important cast members. Nathan Field joined the King's Men in 1616. William Ecclestone became a King's Man in 1614, as John Rice did around 1620; Joseph Taylor, who had stayed with the Prince Charles's company in 1616 and had become their leading man, replaced Richard Burbage as the King's Men's lead actor when Burbage died in March 1619. The leakage from the Lady Elizabeth's troupe included plays as well as personnel: works by John Fletcher and his collaborators that had been in their repertory, including Cupid's Revenge, The Coxcomb, and The Knight of Malta, ended up as King's Men's plays.Gurr, The Shakespeare Company, pp. 128, 159.  
The company reappeared in London in 1622. The actors worked for Christopher Beeston; in April 1624, they performed Philip Massinger's The Renegado. Defections continued: in 1624 Eliard Swanston left to join the King's Men. In 1625, the Queen of Bohemia's Men were replaced by, or combined with, the newly created Queen Henrietta's Men.
In 1628 a new charter was granted to a successor company; this version of the troupe toured the provinces and showed little if any activity in London. It disappeared after 1632.Murray, pp. 259-62.

Gorbea or Gorbeia is a mountain and massif, the highest in Biscay and Alava (Basque Country, Spain), with a height of 1,481 m AMSL. The massif covers a wide area between the two provinces. The main mountain is a round grass-covered summit where a 20-metre-tall metallic cross has been constructed to reach the altitude of 1,500 m. Other important mountains of the massif are the Berretín (1,227 m), Lekanda (1,301 m) and Aldamin (1,376 m) limestone peaks.
Part of the massif is delimited North by the high karstic plateau of Itxina, an intrincate landscape of limestone full of shafts and caves such as Supelegor. The Atxular's Eye cave is the only walking access to the plateau.
The South is delimited by the Berretín mountain and the lush forests of Zuia
The entire massif has been enclosed in a natural park of 200 km² created by the Basque Government in 1994 to preserve the local flora of beech and oak and fauna of wild boar and deer. The main access points for the mountain are Murgia from Alava and Areatza from Biscay.

Enele "Henry" Tuilagi (born 12 August 1976) is a Samoan rugby union footballer. He currently plays for USA Perpignan in the French club competition, the Top 14, and has appeared ten times for his national team Samoa. He previously spent a year playing in the Italian Super 10 competition for Parma as well as a spell in Rugby League.
Tuilagi made 24 first team appearances during his first season with the Leicester Tigers. He scored a try on his debut match for the Tigers against London Irish. He soon established himself firmly in the Tigers line-up, but his next season was cut short with a broken leg in the final home game against the London Wasps.
The Tuilagi family have strong connections with Leicester Tigers; Henry's brother Alesana (Alex) played for Leicester before moving to play in Japan, and his brothers Fereti (Freddie) and Anitelea (Andy) and Sanele Vavae Tuilagi are former players. His brother Manu is still at Leicester. Manu began his first season with Leicester in the 2010–11 Aviva Premiership and made his debut for England against Wales in August 2011.
Henry Tuilagi has made a real impact in the back row after joining his elder brother Fereti when at Leicester. He made 24 first team appearances in his first season, scoring a try on his debut in the opening game against London Irish, and has since consolidated his position both in the team and as a favourite of the fans. His 2004/05 season was cruelly cut short, however, when he suffered a broken leg in the final home Premiership match against London Wasps in April.
Henry previously played for Italian club Parma, where his younger brother Alesana had joined him. He appeared for Parma against London Wasps at High Wycombe in the first round of the European Challenge Cup, and then at Caerphilly in the quarter final of the same competition in January 2003. The No.8 was first included in the Samoa squad for the 2000 Pacific Rim Championship, but had to wait another two years for his test debut against Fiji in Apia, Samoa in June 2002.
Both Fereti and Alesana joined him in the international team later in the month when all three brothers played together in the World Cup qualifier against Fiji at Nadi. He was also capped for Samoa at Rugby League in 1999.
Tuilagi was known for his enormous strength, and is one of the strongest athlete in sporting history whose career was not dedicated to powerlifting as a end in itself. He bench pressed 250 kg (over 550 lb) for 5 reps at his peak.http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/healeys-crunch-battles-513267

Hardware-dependent software (HDS), the part of an operating system that varies across microprocessor boards and is comprised notably of device drivers and of boot code which performs hardware initialization. HDS does not comprise code which is only specific to a processor family and can run unchanged on various members of it. The HDS is alternatively called the BSP, for Board Support Package, especially in the world of commercial operating systems where the processor family code is distributed in binary form only.
Often software that runs on operating systems may be hardware dependent at first, but emulators can reduce dependencies for specific hardware.

The 1981 Embassy World Darts Championship was the fourth year that the British Darts Organisation had staged a world championship. The field was expanded from 24 to 32 players, the format which would remain for many years. For the third successive year the tournament was staged at Jollees Cabaret Club in Stoke-on-Trent.
Eric Bristow was back to defend his title and would face John Lowe the champion of two years previously in the final. The final was the best of nine sets, but there was a break scheduled after three sets where the third-fourth place play-off match would be held.
Lowe ran away with the first two sets without dropping a leg and took the first leg in the third set before Bristow finally got onto the scoreboard. The "Crafty Cockney" held on to take that third set to go into the break just one set behind. As in the previous year's final, Bristow edged ahead to lead 4-3 in sets and Lowe (as Bobby George did in 1980) had darts to take the match into a final set. However Lowe missed three attempts at double ten and Bristow took out double four to win the title for the second year running.

[[National Congress of Fiji]]

CATEGORIES: Fiji Indian organisations, Political parties in Fiji

The National Congress of Fiji was formed on 10 January 1965 at the Kisan Sangh Hall in Lautoka, in front of 1,500 farmers, led by Ayodhya Prasad. The Congress sent a telegram to the Secretary General of the United Nations stating that 80,000 Fiji Indians wanted to settle in a foreign country.  The purpose of the telegram was to draw the attention of the United Nations to the plight of the Fiji Indians. The telegram had the desired result, as under pressure from the United Nations the  Colonial Secretary called a Constitutional Conference for 26 July 1965. 
Ayodhya Prasad and the Congress were bitterly opposed to A.D. Patel and the Federation Party.  Prasad believed that A.D. Patel actually did not want independence for Fiji and used the fear of common roll to deter other races from agreeing to independence. On 21 July 1965, before the delegates departed for the London constitutional conference, the Congress called a meeting in which Fijian and European members of the Legislative Council were invited. The purpose of the meeting was to ensure that delegates to the London Conference were aware that there was at least one group of Fiji Indians willing to work with people of other races to achieve independence.
In October 1965, Ayodhya Prasad met Ratu Kamisese Mara and suggested the establishment of a new political party made up of the Fijian Association and National Congress of Fiji. Ratu Kamisese Mara got the Europeans to join up as well and several meetings were held before it was decided on 29 November 1965 to form the Alliance Party. The Alliance was formed on 12 March 1966 with the coming together of the Fijian Association,  National Congress of Fiji, General Electors Association, Suva Rotuman Association, Rotuman Convention, Chinese Association, All-Fiji Muslim Political Front, Fiji Minority Party and the Tongan Organization, along with Vijay R. Singh, who joined it independently. 
For the 1966 elections, the Alliance Party asked the National Congress to put forward names of its candidates. Ayodhya Prasad put his own name for the Western cross-voting seat, while K.S. Reddy was nominated for the Nadi/Nadroga seat and James Shankar Singh for the Ba seat. Vijay R. Singh, was able to use his influence with Ratu Kamisese Mara to have the Western cross-voting ticket given to K.S. Reddy and the Nadi/Nadroga ticket (against A.D. Patel) given to Ayodhya Prasad. This incident showed how both Ayodhya Prasad and Vijay R. Singh trying to outmeanouvre each other for the leadership if Indians in the Alliance Party. Ayodhya Prasad lost to A.D. Patel by 7601 votes to 4025 votes and K.S. Reddy won against his Federation party opponent.
Originally Indians had joined the Alliance Party as members of the National Congress, but Vijay R. Singh encouraged people to join the Party directly. Ayodhya Prasad believed that the Indians would have a better say in the Alliance Party if they joined it through the National Congress but was powerless to prevent the move to direct membership as he was afraid that this would be seen as an attempt by him to destabilise the Alliance Party. With failing health he could do little and the National Congress was wound up in 1967.

It is the successor to the MAYA I which was composed of only 23 logic gates and could only complete specific games of tic-tac-toe.  MAYA-II has more than 100 DNA circuits and can now thoroughly play a game of tic-tac-toe.  It is very slow - one move in a game of tic-tac-toe can take up to 30 minutes making it more of a demonstration than an actual application.Meet MAYA-II, the new DNA computer that can play Tic-Tac-Toe - Engadget
The arrangement of this device looks like that of a tic-tac-toe grid and consists of nine wells coated with culture cells. The logic gates are made of the E6 Deoxyribozymes (or DNAzyme) which react to specific oligonucleotide input. Upon reaction, the DNAzyme cleaves the substrate producing an increase in red or green fluorescence, depending on whether it is the computer's or the human's turn respectively.
This technology was used to deepen the quality of diagnostics given to patients infected with the West Nile virus. Joanne Macdonald, a Columbia University virologist, hopes this device can be implanted in the human body and control the presence of cancer cells or the levels of insulin for diabetic patients.http://acswebapplications.acs.org/applications/ccs/application/index.cfm?PressReleaseID=2724&categoryid=2
One of the suggested uses put forward by MAYA's creators is that technology such as this can be used in situations where fluid is involved, such as in a sample of blood or a body, since it does not use traditional silicon components.https://digamma.cs.unm.edu/wiki/bin/view/McogPublicWeb/MolecularAutomataMAYAII MAYA-II

The public database allows the general public access to information regarding manufacturing inspections completed by regulatory authorities from all European Economic Area (EEA) countries. Prior to the enactment of the EudraGMP database, information only came from a limited number of European countries. The European regulatory authorities update the database continuously and expect it to grow extensively over the next few years as more “GMP certificates are imported each year.”

[[Mira River (Portugal)]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Portugal

The Mira River is a Portuguese river located in southwestern Alentejo.
Its meander length is 145 km.
It has its sources on the northern slopes of the Serra do Caldeirão and pursues a southeast-northwest course with a generally mild inclination to the Atlantic Ocean, where it discharges through a small calm delta near the town of Vila Nova de Milfontes, 115 km south to Lisbon. It is one of the two only rivers in Portugal with a chiefly south-north orientation (the other being its neighbour Sado) and one of the few rivers in Europe with this orientation.
Mira basin borders Sado River basin at north and Guadiana River basin eastwards.
Main tributaries in the right bank: Torgal Rivulet, Luzianes River and Perna Seca River. Main tributaries in the left bank include rivers Macheira, Guilherme and Telhares. 
Distributary streamlines run perpendicularly along the coastline and discharge directly to the Atlantic Ocean.
Since its name origins are prior to Roman dominion in the zone, it is believed, that the name Mira may have the same Celtic or pre-Celtic origin of that of the old city of Miróbriga (cradle of the modern city of Santiago do Cacém), whose ruins lie 32 km to the north. It is known that in the pantheon of the local tribes (called Celtici by the Romans) there was a god for whom devotion was made to protect the waters, whose name was Mirobieus.

Cynomya mortuorum belongs to the order Diptera, sometimes referred to as "true flies". In English, the only common name occasionally used is "fly of the dead" ([tpl]Lang|de|Totenfliege[/tpl] in German). It has a bluish-green appearance, similar to other Calliphoridae and is found in multiple geographic locations with a preference for colder regions. Belonging to the family Calliphoridae, it has been shown to have forensically relevant implications due to its appearance on carrion. Current research is being done to determine C. mortuorum's level of importance and usage within forensic entomology.

[[Tanam]]
CATEGORIES: Carnatic music terminology

Tanam or Taanam (pronounced tānam) is one of the methods of raga improvisation (manodharma) in Carnatic Classical Music tradition, suited mainly for vocal music, Violin and Veena.
It consists of improvising a particular raga with repetition of syllables like aa, nam, tham, taa, na, thom, tha, nom etc. Use of rhythmic pulse has an important place in taanam exposition, and the singer is sometimes joined by the mridangam artist, since this is said to enhance the effect of the performance. The tradition of mridangam artist accompanying during tanam is usually credited to the custom of Kerala based carnatic musicians.[tpl]fact|date=December 2012[/tpl]
There are various tanams like Chakra Tanam, Vakra Tanam, Aja Tanam, Gaja Tanam, Markata Tanam, Vadhya Tanam etc.
Tanam is the second part of a Raagam Taanam Pallavi, and comes immediately after the raga is sung but before the pallavi is about to begin. Among these three modes, tanam is rarely sung very elaborately when compared to raga and pallavi, the reason usually cited for this being that tanam singing requires a lot of physical stamina, sound knowledge of the fundamentals of classical music, good practice and experience.
In Violin and Veena solo concerts, however, tanam is almost always performed as part of the main piece. 
Tanam singing is regarded as a dying art today with musicians not having the patience or the aptitude to take up such scholarly rigorous pursuits.Tanam singing - A dying art

Schwäbisch Hall, a historic German town, was attacked by 24 American Liberator bombers on 23 February 1945 during World War II. Three smaller attacks followed. On 25 February 1945, 53 civilians died and the old bridge collapsed. Then, and on 17 April 1945, the old Rathaus was reduced by incendiary bombs to rubble. Though several buildings were destroyed or damaged, the historical old town suffered comparatively little.
Altogether, the great majority of houses in the city survived the war without any damage, so still today the spectacular medieval houses can be admired.

The 1992 Embassy World Darts Championship was held from 3–11 January 1992 at the Lakeside Country Club, Frimley Green, Surrey.
With Eric Bristow and defending champion Dennis Priestley both going out in round two, the way was paved for the top two seeds, Phil Taylor and Mike Gregory, to make it to the final – notably, the first since the inauguration of the World Championship in 1978 that neither featured Bristow nor John Lowe.
In a titanic affair, full of big scores and high checkouts, it went to the final set and a tiebreak, where Gregory missed two chances each at double 8, double top and double 10 for the title. It also made Gregory the first and only player to miss darts at double to win a world championship and eventually lose.
Taylor took full advantage and sent the match to a sudden-death leg, which he won to take his second World title.

The Sittaung ([tpl]lang-my|စစ်တောင်းမြစ်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-my|sɪʔ táʊɴ mjɪʔ|[/tpl]; formerly, the Sittang or Sittoung) is a river in south central Myanmar in Bago Division. The Pegu Range separates its basin from that of the Irrawaddy. The river originates at the edge of the Shan Plateau southeast of Mandalay, and flows southward to the Gulf of Martaban. Its length is 420 km and its mean annual discharge is around 50 cubic kilometers per year.
Although it flows through fairly flat country, the Sittaung has a notorious tidal bore  at its mouth which has precluded any but very small craft navigating the river. The river is navigable for 40 km year round and for 90 km during three months of the year. The river is used primarily to float timber south for export.[tpl]Cite web| title=Sittaung River |publisher=Myanmar's Net| url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar/sittaung-river.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090416025829/http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar/sittaung-river.htm|archivedate=16 April 2009|deadurl=no[/tpl] Strong currents make the river even less valuable as a means of transport in eastern Burma. Its basin does not have the same richness for agriculture as the Irrawaddy because there is no soil flowing down from the Himalayas.

The city of Ulm, a city in the federal German state of Baden-Württemberg, situated on the River Danube, was heavily bombed during World War II. The heaviest air raid was on 17 December 1944, which killed and injured hundreds but left 25,000 people homeless. By the end of the war, 81% of the city centre was destroyed. Only 1,763 out of 12,756 buildings were intact. But Ulm Münster still towered above the ruins, as it was left intact by Allied bombers who utilized it as a navigational landmark. Water-filled bomb craters covered the ground, following the rain. The rubble was so thick that walking was almost impossible. This was the British Royal Air Force Bomber Command's first and only raid on Ulm. Two large lorry factories, Magirus-Deutz and Kässbohrer were the primary targets.  There were several other important industries and some Wehrmacht barracks and depots. A total of 1,449 tons of bombs were dropped during the 25-minute raid, starting in the city centre (Münsterplatz) and then creeping back to the west, across the industrial and railway areas and out into the country. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 establishments destroyed. 
There were 317 Avro Lancaster bombers and 13 de Havilland Mosquito light bombers of No. 1 Group RAF and No. 8 Group RAF. There were 2 Lancasters lost.Royal Air Force Campaign Diary December 1944

CATEGORIES: Plant toxins

Phytotoxin refers to a substance, known as phytotoxic substances, in soils inhibitory to the growth of or poisonous to plants. Phytotoxic substances may result from human activity, or they may be produced by plant roots, by microorganisms, or by naturally-occurring chemical reactions."Science Encyclopedia:Biochemistry" http://science.jrank.org/pages/39180/phytotoxin.html 2010/4/5. A good soil will protect plants from toxic concentrations of such substances by ventilating gases, by decomposing or adsorbing organic toxins, or by suppressing toxin-producing organisms. Many substances produced by plants are secondary metabolites and are the by-products of primary physiological processes.Raven, Peter H,Ray F. Evert, Susan E. Eichhorn: "Biology of Plants", pages 27-33. Some examples of phytotoxins exist among the plant secondary compound classes of alkaloids, terpenes, and especially phenolics, though not all such compounds are phytotoxic. They can be found as well in herbicides and substances produced by bacteria.

An outwardly friendly and nice person, she believed that she was doing people a favour by killing them as it brought them peace from the madness of Mega-City One. Homer didn't believe this but went along with it out of love for her. While the judges were aware of their killings, they proved unable to identify her.
In one occasion, she took advantage of a citywide war to kill more people. Judge Dredd Megazine 3.58
Her identity finally discovered by Dredd in "Shakedown" during a raid on an apartment block when crime levels in said block were at an all time high. Megazine #208 However, she ecaped to Brit-Cit (via Oz) with Homer and opened  legal a euthanasia clinic. Much to Homer's dismay, however, Oola began murdering people again (leading to Dredd being sent to Brit-Cit to investigate): she revealed her motive to be a sham when she admitted that killing wasn't the same when the victims "want it". She also revealed she intended to kill him as well, as a present for Christmas. Homer informed the Brit-Cit judges and they and Dredd raided the Blint's apartment block, but Oola had already fled after injecting her husband.

CATEGORIES: Pasta, Italian cuisine

Bigoli (Venetian: bìgołi) is an extruded pasta in the form of a long and thick tube. Traditionally they were made with buckwheat flour, but are more commonly made with whole wheat flour now. Traditionally, duck eggs are used for the pasta. It closely resembles bucatini. Bigoli is a term used in Treviso, whereas the term pici is used in Tuscany for a similar sized pasta without the hole in the center.
In "La vecchia cucina eugubina" they say that this noodle is as thick as a wooden needle for knitting stockings.

[[Database refactoring]]
CATEGORIES: Extreme programming, Databases

A database refactoring is a simple change to a database schema that improves its design while retaining both its behavioral and informational semantics.   A database refactoring is conceptually more difficult than a code refactoring; code refactorings only need to maintain behavioral semantics while database refactorings also must maintain informational semantics.Scott Ambler and Pramod Sadalage (2006). Refactoring databases: Evolutionary database design. Addison-Wesley. ISBN 978-0-321-29353-4
The process of database refactoring is the act of applying database refactorings to evolve an existing database schema (database refactoring is a core practice of evolutionary database design).  You refactor a database schema for one of two reasons: to develop the schema in an evolutionary manner in parallel with the evolutionary design of the rest of your system or to fix design problems with an existing legacy database schema
Database refactoring does not change the way data is interpreted or used and does not fix bugs or add new functionality.  Every single refactoring to a database leaves the system in a working state, thus not causing maintenance lags, provided the meaningful data exists in the production environment.
An example of database refactoring would be splitting an aggregate table into two different tables in the process of database normalization

CATEGORIES: Geography of Biscay, Basque mountains

Urkiola is a mountain range of the Basque mountains in Biscay near Durango, in the western Basque Country, Spain. The range's highest mountain is Anboto (1331 m). The range runs from west to east and forms the water divide of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean basins.
It was declared "Natural park" on 29 december 1989 because the Basque government wanted to protect the variety of wildlife and flora that it has. In the center of this natural park exists a church which it is called Santuario de Urkiola. This is the church of the Saints Antonios Abad and De Padua. It is one of the most beautiful and visited Basque churches.
The Basque mithology takes part in this natural park too. Some people thinks that on one of the sides of the Anboto mountain there is the face of the Basque god Mari.

It was bombed by British bombers (277 Lancasters and 8 Mosquitos of Nos 1 and 8 Groups) on 19 March 1945 during World War II, a few days before it was taken by the US Army. 85% of the city was destroyed. Hanau lost its old monuments, and the medieval section of the city was levelled. The ancient castle, arsenal, city theater and the birthhouse of the Grimm brothers were destroyed. Only half of the Walloon church still stands today. Hanau became a major garrison town in the late 19th century and was (and is) an important junction on the German railway system.

René-Joseph Kimber (November 26, 1786 – December 22, 1843) was a physician and political figure in Lower Canada and Canada East. His grandfather's surname was originally spelled Jékimbert.
He was born in the town of Quebec in 1786, the son of René Kimber, and studied at the Collège Saint-Raphaël at Montreal. He apprenticed in medicine at Trois-Rivières, qualified to practice in 1811 and set up practice at Trois-Rivières. In 1811, he married Apolline, the daughter of Montreal merchant Pierre Berthelet. Kimber served in the militia during the War of 1812 as an officer and surgeon. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Trois-Rivières in an 1832 by-election and was reelected in 1834. He supported the Ninety-Two Resolutions but did not support the use of force. Although he opposed the union of Upper and Lower Canada, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Champlain in 1841. In August 1843, he was named to the Legislative Council.
He died in Montreal in 1843.
His daughter Harline married Henry Judah, who represented Champlain in the legislative assembly after Kimber was named to the legislative council. His sister Clotilde married Charles Langevin, who represented Hampshire in the legislative assembly, after the death of her first husband.

[[Gogonasus]]
CATEGORIES: Devonian fish, Lobe-finned fish, Prehistoric bony fish, Gogo fauna

Gogonasus (meaning "snout from Gogo") was a lobe-finned fish known from 3-dimensionally preserved 380 million-year-old fossils found from the Gogo Formation in Western Australia. It lived in the late Devonian period, on what was once a 1400 kilometre coral reef off the Kimberley coast surrounding the north-west of Australia. Gogonasus was a small fish reaching 30-40 cm (1 ft) in length.http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/tetrapodsandamphibians/p/gogonasus.htm 
Its skeleton shows several features that were like those of a four-legged land animal (tetrapod). They included the structure of its middle ear, and its fins show the precursors of the forearm bones, the radius and ulna. Researchers believe it used its forearm-like fins to dart out of the reef to catch prey. 
Gogonasus was first described from a single snout (ethmosphenoid) by John A. Long (1985). On Long's 1986 expedition to Gogo the first relatively complete skull of Gogonasus was found by Chris Nelson and after being prepared solved a scientific controversy by showing that the inner large fangs of the coronoid bones did not insert into the choana of the palate (Long 1988) as had been suggested by Rosen et al. (1981) for Eusthenopteron. In 1990 a combined expedition from the Western Australian Museum and the Australian National University yielded another almost complete skull of Gogonasus, this one found by Dr R.E. Barwick. The full description of its cranial anatomy appeared in Long, J. A., Barwick, R. E. & Campbell, K.S.W.  (1997), although not all aspects of the skull were clear then even from the 3 specimens. In 2005  Long lead another expedition back to Gogo and on July 11 one of the team members, Dr Tim Senden from the Australian National University, found a very well preserved skeleton of Gogonasus, containing almost the complete fish down to the tip of the tail. It was Dr Senden's first field trip with the other researchers. 
The specimen (NMV P221807) is now held at Museum Victoria, after nearly 4 months of acetic acid preparation by John Long. The new specimen showed some surprising new data not seen in any of the other specimens. Firstly, there were large spiracular openings on top of the skull, with a distinct down folded cosmine-covered lamina of bone present on the tabular bone. This indicated its spiracles were almost as large as in the elpistostegalian fishes (like Tiktaalik) and early tetrapods (e.g. Acanthostega). Secondly, after preparation of its pectoral fins, the internal limb skeleton showed closer resemblances to that of the elpistostegalians than to  other more generalised tetrapodomorph fishes like Eusthenopteron. For almost 100 years Eusthenopteron had been the well-used role model for demonstrating stages in the evolution of lobe-finned fishes to tetrapods. Gogonasus now replaces Eusthenopteron in being a better preserved representative without any ambiguity in interpreting its anatomy (as had been shown for example by Rosen et al. 1981 when erroneously reconstructing the fit of the lower jaws to the  palate). Superficially, Gogonasus appears similar to the generalised tetrapodomorph fishes like Osteolepis from Scotland, but in its advanced features shows that even primitive-looking cosmine-covered forms evolved significant specializations towards becoming tetrapod-like. 
Gogonasus is just one of the over 45 species of 3-dimensionally preserved fishes from the Gogo Formation deposit. It is the only Devonian site in the world to yield whole complete fishes in perfect uncrushed preservation in some specimens.

The ''Sleipner''-class corvette was a part of the Royal Norwegian Navy's 1960 fleet plan. It was intended to build five ships of the class, but because of economic problems only two were built; [tpl]Ship|HNoMS|Sleipner|1963|2[/tpl] and [tpl]Ship|HNoMS|Æger|1965|2[/tpl].
Sleipner was built by Nylands Mekaniske Verksted, Oslo, and Æger by Aker Mekaniske Verksted, Oslo, and handed over to the Royal Norwegian Navy between 1965–1967. The ships were armed with an American [tpl]convert|3|in|mm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] gun forward and a Bofors 40 mm gun aft, with a Terne III anti-submarine rocket launcher ahead of the 40 mm gun. The ships were fitted with American SQS-36 sonar.
The ships had their anti-submarine capabilities improved in 1972, when they were fitted with Mark 32 anti-submarine torpedo tubes. The ships were mainly used as training ships in the 1980s, although they did retain a wartime role as coastal escorts.Grove 1990, p. 107. They were again modernised between 1988 and 1989, with new sonar and gun fire control systems fitted.  They were decommissioned in 1993.

The Medici giraffe was a giraffe presented to Lorenzo de' Medici in 1486 possibly by al-Ashraf Qaitbay, the Burji Sultan of Egypt, in an attempt to win the support of the Medici. 
It caused a great stir on its arrival in Florence: although the Medici maintained a large menagerie, and had previously featured a giant mannequin of a giraffe in the animal entertainments they provided to the citizenry, this was the first time a living example had been seen in the city.  It was also reputedly the first living giraffe to be seen in Italy since the days of Ancient Rome. It did not survive for long and another giraffe was not seen in Europe for almost 300 years.

The Machrihanish Golf Club is a classic Scottish links course situated in Machrihanish at the southern tip of the Mull of Kintyre. The main course, with views of the western seaboard including the Paps of Jura and Ireland, was ranked the No. 39 course outside of the United States by Golf Digest in 2005.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/planetgolf/index.ssf?/courses/world/gd200505planetgolf.html#Anchor-49575|title=The 100 Best Courses Outside the U.S.|publisher=Golf Digest|date=May 2005|accessdate=13 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061112053715/http://www.golfdigest.com/planetgolf/index.ssf?/courses/world/gd200505planetgolf.html#Anchor-49575  |archivedate = 12 November 2006[/tpl] In particular, the first hole is often rated as one of the best opening holes in the world.
The golf club was founded in 1876 as the Kintyre Golf Club.  The course had ten holes before the club officially existed, and was quickly expanded to 12.  In 1879, Old Tom Morris was brought in to redesign and expand the course to the full 18 holes, including today's first hole.  J.H. Taylor made some modifications in 1914, and in the 1940s Sir Guy Campbell brought the course to its current configuration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.machgolf.com/club-history.php|title=History of Machrihanish Golf Club|accessdate=13 March 2007[/tpl]
The club also has a shorter 9-hole golf course, and separate men's and women's clubhouses.  It has hosted the Scottish Ladies Championship on several occasions.

CATEGORIES: BDO World Darts Championships, Sport in Stoke-on-Trent, 1980 in darts

The 1980 Embassy World Darts Championship was the third year that the British Darts Organisation had staged a world championship. Again the field was 24 players, with the top seeds receiving a bye to the last 16 stage. For the second successive year the tournament was staged at Jollees Cabaret Club in Stoke-on-Trent.
Defending champion John Lowe, who had released a book The Lowe Profile just before the event suffered a surprise defeat 0–2 to Cliff Lazarenko saying afterwards "If you miss your doubles in this one, you must expect to go out." Eric Bristow was then immediately installed as favourite to win the event and would meet another flamboyant character of the game in the final – Bobby George.
George, who was not invited to the qualifiers the previous year appeared in a sequined shirt and when arriving on the stage was presented with a candelabra to complete a Liberace effect. He also made the early running in the final leading 1–0, 2–1 and 3–2. The first six sets all went to a deciding leg until Bristow won the seventh 3–1 to establish a 4–3 set lead. In the next set at 2–2 in legs, George had a golden opportunity to level the match and take it to a decider but bust his score and nonchalantly threw his third dart into the board before putting his darts into his top pocket in anticipation of Bristow checking out to win the title. Bristow did so.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

Lubor J. Zink (September 20, 1920 - November 6, 2003) was a Czech-Canadian writer and columnist known for his anti-Communism.
Lubor Jan Zink was born in Klapý, Czechoslovakia. He was a student of economics at Prague University in March 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded and occupied the country. A member of the Czech underground movement, Zink fled first to Hungary and ultimately to Britain and joined the exiled Czech army which fought as a brigade with the British Army in 1944 and 1945 rising to the rank of First Lieutenant. He was awarded the Military Cross, Medal for Bravery, and Medal of Merit, and the Medal for Fidelity by the exiled Czech Government during World War II. In London, Zink was recruited to make broadcasts to his homeland via the BBC Overseas Service resulting in his family being detained and placed in a concentration camp.
Following the war, Zink returned to his homeland in 1945 and joined the Czech language service of Radio Prague, the international broadcasting station operated by the Foreign Ministry. Zink's anti-Communist reports were heard by Czechs living abroad and, after the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took power in a 1948 coup, his broadcasts became anti-government. He subsequently lost his job and went into hiding until he, his wife and two-year old son could flee to England, becoming a British subject in 1949, and rejoined the BBC and worked on its European service until 1951. He then joined NATO where he worked as a political and economic analyst until 1957.http://www.archivescanada.ca/english/search/ItemDisplay.asp?sessionKey=999999999_142&l=0&lvl=1&v=0&coll=0&itm=267591&rt=1&bill=1
Zink moved to Canada in 1958 with his wife and son and became editor of the Brandon Sun in Manitoba. His editorials won him a National Newspaper Award in 1961 and he was offered a job with the Toronto Telegram as an Ottawa-based columnist. He became a Canadian citizen in 1963. When the Telegram folded in 1971 he moved to the Toronto Sun, becoming one of the paper's original staffers.
Although he was a member of the Ottawa press gallery and his column was ostensibly on national affairs, it was generally a forum for his ardent anti-Communist views. It often attacked Soviet foreign policy, Western liberals who favoured negotiations with the Soviet Union, Cuba, as well as then-Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau whom Zink viewed as a "crypto-Communist". Zink also ridiculed social programs being introduced by the federal government in the 1960s and 1970s, writing in 1965, "After medicare, what is next on the womb-to-tomb welfare list? Well, there are legalcare, morticare, carcare, housecare, leisurecare, and endless other possibilities."Toronto Telegram, July 26, 1965
Zink's columns on federal politics were published in three collections, Trudeaucracy (1972),  Viva Chairman Pierre (1977) and What Price Freedom? (1981).
Zink ran for a federal seat in the riding of Parkdale twice as the Progressive Conservative candidate. On both occasions he was not successful but managed to poll second in the 1972 and 1974 federal elections.
His Toronto Sun columns were syndicated across the Sun News chain and were also picked up by the Christian Science Monitor in the United States.
His anti-Communist themes continued through the era of détente and glasnost resulting in many of his critics ridiculing him as a relic of the Cold War era or a "one-trick pony who never got over the communist era"."Pugnacious expatriate Czech outlived the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - Journalist fought first the Nazis and then the Red Menace, denouncing Soviet-style communism till its fall" By Randy Ray, The Globe and Mail, Wednesday, February 18, 2004 - Page R5
Having outlived the Velvet Revolution and the fall of the Soviet Union and in declining health, Zink discontinued his column in 1993.
After the fall of Communism, Zink was awarded a number of accolades from his homeland including  the Czech Republic's Medal of Merit, 1st Class in 1995; the Czech Foreign Ministry's Jan Masaryk Gratias Agit Award in 1999; and the Special Prague University Honour Medal in 2001. He was also made an honorary colonel in the Czech army.

The Xbox 360 is a video game console developed by Microsoft, and is the successor to the original Xbox, and it is the second console in the Xbox series. The Xbox 360 competes with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information divulged later that month at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3).
The Xbox 360 features an online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console's lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: play games online; download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television programs, and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, the Xbox 360 allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect motion sensing camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0,3253,l=251237&a=251237&po=8,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | title=The 10 Greatest Video Game Consoles of All Time[/tpl]http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/steve-ballmer-reboots-01122012.htmlhttp://www.theverge.com/2012/11/13/3633038/microsoft-xbox-360-trojan-horse-living-room[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397387,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | title=Is the Xbox 360 the Elusive Living Room PC?[/tpl]http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/how-the-xbox-360-won-the-console-war-1196990

Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television (1978) is a book by Jerry Mander, who argues that many of the problems with television are inherent in the medium and technology itself, and thus cannot be reformed.

John "Bunny" Daly was an Australian rules footballer prominent in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) during its developmental years between 1887 and 1903.
Daly played his first match for Norwood as a 17-year-old in 1887, in a holiday exhibition match against Port Adelaide.  In front of 15,000 spectators the debutant displayed an exciting running, dodging type of game for which he would become famous.  
A creative rover, he was both deceptive (he loved to fake to kick, only to then recover and play on around the player) and an excellent user of the drop-kick to set the ball to his forwards.
Daly played in four premierships with Norwood, including the hat-trick between 1887 and 1889.  He was club best and fairest seven times with Norwood, and topped the club's goalkicking in 1887. 
After playing twelve seasons for Norwood, Daly found himself forced to move to West Adelaide by a change of rules by the South Australian Football Association (as the SANFL was then named). The Association required players to play for the side representing the electoral district in which the player resided.  This placed Daly with the lowly performing West Adelaide side. 
Daly was appointed captain-coach of West Adelaide, and although his brilliant style of play continued, he was unable to raise them to any extent up the premiership table.  
Daly retired in 1904, after a total (estimated) of about 200 games.  He represented his State seven times.
He was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 and into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2002.

[[Four Brothers (band)]]

CATEGORIES: Zimbabwean music

The Four Brothers are perhaps the most internationally successful and recognised group to come from Zimbabwe. The members are not literally brothers and at times there have been more than four. They play fast-paced guitar-based pop music with songs sung in the Shona language. Their lead guitar string-plucking sound is reminiscent of the sound of the African mbira instrument and is a style known as 'jit'.
Founded in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) in 1977 by Marshall Munhumumwe and Never Mutare with Edward Matigasi and Aleck Chipaika, the band gained international recognition in the late 1980s with UK BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel being their most well known advocate.
Marshall Munhumumwe was the nephew of Zimbabwean star Thomas Mapfumo.
At the time the Four Brothers formed bands in Rhodesia were not allowed to play traditional African music. The Four Brothers therefore played rock and roll cover versions of well-known artists such as the Beatles. They took up a residency position at the Saratoga bar in Salisbury (now Harare).
After the 'Chimurenga', the War of Independence in Zimbabwe, it became possible to again play traditional music. The band's format and instruments are clearly influenced by western rock and roll but the sound is evidently originating from Africa. The lead guitar is played in such a way as to sound like mbira.
Marshall Munhumumwe wrote most of the band's songs and music as well as unusually being both the lead singer and drummer. Their first big hit in Zimbabwe, 'Makorokoto', celebrated Zimbabwean independence. Makorokoto means 'Congratulations' in the Shona language.
After signing a deal with British record label Cooking Vinyl the band toured the UK and Canada. This apparently brought the band a greater degree of musical freedom enabling them to buy new instruments and to record more.
BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel championed The Four Brothers in the UK. They recorded  four radio sessions for his show between 1988 and 2000. The band played at Peel's surprise 50th birthday party at his home and he selected 'Pasi Pano Pane Zviedzo' as one of his favourite records of all time on the radio show Desert Island Discs in 1990. Peel is often quoted as describing the Four Brothers as "..the best live band in the world".
In 1997 founder member Marshall Munhumumwe suffered a stroke, following a car crash. He was unable to continue to perform with the band and was replaced by Albert Ruwizhi. Munhumumwe died in 2001 at the age of 49 and the following year bass guitarist Never Mutare died. Finally, the last surviving member, Frank Sibanda died peacefully in December 2010.

Karl Jakob Weber (12 August 1712 – 1764) was a Swiss architect and engineer who was in charge of the first organized excavations at Herculaneum, Pompeii and Stabiae, under the patronage of Carlo III of Naples. His detailed drawings provided some of the basis for the luxurious royal folios of Le Antichità di Ercolano esposte, by means of which the European intelligentsia became aware of the details of what was being recovered.
Weber's unwilling collaborator was the cavaliere Rocco de Alcubierre, previously in charge of the excavations, whose treasure-hunting technique provided the fine bronzes and other works of art that kept royal patronage stimulated. Alcubierre was jealous of Weber, treated his system of excavating whole rooms with a concern for context that makes him a heroic forerunner of today's architectural profession, and attempted to sabotage Weber's his work.  On Weber's death, the architect Francisco La Vega was put in charge of excavations.
Weber's plan of the still-buried Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, which was being explored room by room by smashing openings through frescoed walls, is still the basis of our understanding of its layout, which was echoed in the construction of the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu, California.
Weber was born at Arth, Schwyz, Switzerland, to a noble Catholic family. He was trained at the gymnasium of Lucerne, then travelled to Pavia, Lombardy, pursuing a higher degree in mathematics at the Collegio Ghislieri. Not having a private income in spite of his noble background, he enlisted in a regiment of Swiss mercenaries stationed in the Kingdom of Naples. The remainder of his career was passed in Italy.  After a few years, he took examinations for admission to the corps of military engineers,  and was accepted in the Royal Guard as engineer in 1743.  where he joined the forces excavating Herculaneum in late 1749, initially at the request of Alcubierre, the Spanish military engineer who directed the royal excavations.  In addition to the Villa dei Papiri he recovered much of the Theatre at Herculaneum, the Praedia of Julia Felix on the Via dell'Abbondanza at Pompeii, for which he drew up an axonometric plan, and several villas at Stabiae, bringing the first professionalism to the Royal digs.

Johannes Hymonides, known as John the Deacon of Rome (d. before 882), was towards the middle of the 9th century a monk of Monte Cassino near Rome, and later a deacon of the Roman Church. Possessed of considerable learning, he was closely associated with Anastasius, Librarian of the Roman Church (died 879).
At the instance of Pope John VIII (872-82), John wrote a life of St. Gregory the Great, making use of the works of this pope and of extracts made at an earlier date from the pope's letters in the archives of the Roman Church. The work is divided into four books: in the first he gives an account of the life of Gregory up to the time of his pontificate; in the second, of his activities as pope; in the third, of his teachings; and in the fourth, of his progress in perfection. The life was edited by Jean Mabillon."Acta SS. ord. S. Benedicti", I, 398-496; Acta Sanctorum, March, II, 137-211; Patrologia Latina, LXXV, 50 sqq..
He also intended to write a detailed history of the Church, and at his request the aforesaid Anastasius compiled a history in three parts (tripartita) from Greek sources for the use of John, whose purpose, however, was never executed. On the invitation of Bishop Gaudericus of Velletri (867-79), he undertook to re-edit the Gesta Clementis, a life of Pope Clement I (died about end of the 1st century), but did not live to finish the work, which Gaudericus undertook to complete, though it never appeared in full. It is said that in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris there is yet in manuscript a short commentary on the Heptateuch based on patristic sources and written by this John.
A letter from a certain Johannes Diaconus to Senarius, "vir illustris", treats of the ceremonies of baptism; it is not however, the work of the John treated here, but of an older deacon of this name.ed. P.L., LIX, 399-408.

He flourished towards the end of the ninth and the beginning of the tenth century, and from his writings appears to have been a very learned and accomplished cleric. He wrote several historical works, important sources of information for the history of his time. 
He first wrote a continuation of the diocesan chronicle of Naples (Gesta episcoporum Neapolitanorum), begun by another cleric, but which he brings down from 762 to 872. He makes use of both written and oral tradition, and contributes from personal knowledge. The narrative is graphic and spirited, and impresses the reader as a frank and accurate story.ed.

Ciampate del Diavolo (Neapolitan: "Devil's Footprints") is the name of a locality near Roccamonfina (northern Campania, Italy), in the neighbourhood of an extinct volcano with the same name. It takes its name from several human fossil footprints.
Local tradition attributed the prints to the Devil, since it was deemed the sole creature capable of walking on lava without harm. The footprints were in fact made in volcanic ash by a bipedal hominid living in the area some 350,000 years ago. The footprints were left by individuals barely five feet (1.50 m) tall, who appear to have been running away from the volcano.David Perlman, Stone Age human tracks found: Three people were rushing down side of a volcano near Naples, San Francisco Chronicle, March 13, 2003.

[[Soga Ryōjin]]
CATEGORIES: Pure Land Buddhism, Buddhism in Japan, 1875 births, 1971 deaths

[tpl]nihongo|Soga Ryōjin|曽我 量深||extra=1875-1971[/tpl] was an influential thinker in the Higashi Honganji Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist tradition, and a president of Ōtani University.
Soga was born in the city of Niigata, Niigata. He entered Shinshū University, later known as Ōtani University, and graduated in 1901. After graduation from Shinshū, Soga returned to Niigata and became the adopted son-in-law of the priest of Jō'on-ji, a temple in Mitsuke, Niigata.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) | title = 曽我 量深 | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-09-12 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | trans_title = Soga Ryōjin | oclc = 153301537[/tpl]
Soga returned to study at Ōtani University and became a disciple of Kiyozawa Manshi (1863 – 1903), and a member of the Ōtani School of Buddhist thought. He served as a professor at Toyo University from 1916 to 1924, and then served as a professor at Ōtani University for the following 25 years.
Soga Ryōjin developed a subjective and personal approach to Jōdo Shinshū studies, building on the thought of Kiyozawa Manshi, which he summarised in the words; "We do not believe in Buddha or God because they actually exist; they exist because we believe in them". Soga's writing on the topic in his book Nyorai hyōgen no hanchū to shiteno sanjinkan, published in 1928, brought him into strong conflict with his denomination. He left his professorship at Ōtani University soon after in April of 1930.
Soga was always extremely careful to differentiate the Jōdo Shinshū perspective from the 'Pure Land as mind alone' doctrine found in some Pure Land and Zen schools:
After leaving Ōtani Soga founded the Koho Gakuen in Kyoto with his close friend, the scholar Kaneko Daiei (1881 – 1976). Soga returned as a professor at Ōtani University in 1941. He served as the 17th president of the university from 1961 to 1967, and died on June 20, 1971.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) | title = 金子大栄 | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-09-12 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | trans_title = Kaneko Daiei | oclc = 153301537[/tpl]

The Jewang Un'gi, or Songs of Emperors and Kings, is a historical poem composed by Yi Seung-hyu (李承休) in 1287, in the late Goryeo period.  Comprising two volumes, it depicts the history of Korea from Dangun to King Chungnyeol, and is the second-oldest text recounting the legend of Dangun.http://books.google.com/books?id=AVw_C0SZkZ4C&pg=PA56  The title is sometimes alternatively translated Rhymed Chronicles of Emperors and Kings. 
Yi composed the text after retiring from government service to the Cheoneunsa monastery on Duta-san mountain in Samcheok, in present-day Gangwon province.http://books.google.com/books?id=mJwzAQAAIAAJ
The first edition of the work was printed in 1295-1296 in Jinju, while Yi was still alive.  Both extant texts, however, are from a revised woodcut edition printed in 1360 in Gyeongju.

[[Round Tower Lodge]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Cheshire, History of Cheshire, Grade II listed buildings in Cheshire, Demolished buildings and structures in England

The Round Tower Lodge was situated in the central reservation of the A556 road in Sandiway, Cheshire, England.  It was designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.[tpl]NHLE |num= 1227728|desc= The Round Tower, Cuddington|accessdate= 12 September 2013|separator=,|ps=[/tpl]
The tower was all that survived of a gate lodge to the house of Vale Royal Abbey.  The lodge was built on the main Chester to Manchester road as an entrance to Vale Royal's New Park and was linked to the house by a driveway containing a second lodge building, Monkey Lodge.  The tower was a circular, two-storey building constructed of sandstone.  On top of the tower was a crenellated parapet.  On the south-west elevation was a planked and studded oak door built into a Gothic-style arch.  There were also three Gothic-style windows.  Above the door and windows were four unglazed crossloops.  To the east of the tower was a short stub wall which used to be part of a square single-storey room which was integral with the tower's construction.  It was built in the early 19th century but the exact date of its construction has not been recorded.  Also the name of the architect is unknown.Wood, Jason, 'New Research on the Round Tower, Sandiway' Cheshire History:46, 2006-2007, pp. 119-127. This discusses, amongst other things the date of construction and the name of the architect.
The gate to the house lay to the west of the tower the posts of which were connected to the lodge by a low boundary wall surmounted by iron railings.  In late 19th and early 20th century additions were made to the eastern room.  There was an extension consisting of another square stone structure and there is evidence of yet a further extension which was probably a lean-to shed-like structure.  In 1871 the lodge was tenanted by a shepherd named William Ree who lived there with his family.  The last occupants, in the 1920s, were Hughie Preston and his wife.  The tower itself provided the main living quarters, the first extension was the bedroom and the extension beyond that was the kitchen.
Towards the end of the 19th century New Park was renamed Pettypool Park and after World War I it became Sandiway Golf Course.  Other than the tower, the lodge buildings were demolished when the main road was converted into a four-lane dual carriageway in the 1930s, the tower becoming stranded in the central reservation.  The old road was retained as the eastbound carriageway and the westbound carriageway was added to the south of the tower.  It was owned by the Highways Agency who carried out repairs which were completed in 2002.  It was a Grade II listed building and is included in the Sandiway Conservation Area.
On 14 November 2013, the Round Tower Lodge was badly damaged when a car collided with it. The tower was declared to be unsafe, and was demolished.[tpl]Citation | last = Bebbington | first = Gina| author-link = | publication-date = 15 November 2013 | date = | year = | title = Round Tower demolished after crash| periodical = Northwich Guardian| series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = Newsquest(Northwest)| volume = | issue = | pages = | url = http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/news/10812219.Round_Tower_demolished_after_crash/| archiveurl = | archivedate = | issn = | pmid = | pmc = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =15 November 2013[/tpl]  A social media campaign to rebuild the tower was subsequently started by local residents.[tpl]cite web|last=Bysouth|first=Alex|title=Campaign to rebuild A556 Round Tower|url=http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/news/10812655.Campaign_to_rebuild_A556_Round_Tower/|work=Northwich Guardian|publisher=Newsquest|accessdate=15 November 2013[/tpl]  In response, Cheshire West and Chester Council stated that the tower materials had been stored and a reconstruction was already planned; costs were to be pursued from the driver's insurance company.Cheshire West and Chester: Famous Northwich landmark seriously damaged (accessed 16 November 2013)

[[Property finder]]

CATEGORIES: Sales occupations, Real estate brokers

Property Finder (or Property Search Agents as they are also known) are companies and individuals representing a buyer in a property transaction.  The term is more common in the United Kingdom, but in the United States the situation is referred to as buyer brokerage, and in Australia it is known as Buyer Advocacy.
Property Finders specialise in sourcing and negotiating the purchase of property on behalf of the buyer. In essence, the Property Finder will develop an in-depth understanding of his client's requirements, desires and property goals, and then attempt to find a property which matches all of these requirements for his client to acquire. 
In Britain until the early 1990s, agents involved in a property transaction worked for the seller as Estate agents. Now, property finders exist to represent the interests of the buyer or tenant. Today in the United States where fiduciary obligations exist, if the buyer is working with a broker other than the brokerage which represents the seller by "listing" the property for sale, he may choose to enter into a buyer brokerage agreement to be represented.  (In some cases where dual agency is permitted by law, even the listing broker may represent the buyer). If the buyer does not enter into this agreement, he/she remains as a customer of the broker, who is then the sub-agent of seller's broker.  PropertyFinders is the Registered TradeMark within Australia - Trade Mark #1081652.

[[Coupe de France (rugby)]]

CATEGORIES: French rugby union competitions

The Coupe de France was a French rugby union competition which was founded early in the 20th century but was abandoned during World War II, and then restarted in 1943. All clubs were invited to participate, about 100 of them took part, with the first division teams joining in in the last rounds.
The 1951 final was so violent that the Rugby Football Union asked for it to be discontinued, otherwise France could have been expelled from the Five Nations Tournament which they had just rejoined in 1939. And this was exactly what the chairman of the French Federation did. It was replaced the next year by the Challenge Yves du Manoir which had been ended by the war.
The competition was reborn in the mid-1980s under the impulse of the then president of the French Federation, Albert Ferrasse, in parallel with both the championship and the Challenge Yves du Manoir. But low gates, an already crammed schedule doomed it after three seasons. 
A final effort to resurrect it was made in 1996, when it was merged with the Challenge Yves du Manoir, which was called Trophée Du-Manoir Coupe de France. It lasted until 2003 under three different names. As a result, the final seven competitions are counted both in the Coupe de France and Challenge Du Manoir records.

Barbette (December 19, 1898 – August 5, 1973) was an American female impersonator, high-wire performer, and trapeze artist born in Texas on December 19, 1899. Barbette attained great popularity throughout the United States but his greatest fame came in Europe and especially Paris, in the 1920s and 1930s.
Barbette began performing as an aerialist at around the age of 14 as one-half of a circus act called The Alfaretta Sisters. After a few years of circus work, Barbette went solo and adopted his exotic-sounding pseudonym. He performed in full drag, revealing himself as male only at the end of his act.
Following a career-ending illness or injury, Barbette returned to Texas but continued to work as a consultant for motion pictures as well as training and choreographing aerial acts for a number of circuses. After years of dealing with chronic pain, Barbette committed suicide on August 5, 1973. Both in life and following his death, Barbette served as an inspiration to a number of artists including Jean Cocteau and Man Ray.

It is part of a national program through which local, provincial, territorial and federal governments enable people to learn about, value, safeguard and enjoy the country's historic places.
The Canadian Register does not connote national historic significance, though many National Historic Sites of Canada are listed. Rather, it is a nationwide register of properties, many of which are of local significance.
Administered by Parks Canada, provincial, territorial and civic governments contribute listings to the Canadian Register through a nomination process. As such, it is a flexible compendium of sites and structures which have been recognized as historic through any one of several programs. Evaluation of a site is left to the these authorities, but the Register includes background information prepared by them, including references to the legal authority used for historic designation. Administrators say the Register is flexible enough to work with the range of heritage programs across the country, while being uniform enough to make searching for recognized historic places possible.Canada's Historic Places - About Currently, the Register holds over 12,500 listings, with a goal of including the roughly 17,000 historic sites across the country.
A Canadian Register listing does not put any additional legal constraints on property owners. Listing recognizes and celebrates the importance of a historic place to its community, province or territory, or to the nation. The register does not impose its own criteria but bases listing on federal, provincial, territorial or local designations of historic places, "a reflection of the community-based approach to heritage conservation in Canada."Shannon Ricketts "Who Decides?

CATEGORIES: Feudalism, Noble titles

Some titles of nobility outside Europe may be considered as equivalents of Duke.
Like other major Western noble titles, Duke is sometimes used to render (translate) certain titles in non-western languages. "Duke" is used even though those titles are generally etymologically and often historically unrelated and thus hard to compare. However, they are considered roughly equivalent, especially in hierarchic aristocracies such as feudal Japan, useful as an indication of relative rank.

It is marketed as Tinosorb S by BASF and as Escalol S by Ashland Inc. A recent development is Tinosorb S Aqua, which is bemotrizinol in a PMMA matrix dispersed in water. This makes it possible to add bemotrizinol to the water phase.Tinosorb S Aqua infohttp://www.basf-chemtrade.de/images/stories/broschueren/PCI/100413_tinosorb_s_aqua.pdf
Bemotrizinol is a broad-spectrum UV absorber, absorbing UVB as well as UVA rays. It has two absorption peaks, 310 and 340 nm. It is highly photostable. Even after 50 MEDs (minimal erythemal doses), 98.4% remains intact. It helps prevent the  photodegradation of other sunscreen actives like avobenzone.
Bemotrizinol has strong synergistic effects on the SPF when formulated with bisoctrizole, ethylhexyl triazone or iscotrizinol.http://www.ciba.com/tinosorb-s_brochure.pdf It is the most effective UV absorber available measured by SPF, based on the maximum concentration permitted by European legislation.

Platystemon is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the poppy family containing the single species Platystemon californicus, which is known by the common name creamcups. It is native to Oregon, California, Arizona, Utah and Baja California, and is found in open grasslands and sandy soils.Platystemon. The Jepson eFlora 2012.
This is a variable plant taking such a wide range of forms it has been split, reorganized, and redescribed as up to 57 different species. Its form often varies according to geography and habitat conditions. Coastal forms may be hairless and a bit succulent, while semidesert individuals can be squat, hairy plants. Some authors describe separate varieties, which are ecotypes adapted to specific, often very limited, habitat types.Platystemon californicus. Flora of North America.
The annual herb is usually at least a bit hairy, sometimes quite woolly. The stem is upright to decumbent and 3 to 30 centimeters long. The leaves are oppositely arranged or whorled about the stem. They are widely linear and smooth-edged with rounded or pointed tips. They are 1 to 9 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a single flower growing from a leaf axil or the tip of the stem. It is borne on a peduncle roughly 3 to 26 centimeters long. The flower usually has six petals, but a large flower can have more. The petals vary in size, shape, and color. They measure 6 to 19 millimeters long and have rounded or pointed tips. There are five basic color patterns: solid white, solid yellow, and a white petal with a yellow tip or yellow base or both.Hannan, G. L. (1982). Correlation of morphological variation in Platystemon californicus (Papaveraceae) with flower color and geography. Systematic Botany 7(1) 35-47. The all-yellow petals are less common. The petals may age reddish. The center of the flower is filled with several whorls of stamens with thickened ends. The fruit is a capsule up to 1.6 centimeters long which is divided into many sections containing shiny black seeds.
The flowers are partly wind-pollinated and partly pollinated by solitary bees.Hannan, G. L. (1981). Flower color polymorphism and pollination biology of Platystemon californicus Benth.(Papaveraceae). American Journal of Botany 68(2) 233-43.

In English, the name "Syria" was formerly synonymous with the Levant (known in Arabic as al-Sham) while the modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires, including the Eblan civilization of the third millennium BC. In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt.
The modern Syrian state was established after the first World War as a French mandate, and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Arab Levant. It gained independence in April 1946, as a parliamentary republic. The post-independence period was tumultuous, and a large number of military coups and coup attempts shook the country in the period 1949–1971. Between 1958 and 1961, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt, which was terminated by a military coup.

[[Brauer–Siegel theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Analytic number theory, Theorems in algebraic number theory

In mathematics, the Brauer–Siegel theorem, named after Richard Brauer and Carl Ludwig Siegel, is an asymptotic result on the behaviour of algebraic number fields, obtained by Richard Brauer and Carl Ludwig Siegel. It attempts to generalise the results known on the class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields, to a more general sequence of number fields
In all cases other than the rational field Q and imaginary quadratic fields, the regulator Ri of Ki must be taken into account, because Ki then has units of infinite order by Dirichlet's unit theorem. The quantitative hypothesis of the standard Brauer–Siegel theorem is that if Di is the discriminant of Ki, then
Assuming that, and the algebraic hypothesis that Ki is a Galois extension of Q, the conclusion is that
where hi is the class number of Ki.
This result is ineffective, as indeed was the result on quadratic fields on which it built. Effective results in the same direction were initiated in work of Harold Stark from the early 1970s.

Iraq borders Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west.  Iraq has a narrow section of coastline measuring [tpl]convert|58|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] on the northern Persian Gulf. The capital city, Baghdad is in the center-east of the country. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run through the center of Iraq, flowing from northwest to southeast. These provide Iraq with agriculturally capable land and contrast with the steppe and desert landscape that covers most of Western Asia.
Iraq has been known by the Greek toponym 'Mesopotamia' (Land between the rivers) and has been home to continuous successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC. The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is often referred to as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of writing. At different periods in its history, Iraq was the center of the indigenous Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian empires. It was also part of the Median, Achaemenid, Hellenistic, Parthian, Sassanid, Roman, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Mongol, Safavid, Afsharid, and Ottoman empires, and under British control as a League of Nations mandate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/top10_iraq_battles.html |title=Top 10 Battles for the Control of Iraq |publisher=Livescience.com |accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl] Iraq is home to two of the world's holiest places among Shias: Najaf and Karbala.On Point: The United States Army In Operation Iraqi Freedom – Page 265, Gregory Fontenot – 2004
Iraq's modern borders were mostly demarcated in 1920 by the League of Nations when the Ottoman Empire was divided by the Treaty of Sèvres. Iraq was placed under the authority of the United Kingdom as the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. A monarchy was established in 1921 and the Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from Britain in 1932. In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Republic of Iraq was created. Iraq was controlled by the Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-led faction) from 1968 until 2003. After an invasion led by the United States of America including multinational forces, the Ba'ath Party was removed from power and multi-party parliamentary elections were held.

[[Gugyeol]]
CATEGORIES: Korean writing system, Joseon Dynasty, Scripts without ISO 15924 code

Gugyeol is a system for rendering texts written in Classical Chinese into understandable Korean.  It was chiefly used during the Joseon Dynasty, when readings of the Chinese classics were of paramount social importance.  Thus, in gugyeol, the original text in classical Chinese was not modified, and the additional markers were simply inserted between phrases.  The Korean reader would then read the parts of the Chinese sentence out of sequence to approximate Korean (SOV) rather than Chinese (SVO) word order.  A similar system for reading classical Chinese is used to this day in Japan and is known as Kanbun.  
The name gugyeol can be rendered as "phrase parting," and may refer to the separation of one Chinese phrase from another.  This name is itself believed to originate from the use of hanja characters to represent the Middle Korean phrase ipgyeot (입겿), with a similar meaning.  The gugyeol system is also sometimes referred to as to (토, 吐) or hyeonto (현토, 懸吐), since to is also used to refer to the morphological affixes themselves; or as seogui (석의, 釋義) which can be rendered as "interpretation of the classics."
Gugyeol first came into use in the early Goryeo dynasty.  In this period, certain hanja characters were used (along with specialized symbols) to represent Korean sounds through their meaning.  For example, the syllable '잇' (is) was represented with the hanja character 有, since that character has the Korean meaning '있다.'  This technique came to be replaced in the late Goryeo period with using hanja characters according to their sound.  This later version of the gugyeol system was formalized by Jeong Mong-ju and Gwon Geun around 1400 in the early Joseon Dynasty, at the behest of King Taejong.  At this time a number of Confucian classics, including the Classic of Poetry, were rendered into gugyeol.
The term gugyeol is often extended beyond this early system to similar uses of hangul following the introduction of the Hunmin jeongeum in the 15th century.  In this respect, gugyeol remains in occasional use in contemporary South Korea, where such techniques are still sometimes used to render the Confucian classics into readable form.
Gugyeol should be distinguished from the idu and hyangchal systems which preceded it.  Gugyeol used specialized markings, together with a subset of hanja, to represent Korean morphological markers as an aid for Korean readers to understand the grammar of Chinese texts.  Also, the idu and hyangchal systems appear to have been used primarily to render the Korean language into hanja; on the other hand, gugyeol sought to render Chinese texts into Korean with a minimum of distortion.

[[Vasily Vasilievsky]]

Vasily Grigorievich Vasilievsky (also spelled Vasiljevskij and Wasiliewski, Russian: Василий Григорьевич Васильевский) was a Russian historian who founded the St. Petersburg school of medieval studies and was a major force in Byzantine studies during the second half of the 19th century.
The son of a rural priest, Vasilievsky was born on 2 February 1838. Graduating with honours from the University of St. Petersburg in 1860, he was appointed professor there and was elected into the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1890. 
Vasilievsky edited the Journal of the Ministry of Education before founding, in 1894, the Vizantiyskiy Vremennik, which remains the chief organ for Byzantine studies in Russia to this day. He was the first to publish many medieval Greek sources relating to Russian history (Byzantium and the Pechenegs, 1872). He was also the first to research the agrarian history of Byzantium and its tax system (Iconoclast Legislation, 1878). 
Vasilievsky died in Florence on 25 May 1899. His collected works were published in four volumes between 1908 and 1930. The Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary (1890-1906) noted that "almost every modern Byzantinist is Vasilievsky's disciple". The foremost among his pupils was Alexander Vasiliev (1867-1953).

The 1984–85 Serie A season heralded Hellas Verona's first and so far only Scudetto.  Unusually, none of the big three of Juventus, AC Milan or Inter managed to finish in the top two. Ascoli, Lazio and Cremonese all got relegated to Serie B.
It was the only season when referees were assigned to matches by way of a random draw instead of being assigned to a specific match by a special commission of referees ('designatori arbitrali'). After the betting scandal of the early 1980s (the 'calcioscommesse' scandal) it had been decided to clean up the image of Italian football by assigning referees randomly instead of picking them, in order to clear up all the suspicions and accusations . This resulted in a quieter championship and in a completely unexpected final table.

Fyodor Ivanovich Uspensky or Uspenskij ([tpl]IPA-ru|ˈfjodər ɪˈvanəvʲɪtɕ usˈpʲenskʲɪj[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ru|Фёдор Иванович Успенский[/tpl]) was the preeminent Russian Byzantinist in the first third of the 20th century. His works are considered to be among the finest illustrations of the flowering of Byzantine studies in Tsarist Russia.
Uspensky was born near Galich on 19 February 1845. He was educated at the University of St. Petersburg, with his first thesis (1872) dedicated to Nicetas Choniates. For two decades (1874–94) he read lectures at the Novorossiysky University in Odessa. This position allowed him to spend considerable time abroad. 
Uspensky's doctoral thesis (1879) dealt with the foundation of the Second Bulgarian Empire. Although he specialized in the Byzantine-Bulgarian relations and investigated the Slavic influence on the Byzantine economy, Uspensky also researched and wrote extensively on the Crusades.
In 1894 Uspensky, who shared Slavophile ideals, decided to move to Constantinople in order to study and protect the surviving monuments of Byzantine antiquity, which had been neglected by the Ottoman authorities for centuries. He founded the Russian Archaeological Institute (headquartered at Studion) and presided over its pioneering archaeological research in Constantinople, Asia Minor, Macedonia and Bulgaria. In 1900, he was elected into the Russian Academy of Sciences. With the outbreak of World War I, Uspensky was forced to abandon his work and flee Turkey.
Back in Petrograd, the 70-year-old professor was invited to edit the organ of Byzantine studies, Vizantiyskiy Vremennik. After the October Revolution, he delivered lectures at the Leningrad University (1922–27) and, enduring criticism of the Bolshevik authorities, prepared for publication the results of a lifelong study — a monumental three-volume account of the history of the Byzantine Empire. 
Uspensky died in Leningrad on 10 September 1928. The posthumous publication of his magnum opus, based on numerous unpublished sources and unprecedented in scope, demonstrated the wide range of his scholarship. His book about the Trapezuntine Empire also appeared posthumously.

William "Willy" Theisen is a restaurant entrepreneur from Omaha, Nebraska, born in Chicago and raised in Clinton, Iowa. He was the founder and
former owner of Godfathers Pizza,[tpl]cite news|title=Company to Acquire Godfather's Pizza|publisher=Gainesville Sun|date=September 13, 1983|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vKkRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0ukDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3413,3959318&dq=pizza+william-theisen+-wikipedia&hl=en[/tpl] a popular pizzeria chain that has locations in over 40 states. Theisen got the idea to start a pizza chain when he was running his own bar called "Wild Willys." He noticed many of his customers carried pizza, from a pizza restaurant next door, into his bar to eat it. Theisen decided to remove the wall separating the two businesses. The first Godfathers opened in 1973. Many locations opened throughout the country and Theisen looked to have a hit on his hands. He sold his interest and ownership in the company in the mid-1980s to Pillsbury and stepped down from operating the company. Pillsbury has long since sold the restaurant chain.
Theisen in 1983 constructed a [tpl]convert|20125|sqft|m2[/tpl] mansion, at the time the largest mansion in Omaha. He sold the mansion in 1995 to Terry Watanabe, former owner of Oriental Trading Company. The mansion was placed back on the market with an asking price of approximately $5 million. The Omaha World-Herald reported that the mansion has been sold and will be removed, with the property to be used for three-four smaller houses.
In 2009 he opened Pitch Pizzeria in Omaha, his first new pizza restaurant since he sold his interest in Godfather's in the mid-1980s. Unlike Godfather's, Pitch is a coal-fired, thin-crust pizzeria.

[[Minister affair at the announcement of the Reinfeldt cabinet]]
CATEGORIES: Political scandals in Sweden, 2006 in Sweden

The minister affair at the announcement of the Reinfeldt cabinet in Sweden is a political scandal which started on October 7, 2006 when the Cabinet of Fredrik Reinfeldt, which had been announced on October 6, immediately became affected by media allegations on past errors on the part of several cabinet ministers, in particular Maria Borelius, Cecilia Stegö Chilò and Tobias Billström. The affair centred around the use of domestic workers (nannies and maids) without paying employment (payroll) tax, employer's contribution ([tpl]lang-sv|arbetsgivaravgifter[/tpl]), unpaid TV licences and other issues. On October 14, 2006 Maria Borelius resigned after eight days in office, and on October 16, 2006 Cecilia Stegö Chilò resigned after ten days in office. Criminal charges have been filed against Borelius, Billström and Stegö Chilò. The affair has also been widely reported by the international press, with the British Financial Times dubbing it "Nannygate"."Nannygate" ger eko i omvärlden, Dagens Nyheter, October 18, 2006 [tpl]sv icon[/tpl]Så uppmärksammas skandalen i världsmedier, Expressen, October 15, 2006 [tpl]sv icon[/tpl]

[[Ognissanti, Florence]]

CATEGORIES: Churches in Florence

The Chiesa di Ognissanti (All-Saints Church)It gives its name to the borgo, one of the traditional divisions of Florence. is a Franciscan church in Florence, Italy. Founded by the lay order of the Umiliati, the church was dedicated to all the saints and martyrs, known and unknown. 
It was completed during the 1250s, but almost completely rebuilt on Baroque designs of Bartolomeo Pettirossi, about 1627, with a façade - by Matteo Nigetti (1637)It was restored in 1872. - that conserved the  grand glazed terracotta lunette in the manner of the Della Robbia, now attributed to Benedetto Buglioni, over the doorway: Ognissanti was among the first examples of Baroque architecture to penetrate this Renaissance city. Its two orders of pilasters enclose niches and windows with fantastical cornices. To the left of the façade is a campanile of 13th and 14th century construction.
The Umiliati, by the dedication and probity of the lay brothers and sisters, gained a reputation in Florence, and dedicated works of art began to accumulate in their severely simple church. Giotto's celebrated Madonna and Child with angels, now in the Uffizi, was painted for the high altar, about 1310, and recently, cleaning has also revealed Giotto's hand in the Crucifix in the left transept.The paintings on panels, always considered noteworthy (starred in Touring Club Italiano, Firenze e dintorni, 1964:313) had been considered a work of Giotto's followers ("scuola giottesca" in TCI, Firenze e dintorni); see also (BBC News) "Giotto's Ognissanti Crucifix brought back to life": accessed 5 November 2010. During the sixteenth century the Umiliati declined in energy, and the Franciscan order assumed control of the church in 1571, bringing precious relics such as the robe Saint Francis of Assisi wore. 
In the interior, the Baroque remodelling provided a completely rebuilt apse with a pietre dure high altarBuilt to a design by Jacopo Ligorio and a sotto in su perspective (1770) on the vaulted nave ceiling.  Fifteenth-century frescoes by Domenico Ghirlandaio and Sandro Botticelli are also preserved in the nave; Botticelli is buried in the churchA small round stone in a chapel of the right transept marks his resting-place near his beloved Simonetta Vespucci. Botticelli's fresco of Saint Augustine in His Study corresponds to Ghirlandaio's St. Jerome in His Study in the chapel facing it across the nave; both were executed in 1480.  Ghirlandaio also frescoed a  Last Supper in the refectory between the two cloisters, a work with which Leonardo was intimately familiar.
In the Vespucci chapel, a fresco by Domenico Ghirlandaio with his brother David (about 1472), of the Madonna della Misericordia protecting members of the Vespucci family, is reputed to include the portrait of Amerigo Vespucci as a child.
Over the door to the sacristy is a crucifix in wood by Veit Stoss.

Saints Emeterius (Hemeterius) and Celedonius ([tpl]lang-es|San Emeterio y San Celedonio[/tpl]; died ca. 300) are venerated as saints by the Catholic Church.  Two Roman legionaries (and possibly also brothers), they were martyred for their faith around 300. They are patron saints of Calahorra (La Rioja), which is traditionally regarded as the place of their death.
They are said to have been serving in this city at the end of the third century or at the beginnings of the fourth.  According to one legend, they were the sons of the martyr Marcellus the Centurion.Parroquia  Cofradía de las Siete Palabras de Jesús en la Cruz de León - España  It may have been during either the persecutions of Diocletian or of Valerian when they were imprisoned and forced to decide between renouncing the faith or leaving the army.
Their legend states that they were tortured and finally decapitated on the banks of the Cidacos River outside of Calahorra, which became the site of the actual cathedral of the city and explains its strange location beyond the city walls.  The heads of these saints are said to have floated to Santander aboard a boat made of stone.  A community of monks who lived in that city became custodians of these holy relics.
According to Prudentius, the brothers Emeterius and Celedonius, soldiers of the Legio VII Gemina, were martyred at Calahorra, but the exact date of their martyrdom is unknown.

[[GW approximation]]
CATEGORIES: Quantum field theory

can be truncated after the first term:
Another way to say the same thing is that that self-energy is expanded in a formal Taylor series in powers of the screened interaction W and the lowest order term is kept in the expansion in GWA.
The above formulae are schematic in nature and show the overall idea of the approximation.  More precisely, if we label an electron coordinate with its position, spin, and time and bundle all three into a composite index (the numbers 1, 2, etc.), we have
where the "+" superscript means the time index is shifted forward by an infinitesimal amount.  The GWA is then
To put this in context, if one replaces W by the bare Coulomb interaction (i.e. the usual 1/r interaction), one generates the standard perturbative series for the self-energy found in most many-body textbooks.  The GWA with W replaced by the bare Coulomb yields nothing other than the Hartree–Fock exchange potential (self-energy).  Therefore, loosely speaking, the GWA represents a type of dynamically screened Hartree–Fock self-energy.
In a solid state system, the series for the self-energy in terms of W should converge much faster than the traditional series in the bare Coulomb interaction.  This is because the screening of the medium reduces the effective strength of the Coulomb interaction:  for example, if one places an electron at some position in a material and asks what the potential is at some other position in the material, the value is smaller than given by the bare Coulomb interaction (inverse distance between the points) because the other electrons in the medium polarize (move or distort their electronic states) so as to screen the electric field.  Therefore, W is a smaller quantity than the bare Coulomb interaction so that a series in W should have higher hopes of converging quickly.
interaction is much weaker and is more likely to give a rapidly converging perturbative series.

Sir William Bruce of Kinross, 1st Baronet (c. 1630 – 1 January 1710) was a Scottish gentleman-architect, "the effective founder of classical architecture in Scotland," as Howard Colvin observes.Colvin, p.172–176 As a key figure in introducing the Palladian style into Scotland, he has been compared to the pioneering English architects Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren,Fenwick, p.xv and to the contemporaneous introducers of French style in English domestic architecture, Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt.
Bruce was a merchant in Rotterdam during the 1650s, and played a role in the Restoration of Charles II in 1659. He carried messages between the exiled king and General Monck, and his loyalty to the king was rewarded with lucrative official appointments, including that of Surveyor General of the King's Works in Scotland, effectively making Bruce the "king's architect". His patrons included John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, the most powerful man in Scotland at that time, and Bruce rose to become a member of Parliament, and briefly sat on the Scottish Privy Council.
Despite his lack of technical expertise, Bruce became the most prominent architect of his time in Scotland.  He worked with competent masons and professional builders, to whom he imparted a classical vocabulary; thus his influence was carried far beyond his own aristocratic circle. Beginning in the 1660s, Bruce built and remodelled a number of country houses, including Thirlestane Castle for the Duke of Lauderdale, and Prestonfield House.  Among his most significant work was his own Palladian mansion at Kinross, built on the Loch Leven estate which he had purchased in 1675.  As the king's architect he undertook the rebuilding of the Royal Palace of Holyroodhouse in the 1670s, which gave the palace its present appearance.  After the death of Charles II Bruce lost political favour, and later, following the accession of William and Mary, he was imprisoned more than once as a suspected Jacobite.  However, he managed to continue his architectural work, often providing his services to others with Jacobite sympathies.

Well-known cover versions are by The Shadows who released the song as instrumental in 1997 on the album The Shadows at Abbey Road: The Collectors Edition, by Percy Faith and by Alvin and the Chipmunks (both in 1969) and by Franck Pourcel in 1976.
The song is parodied in the South Park episode "It Hits the Fan" sung by Mr. Garrison.
Aside from another Dick Van Dyke song being referenced in this film, Jim Carrey also famously parodies this song in Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. 
Steampunk band Abney Park does a cover of "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" on occasion at live shows, incorporating an industrial and classic twist to the song.

[[Rinaldo degli Albizzi]]
CATEGORIES: 1370 births, 1442 deaths, Italian untitled nobility, People from Florence, 15th-century Italian people

Rinaldo degli Albizzi (1370–1442) was an Italian nobleman, a member of the Florentine family of the Albizzi. Together with Palla Strozzi, he was the main opponent of Cosimo de' Medici's rise in Florence.
After the Volterran revolt against Florence in 1428, Rinaldo degli Albizzi was sent to 'reacquire' Volterra from rebels led by priors and Giovanni di Contugi. Afterwards, Rinaldo incited Niccolò Fortebraccio to "attack the Lucchese under cover of some fictitious quarrel",Florentine Histories, Niccolò Machiavelli an action that led Florence to the conquest of Lucca. During this campaign, Rinaldo degli Albizzi was accused of attempting to increase his own wealth through sacking. He was eventually removed from his position and recalled to Florence.
Later, in the 1430s, Rinaldo convinced several prominent nobles to strike out against Cosimo de' Medici, whom he feared was getting too powerful. Eventually, Rinaldo helped Bernardo Guadagni, a candidate for a position among the Signori, pay off his debts, which had been disqualifying him to run for office. Guadagni won the position of Gonfalonier. Through Guadagni, Rinaldo summoned Cosimo to the palace, where he was captured. After a short trial, Cosimo was sentenced to 20 years' exile from Florence.
However, with the downturn of Florentine fortunes in the war with Milan, Cosimo returned with popular acclamation barely a year later, and Rinaldo was in his turn exiled. He died at Ancona.

[[Charity (play)]]
CATEGORIES: Plays by W. S. Gilbert, 1874 plays

Charity is a drama in four acts by W. S. Gilbert that explores the issue of a woman who had lived with a man as his wife without ever having married. The play analyses and critiques the double standard in the Victorian era concerning the treatment of men and women who had sex outside of marriage, anticipating the "problem plays" of Shaw and Ibsen.Crowther, Andrew, Synopsis of Charity It opened on 3 January 1874 at the Haymarket Theatre in London, where Gilbert had previously presented his 'fairy comedies' The Palace of Truth, Pygmalion and Galatea, and The Wicked World.  Charity ran for about 61 performances, closing on 14 March 1874, and received tours and revivals thereafter.
Gilbert created several plays for the Haymarket Theatre, managed by John Baldwin Buckstone and starring William Hunter Kendal and his wife, Madge Robertson Kendal, sister of the playwright Thomas William Robertson, in the early 1870s. In Charity, Gilbert wanted to use what he perceived as Mrs. Kendal's capabilities as a tragedienne, and, after abandoning his original plan of a vindictive villainess, he composed one of his most powerful women's roles for her in this play.Stedman, p 114
1874 was a particularly busy year for Gilbert. He illustrated The Piccadilly Annual; supervised a revival of Pygmalion and Galatea; and wrote Charity; Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, a parody of Hamlet; a dramatisation of Ought We to Visit Her? (a novel by Annie Edwardes), an adaptation from the French, Committed for Trial, another adaptation from the French called The Blue-Legged Lady, a play, Sweethearts, and Topsyturveydom, a comic opera. He also wrote a Bab-illustrated story called "The Story of a Twelfth Cake" for the Graphic Christmas number.

Harold Anthony Caccia, Baron Caccia, [tpl]small|GCMG GCVO GCStJ[/tpl] (21 December 1905 Pachmarhi, India; 31 October 1990 Builth Wells, Wales) was a British diplomat.
He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Oxford and won a Blue at rugby union, playing at centre for Oxford in The Varsity Match in 1926.[tpl]cite book|title=Rothmans Rugby Union Yearbook 1991-92|year=1991|publisher=Queen Anne Press|isbn=0356202496|page=414[/tpl]  He played cricket for Oxfordshire in the Minor Counties Championship between 1928 and 1938.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/179/179712/179712.html|title=Player profile: Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=24 May 2011[/tpl]  He married Anne Catherine Barstow, daughter of George Lewis Barstow and Enid Lillian Lawrence, in 1932. He entered the diplomatic service in 1929 and was posted to Peking (Beijing) and then to Athens and London where, in 1936, he became assistant private secretary to Anthony Eden.
He was back in Athens early in World War II, but was then attached to the staff of Harold Macmillan, Britain's representative at Allied headquarters in North Africa. The Greek civil war once again saw him in that country, and by 1945 his services earned him recognition on the Birthday Honours List. He was knighted in 1950.
He was created a life peer with the title Baron Caccia, of Abernant in the County of Breconshire, on 11 May 1965. Caccia was appointed a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George.
Caccia was Ambassador to Austria from 1951 to 1954, and from 1956 to 1961 Ambassador to the USA. He was sent to Washington to repair relations badly damaged by the Suez crisis of 1956. The breakdown in mutual confidence arose when Britain and France joined an Israeli invasion of Egypt and sent military forces to capture the Suez Canal, which had been nationalized by President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. In the years that followed, he was instrumental in restoring and nurturing the "special relationship" between London and Washington.
In 1961, he became Permanent Under-Secretary of State, an office he held until 1965. He was Provost of Eton 1965-78 and President of MCC in 1973-74.

CATEGORIES: Disused railway stations in Leicestershire, Railway stations closed in 1968, Railway stations opened in 1876, Former Midland Railway stations, Beeching closures in England

East Langton railway station was opened by the Midland Railway on what is now the Midland Main Line in 1857, initially calling it simply Langton.
Plans had been made earlier in 1847 for a line from Leicester to Bedford, but had lapsed.  However the Midland, running to Rugby at that time and dependent on the LNWR for its path into London, was looking for an alternative. It revived its plans for Bedford to go forward to Hitchin to join the Great Northern Railway 
The station had two platforms with neat Midland pattern timber buildings. The booking office was on the southbound
up line, with a small waiting-room on the down.  There was no footbridge and the line was crossed by a barrow crossing at the northern end.  To the north were long sidings on either side of the running lines capable of handling trains of 30 to 41 wagons - typical for Victorian trains of the period.  The signal box was next to these on the down side.  Southbound LNWR trains also used the line on their way to a junction at Market Harborough and would signal their presence to the box by means of three whistles.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations. Vol. 1 Oxford Publishing 
It was renamed East Langton in 1891 though it also served West Langton, Church Langton, Thorpe Langton and Tur Langton.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
It closed in 1968. Although the site can be seen just north of where the line crosses the B6047 road, the platforms and station buildings have disappeared, and the site may disappear with possible planned future quadrupling of the line.

Kibworth railway station was opened by the Midland Railway in 1857 on what is now the Midland Main Line.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books
Plans had been made earlier in 1847 for a line from Leicester to Bedford, but had lapsed.  However the Midland, running to Rugby at that time and dependent on the LNWR for its path into London, was looking for an alternative. It revived its plans for Bedford to go forward to Hitchin to join the Great Northern Railway.
The station was near the summit of the Kibworth Incline, the most northerly of the Leicester to Hitchin section. It was built next to the bridge carrying  the highway from Kibworth Beauchamp, still known at Station Street, and access was by means of wooden stairs to each platform. The station buildings were of brick in the Midland Ecclesiastical Gothic style. The booking office and other facilities were on the down (northbound) platform, with a small waiting-room on the southbound.
On the down side were two bay platforms, one running through a goods shed.  These joined the running lines by a crossing, but also led back to longer sidings next to the down line. Next to the up line on the other side of the road bridge, was a short loop serving a cattle dock, and an unusual siding curving away from the running lines to some small sheds.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations. Vol. 1 Oxford Publishing 
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
Goods services ended on 4 July 1966, and the station closed to passengers on 1 January 1968.
In recent years, it has housed a fencing and wood merchants business but became empty in 2002.
In the early 2000s,a number of houses were built on the car park. At some point, access to the line was removed, as were the platforms.

[[Thai stick]]

CATEGORIES: Cannabis culture, Drugs in Thailand

A Thai stick is a form of cannabis from Thailand that was popular during the late 1960s and 1970s. It consisted of premium buds of seedless marijuana which were skewered on stems. Several rows of fiber found in the stalk of the marijuana plant were then used to tie the marijuana to the stem to keep it in place.What Is Thai Stick Thai stick bud may also be tied around bamboo sticks with a piece of string known as a “rasta hair.”[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hempcity.net/travelreports/11strains2003/thaisinse/index.html |title=From Thailand, to Holland, to Spain: From Thai stick seeds to smoke able weed: Thai Sinse |publisher=Hempcity.net |date=2011-03-29 |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl]
The Thai sticks exhibited considerably higher potency in comparison with other cannabis available in Western countries at the time. This added potency was rumored to be caused by the Thai sticks being dipped in opium. However, the more widely accepted reason is that Thai cannabis growers had for hundreds of years selected seeds from their strongest plants, which coupled with Thailand's long growing season, high temperatures and, rich volcanic soil, conspired to produce an exceptionally potent product. A number of reasons have been cited for the decline of the Thai stick; stricter policing of cannabis cultivation; dilution of traditional cannabis populations by earlier maturing, less psychoactive cultivars imported from Pakistan and Afghanistan; the burgeoning indoor growing industry in target markets; and the reduction of military troop transports (which was the primary means of export) between Thailand, particularly Bangkok, and the United States, at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.
In modern terminology, Thai stick often refers to marijuana tied to stem as documented above and then dipped into a hashish oil, a potent cannabis derivative which saturates the buds and lends to a stronger smoke. Some California cannabis clubs sell this product. Originally, this was a frequent practice of the 1970s with the actual Thai stick. There are still some surviving recipes from Cambodia where high quality marijuana and hash oil are used.

When the Muslim army conquered the town of Ayn al-Tamr they found a number of Arab Christian priests in a monastery. One of them was called Nusair another called Serine. They both embraced Islam. Nusair is the father of Mosa Ben Nusair, the supreme commander of the forces which later conquered Spain under the leadership of Tariq bin Ziyad, the second in command for Musa bin Nusayr. Serine, the other convert, is the father of the scholar Ibn Serine who became one of the more celebrated Muslim theologians.
This battle took place in modern day Iraq (Mesopotamia) between the early Muslim Arab forces and the Sassanians along with their Arab Christian auxiliary forces. Ein-ul-tamr is located west of Anbar and was a frontier post which had been established to aid the Sassanids.The Caliph's Last Heritage: A Short History of the Turkish Empire by Mark Sykes

The Padrão Real ([tpl]IPA-pt|pɐˈðɾɐ̃w̃ ʁiˈaɫ[/tpl], Royal Standard) was a master Portuguese nautical chart produced and maintained by the Portuguese government organization, the Armazéns da Índia, where the new discoveries were recorded. The earliest extant source referring explicitly to this cartographic standard is of ca. 1540 but it is believed that it was created much earlier, probably still during the fifteenth century. The Spanish counterpart of the Portuguese Padrão Real was the Padrón Real, officially established by the Spanish Monarchs in 1508, in the Casa de Contratación. 
A popular theory sustains that the Cantino planisphere (1502) is a copy of Padrão Real, ordered by alberto cantino to some Portuguese official cartographer. However, there is no historical evidence that such order was ever made and the theory is weakened by the presence of numerous mistakes.

Germany competed at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway after not having been invited to the 1948 Winter Olympics because of the role in World War II, and because the NOC restored in 1947 as Deutscher Olympischer Ausschuß did not represent a recognized state yet. The Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949, the NOC for Germany was renamed and in 1951 recognized by the IOC while recognition of a separate NOC of the GDR was declined. East Germans were told to cooperate in a single team Germany, which they declined in 1952, but accepted for 1956 and later.
Germany entered all events except the 1500 metres skating event, which was skipped by Germany' only speed skating entrant in favour of the other three events.
The IOC website currently uses both the codes GER or FRG for German medal winners, suggesting they represented two different teams:

[[Throne of Chaos]]
CATEGORIES: Finnish heavy metal musical groups, Century Media Records artists

Throne of Chaos were a heavy metal band from Espoo, Finland, active from 1996 to 2005.  
Their early sound, as recorded on their debut album Menace and Prayer, has been described as melodic death metal, having musical characteristics reminiscent of fellow Finns Children of Bodom.Encyclopaedia Metallum - Throne of Chaos
For their second album, Pervertigo, the band migrated to a sound more heavily influenced by thrash and power metal.  For their final album, the progressive-leaning Loss Angeles, released on InsideOut Music, the band shortened their name from Throne of Chaos to TOC.Progressive Rock Pages - Throne of Chaos - Loss Angeles
Taneli Kiljunen originally performed all vocals before damaging his throat and being unable to sing for an extended period. Because of this, Pervertigo was performed with the help of two session vocalists: Pasi Nykänen, also of Warmen, and Niklas Isfeldt, vocalist with Dream Evil, and Pure X. For Loss Angeles, Tuomas Nieminen was added to the band with Taneli offering occasional bursts of harsh vocals.
Despite the radical evolution of their sound over their decade of existence, as well as favourable reviews for their final album, the band, unable to make commercial headway, called it quits in August 2005.The Dutch Progressive Rock Page - CD Reviews 2004

Each of the women tend to have psychological and behavioral problems. Mischievously sexual and rascally moments are also captured among the women. All seven women have different backgrounds and personalities. They are introduced to the show based off their capacity to be a "charismatic, tough chick." The cast, deemed "bad girls", enjoy a luxurious lifestyle in a fine mansion for three months, during which they must obey specified rules. Their lives inside and outside of the house are chronicled and recorded by the production team.
Bad Girls Club airs in three nations besides the United States; MTV Australia, RTL 5 in The Netherlands, and TV11 in Sweden, and as of December 2013 has not been licensed to a broadcaster in another nation for a local version of the series. The program has been negatively reviewed by critics for the effect it may have on teenagers, and the negative attitudes and remarks of the cast members have caused outrage to some viewers.
The format of the show has changed from early seasons. If a "Bad" Girl breaks a rule, she is evicted from the show and, if it is early in the season, replaced by a new "Bad Girl". The fourth season is considered the series' "breakthrough season", becoming Oxygen's first series ever to average over one million viewers per episode.[tpl]cite web|title=Oxygen's Hit Series "Bad Girls Club" Returns for Fourth Season Premiering Tuesday, December 1 at 10pm ET/PT|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2009/10/13/oxygens-hit-series-bad-girls-club-returns-for-fourth-season-premiering-tuesday-december-1-at-10pm-et-pt-33045/20091013oxygen01/|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=October 30, 2013|date=October 13, 2009[/tpl]

[[Harrison Ridley Jr.]]
CATEGORIES: 2009 deaths, American music critics, Jazz writers, 1930s births

Harrison Ridley Jr. (1938 (?) - February 19, 2009) was a teacher and broadcaster on African-American music.
Ridley taught music history at Temple University and Villanova University, he was the host of a Sunday night radio show on WRTI (90.1FM) entitled, "The Historical Approach to the Positive Music." The "historical approach" Ridley took was to focus in particular on one artist, and use his entire four-hour (8pm-12am) program to give the listener a sense of that artist's contribution to the tradition. Often he would focus on a specific period in an artist's career, such as early (1920s-1940s) Duke Ellington or Miles Davis recordings from the 1960s. The show ran for more than thirty years and was very popular in the Philadelphia area. Ridley would often reference the fact that his phone lines in the studio were full of calls—local jazz celebrities had been known to call in during a show as well.
Ridley was also a record collector and archivist. In the course of fifty years of collecting, he amassed over 8,500 LPs, 3,000 78s, 200 45s, 300 CDs, and 6,000 books on African American history and music. He specialized in Duke Ellington albums (of which he had more than 600), and was also an expert on Benny Carter (he had 200 Benny Carter albums).Harrison Ridley Jr
Harrison, a mechanical and building engineer employee of the Philadelphia School District for 39 years, also shared his passion for the "Positive Music"  by visiting many schools throughout the decades and sharing his wealth of knowledge with students, parents and staff.  Many students were truly inspired by his visits and would constantly ask their teachers, "When can Mr. Ridley come back and talk with us again?".  Harrison would also hold occasional informational classes for PSD central office staff after the end of regular business so they could also reap the benefits of his expertise. 
He did not use the term "jazz," opting instead for phrases such as "this music referred to as jazz," or simply, "the positive music." In this respect he shares a similarity with many other jazz artists and historians (Duke Ellington being the most prominent example) to resist using "jazz" as a descriptive label.
In his lifetime Ridley received more than 80 awards, including recognition from the Philadelphia City Hall and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and an honorary Doctorate in Music from Villanova University (conferred in May, 2008). Ridley also worked as a consultant for the Library of Congress. Dubbed a "walking encyclopedia of jazz,"[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=30504 |title=WRTI Remembers Legendary Jazz Host Harrison Ridley, Jr.|publisher=All About Jazz | accessdate=2009-02-22 |date=2009-02-20[/tpl] Ridley was in great demand on radio and television shows. He was also an archivist for the Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts, an important institution in the Philly jazz scene.Charting Courses of Discovery
Ridley died on February 19 2009, some weeks after a major stroke.

[[Young Dracula]]

CATEGORIES: BBC children's television programmes, British children's television programmes, Dracula television programs

Young Dracula was a British teenage  horror drama television series airing on CBBC, loosely based on Young Dracula and Young Monsters, a children's book by Michael Lawrence. The final episode aired on March 31, 2014.
The first two series follow the Dracula family, a family of vampires: Vladimir (Vlad), his father Count Dracula, and paternal older half- sister Ingrid. Having lived in Transylvania, they move to Stokely, a small town in Wales after various incidents involving angry peasant mobs. It was filmed in various locations around Wales, including Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf, Caerphilly Castle, Tretower Court and parts of Llantrisant. Directed by Joss Agnew, the first series was broadcast in 2006, and the second series, which started in late 2007, concluded in early 2008.
The third series, commissioned three years after the second, sees Vlad and the Count flee both vampires and slayers, while the Count is determined that Vlad should fulfil his destiny to become "the Chosen One". This series was filmed in Liverpool during 2011, in various locations including the disused Margaret Bevan School, Croxteth Hall and Stanley Docks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.how-do.co.uk/north-west-media-news/north-west-broadcasting/waterloo-road-heads-to-scotland-20110823100955217 |title=Waterloo Road heads to Scotland |publisher=How-Do |date=23 August 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016vvt0 |title=CBBC Programmes - Young Dracula, Series 3, Hide and Seek |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Behind the scenes at Young Dracula|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/clips/p00lr6wd|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 March 2013[/tpl] It began airing on 31 October 2011. The fourth series follows on from season three's predicament and was helmed by a new director, and began airing on 29 October 2012. Young Dracula was renewed for a fifth series in 2013, with filming beginning in April,https://twitter.com/clarelucythomas/status/281743927630000129 and was broadcast from January 2014.
Young Dracula was nominated for Best Children's Drama in the 2008 BAFTA Awards and has been nominated for several other awards. An additional series, the Young Dracula Files, began broadcasting on October 24, 2012, in which the main characters tell their stories of the past. It was primarily hosted by the character Bertrand Du Fortunesa, played by Cesare Taurasi.

[[Rotordynamics]]
CATEGORIES: Dynamics

Rotor dynamics is a specialized branch of applied mechanics concerned with the behavior and diagnosis of rotating structures. It is commonly used to analyze the behavior of structures ranging from jet engines and steam turbines to auto engines and computer disk storage.  At its most basic level rotor dynamics is concerned with one or more mechanical structures (rotors) supported by bearings and influenced by internal phenomena that rotate around a single axis.  The supporting structure is called a stator. As the speed of rotation increases the amplitude of vibration often passes through a maximum that is called a critical speed. This amplitude is commonly excited by unbalance of the rotating structure; everyday examples include engine balance and tire balance. If the amplitude of vibration at these critical speeds is excessive then catastrophic failure occurs. In addition to this, turbo machinery often develop instabilities which are related to the internal makeup of turbo machinery, and which must be corrected. This is the chief concern of engineers who design large rotors.
Rotating machinery produces vibrations depending upon the structure of the mechanism involved in the process. Any faults in the machine can increase or excite the vibration signatures. Vibration behavior of the machine due to imbalance is one of the main aspects of rotating machinery which must be studied in detail and considered while designing. All objects including rotating machinery exhibit natural frequency depending on the structure of the object. The critical speed of a rotating machine occurs when the rotational speed matches its natural frequency. The lowest speed at which the natural frequency is first encountered is called the first critical speed, but as the speed increases additional critical speeds are seen. Hence, minimizing rotational unbalance and unnecessary external forces are very important to reducing the overall forces which initiate resonance. When the vibration is in resonance it creates a destructive energy which should be the main concern when designing a rotating machine. The objective here should be to avoid operations that are close to the critical and pass safely through them when in acceleration or deceleration. If this aspect is ignored it might result in loss of the equipment, excessive wear and tear on the machinery, catastrophic breakage beyond repair or even human injury and loss of lives.
The real dynamics of the machine is difficult to model theoretically. The calculations are based on simplified models which resemble various structural components (lumped parameters models), equations obtained from solving models numerically (Rayleigh–Ritz method) and finally from the finite element method (FEM), which is another approach for modelling and analysis of the machine for natural frequencies. On any machine prototype it is tested to confirm the precise frequencies of resonance and then redesigned to assure that resonance does not occur.

[[Tetrapharmacum]]

CATEGORIES: Roman cuisine, Ancient Greek medicine

Tetrapharmacum (Latin), or tetrapharmakos (from Greek τετραφάρμακος), and sometimes tetrapharmakon (τετραϕάρμακον, "the "fourfold drug") was a pharmaceutical compound known in ancient Greek pharmacology, a mixture of wax, pine resin, pitch and animal fat, most often pork fat.
The word tetrapharmakos has been used metaphorically by Epicurus and his disciples to refer to the four remedies for healing the soul.
Apparently named after this unprepossessing concoction, tetrafarmacum (standard Latin tetrapharmacum) was a complicated and expensive dish in Roman Imperial cuisine. It contained sow's udder, pheasant, wild boar and ham in pastry. The only surviving source of information on the tetrafarmacum is the Augustan History, which mentions it three times. All three mentions are credited to the now-lost biography of Hadrian by Marius Maximus. According to this source, the Caesar Lucius Aelius (died 138) invented the dish;  his senior colleague, the Emperor Hadrian, liked it; a later emperor, Alexander Severus, liked it too.

Like a simple cell, a complex cell will respond primarily to oriented edges and gratings, however it has a degree of spatial invariance.  This means that its receptive field cannot be mapped into fixed excitatory and inhibitory zones. Rather, it will respond to patterns of light in a certain orientation within a large receptive field, regardless of the exact location. Some complex cells respond optimally only to movement in a certain direction.
These cells were discovered by Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel in the early 1960s. They refrained from reporting on the complex cells in (Hubel 1959) because they did not feel that they understood them well enough at the time.[tpl]cite book|last=Wiesel|first=David H. |last2=Hubel |first2=Torsten N.|title=Brain and visual perception : the story of a 25-year collaboration|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-19-517618-6|edition=Online-Ausg..[/tpl]
 In Hubel and Wiesel (1962),<ref name="Hubel1962" /> they reported that complex cells were intermixed with simple cells and when excitatory and inhibitory regions could be established, the summation and mutual antagonism properties didn't hold.
The difference between the receptive fields and the characteristics of simple and complex cells is the hierarchical convergent nature of visual processing. Complex cells receive inputs from a number of simple cells. Their receptive field is therefore a summation and integration of the receptive fields of many input simple cells [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl].

The Tour of Brotherly Love was a 2001 tour of North America featuring Oasis, The Black Crowes, and Spacehog, three rock bands featuring pairs of brothers: Noel and Liam Gallagher, Chris and Rich Robinson, Royston and Antony Langdon, respectively. The tour's title is a nod to the fact that all three pairs of brothers have been known to fight, sometimes physically, sometimes even publicly.
Originally scheduled for 21 dates across the United States and Canada, the three bands performed to capacity crowds in medium-sized arenas and concert halls, including a three-night stand at Radio City Music Hall in New York. Prior to the tour's two dates at The Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, The Black Crowes were inducted into the Guitar Center Rockwalk, a walk of fame honoring notable musical acts and artists. Noel Gallagher and Slash were on hand for the ceremony.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/3080.html |title=Rock Walk inducts the Black Crowes; Robinson, Gallagher talk Brotherly Love tour |accessdate=2008-04-22 |publisher=LiveDaily [/tpl]
Noel Gallagher and Gem Archer of Oasis and the Langdon brothers of Spacehog joined The Black Crowes on stage at the end of most shows on the tour, performing covers of songs by Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones. Oasis drummer Alan White missed the tour with a thumb injury and was replaced by older brother Steve White, drummer for Paul Weller.
The May 24 date in Cincinnati, Ohio, was canceled when the Riverbend Music Theater's stage, backstage and pavilion were flooded by forty-five feet of water from the rising Ohio River. The May 29 show in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was canceled because of the tour re-rerouting following the Cincinnati cancellation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12031970 |title=Black Crowes-Oasis Tour Cancels Two Dates |accessdate=2008-04-22 |publisher=Yahoo Music!

Neil Moore (born 21 September 1972 in Liverpool) is an English professional football defender who is currently playing for Solihull Moors.
Moore joined Nuneaton Borough in July 2003 following his release from Mansfield Town. He started his career at Everton and had loan spells with Blackpool, Oldham Athletic, Carlisle United, Rotherham United and Norwich City before moving to Burnley, and Macclesfield Town.
In 2000, he moved into non-league with Telford United. Moore spent two seasons at Bucks Head, where he was the subject of a £40,000 bid from Chester City. Upon the completion of his contract with Telford, he signed for Division Two side Mansfield Town, where he was captain until the appointment of Keith Curle as manager. He scored his first and only goal for Mansfield in the League Cup against Derby County. He spent time on loan at Southport before being released and joining Nuneaton Borough, for whom he was skipper for three seasons. Despite being replaced as team captain by Tom Curtis at the start of the 2007–08 campaign, Moore remained a prominent first-team member, and when Curtis left at the end of the season, Moore was given the captaincy again for the 2008–09 season, following Nuneaton's two-league demotion. However, Moore was released by manager Kevin Wilkin in October 2008, so that Wilkin could free up money to buy attackers.
He was a member of the first group of legends ever inducted into the inaugural hall of fame when it began in 2009.

[[Lawrence Fletcher]]

CATEGORIES: English male stage actors, 17th-century English male actors, 1608 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Lawrence Fletcher (died 1608) was a Jacobean actor, and man of mystery.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964, Penguin, Baltimore, 1964; p. 168.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, p. 318. He is listed on the royal patent of 19 May 1603 that transformed the Lord Chamberlain's Men into the King's Men — and he is listed first, with William Shakespeare second and Richard Burbage third; significant, in the hierarchy-mad world of the time. Yet Fletcher never appears on the other documents that give later generations our limited knowledge of the King's Men; he doesn't seem to have acted, in the leading acting company of the age.
Unlike the eight men whose names follow his on the patent, Fletcher was not, or not primarily, a London actor; he had been "comedian to His Majesty" before 1603, when James I and VI was King of Scotland only. Perhaps his inclusion on the list was diplomatic and bureaucratic, a way of easing and greasing the company's transition from the old regime to the new; or perhaps Fletcher intended to be an active member of the company (their comedian Thomas Pope died in 1603, and Fletcher could have been his replacement), but was prevented by declining health. Fletcher was buried on 12 September 1608, in St. Saviour's Church, Southwark.
By then, Augustine Phillips had died, in May 1605; in his will, he'd left 20 shillings to his "fellow" Fletcher. This is less than the 30s. Phillips left to Shakespeare, Henry Condell, and Christopher Beeston, but the same sum he left to fellow King's Men Robert Armin, Alexander Cooke, Richard Cowley, and Nicholas Tooley. This seems to suggest that Fletcher was more than a mere name on a document — though what more, precisely, is impossible to say, given the limits of the evidentiary record.

[[Draft (engineering)]]

CATEGORIES: Casting (manufacturing), Plastics industry

In engineering, draft is the amount of taper for molded or cast parts perpendicular to the parting line. It can be measured in degrees or mm/mm (in/in).
Consider the fabrication of a hollow plastic box, without lid.  Once the plastic has hardened around the mold, the mold must be removed.  As the plastic hardens, it may contract slightly.  By tapering the sides of the mold by an appropriate "draft angle", the mold will be easier to remove.
If the mold is to be removed from the top, the box should taper in towards the bottom, such that measuring the bottom internal dimension will yield a smaller length and width than measuring the top from which the mold is extracted.
By specifying the opening length and width, a draft angle, and a depth, it is not necessary to specify the dimensions for the internal surface, as these may be calculated from the above.
The manufacture of a part that incorporates zero or negative angles may require a mold that can be separated into two or more parts, in order to release the casting.

Brown or Brown people is a racial and ethnic classification. Like black people and white people, it is a metaphor for race based on human skin color. In racialist anthropology, the color brown and the term brown people was used to describe a series of hypothesized racial groups that included various populations from North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Western Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Middle East, Latin America and South America. In Brazil, brown people is a cognate term for pardo. In North America, both Latinos and South Asians sometimes self-identify or are described as brown people.

[[Grey Egerton baronets]]
CATEGORIES: Baronetcies, 1617 establishments in England

The Egerton, later Grey Egerton Baronetcy, of Egerton and Oulton in the County of Chester, is a title in the Baronetage of England. It was created on 5 April 1617 for Roland Egerton. He later represented Wootton Bassett in Parliament. Egerton married Bridget, sister and co-heir of Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton, who was attainted in 1603 and his title forfeited (see Baron Grey de Wilton). The Egertons were an ancient Cheshire family. An ancestor of the first Baronet, William le Belward, took the surname of Egerton from the lordship of Egerton, which he inherited. The sixth Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Newton.George Edward Cockayne Complete Baronetage Volume 1 1900 
In 1784, the seventh Baronet was created Baron Grey de Wilton, of Wilton Castle in the County of Hereford, in the Peerage of Great Britain, a revival of the title held by his ancestors. The peerage was created with remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1801 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Grey de Wilton and Earl of Wilton, of Wilton Castle in the County of Hereford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. These titles were created with special remainder to the second and the younger sons successively of his daughter Lady Eleanor, wife of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster. On Lord Wilton's death in 1814 the barony became extinct as he had no sons, while he was succeeded in the viscountcy and earldom according to the special remainder by his grandson, the second Earl (see the Earl of Wilton for the later history of these titles). The baronetcy passed to his kinsman, the eighth Baronet, a descendant of a younger son of the first Baronet. He represented Chester in the House of Commons. The ninth Baronet was in 1825 granted by Royal Warrant, and for all subsequent Baronets on succeeding to the title, the right to assume for themselves only the additional surname of Grey and the arms and supporters of Grey de Wilton (although the 16th and 17th Baronets have chosen not to use this additional surname). The tenth Baronet was a politician and noted palaeontologist. The sixteenth Baronet, was a Major-General in the British Army; inheriting the baronetcy at the age of 94, General Egerton opted not to use the title. As of 2014, the title is held by the latter's son, the seventeenth Baronet, who succeeded in 2010. 
Several other members of the Egerton family have also gained distinction. Caledon Richard Egerton, fifth son of the ninth Baronet, was a Major-General in the British Army. His third son, Sir Charles Comyn Egerton, was a Field Marshal in the British Army. His son Wion de Malpas Egerton (1879–1943) was a Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy and was killed in action in the Second World War. His son David Boswell Egerton was a Major-General in the Royal Artillery, was awarded the Military Cross, and later became the sixteenth Baronet. Sir Reginald Arthur Egerton, another son of the aforementioned Major-General Caledon Richard Egerton (d. 1930), was Private Secretary to the Postmaster-General, Surveyor to the General Post Office, London, and Secretary to the General Post Office, Dublin. Sir Stephen Loftus Egerton (1932–2006) (son of William le Belward Egerton, son of William Egerton, son of Philip Henry Egerton, son of William Egerton, third son of Philip Egerton, father of the eighth and ninth Baronets), was a prominent diplomat. He was British Ambassador to Iraq from 1980 to 1982 and Ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1986 to 1989. Sir Robert Eyles Egerton (1827–1912), youngest son of William Egerton, third son of Philip Egerton, father of the eighth and ninth Baronets, was Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab. His son Sir Raleigh Gilbert Egerton (1860–1931) was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army. A junior branch of the family is settled in Australia (see Peter Warburton); one of the present day members of the family, Richard Egerton-Warburton AO LVO, is a recipient of the Order of Australia.

Irwin Kostal (October 1, 1911 – November 23, 1994) was an American musical arranger of films and an orchestrator of Broadway musicals.
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Kostal opted not to attend college, instead teaching himself musical arranging by studying the symphonic scores available at his local library. His first professional job was as a staff arranger for Design for Listening, an NBC radio show based in his hometown. Irwin was one of four children born to James and Emma Kostal. His siblings James, Jerome and Violet all remained in the Chicago area.Irwin Kostal at Disney Legends
After moving to New York City, Kostal was hired for Sid Caesar's popular variety series Your Show of Shows, and followed this with a stint at The Garry Moore Show. In the latter part of the decade he began working on Broadway, orchestrating for Shinbone Alley, The Music Man, Fiorello!, and West Side Story. His work on the latter resulted in his being hired to score the 1961 screen adaptation with Saul Chaplin, Johnny Green, and Sid Ramin. The quartet won both an Oscar and a Grammy Award for their contributions. Kostal later went on to collaborate with Saul Chaplin for the 1965 film adaptation of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music and won an Oscar for Best Music Scoring.
He also conducted the orchestra for several of the Firestone Christmas Albums.
For the remainder of his life, Kostal divided his time primarily between stage and screen, with an occasional detour into television to work with such people as Carol Burnett, Lucille Ball, and Leonard Bernstein. He supervised five of the Sherman Brothers musical film scores  (one of them being Mary Poppins) at four different movie studios between 1964 and 1978.  In 1982, he conducted the digital re-recording of the music to Walt Disney's 1940 animated feature Fantasia. 
Kostal died of a heart attack in Studio City, California. In 2004 he was named a Disney Legend in recognition of his contributions to films released by the studio.

[[Ulica Sezamkowa]]

CATEGORIES: Polish children's television series, Sesame Street international co-productions, Television programs featuring puppetry

Poland gained its own version of Sesame Street in 1996 on TVP2. It was one of the few countries in Europe that did not translate the famous Sesame Street songs. This version does a lot with their own traditional music. 
The Muppets remain the main attraction, but now they speak Polish, have Polish names, and interact with actors playing Polish characters, including a grandfather whose bushy mustache makes him look like Poland's anti-communist hero and former president, Lech Walesa. 
Actor Andrzej Buszewicz was chosen for the role by children who were shown a group of photographs and picked his face as the most grandfatherly. "It turned out that (the Walesa look-alike) was the average grandfather the children selected", said Andrzej Kostenko, who shot the 52-episode series. 
The series had its debut in October, just after a version appeared in Russia in the Russian language. Before that, Polish children had only known the American version of Sesame Street with a man doing a voice-over and reading all the parts in Polish (as is usually the case for most foreign-language programs that are broadcast on Polish TV). Now, it's all Polish, from the dubbed dialogue to the Polish family that lives on the make-believe "Sezamkowa" Street. 
There are even original Polish Muppets, designed in the United States by Jim Henson Productions based on thousands of Polish children's sketches. 
The characters are:
In one episode, Beata played a TV commentator, reporting on an orchestra's performance as if it were a sporting event. "The piano is moving ahead and the violin is coming in second," she said. "The oboe has done something wrong. It's getting a yellow card from the conductor." In Poland, where classical music retains a strong influence, along with soccer, the scene worked.
The prime time Sunday afternoon series is the result of 15 months of effort by Polish producers, educators, writers and actors working with the Children's Television Workshop crew.

Vicente Segrelles (born 9 September 1940 in  Barcelona) is a Spanish comic book artist and writer.
Segrelles gained popularity in Europe for his painted comic book epic The Mercenary (El Mercenario), started in 1980. Set in a medieval fantasy world, El Mercenario follows the adventures of a mercenary in his fight against evil. Unusual for the craft of comic books, every panel of his work for this series—which has reached 13 issues so far—is painted in oil, a time-consuming process.
Segrelles was also the cover artist for the Italian science fiction magazine Urania from 1988 to 1991.

[[Didot (typeface)]]

CATEGORIES: Modern serif typefaces

Didot is a name given to a group of typefaces named after the famous French printing and type producing family. The classification is known as modern, or Didone. The typeface we know today was based on a collection of related types developed in the period 1784–1811. Firmin Didot (1764–1836) cut the letters, and cast them as type in Paris. His brother, Pierre Didot (1760–1853) used the types in printing. His edition of La Henriade by Voltaire in 1818 is considered his masterwork. The typeface takes inspiration from John Baskerville's experimentation with increasing stroke contrast and a more condensed armature. The Didot family's development of a high contrast typeface with an increased stress is contemporary to similar faces developed by Giambattista Bodoni in Italy. Didot is described as neoclassical, and is evocative of the Age of Enlightenment. 
The "CBS Didot" version of Didot was commissioned and used by broadcast network CBS for many years alongside its famous "eye" logo.http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/revival/cbs-didot.html While the network's use of Didot with its logo is not as prevalent as it once was, it is still a common sight.
The Style Network used a bold weight of Didot in its on-air identity (in addition to the News Gothic font).
Several revivals of the Didot faces have been made, most of them for hot metal typesetting. Like Bodoni, early digital versions suffered from a syndrome called "dazzle"–the hairline strokes in smaller point sizes nearly disappearing in printing. Among the more successful contemporary adaptations are the ones drawn by Adrian Frutiger for the Linotype foundry, and by Jonathan Hoefler for H&FJ. Both designs anticipate the degradation of hairline in smaller point sizes by employing heavier weighted strokes in the smaller point sizes.

HMS ''Shrivenham'' was one of 93 ships of the [tpl]sclass|Ham|minesweeper|0[/tpl] of inshore minesweepers. 
Their names were all chosen from villages ending in -ham. The minesweeper was named after Shrivenham in Oxfordshire.
Following completion she was immediately placed in Operational Reserve out of the water on a cradle until 1963. She was then transferred to the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service but was put up for disposal in 1966. She was sold to the Port of London Authority in 1969 and remained with them until her retirement in the 1980s.
Although retired and with the wheelhouse, engines and most deck fittings removed she is still "afloat" and has, for the last 13 years, been a "liveaboard" home.

CATEGORIES: Graphics processing units, Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo chips, Ricoh products

The PPU (Picture Processing Unit), more specifically known as Ricoh RP2C02 (NTSC version) / RP2C07 (PAL version), is the microprocessor in the Nintendo Entertainment System responsible for generating video signals from graphic data stored in memory.
The chip is known for its effective use of memory, using very little memory to store graphical data. It was rather advanced for its time when the Famicom (Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System) was released, sporting full sprite support, movable backgrounds, and many colors on screen at the same time. To compete with other video game systems, like the graphically superior Sega Master System, Nintendo also extended the PPU's technical capabilities through the use of mappers, which were placed on the game cartridge. The mappers added more memory or could bank switch data into the PPU's address space, making it possible to create more advanced graphics, using more colors and bigger tile sets.

The Belton Chalets are a group of historic hotel buildings in the village of West Glacier, Montana, near the western entrance to Glacier National Park. The chalet buildings were built in 1910-11 by the Great Northern Railway (GN) as the first component of the railroad's ambitious program of hotel, road, and trail construction in Glacier. The buildings featured a "Swiss Chalet" architectural style that set the style for much of the Great Northern's building program in Glacier. Ultimately, the site included five buildings, including a dining hall and a hotel facility.
During the 1910s and 1920s the Belton Chalet was operated by the Glacier Park Hotel Company, the GN subsidiary responsible for the railroad's concession operations in Glacier. The property was less successful than the GN's other Glacier facilities, however, probably due to its remoteness from the park's other railway-operated hotels, and by the 1930s it saw only intermittent use. The railway sold the chalet buildings in 1946, and the main hotel building stood empty for most of the next five decades, while a cafe and bar intermittently operated in the old dining hall. In 1997, the property was acquired by new owners who undertook a $1 million restoration of the entire complex, and the hotel reopened beginning with the 1998 summer season. http://www.beltonchalet.com/ The chalet buildings, together with other sites were included in the National Historic Landmark designation of Great Northern Railway Buildings in 2000.

Operation SimoomSimoon means a desert wind. Note that this name was used in the movie Operacja Samum, but there are no references it was the actual name of the operation. ([tpl]lang-pl|Operacja Samum[/tpl]) was a top secret Polish intelligence operation conducted in Iraq in 1990.
In 1990 the CIA asked European intelligence agencies to assist in the withdrawal of six American operatives (a mix of CIA and DIA officers) investigating Iraqi troops movements in Iraq before the Gulf War.John Pomfret, Polish Agents Rescued 6 U.S. Spies From Iraq - Scotch Lubricated Escape During Gulf War, The Washington Post, January 17, 1995 Several countries, such as Russia, Great Britain, and France refused to help in such a dangerous operation; only Poland agreed to help. The operation was very risky because if the cover were to be blown, all operatives were likely to be killed.
Poland had connections in Iraq due to Polish engineering firms' construction work throughout the country and sent a few operatives to start working on the operation. Gromosław CzempińskiReprint of article from Warsaw Voice, The Warsaw Voice, 23. 5. 1999 became the commander of this operation, assigned to it by Polish Minister of Internal Affairs and first chief of Urząd Ochrony Państwa, Krzysztof Kozłowski. Ironically, Czempiński has previously been a spy in the United States and either took part or led many operations against the Western intelligence services. The main plan was to reestablish contact with the hiding American spies and give them Polish passports so they could escape from Iraq in a bus, alongside Polish and Russian workers.
The six agents were hiding in Kuwait and Baghdad for several weeks before the escape was carried out. The operation was very difficult because the Iraqis started to suspect some kind of American-Polish intrigue.
The agents were given refuge at a Polish construction camp, and then provided with passports and put on a refugee bus. An Iraqi officer at checkpoint on the border had studied in Poland and spoke Polish well enough to communicate. When the bus arrived at the border, he asked one of the American spies a question in Polish. Since the spy did not know Polish at all, he pretended to be heavily drunk (another version states that the operative in question fainted). Nevertheless, the bus managed to cross the border with all occupants (WP 1995). Poles moved the agents out of Iraq and into the safety of Turkey. Operatives from both sides returned to their countries. Polish forces rescued not only the agents but also secret maps—detailed maps of various military installations and of crucial points in the capital of Baghdad itself—apparently crucial for Operation Desert Storm.
As a reward for Poland's help, the US government promised to cancel half, or $16.5 billion, of Poland's foreign debt.During Gulf War, Polish Agents Saved 6 American Spies, The New York Times, January 18, 1995
In at least two other operations, the Poles later aided another 15 foreigners to escape, mostly Britons, held hostage by the Iraqis as part of Saddam Hussein's "human shield" campaign to deter an allied invasion.
Information about this operation was first revealed in 1995 by The Washington Post. In 1999, Polish director Władysław Pasikowski made a movie, Operacja Samum about this operation; it was the first Polish production co-financed by Warner Bros. and third by HBO.

Thomas Grey Egerton, 1st Earl of Wilton (14 August 1749 – 23 September 1814), known as Sir Thomas Grey Egerton, Bt from 1756 to 1784, was a British peer.
Egerton was the son of Sir Thomas Grey Egerton, 6th Baronet, and his wife Catherine Copley. On his father's side he descended from Sir Rowland Egerton, 1st Baronet, who married Bridget Grey, sister and co-heir of Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton, who was attainted in 1603 with his title forfeited. Egerton sat as a Member of Parliament for Lancashire from 1772 to 1784. The latter year the barony of Grey de Wilton held by his ancestors was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Grey de Wilton, of Wilton Castle in the County Hereford. The peerage was created with remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1801 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Grey de Wilton and Earl of Wilton, of Wilton Castle in the County of Hereford, with remainder to the second and the younger sons successively of his daughter Eleanor, wife of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster.
Egerton was listed as a subscriber to the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal navigation in 1791.[tpl]cite book | title = A list of the subscribers to the intended Bolton Bury and Manchester Canal Navigation | publisher = Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Company | year = 1791 | location = Greater Manchester County Records Office, ref.

Lord Wilton married Eleanor Assheton, daughter of Sir Ralph Assheton, in 1769. He died in September 1814, aged 65. On his death the Barony of Grey de Wilton became extinct as he had no sons while the Baronetcy was passed on to a distant relative. He was succeeded in the Viscountcy and Earldom according to the special remainder by his grandson Lord Thomas Grosvenor Egerton.

[[Good Samaritan Hospital (Cincinnati)]]

CATEGORIES: Hospitals in Cincinnati, Ohio, American Civil War hospitals, Hospitals established in 1852, Cincinnati, Ohio in the American Civil War, Greater Cincinnati Consortium of Colleges and Universities, Robert Mills buildings

Good Samaritan Hospital, the oldest and largest private teaching and specialty health care facility in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, was opened in 1852 under the sponsorship of the Sisters of Charity. The hospital is member of TriHealth, a joint operating agreement between Catholic Health Initiatives and Bethesda, Inc. Cincinnati to manage Good Samaritan.  The Hospital of the Good Samaritan, at Sixth and Lock streets, was originally the Cincinnati Marine Hospital, built at a cost of $300,000, from a generic pattern by American Architect, Robert Mills. Because there was already a place for merchant seamen (river men) to go, there were insufficient numbers of such men to warrant opening the hospital. 
During the Civil War, it was the Military Hospital of Cincinnati, which operated first as a volunteer hospital, supported by community donations, until it was obvious that the war would last more than 90 days, thus it was taken over by the Army Medical Department. After the war, Butler and Worthington purchased the hospital from the government for about $70,000 and donated it to the Sisters of Charity.  The original eye hospital was used for a time,and perhaps formed by Dr. Daniel Drake, who received a charter from the Ohio General Assembly for a medical school in 1819 and then in 1821, a charter for the City Infirmary called the Commercial Hospital and Lunatic Asylum of the State of Ohio. "Commercial" stood for commerce and this is where the sick and injured river and canal men were brought.

[[Status attainment]]

CATEGORIES: Sociological theories

Status attainment or status attainment theory is a concept of sociology.
It deals largely with one's position in society, or class. Status attainment is affected by both achieved factors, such as educational attainment, and ascribed factors, such as family income. It is achieved by a combination of parents' status and one's own efforts and abilities. The idea behind status attainment is that one can be mobile, either upwardly or downwardly, in the form of a class system.
In education context, status attainment assumes that social status of parent affects educational level achieved by children, which in turn affects occupational level and social status. Thus, level of schooling would affect (moderate) the degree of intergenerational transmission of social status.Status Attainment Theory

Written by series creator Eric Kripke and directed by Kim Manners, the episode featured Nicki Aycox's final portrayal of recurring villain Meg Masters, and also introduced Jim Beaver as hunter and Winchester-ally Bobby Singer.

[[Loafing (ice hockey)]]

CATEGORIES: Ice hockey terminology, Ice hockey strategy

Loafing, floating, or cherry picking in ice hockey is a manoeuver in which a player, the floater (usually a forward), literally loafs — spends time in idleness — or casually skates behind the opposing team's unsuspecting defencemen while they are in their attacking zone. It is very similar to the cherry picking tactic sometimes used in basketball. Its controversy is also very similar to that of cherry picking in basketball.
The tactic is used sparingly as although it sometimes creates a breakaway opportunity for the defending team should they manage to take control of the puck and pass it to the floater, it also creates a five-on-four situation (during even strength play) for the attacking team.  Also, a good defenceman usually keeps an eye open for the development of these potential situations where he would immediately backcheck once a floater is spotted.

[[Cityscape of Lexington, Kentucky]]

CATEGORIES: Cityscapes, Geography of Lexington, Kentucky

The urban development patterns of Lexington, Kentucky, confined within an urban growth boundary that protects its famed horse farms, include greenbelts and expanses of land between it and the surrounding towns. This has been done to preserve the region's horse farms and the unique Bluegrass landscape, which bring millions of dollars to the city through the horse industry and tourism. Urban growth is also tightly restricted in the adjacent counties, with the exception of Jessamine County, with development only allowed inside existing city limits. In order to prevent rural subdivisions and large homes on expansive lots from consuming the Bluegrass landscape, Fayette and all surrounding counties have minimum lot size requirements, which range from [tpl]convert|10|acre|m2[/tpl] in Jessamine to fifty in Fayette.
Because the farmland in the southern part of the county consisted more of tobacco farms than pastures for raising horses and thus was considered "replaceable," most of Lexington's growth has been historically concentrated south of the downtown area. As a result, more than seventy percent of today's population lives south of US 60. Until the mid-1990s, most of the growth occurred in the southwest between US 68 (Harrodsburg Road) and KY 1974 (Tates Creek Road). Today, new development continues to the Madison and Clark County lines in a southeasterly direction along the Interstate 75 and US 60 (Winchester Road) corridors. Of the surrounding counties, the greatest growth is occurring in the counties through which Interstate 75 and US 27 pass, such as Scott County, Madison County and Jessamine County. Clark County and Woodford County are experiencing moderate growth, and Bourbon County is stagnant, with almost no growth. More recently, growth has begun to leapfrog the adjacent counties, with rapid increases in suburban development in Anderson County, to the west of Woodford County along the Bluegrass Parkway and also in the commuter belt of the state capital of Frankfort; and Garrard County, to the south of Jessamine along US 27.
In addition to rampant suburban growth, downtown Lexington is seeing a large building boom, with the revitalization of many historical structures and the construction of many new ones. Much of the development utilizes urban infill techniques such as the filling in of parking lots and high-density or out-of-character structures. Several new projects, such as South Hill Station Lofts and University Lofts, are taking advantage of now-disused tobacco warehouses along the South Broadway corridor.

CATEGORIES: Bayesian inference, Regression analysis

In statistics, Bayesian linear regression is an approach to linear regression in which the statistical analysis is undertaken within the context of Bayesian inference. When the regression model has errors that have a normal distribution, and if a particular form of prior distribution is assumed, explicit results are available for the posterior probability distributions of the model's parameters.

Central Scientific Company was founded in 1900 in downtown Chicago. It was formed out of what was left of the Olmstad Scientific Company.
Central Scientific manufactured and distributed science teaching equipment for schools, colleges, and universities by catalog mail order. The trademark "CENCO" was used from 1909 onwards. CENCO dominated the field of selling science education equipment through their mail order catalog.
By 1935, the company established itself as one of the leading national suppliers of science equipment. During World War II, part of the manufacturing facility was turned over to the production of war necessities, making bombsights for airplanes and fuses for large bombs. 
After 1968, the company began having financial difficulties. In 1974, the assets were sold off to competitors. The educational business retained the name Central Scientific Company.
In April 1979, Central Scientific's assets and activities were acquired by two businessmen from Buffalo, New York. They sold the business to Sargent-Welch (their main competitor) in 2000.

James Horatio "Jimmy" Thorpe (16 September 1913 – 9 February 1936) was an English footballer born in Jarrow. He played 139 games as a goalkeeper for Sunderland Football Club. He signed when he was 17 after attending Jarrow Central School. He had a promising career, becoming starter for the club from the 1932/33 season. His life and career were cut short on 1 February 1936 when he was kicked in the head and chest after he had picked up the ball following a backpass in a game against Chelsea at Roker Park. He continued to take part until the match finished, but died in hospital 4 days later from diabetes mellitus and heart failure 'accelerated by the rough usage of the opposing team' [tpl]cite news|title=Goalkeeper's Death|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1936-02-14-16-001&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1936-02-14-16 | location=London | work=The Times|date=14 February 1936[/tpl]
This tragic end to Thorpe's career led to a change in the rules, where players were no longer allowed to raise their foot to a goalkeeper when he had control of the ball in his arms.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/10/04/soinve04.xml | location=London | title=On the run with dogs and a long-dead goalkeeper - Telegraph[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Though Thorpe may be little known, even in the North East, goalkeepers around the world doubtlessly owe a debt to him.

[[Mahdi al-Modarresi]]
CATEGORIES: Shia Muslim scholars of Islam, Iraqi Shia Muslims, Living people

Sayed Mohammad Mahdi Al-Modarressi comes from a family of scholars which includes supreme religious jurists, or Grand Ayatollahs, such as Grand Ayatollah S. Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi, one of Iraq’s leading faith leaders of its majority Shi'a population.
Under his father’s supervision, Sayed Al-Modarressi followed a solid traditional curriculum in the Hawza, studying classical works on various disciplines of Islamic jurisprudence as well as the instrumental faculties commonly taught at religious learning institutions. A graduate of the acclaimed al Qa’em Theological Research Institute near the Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque in Damascus, Sayed Modarressi reached the level of Sotouh al Ulya (Upper Foundations). His classical curriculum embodied a methodology which crystallizes the middle way of Islam; respect for the differences between jurists, and a spiritual education drawn from the Qur'an and the traditions of Prophet Muhammad and his Household; the Ahlulbayt. 
Modarressi has written three books in Arabic (published in Beirut) http://ahlulbayt.tv/enlight/?page_id=6 and two titles in English (being edited for publication), in addition to numerous papers on Islamic sciences as well as contemporary issues including social and theological Islamic thought.
Sayed Modarressi's last book (Arabic) is an in-depth analytical study of the prophetic narration known as Hadeeth Al Thaqalayn (Hadith of the two weighty things) which looks into the practical implications of this controversial narration and provides a thorough insight of the Shia/Sunni deliberations on this text. http://ahlulbayt.tv/enlight/?page_id=6
Sayed Modarressi's English books include 'Say; He is God – Allah the God of Islam' and 'Why Muslims Are Weird - And Some Outright Crazy!'.According to previous versions of this wiki, the book's title was originally "Why We Are Different; Bridging the Divide Between Islam and the West" but was changed later, as per the online bio The former is a wide-ranging study of the Islamic view of God, focusing on the principle theological arguments for the existence of the supernatural Creator from an Islamic viewpoint. The latter work is an introduction to the religion of Islam to non-Muslims with a radically new, unorthodox approach to this over-saturated yet intricately complex subject. The book tackles subjects as complicated as Jihad & Hijab, as well as trivial matters as why Muslims have special dietary needs and fashion customs. 
Another work is a collection of essays about contemporary challenges facing Muslim youths http://ahlulbayt.tv/enlight/?p=284 with special emphasis on problems which are more relevant in Western nations where they are a growing minority. Such 'taboo' subjects as pornography, alcohol, sex, drugs, and religious extremism are discussed. 
Sayed Modarressi lectures worldwide on traditional as well as contemporary Islamic issues and has lectured in countless mosques, churches, universities, and seminaries. He has been interviewed by numerous publications and has appeared on TV and radio programs such as the BBC. An ardent advocate of interfaith dialogue,Interfaith Dialogue at St. Andrew's Modarressi engages in such events on a regular basis and has consistently spoken out against acts of terror.BBC's Reporting Religion Interviews Sayed Mehdi al-Modarressi

The North Fork of the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River is a [tpl]convert|6.9|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl]New Hampshire GRANIT state geographic information system river located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the United States.  It is a tributary of the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River, part of the Merrimack River watershed.
The North Fork begins at the outlet of Ethan Pond in the southeastern corner of Bethlehem, New Hampshire and just north of the northeastern corner of the Pemigewasset Wilderness in the heart of the White Mountains.  The river flows west and enters the town limits of Lincoln, the second-largest town by area in New Hampshire.  Passing under the Appalachian Trail (and entering the Pemigewasset Wilderness), the North Fork drops over Thoreau Falls and encounters Whitewall Brook flowing south out of Zealand Notch.  Turning southwest, the North Fork flows through a deep valley with Mount Bond to the west, and joins the East Branch of the Pemigewasset in a broad valley directly north of Mount Hancock.
The North Fork is paralleled by the Appalachian Trail from Ethan Pond to Thoreau Falls, and by the Thoreau Falls Trail from there to the East Branch of the Pemigewasset.

Pep bands are generally associated with performing at pep rallies and sporting events (usually football, basketball or hockey).  With a few exceptions, pep bands are exclusive to the collegiate and high school level.  The typical instrumentation of a pep band is the same as most marching bands, using mainly woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments.  Pep bands typically don't use primarily orchestral instruments (double reeds, strings, etc.), but this is not a hard set limitation.

[[Sonic black hole]]
CATEGORIES: Black holes

A sonic black hole (sometimes called a dumb hole) is a phenomenon in which phonons (sound perturbations) are unable to escape from a fluid that is flowing more quickly than the local speed of sound. They are called sonic, or acoustic, black holes because these trapped phonons are analogous to light in astrophysical (gravitational) black holes. Physicists are interested in them because they have many properties similar to astrophysical black holes and, in particular, are predicted to emit a phononic version of Hawking radiation. The border of a sonic black hole, at which the flow speed changes from being greater than the speed of sound to less than the speed of sound, is called the event horizon. At this point the frequency of phonons approaches zero.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Seems doubtful|date=August 2011[/tpl]
Sonic black holes are possible because phonons in perfect fluids exhibit the same properties of motion as fields, such as gravity, in space and time. M. Visser, “Acoustic black holes: Horizons, ergospheres, and Hawking radiation,” Classical and Quantum Gravity 15, 1767 (1998) arXiv:gr-qc/9712010 For this reason, a system in which a sonic black hole can be created is called a gravity analogue. Nearly any fluid can be used to create an acoustic event horizon, but the viscosity of most fluids creates random motion[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Source says only that "viscosity which introduces terms that cannot be moulded in the relativistic form described earlier"|date=August 2011[/tpl] that makes features like Hawking radiation nearly impossible to detect. The complexity of such a system would make it very difficult to gain any knowledge about such features even if they could be detected.G. Jannes, “Emergent gravity: the BEC paradigm,” Ph.D thesis, Department of Theoretical Physics, Complutense University of Madrid, page 34, Arxiv preprint arXiv:0907.2839 (2009). Many nearly perfect fluids have been suggested for use in creating sonic black holes, such as superfluid helium, a degenerate Fermi gas, and Bose–Einstein condensate. Gravity analogues other than phonons in a fluid, such as slow light and a system of ions, have also been proposed for studying black hole analogues.B. Horstmann, R. Schützhold, B. Reznik, S. Fagnocchi, and J. I. Cirac, “Measurement of Hawking Radiation with Ions in the Quantum Regime,” Arxiv preprint arXiv:1008.3494, 2010.  The fact that so many systems mimic gravity is sometimes used as evidence for the theory of emergent gravity, which could help reconcile relativity and quantum mechanics.G. Jannes, “Emergent gravity: the BEC paradigm,” Ph.D thesis, Department of Theoretical Physics, Complutense University of Madrid, page 12, Arxiv preprint arXiv:0907.2839 (2009).
Acoustic black holes were first theorized to be useful by William Unruh in 1981.W. G. Unruh, “Experimental black hole evaporation,” Phys. Rev. Lett. 46, 1351 (1981). However, the first black hole analogue was not created in a laboratory until 2009. It was created in a rubidium Bose–Einstein condensate using a technique called density inversion. This technique creates a flow by repelling the condensate with a potential minimum. The  surface gravity and temperature of the sonic black hole were measured, but no attempt was made to detect Hawking radiation. However, the scientists who created it predicted that the experiment was suitable for detection and suggested a method by which it might be done by lasing the phonons.O. Lahav, A. Itah, A. Blumkin, C. Gordon & J. Steinhauer, “A sonic black hole in a density-inverted Bose–Einstein condensate” Arxiv preprint arXiv:0906.1337 (2009).

Robert Walter "Bob" Jones (December 2, 1889 – August 30, 1964), nicknamed "Ducky",Bob Jones Baseball Stats by Baseball Almanac was a Major League Baseball third baseman who played nine seasons with the Detroit Tigers from 1917 to 1925.
Born in Clayton, California, Jones made his major league debut at age 27 on April 11, 1917. A left-handed batter, he threw right-handed.  He played 853 major league games with a .265 batting average, 791 hits and 316 RBI. 
As the starting third baseman for the 1921 Detroit Tigers, Jones had his only .300 season, batting .303 for a Detroit team loaded with offensive talent (including Hall of Fame batting champions Ty Cobb and Harry Heilmann).  Despite hitting .303, Jones was one of the "weaker" hitters on a team remembered for its record-setting .316 team batting average, still the highest single season average in American League history.  Despite the impressive hitting, the 1921 Tigers finished in 6th place, 27 games behind the Yankees.
In nine seasons with the Tigers, Jones played 774 games at 3rd base, with the rest at 2nd base and as a pinch-hitter.  He held the second-best fielding percentage (.962) among starting third basemen in the 1922 season.  Jones also had a 3.60 range factor score in 1922, 0.36 points higher than the league average for 3rd basemen.  On May 7, 1923, Jones collected nine assists in a single game, which at the time tied him for the American League record for assists in a game by a 3rd baseman.  
In 1964, Jones died at age 74 in San Diego, California.

This theory focuses on how aspects of culture, such as values, beliefs, customs and skills, are transmitted from one generation to the next.Berk, L.E. (2012). "Infants and children: Prenatal through middle childhood". Boston, MA: Pearson According to Vygotsky, social interaction, especially involvement with knowledgeable community or family members, helps children to acquire the thought processes and behaviours specific to their culture or society. The changes or growth that children experience as a result of these interactions differs greatly between cultures; this variance allows children to become competent in tasks important or necessary in their particular society.

The hit single "Boys Will Be Boys" is included as a bonus track.  This song also featured on the band's second album, Brassbound, but was a success long after the release of the previous album. The band put all of the songs from the album on their myspace page for fans to listen to. The album has been billed by the band as their best album and the one which they are most proud of, but response critics and most importantly from fans and the general public were mixed and lukewarm.
The album charted at #15, with the then current single "Lonely at the Top" dropping from 10 to 31 on album release week. After this the album left the top 75 after three weeks in the chart. It did re-enter after the release of "I Luv U", but the last reported sales figures claimed that the album is their least successful sales-wise.

Lille was the first major victory for Vauban’s siege techniques. Louis XIV, arguing that the Spanish dowry of his wife Maria Theresa of Austria had not been paid, began to expand French borders to the north and east, invading the Spanish Netherlands. This began a conflict with Spain that became the War of Devolution. After taking Charleroi, Tournai and Douai, French troops laid siege to Lille, at that time part of the county of Flanders under Spanish rule. Siege techniques applied by the French military engineer Vauban were instrumental in their capture.

From 2007 until 2011, he was Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, an order of knighthood under papal protection, having previously served as President of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications from 1984 to 2007. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2007. He provided the commentary for the American television viewers of the Christmas Midnight Mass from St Peter's Basilica, Rome. However, in 2009, he retired from that role after 25 years. The commentary has been taken over by Monsignor Thomas Powers of the Diocese of Bridgeport, Connecticut, an official in the Congregation for Bishops.
Pope Benedict XVI accepted Cardinal Foley's resignation as Grand Master on Thursday, February 24, 2011, due to age (on November 11, 2010, the Cardinal had turned 75, the age at which all bishops must write a letter to the Pope formally offering to resign) and because of ill health (the Cardinal was diagnosed in September 2009 with leukemia and anemia). He had led the Pontifical Council for Social Communications for 23 years, from 1984 to June 2007, when he was appointed Grand Master, and had been a consultor or member of many Curial departments. At one time he was editor of The Catholic Standard and Times, the newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. He had met with Pope Benedict XVI on February 10, two days after submitting his resignation letter to the Vatican Secretary of State.

Stop-Time, published in 1967, is a memoir by American author Frank Conroy, and tells the story of his poor childhood and early adulthood, growing up in New York  City and Florida. Focusing on a series of moments from his life, the book combines traditional fictional devices such as scenes while also delving deeply into the author's psyche. The book established Conroy's reputation as a writer. In his review, Norman Mailer wrote, "Stop-Time is unique, an autobiography with the intimate unprotected candor of a novel. What makes it special, however, is the style, dry as an etching, sparse, elegant, modest, cheerful. Conroy has that subtle sense of the proportion of things which one usually finds only in established writers just after the mellowing of their career." Many younger writers have cited Stop-Time as an important influence on their writing careers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4579695|title=Author Frank Conroy Dies|publisher=npr.org|date=2005-04-06|author=Melissa Block|accessdate=2006-11-22[/tpl] He published his second book, Midair, 18 years later.

[[OTPW]]
CATEGORIES: Cryptographic software, Password authentication

OTPW is a one-time password system developed for authentication in Unix-like operating systems by Markus Kuhn. A user's real password is not directly transmitted across the network. Rather, the real password is combined with a short set of characters (constant secret) and a set of one-time tokens to form a single-use password. As the single-use password is only used once, passwords intercepted by a password sniffer or key logger are not useful to an attacker.
OTPW is supported in Unix and Linux (via Pluggable authentication modules), OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD, and a generic open source implementation can be used to enable its use on other systems.
OTPW, like the other one-time password systems, is sensitive to a man in the middle attack if used by itself. This could for example be solved by putting SSL, SPKM or similar security protocol "under it" which authenticates the server and gives point-to-point security between the client and server.

[[Limited release]]

Limited release is a term in the American motion picture industry for a motion picture that is playing in a select few theaters across the country (typically in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago).
A limited release is often used to gauge the appeal of specialty films – especially of documentaries, independent films and art films. A common practice by major film studios is to give highly anticipated and critically acclaimed films a limited release in December in New York and Los Angeles in order to qualify them for an Academy Award nomination, as set out by the rules outlined by the Academy. These films would often receive a wider release later in January or February.
The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which first premiered in 1975, is still shown at limited theaters making it now the longest-running theatrical release in film history.[tpl]cite book |title = Comedy-Horror Films | last=Hallenbeck| first=Bruce G.| publisher=McFarland|date =13 May 2009| pages = 112| isbn=978-0-7864-3332-2[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.close-upfilm.com/diary/news-rocky_horror.html| title=Let's Do the Time Warp, Again. | accessdate=11 February 2008| publisher=Close-Up Film[/tpl]

It was marketed toward boys between the ages of five and nine who were not ready for high-end video games in terms of maturity or expense, though ironically the included game was rated T by the ESRB.  The console used UDF format CD-ROMs.  The HyperScan has two controller ports, as well as a 13.56 MHz RFID scanner that reads and writes to the "cards" which, in turn, activate features in and save data from the game. Players are able to enhance the  abilities of their characters by scanning cards. Games retailed for $19.99 and the console itself for $69.99 at launch, but at the end of its very short lifespan, prices of the system were down to $9.99, the games $1.99, and booster packs $0.99.
The system was sold in two varieties, a cube, and a 2-player value pack. The cube box version was the version sold in stores. It included the system, controller, an X-Men game disc, and 6 X-Men cards.  Two player value packs were sold online (but may have been liquidated in stores) and included an extra controller and 12 additional X-Men cards.[tpl]cite web|last=Fillip |first=Game |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IZZDAE |title=ConsoleHyperscan Video Game System: Toys & Games |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in León, Spain, Entertainment districts in Spain, Restaurant districts and streets, Visitor attractions in Castile and León

Barrio Húmedo is the nickname given to an old part of the city of León, Spain, that is concentrated within the largely intact Roman city walls. The translation is usually rendered as the wet district, a reference both to the large number of bars and clubs packed into a relatively small area and to the copious quantities of alcohol consumed inside them. The area is centered around the square called Plaza de San Martín, from where an intricate network of streets spreads out towards the newer parts of León. There are approximately between 100 and 150 bars and clubs within Barrio Húmedo.
The district is famous throughout Spain for both its density and intensity of bars and clubs and because of León's reputation for free tapas bars. The most common practice of those who visit the bars is to pub crawl (have one drink and then move on to the next bar).
Tapas are mostly served from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. At around 10:30 p.m., people sometimes start to have dinner in the restaurants that are often located inside the same tapas bars. These restaurants tend to specialize in traditional Leonese cuisine; there are a number of quite prestigious and famous ones.
Barrio Húmedo also features rock and heavy metal bars, glamorous nightclubs and Irish-style pubs. 
In 2004, the Chancellor of Germany at the time, Gerhard Schröder, was seen partying at a bar in Barrio Húmedo called La Abaceria with the current Prime Minister of Spain and León native José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. Since then, this bar is sometimes referred to as the Schröder Bar by some.

[[Counties and baronies in Finland]]
CATEGORIES: History of Finland, Finnish nobility

The creation and granting of counties and baronies in Finland began with the coronation of King Eric XIV in 1561 and continued through Great Reductions in the latter half of the 17th century. 
Eric XIV created two baronies in 1561, the barony of Arvasalo to Lars Fleming, who was later entitled to use the name of his manor, Sundholmen, as his barony, and the barony of Joensuu to Klas Kristersson Horn.
King John III is responsible for both the first granted barony, the barony of Viikki, to Klaus Eriksson Fleming in 1570 and the first granted county, the county of Raseborg, to baron Sten Eriksson of Grevsnes' widow and heirs in 1571.
King Sigismund recognized in 1594 Erik Bielke, the heir-general of late baron Lars Fleming, as baron without specifying a barony, and simultaneously his father (widower of baron Lars' heiress) and siblings. Much later, in Gustav II Adolf's reign, the same baron Erik was granted permission to use his own late father-in-law's (Klas Fleming's) barony of Wik as his and his wife's baronial title.
King Charles IX granted just one barony, the barony of Nynäs to Abraham Leijonhufvud, and Gustav II Adolf granted the county of Pärnu (in modern Estonia) to Frans Bernhard von Thurn, the barony of Kimito to Axel Oxenstierna and the barony of Tuutarhovi (in Ingria, now Tuutari) to Juhana Skytte.

Theaters equipped for Megasound had an additional battery of speakers, consisting subs and horns; usually all were placed on the stage,  behind the screen. This system also came along with extra power-amps and specialized processing equipment. Megasound selected soundtrack events with lots of low-frequency content (thuds, crashes, explosions, etc.)http://www.unexplainable.net/artman/publish/article_12418.shtml were directed to these speakers at very high-volume, creating a visceral-effect intended to thrill the audience. Megasound has been best remembered for its infrasonic rumble capability.
Megasound was similar to MCA/Universal's Sensurround. However, unlike Sensurround, Warner Bros. never attempted to market Megasound to other studios as a high-fidelity, high-impact bass enhancement sound system.

[[Ukrainian National Army]]
CATEGORIES: Military units and formations of World War II, Military history of Ukraine, Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Military units and formations established in 1945

Ukrainian National Army (UNA) was a World War II Ukrainian military group, created on March 17, 1945 in Weimar, Germany, and subordinate to Ukrainian National Committee. 
The army, formed on April 15, 1945, and commanded by General Pavlo Shandruk,  consisted of the following units:
Plans were made regarding the inclusion of the Ukrainian Freedom Army (120,000 soldiers), Kuban Cossacks and Georgian military divisions.
The primary purpose of creation of the Ukrainian National Army was to integrate all the Ukrainian units fighting the Soviets under a single command. The intended size of the army, encompassing all the Ukrainian units subordinate to Oberkommando des Heeres was 220,000. However within the two months left till the end of the war, Shandruk was able to gather about 50 thousand soldiers.
In reality, Shandruk was able to command only the 1. UNA Division and elements of the 2. UNA Division. On May 7, under his influence, the division located in western Austria by this time after slowly moving from Slovenia (February 1945), withdrew further from Red Army forces. The "Army" now split into several groups, with one heading towards Italian border and surrendering to the British Army's 15th Army Group and others moved toward the German and Swiss borders and surrendered to the US Army's 6th Army Group. The UNA soldiers were interned in northern Italy, in the area controlled by Polish II Corps forces. After the capitulation, Shandruk asked for a meeting with Polish general Władysław Anders in London, and asked him to protect the army against the deportation to Soviet Union. Despite the Soviet pressure, Anders managed to protect Ukrainian soldiers as the former citizens of the Second Republic of Poland. Shandruk and the bulk of his forces managed to remain in the west, with many of the former UNA soldiers joining the French Foreign Legion.
Other groups, splintered, either surrendered to the Soviet or the Western Allies, facing repatriation, with several hundred interned in Switzerland. 
The UNA had a bad relationship with general Andrei Vlasov's Russian Liberation Army (KONR) and was never subordinated to it.

Topsyturveydom (sometimes spelled Topsyturvydom or Topseyturveydom) is a one-act operetta by W. S. Gilbert with music by Alfred Cellier. Styled "an entirely original musical extravaganza", it is based on one of Gilbert's Bab Ballads, "My Dream". It opened on 21 March 1874 at the Criterion Theatre in London and ran until 17 April, for about 25 performances.Moss, Simon. "Topsyturveydom" at Gilbert & Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia, c20th.com, accessed 16 November 2009 This was the first work shown at the newly built Criterion, and it was played together with An American Lady, written and performed by Gilbert's friend, the dramatist and Fun magazine founder, Henry J. Byron. The musical score to Topsyturveydom does not survive, but amateur productions in recent decades have used newly composed scores or performed the work as a non-musical play.
Advertisements for the work spelled the title "Topsy­­turveydom", whereas the license copy of the libretto, filed with the Lord Chamberlain's office, and now held in the British Library, spells it "Topsy­turvydom". Topsy­­turveydom is set in a quasi-utopia (reminiscent of Gilbert's earlier Happy Arcadia (1872), or even Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels), where things are the opposite of the norm. Party politics is lampooned, much as it would be two decades later in Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited. As in that work, the king is a "detested" monarch. Gilbert also renews the idea of party politics working in a backwards way in Iolanthe, where the House of Lords is threatened with obsolescence by having its members selected by competitive examination.

[[Orzeł-class submarine]]

The ''Orzeł'' class was a short series of modern submarines built in Dutch shipyards for the Polish Navy in the 1930s. Initially the design was to be built in the United Kingdom, but the price proposed was too high and the British Admiralty announced that building a fast submarine with over [tpl]convert|20|kn|km/h|0[/tpl] of surface speed was technically impossible.MDK 2 - Okręt Lublin The two submarines were ordered in De Schelde and Rotterdamse Shipyards, the [tpl]ship|ORP|Orzeł[/tpl] (Eagle) and [tpl]ship|ORP|Sęp[/tpl] (Vulture) (four were initially planned). Design was made in cooperation with a team from Polish Navy, and incorporated some features of the earlier Dutch HNLMS O 16 including the external trainable mount. The hull were entirely welded, and all controls were hydraulically operated.Design was made to fulfill the Polish requirements for a multi-purpose vessel, to be used both on shallow waters of the Baltic Sea and in the high seas. They were among the most modern submersibles in the allied fleets at the outbreak of World War II. Their speed was [tpl]convert|19.5|kn|km/h|0[/tpl]. Project of this class of submarine was a basis for next Dutch O 19 class submarines.[tpl]cite book |title=Submarines: An Illustrated History of Their Impact (Weapons and Warfare)|last= Fontenoy|first= Paul E.|year= 2007|publisher= ABC CLIO|location= |isbn=1851095632|page=267[/tpl]
Orzeł was ordered in 1935 and commissioned in February 1939. On 14 September 1939 the Orzel and Wilk (Wolf) were ordered to make for British ports. Wilk arrived on 20 September 1939 and Orzeł arrived on 14 October 1939 (after an adventurous voyage with no charts). On 8 April 1940 Orzeł sank two large troop transports at the start of the German invasion of Norway. Orzeł was lost with all hands due to unknown reasons while on patrol in North Sea. Orzel loss is one of the biggest mysteries in Polish naval history.

[[Compounding]]

CATEGORIES: Health sciences, Pharmacology

Pharmaceutical compounding (done in compounding pharmacies) is the creation of a particular pharmaceutical product to fit the unique need of a patient.  To do this, compounding pharmacists combine or process appropriate ingredients using various tools.  This may be done for medically necessary reasons, such as to change the form of the medication from a solid pill to a liquid, to avoid a non-essential ingredient that the patient is allergic to, or to obtain the exact dose(s) needed or deemed best of particular active pharmaceutical ingredient(s).  It may also be done for more optional reasons, such as adding flavors to a medication or otherwise altering taste or texture.  Compounding is most routine in the case of intravenous/parenteral medication, typically by hospital pharmacists, but is also offered by privately owned compounding pharmacies and certain retail pharmacies for various forms of medication.  Whether routine or rare, intravenous or oral, etc., when a given drug product is made or modified to have characteristics that are specifically prescribed for an individual patient – it is known as "traditional" compounding.
Due to rising cost of compounding and shortage of drugs in recent times, many hospitals have shown a tendency to rely more upon large-scale compounding pharmacies to meet their regular requirement, particularly of sterile-injectable medications. When "compounding" is done on bulk production of a given formulation rather than patient-specific production, it is known as "non-traditional" compounding (which as discussed below, is arguably not "compounding" but rather "manufacturing"). This development raises concerns about safety and calls for proper regulatory control and monitoring.Grady, Denise; Pollack, Andrew and Tavernise, Sabrina (2012-10-07).

Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Directorate 14 was entrusted with oversight of the Challenge Project.  According to the Iraq Survey Group report:
 M14, directed by Muhammad Khudayr Sabah Al Dulaymi, was responsible for training and conducting special operations missions. It trained Iraqis, Palestinians, Syrians, Yemeni, Lebanese, Egyptian, and Sudanese operatives in counterterrorism, explosives, marksmanship, and foreign operations at its facilities at Salman Pak. Additionally, M14 oversaw the “Challenge Project,” a highly secretive project regarding explosives.

Located near the Mihai Vodă Monastery, on Dealul Spirii in Bucharest, it was built between 1775-1776 during the rule of Alexander Ypsilantis, and it meant to replace the old princely court at Curtea Veche.
Curtea Nouă was described as being in Byzantine style, having three floors, four staircases and three towers. The palace burnt to the ground in 1812 and became known as Curtea Arsă ("Burnt Court").
In the 20th century, archeologists discovered under the place where the palace stood two cellars and two secret passages.

Légende (1906) is a solo work for trumpet and piano, composed by George Enescu and premiered by Merri Franquin, professor of cornet at the Paris Conservatoire.[tpl]Clarify|date=September 2013[/tpl] It reflects the impressionistic style of Enescu's teachers Jules Massenet and Gabriel Fauré.[tpl]Cn|date=September 2013[/tpl] The title is an homage to Professor Franquin.[tpl]Clarify|date=September 2013[/tpl] The piece reflects an important step in the evolution of the trumpet from a more archaic limited instrument, to a fully chromatic and soloistic instrument.[tpl]Cn|date=September 2013[/tpl] The fact that Enescu found it unnecessary to specify "chromatic trumpet" or "trumpet in C" in the work's title (which might have been normal just a few years earlier) is seen as a testament to Franquin's influence (Shamu 2009, 1).
Légende's range extends from a low A-flat to a high C, with an ossia passage that extends only to high B-flat. The piece requires extensive triple tonguing and an unspecified mute.[tpl]Cn|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Légende is in the key of C minor, and begins with a simple lyrical melody which reappears twice. The second time, it is played during the climax in the higher octave, and in the muted conclusion, it appears again in the original low register. In between each statement of the melody are technical passages which require extensive triple tonguing and chromatic fingering. The piano accompaniment is chordal in the lyrical passages, and virtuosic in the technical sections, matching the difficulty of the trumpet part with extensive runs and arpeggios.[tpl]or|date=September 2013[/tpl] A simple listing of the performance indications which follow each other in the score indicates the constantly evolving character of the music: doux, grave, hésitante, pathétique, gracieux, mouvement agité, chantant, vif, furieusement, rêveur (Hoffmann and Raţiu. 1971, 328).

[[Optical black hole]]
CATEGORIES: Black holes

An optical black hole is a phenomenon in which slow light is passed through a Bose–Einstein condensate that is itself spinning faster than the local speed of light within to create a vortex capable of trapping the light behind an event horizon just as a gravitational black hole would.[tpl]cite web|last=Saswato|first=Das|title=Physicists Make Artificial Black Hole Using Optical Fiber|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/astrophysics/physicists-make-artificial-black-hole-using-optical-fiber|work=Aerospace|accessdate=5/4/12[/tpl]
Unlike other black hole analogs such as a sonic black hole in a Bose–Einstein condensate, a slow light black hole analog is not expected to mimic the quantum effects of a black hole, and thus not emit Hawking radiation. It does, however, mimic the classical properties of a gravitational black hole, making it potentially useful in studying other properties of black holes.W.G. Unruh and R. Schützhold, "On Slow Light as a Black Hole Analogue", Phys. Rev. D 68, 024008 arXiv:gr-qc/0303028v2 (2003). More recently, some physicists have developed a fiber optic based system which they believe will emit Hawking radiation.T. G. Philbin et al., Science 319, 1367 arXiv:0711.4796v2 gr-qc (2008)

Giordano d'Anglano (or Giordano d'Agliano), sometimes Jordan Lancia or Lanzia (died 1267) was an Italo-Swabian count and soldier, who served as marshal to Manfred of Sicily and acted as his commander in the wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines in Tuscany.
He was originally from Piedmont and was cousin to Manfred through the latter's mother, Bianca Lancia. He was a loyal servant to Manfred, who gave him a county in Apulia.
In 1260, Jordan was sent by Manfred with some hundreds of German knights  as vicar-general and captain of Tuscany at the request of the Commune of Siena. Meeting with the leaders of the allied towns of Arezzo and Pisa at Empoli, Jordan was convinced by Farinata degli Uberti not to attack Florence itself, Siena's chief enemy and a centre of Guelph power. On 4 September, the Sienese army, depending largely on the German mercenaries, met the Florentine on a hill outside Siena in the Battle of Montaperti. Jordan and his cavalry led the second charge. Jordan followed up this victory by quickly snatching Florence itself, though once again Farinata intervened to prevent the razing of the city walls. He established Guido Novello as podestà and returned with his mercenaries after their paid service of three and a half months.
After the Battle of Tagliacozzo, Jordan was one of the captured who fell into the hands of Charles of Anjou. He was stripped of his eyes, a hand and a foot, and imprisoned in a jail in Brolo where he spent his days until he was decapitated. Brunetto Latini's Il Tesoro portrays Jordan wishing rather to die than endure further mutilation and then talking to his own severed hand, which, the encyclopaedist points out, dubbed many knights in its day.

CATEGORIES: Freddie Mercury albums, 1992 compilation albums, Compilation albums published posthumously, Hollywood Records compilation albums

The Great Pretender is the US version of Freddie Mercury's posthumous solo project, to observe the anniversary of his death. There were numerous producers who had permission from Jim Beach to use the original master tapes. Reinhold Mack, who is not credited as being involved, was hired to oversee the project. The album was released by Hollywood Records on 24 November 1992. 
The album differs from its UK counterpart (aside from a slightly different running order) by replacing the original versions of "The Great Pretender" and "Love Kills" with remixes, featuring a slightly altered ending of the "Mr. Bad Guy" remix, and replacing "Barcelona" with a remix of "My Love Is Dangerous".

The Jaffna lagoon massacre  or Kilaly massacre  occurred on January 2, 1993,  when a Sri Lankan Navy Motor Gun Boat and a number of smaller speed boats intercepted a number of  boats transporting people between the south and north shores of the Jaffna Lagoon in the Northern province in Sri Lanka, and attacked them under the glare of a spot light. The estimated number of deaths range from thirty five (35) to one hundred (100). However, only fourteen (14) bodies were recovered.

[[Naval ram]]

CATEGORIES: Naval weapons

A ram was a weapon carried by varied types of ships, dating back to antiquity. The weapon comprised an underwater prolongation of the bow of the ship to form an armoured beak, usually between six and 12 feet (2–4 m) in length. This would be driven into the hull of an enemy ship in order to puncture the hull and sink, or at least disable, that ship.

[[Biodemography]]

CATEGORIES: Demography

Biodemography is the science dealing with the integration of biology and demography.
Biodemography is a new branch of human (classical) demography concerned with understanding the complementary biological and demographic determinants of and interactions between the birth and death processes that shape individuals, cohorts and populations. The biological component brings human demography under the unifying theoretical umbrella of evolution, and the demographic component provides an analytical foundation for many of the principles upon which evolutionary theory rests including fitness, selection, structure, and change.  Whereas biodemographers are concerned with birth and death processes as they relate to populations in general and to humans in particular, population biologists specializing in life history theory are interested in these processes only insofar as they relate to fitness and evolution.  
Traditionally, evolutionary biologists seldom focused on older, post-reproductives because these individuals (it is typically argued) do not contribute to fitness. In contrast, biodemographers embraced research programs expressly designed to study individuals at ages beyond their reproductive years because information on these age classes will shed important light on longevity and aging.  The biological and demographic components of biodemography are not hierarchical but reciprocal in that both are primary windows on the world and are thus synergistic, complementary and mutually informing.  
However, there has been much more synthesis between the approaches to demographic research in recent years, such that collaboration between evolutionary, ecology and demographic researchers is increasingly common. An example of this is the "Evolutionary Demography Society", formed in 2012/2013 to increase opportunities for inter and multidisciplinary approaches to understanding how life history and ageing are related and lead to different population demographics.
Biodemography is unique in two respects.  First, it is one of a small number of key subdisciplines arising from the social sciences that has embraced biology such as evolutionary psychology and neuroeconomics.  However, unlike the others which focus more narrowly on biological sub-areas (neurology) or concepts (evolution), biodemography has no explicit biological boundaries.  As a consequence, it is a more all-encompassing interdisciplinary concept, but maintains deep biological roots.  Second, the hierarchical organizations that are inherent to both biology (cell, organ, individual) and demography (individual cohort, population) form a chain in which the individual serves as the link between the lower mechanistic levels, and the higher functional levels.  
Biodemography is therefore ideally suited – serving as a “looking glass” -  to complement, engage and inform research on human aging through theory building using mathematical and statistical modeling, hypothesis testing using experimental methods, and coherence-seeking using genetics and evolutionary concepts.

[[Druk]]

CATEGORIES: Dragons, National symbols of Bhutan

The Druk ([tpl]lang-dz|འབྲུག་[/tpl]) is the "Thunder Dragon" of Bhutanese mythology and a Bhutanese national symbol. A druk appears on the Bhutanese flag, holding jewels to represent wealth. In the Dzongkha language, Bhutan is called Druk Yul, or Land of Druk, and Bhutanese leaders are called Druk Gyalpo, Dragon Kings. During the Bhutanese mock election in 2007, all four mock parties were called the Druk colour Party.Every party had a separate colour representing its values. The national anthem of Bhutan, Druk tsendhen, translates into English as "The Kingdom of Druk".
The druk (also known as a "duk" or "dug") was adopted as an emblem by the Dugpa sect, which originated in Tibet and spread to Bhutan.  According to traditional accounts, when the sect's founder, the Lama Chodje Tsangpa Gyarespa, began to build the Ralung monastery, there was a violent storm.  Thunder, or the "Cloud-Voice," is seen as the roar of the dragon.[tpl]cite book|last=Waddell|first=Laurence|title=The Buddhism of Tibet Or Lamaism|year=1895|pages=199|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7PYwcfE_bLUC&pg=PA199&dq=Bhutan+thunder+dug&hl=en&sa=X&ei=A2zEUpeyKcrEoASe5YCwBw&ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Bhutan%20thunder%20dug&f=false[/tpl]  Deciding that this was an omen, he named the monastery Dug-Ralung, adding the word "thunder dragon" to the name.

Hans Vogel (February 16, 1881, Oberartelshofen, Middle Franconia - October 6, 1945) was a German politician and chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) along with Arthur Crispien and Otto Wels from 1931 to 1933. After the NSDAP came to power in 1933, he became one of the leaders of the social democratic exile organization Sopade.
After attending the Volkshochschule in Fürth, Vogel, the son of a merchant and shoemaker, completed an apprenticeship as a wood sculptor assistant in 1897. He joined the trade union for wood sculptors as early as 1897 and worked in various parts of Germany. He was board member of a Social Democratic electoral association in Fürth from 1907 to 1911. From 1908, Vogel worked as secretary of the party in the region of Franconia. From 1912 to 1918 he was a member of the Bavarian Landtag. He supported the Burgfrieden politics of his party, i.e. support for the German war effort and giving up the anti-militarist stance at the beginning of World War I, because he viewed this as his patriotic duty. He served in World War I as a radio operator in the 105th Division.
After the war and the German revolution, Vogel was a member of the German National Assembly, which wrote the Weimar Constitution. He would remain a member of the Reichstag until June 1933. After becoming a member of the caucus of the SPD in 1920, he was elected secretary of the party in 1927. In 1931, he became chairman along with Arthur Crispien and Otto Wels.
After the Machtergreifung in January 1933, Vogel first went to Saarbrücken, because it was administrated by the League of Nations at that time and then on June 2, he moved on to Prague.  In 1938 he moved to Paris and there he helped build up the Sopade, of which he was the sole chairman after Wels's death in 1939.
His death in October 1945 meant that he was not able to help with re-building the SPD. Hans-Vogel-Straße, a street in Fürth, is named after him.Map link to Hans-Vogel-Straße, 90765 Fürth, Germany Google Maps. Retrieved July 20, 2010

Festus is author of the historical work known as Breviarium rerum gestarum populi Romani. It was completed about 379 AD.
Breviarium covers all history of the Roman state from foundation of the City till 369 AD. The book consists of 30 small parts, that's why events of Roman history are described very briefly. Festus is mainly focused on political and (especially) military history of Rome.

Sound 360 was the name of a motion picture sound system used by 20th Century-Fox to enhance the premiere engagements of their 1977 feature Damnation Alley.http://spannerworks.net/reference/10_3a.asp
The format employed the standard 35mm magnetic stereo soundtracks (left, center, right and surround) in a unique configuration. The center channel was directed to the usual behind-the-screen loudspeaker. The left and right channels were redirected to a pair of large full-range speakers mounted on either side of the auditorium. The surround channel was reproduced by a single full-range speaker mounted in the back. The general effect was more enveloping (and often much louder) than a standard 35mm stereo presentation, and very similar to the Megasound process unveiled a few years later by Warner Bros. for the film Altered States.   In addition to Damnation Alley, the film Damien: Omen II was also released in the Sound 360 process.
The 2011 DVD and Blu-ray release of Damnation Alley did not feature a "Sound 360" audio option, as the original elements were not salvageable.

The Main Street Armory is a multi-purpose arena located at 900 East Main Street in Rochester, New York. The Armory was built in 1905 by the United States Army and used for the training and processing of soldiers. Its main arena also hosted several non-military events, including high school basketball, circuses, and auto shows prior to the mid-1950s. In 1990, the New York National Guard left the facility, leaving it vacant and allowing it to fall into disrepair. It was purchased and renovated in the mid-2000s with the intention of refurbishing the Armory's main arena to hold events once again. The building opened for this purpose on February 3, 2007.
It is currently the home of the Rochester Raiders of American Indoor Football. It was the home of the Rochester Centrals of the American Basketball League from 1925 to 1931, the Rochester Iroquois lacrosse team, and was the home of Next Era Wrestling from 2007-2008 until they moved across the street to the Rochester Auditorium Center.

Sail Rock, or Parus Rock ([tpl]lang-ru|скала́ Па́рус[/tpl], Skala Parus), is a natural sandstone monolith of late Cretaceous ageSail Rock at Praskoveyevka Environments located on the shore of the Black Sea, in Krasnodar Krai, Russia. It resembles the outline of a ship's sail, hence its name.
The monolith lies 17 km to the southeast of Gelendzhik, near the village of Praskoveyevka (which is about 500 m from the coast) and the farmstead of Dzhankhot (approximately twice that distance from the coast). Sail Rock has a sheer vertical slope confronting the shore of the sea, isolated from the mass of basic rock by geological forces. It is more than three-fourths revealed by the tide and lies perpendicular to the coast. What is most remarkable about this landmark is its proportions. While the cliff is only a little more than one metre thick, its height is about 25 m and its length about 20.  Thus, the form of the cliff is described as resembling the outline of a quadrangular sail.
An opening of unclear origin is located in the sail, approximatively 2.5 metres above the ground. Many guides state that the formation was a defence against mountain artillery during the Caucasian War. However, this version of the origin of the opening is under some doubt. In 1903, S. Vasyukov, who was investigating the Black Sea coast, wrote after the inspection of the cliff that it was ".. shot from a battleship by seamen, they released 4 projectiles, but the wall remained firm, although the traces are noticeable, but they nowhere opened the rock ...".
The appearance of this unique formation is explained by the pounding of the sea on the land (erosion), as well as the different strengths of its constituent rocks.
Sail Rock's status as a natural monument was declared November 24, 1971 by the administration of Gelendzhik. Protection of the rock was entrusted to the Divnomorskiy rural council. The surrounding beach and its environs are a place for outdoor leisure and recreation, including nearby health resorts.

Henry was born in Cahore, Draperstown, County Londonderry, the son of prosperous Roman Catholic businessman. He was educated at Marist College, Dundalk, Mount St Mary's College, Chesterfield (a Jesuit foundation) and Queen's College, Belfast, where he won every law scholarship open to a student and many other prizes and exhibitions. In 1885, he was called to the Irish Bar.
During the general election campaign of 1895, Henry spoke in support of unionist candidates in two constituencies: Thomas Lea in South Londonderry, Henry's native constituency, and E. T. Herdman in East Donegal.
Henry's legal career flourished - he became Queen's Counsel in 1896, a Bencher of the King's Inns in 1898 and ultimately Father of the North-West Circuit - but his interest in politics did not diminish. By March 1905, he was a delegate at the inaugural meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council and the Unionist Parliamentary candidate for the ultra-marginal North Tyrone seat, which he lost by seven votes in a 1907 by-election.
On 23 May 1916, in the first by-election to be held in Ireland after the Easter rebellion, he was elected MP for South Londonderry. The rebellion had had no discernible impact on the contest.
In November 1918, he became Solicitor-General for Ireland and in July 1919, Attorney General for Ireland. He later served as the first Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland from 1921 to 1925. In 1923, he was created a Baronet, of Cahore in the County of Londonderry.
He married Violet Holmes, daughter of Hugh Holmes, judge of the Irish Court of Appeal. They had five children, including James Holmes Henry, who succeeded as second baronet.
He died in 1925, aged 61, and was buried near his native Draperstown.

Antonio Ponce de Santa Cruz (1561–1632) was the court physician in the royal courts of Philip III and Philip IV. Antonio was the son of Alonzo de Santa Cruz (1505–1567), a famous Spanish cartographer, instrument maker and historian. 
Antonio was also a university professor at the University of Valladolid and a  clergyman. He was interested in lycanthropy, free will, and the role of love in causing madness. As an expert on mental illnesses, he was charged with treatment of Prince Carlos.  
He published his father Alonzo's book Dignotio et cura affectuum melancholicorum (Diagnóstico y tratamiento de las afecciones de los melancólicos) about the diagnosis and treatment of melancholy posthumously in 1622.
He published the first Spanish treatise on epilepsy in 1631, Praelections Valliosoletanae. 
Some have suggested that Antonio was friendly with Miguel de Cervantes, given their mutual interests and similarities in the condition described in Cervantes' book El Licenciado Vidriera (the lawyer of glass), and those in Antonio's book on melancholy.

Žmuidzinavičius Museum, commonly known as the Devils' Museum ([tpl]lang-lt|Velnių muziejus[/tpl]), is a museum in Kaunas, Lithuania, dedicated to collecting and exhibiting sculptures and carvings of devils from all over the world. As of 2009, its holdings encompass about 3,000 exhibits. The collection was initiated by painter Antanas Žmuidzinavičius (1876–1966). A memorial museum was established in his house after his death. At the time the devil collection had only 260 sculptures. As the collection grew, enriched by a number of gifts presented to the museum by its visitors, a separate three-storey extension was built in 1982. The devils, collected from different cultures, are diverse: some are just works of art, while others are incorporated into useful objects, some represent folk myths, while others express modern political ideas. For example, one sculpture depicts Hitler and Stalin as devils in a dance of death over a playground littered with human bones.

Pseudotachylite or Pseudotachylyte is a cohesive glassy or very fine-grained fault rock that is composed of an extremely fine-grained or glassy matrix that often contains inclusions of wall-rock fragments. Pseudotachylite characteristically occurs in veins; is dark in color; and is glassy in appearance. It often has the appearance of the basaltic glass, tachylyte. Typically, the glass has been completely devitrified into very fine-grained material with radial and concentric clusters of crystals. It occasionally contains crystals with quench textures that began to crystallize from the melt.Maddock, R.H. (1983) Melt origin of fault-generated pseudotachylites demonstrated by textures.

Natalie Allyn Sleeth (née Wakeley) (October 29, 1930 – March 21, 1992) was an American composer.Natalie Sleeth biography at Hope Publishing Co. site, accessed December 9, 2013
Sleeth was born in Evanston, Illinois. In 1934, she began to study the piano at the early age of four. In 1952, she received an Academic major in music theory and a BA in music theory at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She married a Professor of Homiletics, Reverend Ronald E. Sleeth. In her later life she received an honorary doctorate from West Virginia Wesleyan College in 1959, and from Nebraska Wesleyan College in 1990. An organist, she wrote over 180 highly successful selections for church and school.
One of Sleeth's best-known anthems for choir is entitled "Joy in the Morning" and was written for the West Virginia Wesleyan College concert chorale on the occasion of her husband's inauguration as the president of West Virginia Wesleyan College in 1977. 
Another favorite, sung widely in the United Church of Canada is "In the Bulb There is a Flower".  This was composed as an anthem and dedicated to Ronald, who was diagnosed with cancer very soon after its composition.  It was written for the Pasadena Community Church, St. Petersburg FL, conducted by C. Frederick Harrison, and first performed by their choirs in March 1985.  It was also performed at Ronald's funeral, the only song of hers to be performed for that occasion at his request.  It appears as hymn #703 in the United Church of Canada hymnal, Voices United (Toronto:  The United Church Publishing House, 1996). It also appears as hymn #707 under the title "Hymn of Promise" in the United Methodist Hymnal (Nashville, TN: The United Methodist Publishing House, 1989). Translated into German by Lothar Pöll in 1999 this hymn is part of the "Gesangbuch der Evangelisch-methodistischen Kirche" (Stuttgart / Zürich / Wien: Medienwerk der EmK, 2002, #661).Karl-Heinz Baum: "Aus der Zwiebel wird die Blume"
Sleeth died of cancer in Denver, Co, in 1992. She was a member of the Highland Park United Methodist Church in Dallas, TX.

Panoche Valley grasslands are frequented by a variety of bird species of special interest, including Golden Eagle, Mountain Plover, Ferruginous Hawk, Prairie Falcon, Merlin, Mountain Bluebird, Loggerhead Shrike, Burrowing Owl, and Long-billed Curlew. The valley provides critical habitat, especially in winter, for these birds. Mammals in the area include three federally endangered species; the San Joaquin Kit Fox, Giant Kangaroo Rat, and Nelson's Antelope Squirrel. American Badger is also native to the valley. Endangered reptiles in the valley includes Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizard.
There is only one place in the entire world named Panoche, making it unique among the world's place names. It is thought that the name Panoche is derived from the local Indian word for a species of cane that once grew in the valley from which the Indians extracted panoche, a kind of sugar. It is believed that this is the origin for the name panocha, a popular Mexican and Filipino sugar (though processed somewhat differently from each other), and a pudding eaten during Lent in New Mexico and Southern Colorado.Three Rocks Report, Three Rocks Research, April 2006.

[[John Goss Special]]

CATEGORIES: Ford Falcon, Muscle cars, Coupes, Cars of Australia, 1970s automobiles, Rear-wheel-drive vehicles, Vehicles introduced in 1975

The John Goss Special was a limited edition of the Ford Falcon released by Ford Australia in August 1975 to commemorate John Goss' win in the prestigious Bathurst 1000 endurance race the previous year.
The car was based on the XB Falcon 500 Hardtop and featured a 302 in³ (4.9 L) Cleveland V8, and some specific options including the GS Rally Pack which featured full dash instrumentation, a 3-spoke steering wheel, vented bonnet (hood) with locking pins, and 12-slot steel road wheels. A separate item featured on all John Goss Special hardtops were the cosmetic side body vents that were also a feature of contemporary Falcon GT hardtops.
The John Goss Special cars were available in a choice of two accent colours, Apollo Blue metallic or Emerald Fire (green) metallic, offset against the predominant body colour of Polar White. The metallic paint (specified on the cars' compliance plates) covered the bonnet, engine bay, chassis, and feature sections on the 'A' pillar and waistline, as well as the lower sill sections and the rear feature panel between the tail-lights. Unlike other GS Rally Pack cars, the road wheels were painted in complementary Polar White, as were the bumper bars and the front grille assembly. Interior trim was mandatory white vinyl, contrasted against a black dashboard and mandatory black floor carpet.
A factory Dealer Bulletin (dated 30 July 1975) released to Ford dealers stated that all "minor Falcon 500 options" were available to order on the John Goss Special, and there is evidence of some cars featuring a Limited Slip Differential. The 302ci V8 was the only available engine, but this could be had with either a 4-speed manual or 3-speed automatic floor-mounted transmission. A central floor Sports Console was a specified mandatory option, as was Sports Handling Suspension with 185 section steel-belted radial tyres.
Some Ford dealers such as McLeod Ford in Sydney (well-known at the time for their Horn cars) chose to add accessories such as front and rear spoilers, and/or to modify the interior seating to feature colourful cloth or vinyl inserts. 
Exactly how many John Goss Special cars were built remains unknown, as Ford never released actual production figures, and the cars are recorded collectively in the official records as Falcon 500 Hardtop builds. However, amongst surviving JGS cars, it is clear that the build dates span July 1975 to November 1975 inclusive. Estimates recorded in the general media place their numbers anywhere between 260 and 800, with Sports Car World magazine (December 1975) suggesting that Ford made an initial build of 400 units that sold out quickly and that a second run of cars was then commenced. Motor Manual magazine (January 1976) also mentions the situation of a second build run. Regardless of the uncertainty of actual numbers, the John Goss Special has become popular among 'Australian muscle car' collectors despite not gaining the press or publicity of other limited edition Falcon cars such as the GT-HO (1969-1971) and the Cobra (1978).

[[Stenohaline]]

CATEGORIES: Aquatic ecology

Stenohaline describes an organism, usually fish, that cannot tolerate a wide fluctuation in the salinity of water.Wurts, W. Why can some fish live in freshwater, some in salt water, and some in both? World Aquaculture 29(1):p.65. Stenohaline is derived from the words: "steno" meaning narrow, and "haline" meaning salt.  Many fresh water fish, such as goldfish (Carassius auratus), tend to be stenohaline and die in environments of high salinity such as the ocean. Many marine fish, such as haddock, are also stenohaline and die in water with lower salinity.  
Alternatively, fish living in coastal estuaries and tide pools are often euryhaline (tolerant to changes in salinity) as are many species which have life cycle requiring tolerance to both fresh water and seawater environments such as salmon and herring.

Thomas III of Saluzzo ([tpl]lang-it|Tommaso III di Saluzzo[/tpl]) (1356–1416) was Marquess of Saluzzo from 1396 until his death.
He was born in Saluzzo in north-western Italy to Frederick II del Vasto and Beatrice of Geneva. His maternal grandfather was Hugh of Geneva, Lord of Gex, Anthon and Varey.
He tried to continue the philo-French politics of his father, mainly to face the menace of Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy, who aimed to conquer the whole Piedmont. In fact, the treaty stating the nominal submission to France was signed by Thomas well before his father's death.
The vassallage to French was also a consequence of the education received by Thomas, who lived in Provence for much of his youth, and travelled there in 1375, 1389, 1401, 1403 and 1405. He was married to the French Marguerite of Roussy.
In 1394 he was captured by Savoyard troops while he was leading a ravage in Monasterolo. Imprisoned first in Savigliano and then in Turin, he was freed only two years later after a ransom of 20,000 golden florins had been paid.
In his late years Thomas assigned the succession to his young son Ludovico, under the regence of his brother Valerano and the marquesses Marguerite.

Madeline Levine, Ph. D., is a practicing psychologist in Marin County, California.  She is the author of four books: Viewing Violence published in 1996, See No Evil: A Guide to Protecting Our Children from Media Violence published in 1998, The Price of Privilege: how parental pressure and material advantage are creating a generation of disconnected and unhappy kids published in 2006, and "Teach your Children Well" published in 2012.  The first two books represent an analysis of the negative effects of media violence on child development.  Her third book The Price of Privilege is a study of the psychological ailments plaguing teens from affluent families.  The Price of Privilege is based not only on her 25 years of experience in treating such teens within Marin County (an affluent community within the San Francisco Bay Area) but also on her consultations with colleagues around the United States—particularly research psychologist Suniya S. Luthar -- as well as her review of the contemporary psychological research on the subject. "Teach Your Children Well" is marketed as "a toolbox for parents, providing information, relevant research and a series of exercises to help parents clarify a definition of success that is in line with their own values as well as their children’s interests and abilities."

HLA DR3-DQ2 is double serotype that specifically recognizes cells from individuals who carry a multigene HLA DR, DQ haplotype.
Certain HLA DR and DQ genes have known involvement
in autoimmune diseases. DR3-DQ2, a multigene 
haplotype, stands out in prominence because it is a factor in several prominent diseases, namely coeliac disease and juvenile diabetes.  In coeliac disease, the DR3-DQ2 haplotype is associated with highest risk for disease in first degree relatives, highest risk is conferred by DQA1*0501:DQB1*0201 homozygotes and semihomozygotes of DQ2, and represents the overwhelming majority of risk. HLA DR3-DQ2 encodes DQ2.5cis isoform of HLA-DQ, this isoform is described frequently as 'the DQ2 isoform', but in actuality there are two major DQ2 isoform. The DQ2.5 isoform, however, is many times more frequently associated with autoimmune disease, and as a result to contribution of DQ2.2 is often ignored.
The frequency of both diseases changes with respect to both the environment (diet) and the frequency of the DR3-DQ2. With coeliac disease risk is increased with the consumption of Triticeae glutens, and this also increases risk in juvenile diabetes whereas other cereals also appear to play a role. More importantly the risk of disease is greatest in homozygotes and linear increases in haplotype resulting in several fold increases of disease risk. This increased risk is most prominent in a rare cancer, enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma. HLA-DR3-DQ2 is found in HLA A1-B8-DR3-DQ2  haplotype in  Northern Europeans (including the British Ilse, Ireland, Iceland).

Fritz Alexander Ernst Noether (October 7, 1884 in Erlangen – September 10, 1941 in Orel, Russia) was a German-born mathematician.
Fritz Noether's father Max Noether was a mathematician and professor in Erlangen. The notable mathematician Emmy Noether was his elder sister; the mathematician Gottfried Noether was his son.
Fritz Noether was also an able mathematician. Not allowed to work in Germany for being a Jew, he moved to the Soviet Union, where he was appointed to a professorship at the University of Tomsk. In November 1937, during the Great Purge, he was arrested at his home in Tomsk by the NKVD and sentenced to a 25-year imprisonment for being a "German spy". While in prison, he was accused of "anti-Soviet propaganda", sentenced to death, and shot.
In 1988 the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union decided that he had not been guilty of any crime.

[[Provisional stamp]]
CATEGORIES: Postage stamps, Postal system, Philatelic terminology

Linn's World Stamp AlmanacDonna O'Keefe Houseman, editor; Linn's World Stamp Almanac, Millennium (6th) Edition. ISBN 978-0-940403-85-7 defines a provisional stamp as "a postage stamp issued for temporary use to meet postal demands until new or regular stocks of stamps can be obtained."Rick Miller, "Lines of stamp classifications have blurred", 20030414
The issuance of provisional stamps might be occasioned by a change in name or government, by occupation of foreign territory, by a change in postal rates, by a change of currency, or by the need to provide stamps that are in short supply.  An interesting example of issuing provisional stamps occurred during the Spanish-American war when supplies of stamps were low and the U.S. had occupation forces in Cuba.  They are known as the "Puerto Principe" provisional stamps of 1898-1899.  Over 40 different combinations of overprinted valuations and underlying Spanish Cuban stamps were produced under the auspices of the military forces over a three-week period from December 19, 1898 to January 11, 1899.Edifil; Catálogo Especializado de Sellos de Cuba, Tomo I (1855-1958), 2nd Ed.; Madrid, 2002 (in Spanish). ISSN 84-95019-08-6  These were replaced by another provisional set produced by overprinting U.S. stamps in the United States for Cuba.  This second set of provisional stamps was sold for about eight months before the U.S. could print Cuban stamps.  The U.S. civilian provisionals also included overprinted postal cards and stamped envelopes.Krieger, George T.; The Postal Stationery of the Possessions and Administrative Areas of the United States of America; United Postal Stationery Society, 2009, ISBN 978-0-9800112-3-4.

[[Elmore delay]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic engineering, Electronic design, Electronic design automation, Integrated circuits

Elmore delay is a simple approximation to the delay through an RC network in an electronic system.  It is often used in applications such as logic synthesis, delay calculation, static timing analysis, placement and routing, since it is simple to compute (especially in tree structured networks,  which are the vast majority of signal nets within ICs) and is reasonably accurate.  Even where it is not accurate, it is usually faithful, in the sense that reducing the Elmore delay will almost always reduce the true delay, so it is still useful in optimization.
Elmore delay can be thought of in several ways, all mathematically identical.
There are many extensions to Elmore delay.  It can be extended to upper and lower bounds, to include inductance as well as R and C, to be more accurate (higher order approximations) and so on.  See delay calculation for more details and references.

Nicholas Tooley (c. 1583 – June 1623) was a Renaissance actor in the King's Men, the acting company of William Shakespeare.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, pp. 346-7.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964, Baltimore, Pengiin, 1964; p. 498.
Recent research has shown that Tooley was born in late 1582 or early 1583; his birth name was not Tooley but Wilkinson. (In 1623 he signed a codicil to his last will and testament "Nicholas Wilkinson, alias Tooley.")Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Other Persons Associated with the Public Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 374-5. He has been associated with the "Nick" in the surviving "plot" of The Seven Deadly Sins, dated c. 1591. The association, if accurate, indicates that he began as a boy player. He was apprenticed to Richard Burbage, and may have followed that actor to the Lord Chamberlain's Men when that company re-formed in 1594. Tooley is mentioned in a letter of Joan Alleyn, Edward Alleyn's wife, in 1603, and he received a 20-shilling bequest in Augustine Phillips's 1605 will. He became a sharer in the King's Men in 1605, replacing the short-lived Samuel Crosse.
Little is known about Tooley's specific roles for the company. He appears in speech prefixes in the First Folio text of The Taming of the Shrew, and in the cast lists for Ben Jonson's The Alchemist (1610), Sejanus (the 1610 revival), and Catiline (1611). In the revival of John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi staged shortly before his death, he played Forobosco and a madman. In the 25 cast lists added to the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679, Tooley is mentioned in 14, those for:
His total is lower than those of company stars like Joseph Taylor and John Lowin, but greater than those for most of the King's men's supporting players; Tooley was clearly a significant member of the company.
(The manuscript of the 1619 play Sir John van Olden Barnavelt indiactes that Barnavelt's wife was played by an actor called "Nick." Early critics tended to identify this "Nick" as Tooley, though it may have been Nick Underwood or another unknown player. The question impinges upon the long-debated issue of whether women's roles in English Renaissance drama were filled exclusively by boys, or sometimes by adult actors like Tooley.)
Tooley witnessed Richard Burbage's will in 1619. In his own will of 3 June 1623, Tooley names Henry Condell and Cuthbert Burbage as his executors and residuary legatees. The bequests in Tooley's will are interesting for the light they throw on the actors of the King's Men, and the close relationship Tooley shared with the Burbage family. Those bequests include:
Tooley forgives the debts owed to him by William Ecclestone and John Underwood, two more members of the King's Men company. He was buried at St. Giles Church, Cripplegate, on 5 June 1623.

Jacques-François de Monbeton de Brouillan (1651, Gascony – September 22, 1705 at Chedabouctou, Acadia) French military officer and Governor of Plaisance (Placentia), Newfoundland (1689-1701) and Acadia (1701-1705).
Monbeton de Brouillan was born to a Protestant noblemen at Gascony and while serving as captain of the French forces in French Canada had renounced Protestantism and was baptized a Roman Catholic at Québec in 1687. In 1689 he returned to France and became governor of Plaisance on June 1, 1690. While at Plaisance Monbeton de Brouillan defended the settlement three times against British attacks, in 1691, 1692 and 1693. During a visit to France in 1695 he was instructed to team up with Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. During the winter of 1696-1697, with troops in the command of d'Iberville, Mombeton de Brouillan they attacked, captured and burned St. John's.
With the death of Joseph Robineau de Villebon, the governor of Acadia in 1700, Monbeton de Brouillan was given command of the government there in 1701 although the actual title of governor was not given until 1702. His poor health was evident during this period and he died in 1705.
He appears to have been an effective governor both at Placentia and at Port-Royal. His organization of defences in these two posts was notable. He also promoted the economic growth of Acadia by developing the fisheries, logging the forests, and building ships.

That history of the airport dates back to 1921 when The Commercial Club of Fort Pierce built an airport where the local American Legion building now stands on U.S. Route 1 for an airline that never got off the ground.  Nine years later, the county purchased [tpl]convert|1600|acre|km2[/tpl] of land that eventually became the current airport; however the first commercial airport was dedicated in 1935 in an area in the vicinity of U.S. Route 1 and Edwards Road.
The current airport, originally named Fort Pierce Airport, was leased during World War II by the U.S. Navy as an auxiliary field for pilots and flight crews from Naval Air Station Vero Beach, Naval Air Station Melbourne and Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale for conducting daytime and nighttime field carrier landing practice (FCLP) prior to landing on actual aircraft carriers. Scout aircraft, dive bombers and torpedo attack bombers utilized the runways, which were redesigned by the military to better accommodate naval aviation training requirements.  In 1947, the Navy disestablished operations and the U.S. Government conveyed the airport back to the county, to include two newly constructed runways, without charging for the improvements made.http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/dec/17/st-lucie-airport-pays-tribute-to-countys/
With little financial capital in county government to operate and maintain a modern airport, the facility languished for the next ten years, becoming overgrown with vegetation and subject to frequent grazing by cattle from nearby farms and ranches.  During the 1960s and 1970s, major improvements took off with the construction of an airport terminal, modern hangars, airfield lighting, navigational aids and fuel facilities. Curtis King, who became the first full-time director in 1967, played an instrumental role in the development of the county's airport for 31 years.http://www.co.st-lucie.fl.us/media/5301.htm
The airport continued to evolve as a general aviation facility, and even though two of four runways were decommissioned, one such former runway became the site of the Airport West Commerce Park, while Runway 9/27 was lengthened and improved.
Runway 10L-28R was completed early 2010 costing $15.3 million, the runway currently has no taxiways to parking therefore making it designated for touch and go operations.

[[Shock mount]]
CATEGORIES: Microphones

In a variety of applications, a shock mount is a mechanical fastener that connects two parts elastically.
The main part of the shock mount is the elastic frame on the exterior.
This helps reduce noise from the surrounding area, without affecting the sound of the microphone.
Shock mounts are commonly used on studio microphones to prevent unwanted noise.  The shock mount is used to partially isolate the mic from vibrations that might otherwise be transmitted through the mic stand, causing unwanted sounds to be added to the output signal.
In order to avoid microphonism, particularly in the input stages of high-gain amplifiers, design engineers used to shock-mount the tube-socket assemblies in these stages by means of small rubber grommets placed in the screw holes, leaving them in a "floating" situation.[tpl]cite book|author1=Granino Arthur Korn|author2=Theresa M.

Milan players, Juventus F.C. players, Serie A footballers, Footballers at the 1960 Summer Olympics, Olympic footballers of Italy

Sandro Salvadore (29 November 1939 – 4 January 2007) was an Italian footballer.
Born Milan, Lombardy, Sandro Salvadore was picked up by A.C. Milan’s scouts when he was 15, and played in their junior team until he made his debut in Serie A in the 1958/59 season aged 20. While wearing AC Milan’s number 6 shirt he won 2 League titles (1958–59 and 1961–62). He left Milan after 72 league matches.
In 1962 Salvadore was purchased by Juventus and became soon a pillar of their defence. After only a few games he fully established himself as a first choice Libero, winning three more League titles (1966–67, 1971–72 and 1972–73) and one Italy’s Cup (1964–65). Salvadore was also the captain of Juventus when they finished as runners-up in the 1972–73 European Cup final and the 1973 Intercontinental Cup final.
He retired in 1974 and was replaced by Gaetano Scirea in the famous Libero role.
From 1960 to 1970 Salvadore won 36 Italy’s full caps. He was part of the team that played both the 1962 and 1966 FIFA World Cups. 
He also was part of the team that won the Third European Championship in 1968. 
Although he missed the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico because of two unfortunate own goals scored in a single match in Madrid, Spain (21 February 1970, Spain - Italy 2–2). Italian national team’s manager Ferruccio Valcareggi decided at 31, Salvadore was no longer at his best. That was the last of Salvadore's Italy caps. It could be said Ferruccio Valcareggi was proved wrong as an Italian defence minus Salvadore were beaten 4-1 in the final by Brazil 
After the retirement Salvadore spent a small period as trainer of a Juventus's youth squad, but left soon and established a small farm in Asti. His last public appearance was the 1 November 2006, invited by Juventus to the celebrations of the club’s 109th anniversary. On that occasion Salvadore received the number six shirt with his name printed.
Sandro Salvadore died of a heart attack on 4 January 2007, aged 67, in Costigliole d'Asti, in the Italian province of Asti.

Horn cars was a name given to a range of dealer-modified passenger cars, usually Ford Falcons, sold at Australian Ford dealers in the 1970s.  The term "Horn car" comes from the Horn Car Accessories company which supplied the parts used to modify these cars.
Horn cars were an initiative taken by Max McLeod, who owned a Ford dealership in Rockdale, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney.  McLeod would add a range of visual modifications to his Falcons - typically spoilers, sunroofs and wild tape striping along the side of the vehicle - in order to make them stand out from the crowd and give his customers the chance to buy a "unique" vehicle.  The concept proved popular and was soon employed by other Ford dealers around Australia.

[[Delos D. Harriman]]
CATEGORIES: Robert A. Heinlein characters, Characters in written science fiction

Delos David Harriman, known as "D.D. Harriman," is a character in the fiction of noted science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein.  He is an entrepreneurial businessman who masterminded the first landing on the Moon as a private business venture.  His story is part of Heinlein's Future History.
Harriman's first appearance in print was in the story Requiem which described his death while pursuing his dream of landing on the Moon himself.  Having opened space to humankind he was, like Moses, denied the sight of his promised land by a combination of health and legal issues.  At the end of his life, Harriman decides to clandestinely arrange to go to the Moon himself.  Harriman meets two spacemen, Captain James (Mac) McIntyre and Engineer Charles (Charlie) Cummings, who are down on their luck and giving rocketship rides at county fairs.  He secretly hires them and pays to have an old orbital ship purchased and upgraded for a flight to the Moon.  To finance this, he liquidates his financial holdings without explanation.  His actions cause his nieces and nephews to take him to court for a competency hearing.  Harriman fails to show up for the hearing and joins the two spacemen as they prepare the ship at a secret desert location.  A deputy marshal locates them, but is knocked out by Charlie Cummings.  As he comes to he sees them making a hurried departure in the modified ship.  The spacemen give the old man his last wish.  He barely survives the trip, and dies shortly after landing.  Charlie buries Harriman's space-suited body on the surface of the Moon and scrawls his epitaph on the tag from an oxygen bottle.  It is Robert Louis Stevenson's "Requiem", which is inscribed on his own headstone in Samoa.
Under the wide and starry sky,  
Dig the grave and let me lie:  
Glad did I live and gladly die,  
And I laid me down with a will!  
This be the verse you grave for me:  
Here he lies where he longed to be;  
Home is the sailor, home from sea,  
And the hunter home from the hill.
Charlie and Mac then abandon the ship and begin the thirty-mile trip to Luna City.
In the later publication, The Man Who Sold the Moon, Harriman is in his prime.  Determined to carry out his vision of a private-venture rocket to the Moon, he buys, bullies, finagles, and deceives anyone who stands in his way.  His partners, who respect his successes if not his methods, think of him as the last of the old robber barons, or perhaps the first of the new ones.  At the end of that story, published later than its sequel, he is left behind as the first colonization team leaves for the Moon.
Harriman is long married, but his marriage takes second place to his business.  When raising money for his venture, he warns Mrs. Harriman that they may close down their extensive underground apartments (built for safety during the so-called "Crazy Years") and live only in the above ground parts of the house.  He also warns her that she may have to relearn the art of running a house without servants.
Heinlein's last novel, To Sail Beyond the Sunset, consists of the memoirs of Maureen Johnson, mother of Lazarus Long, and thus includes considerable detail about the twentieth century of Lazarus's home timeline.  We learn that Maureen was involved in Harriman's Moon project as the mistress of his partner George Strong, a director of Harriman's corporation, and a last-minute benefactor.
While the character only appears in the three Heinlein works, the name "Harriman" appears throughout Heinlein's "Future History" stories, in the names of various foundations and trusts founded by the character.

Elzéar Bédard (24 July 1799 – 11 August 1849) was a lawyer and a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. He later became a judge.
He was born at Quebec City in 1799, the son of Pierre-Stanislas Bédard. Bédard received a typical education for the time which he completed in 1818, He then pursued a career in the priesthood but abandoned this and in 1819 articled to become a lawyer which took place in 1824. By 1830, he was involved in provincial politics and ran unsuccessfully in Kamouraska. He won a by-election in 1832 for Montmorency, a riding left vacant by Philippe Panet. He aligned himself with Louis-Joseph Papineau's Patriote party program and in 1834 was the member who introduced the Ninety-Two Resolutions, although likely he did not have a significant role in the preparation.
He was the first mayor of Quebec City, (1833–1834), but lost the next election to René-Édouard Caron. A close friend and supporter of Lord Gosford, he was appointed a judge of the Court of King's Bench in 1836, an appointment that was called bribery by his radical adversaries in the Patriote party.
Bédard was a political moderate at a time when a more extreme outlook was held by most politicians and this stance brought him some adversity and misfortune during his political life.

[[Potamotrygon]]
CATEGORIES: Potamotrygonidae

Potamotrygon is a genus of freshwater stingrays native to the rivers of South America.
Freshwater stingrays of the genus Potamotrygon are sometimes kept as exotic aquarium fish; though freshwater stingray of other genera do appear in the trade, most are from this genus. They are best kept with a deep, sandy substrate, in which they bury themselves, often with only the eyes visible. They are not territorial with other animals and can be kept in groups, provided a large enough aquarium is provided. They are carnivorous bottom feeders and require strong filtration as they are rather sensitive to water conditions.[tpl]cite book | title = Complete Encyclopedia of the Freshwater Aquarium | last = Dawes | first =  John | publisher = Firefly Books Ltd | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-55297-544-4[/tpl]. Many species of stingray have been bred in captivity,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] and males can be determined by the presence of claspers as in other Chondrichthyans.
Like other stingrays, the fishes of this genus have venomous barbs at the base of their tails, and are dangerous species to humans. It is said that the natives of South America fear the stingray more than they do the piranha.[tpl]cite book | title = Exotic Tropical Fishes | last = Axelrod | first = Herbert, R. | publisher = T.F.H.

An undescribed type is referred to as the Itaituba river stingray or P14 (a P-number system is sometimes used by aquarists, similar to the L-number system). This fish is superficially similar to P. henlei and P. leopoldi except for smaller spots and in larger number.

The Urdu movement was a socio-political movement aimed at making Urdu the universal language and symbol of the cultural and political identity of the Muslim communities of the Indian subcontinent during the British Raj. The movement began with the fall of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, fuelled by the Aligarh movement of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. It strongly influenced the All India Muslim League and the Pakistan movement. The debate over the status of Urdu for the Muslims of Pakistan would also give rise to the Bengali Language Movement in East Bengal in 1952.

[[Chizuko Yoshida]]
CATEGORIES: Japanese artists, Japanese painters, Japanese printmakers, 1924 births, Living people, People from Yokohama

[tpl]Nihongo|Chizuko Yoshida (née Inoue)|吉田 千鶴子|Yoshida Chizuko|born Maech 20, 1924 Yokohama[/tpl] is a Japanese artist. She is a modernist, whose work reflects the development of art in Japan following World War II.
She is also important as the middle link in the succession of three generations of women artists in the widely recognized Yoshida family. She is the wife of artist Hodaka Yoshida (1926–1995). Hodaka’s mother, Fujio Yoshida (1887–1987), was a noted artist alongside of her husband Hiroshi Yoshida (1876–1950). Chizuko's daughter, Ayomi Yoshida (born 1958), is well known for her modernist woodblock prints and room-size woodblock-chip installations. Three generations of women artists in one family is a rare phenomenon in Japanese art history.
Chizuko Inoue's first teacher in oil painting was Fumio Kitaoka, who would  become President of the Japan Art Association. In 1941 she studied design at Hongo Art Institute, then in 1949 joined the art seminar of Okamoto Tarō, a leading avant-garde artist and critic. A  year later Chizuko became a member of two important art associations: the Pacific Painting Society (Taiheiyō-Gakai), established earlier by Hiroshi Yoshida and his friends, and Shuyōkai, established by Fujio Yoshida and her artist associates. Chizuko won a prize for her entry in a Shuyōkai exhibition.
Chizuko and her work would also catch the eye of Hodaka Yoshida. They attended Onchi Kōshirō’s art seminar together, held an exhibition of their oils and woodblock prints, and in 1953 were married. They were to have two children, Ayomi and Takasuke (1959- an art jewelry maker), and they would have long careers as independently inspired modern woodblock print artists. They often traveled together to destinations around the world, and occasionally held joint exhibitions.
Her woodblock prints range from geometric abstraction to music to phenomena in nature to beautiful gestures composed of butterflies or flowers. Underlying her compositions is an inner strength, the recollection of an indelible moment. A refined Japanese aesthetic prevails within her use of various modern international styles.
Chizuko has been a member of the Japanese Print Association since 1954, she also helped  establish the Women’s Printmakers Association in 1954, she has exhibited in the College Women’s Association of Japan since its beginning in 1956 and in the annual Contemporary Women’s Exhibition in Ueno Museum since 1987. She has been invited to exhibit in many international art and print biennials.
The largest collection of her works can be found in the Yokohama Museum of Art, with works also in the British Museum,  Art Institute of Chicago, Philadelphia Museum of Modern Art, and the Tokyo International Museum of Modern Art.

Header injection in HTTP responses can allow for HTTP response splitting (also known as CRLF - Carriage Return Line Feed), Session fixation via the Set-Cookie header, cross-site scripting (XSS), and malicious redirect attacks via the location header. HTTP header injection is a relatively new area for web-based attacks, and has primarily been pioneered by Amit Klein in his work on request/response smuggling/splitting. Vulnerabilities due to HTTP header injections such as CRLF are no longer feasible due to the fact that multiple header requests are not possible.

The Baxter Creek watershed at-large has 10 sources.Baxter Creek - Fluvius Innominatus Topo, 1995
The creek has been largely culverted over the years since the Rancho San Pablo and the subdivided Bishop Ranch, then known as Bishop Creek, were urbanized. Residents missed the creek when it disappeared under the asphalt and formed Friends of Baxter Creek. This group has aided in the restoration of several portions of the creek.

The East Ventura Metrolink Station is a Metrolink rail station in the city of Ventura, California. The station is served by Metrolink's Ventura County Line from Los Angeles Union Station to the eastern Ventura neighborhood of Montalvo. Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner does not pass through this station as it lies just off the main coast route within the wye or triangular junction for the Santa Paula Branch line which is owned by the Ventura County Transportation Commission.Kelly, Peggy (October 15, 1999) "Funding for Montalvo Metrolink station would benefit SP Branch Line" Santa Paula Times
Six Metrolink trains serve the station each weekday. This limited Metrolink service runs only at peak hours in the peak direction of travel (i.e. three morning departures to Los Angeles and three afternoon arrivals from Los Angeles). This station was added as an extension to the Metrolink system in Fall 2002. Prior to that, Metrolink trains that ran from Los Angeles to Oxnard laid over overnight at this site but passengers could not board.
Growth in commuters traveling towards Los Angeles is expected to favor this location over the downtown Ventura train station. Overnight storage of trains in the downtown might have also been expensive if that station was used.[ref]BLAKE, CATHERINE 
"Officials Revise Plan for Ventura Metrolink Station" Los Angeles Times October 11, 1999 Collections: Railroad Stations[/ref] On May 9, 2011 Metrolink renamed the station from Montalvo due to the lack of name recognition.

Beavertail Lighthouse, built in 1749, was and still is the premier lighthouse in Rhode Island, USA, especially for entrance into Narragansett Bay. The [tpl]convert|45|ft|adj=on[/tpl] lighthouse lies on the southernmost point of Conanicut Island in the town of Jamestown, Rhode Island in Beavertail State Park. The light has been reconstructed multiple times since its erection, most recently after the Hurricane of 1938. Restoration projects have come and gone since. The light provides navigation for boats and ships entering Narragansett Bay in the East Passage between Conanicut Island and Newport, Rhode Island on Aquidneck Island. Other lighthouses, such as Castle Hill Lighthouse, Point Judith Light, and Rose Island Light are visible from Beavertail Lighthouse.
Its white light rotates counterclockwise and makes a full rotation in about six or seven seconds. The light is on 24 hours per day, unlike many lighthouses that are near it. It has a loud foghorn that blasts about every 30 seconds during the fog.

[[Jipyeong-ri]]
CATEGORIES: Yangpyeong

Jipyeong-ri is a village in Jije-myeon, Yangpyeong County, Gyeonggi-do Province, South Korea.  It was the site of the Battle of Chipyong-ni during the Korean War, February 1951. A memorial has been erected at the site, which is split into three portions — Korean, American and French. The area was an important transportation and communication hub. 
The battle is sometimes known as the Gettysburg of the Korean War. The battle saw 5,600 Korean, American and French forces under the command of Colonel Paul L. Freeman, 23 RCT, defeat a numerically superior Chinese force in hard fighting. Surrounded on all sides, the 2nd Infantry Warrior Division’s 23rd Regimental Combat Team with an attached French Battalion was hemmed in by more than 25,000 Chinese Communist Forces around Jipyeong-ri. United Nations Forces had previously retreated in the face of the Communist forces instead of getting cut off, but this time they stood and fought. The allies fought at odds of roughly 15 to 1.http://8tharmy.korea.army.mil/20110222chipyongni-timmons.asp
On the third day of fighting, units of the 5th Cavalry Regiment punched a hole in the Chinese lines relieving the 23rd RCT.
The victory is considered so decisive that the Chinese began peace overtures soon after.http://8tharmy.korea.army.mil/20110222chipyongni-timmons.asp
Various older historical landmarks are also located there, including the Jipyeong hyanggyo (village school) and a three-story stone pagoda from the Goryeo period.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yp21.net/culture/history/04c_cultural02_24.asp|title=지평리 삼층석탑(地平理 三層石塔,유형문화재 제180호)|work=[tpl]ko icon[/tpl] Yangpyeong County website|accessdate=2006-10-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

The T-bar cichlid (Cryptoheros sajica), also known as Sajica cichlid is a Central American species of cichlid found in freshwater streams and lakes on the Pacific slope of Costa Rica.  It was formerly known as Archocentrus sajica, but the taxonomy was revised as a result of a study by Juan Schmitter-Soto.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/pfk/pages/item.php?news=1399|title=Convict and Jack Dempsey placed in new genera|accessdate=2008-06-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071228234519/http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/pfk/pages/item.php?news=1399  |archivedate = 2007-12-28[/tpl]  The fish is tan colored with seven indistinct bars on the body. The third bar is usually prominent and coupled with a dark lateral stripe running from the gill cover results in a horizontal T-shaped mark, hence the common name of T-bar cichlid.

Meanwhile Temperley was jamming on a side project with former school friend Stuart MacLeod, who had co-written some of the songs for Freud's Pillow.

At the end of his life, the emperor Gomurakami conferred upon him the title kokushi or National Teacher. Yet in his writings Kokan showed an aloofness from prestige with a striving for inner freedom. The best of his poetry in Chinese dates from late in his life when he had withdrawn from ecclesiastical affairs. His poetry and essays were collected under the title Saihokushū.  He is also credited with other contributions to lexography in his lifetime. 
Kokan compiled a thirty-chapter Buddhist history, the Genko Shakusho (元亨釈書), the oldest extant account of Buddhism in Japan.  The work was completed in the Genko era, whence the era name in its title.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Genkō" in Japan encyclopedia, p. 239.
Kokan studied under the celebrated Chinese monk  Yishan Yining. Their relationship can be regarded as the beginning of the golden age of the Literature of the Five Mountains in Japan. He studied calligraphy under an additional Chinese master Huang Shangu. Other works include Japan's first rhymed verse Jubun-in-ryaku in five volumes, Kokan Osho Juzenshiroku in three volumes, and the eighteen-volume  Butsugo Shinron. A portrait of Kokan Shiren is in the Kaizoin of the Tōfuku-ji Temple in Kyoto, Japan.

Radio Antilles was a radio station founded in 1963, located on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. The station operated at 930 kHz AM and covered the entire Caribbean region.  It aired programmes in the English, Spanish and French languages. English programming was broadcast all day on 930 kHz, and Spanish programming from 10:00 PM – 01:00 AM. French language programming was broadcast on 740 kHz and relayed on 1450 kHz.
The broadcast studios were located in the capital city of Plymouth, with the transmission site on the southern slopes of the Soufriere Hills volcano near Morris. Like so much else in Montserrat, Radio Antilles was badly damaged by Hurricane Hugo, briefly rebuilt, and then shut down and abandoned at the start of the eruptions in 1995. Both the studio and the transmitter were eventually burned and buried completely by lahar and pyroclastic flow deposits.

The University of Illinois Astronomical Observatory, located at 901 S. Mathews Avenue in Urbana, Illinois, on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, was built in 1896, and was designed by Charles A. Gunn. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since November 6, 1986, and on December 20, 1989, was designated a National Historic Landmark.University of Illinois Astronomical Observatory, NHL Database, National Historic Landmarks Program. Retrieved April 28, 2007. 
Though none of the astronomical instruments are being used for professional research today, the observatory still contains a 12" Brashear refractor. The observatory played a key role in the development of astronomy as it was home to a key innovation in the area of astronomical photometry. The facility has been directed by such noted scientists as Joel Stebbins and Robert Horace Baker.University of Illinois Observatory Building -- A Virtual Tour, University of Illinois Astronomy Department, October 2, 2000, University of Illinois. Retrieved April 28, 2007
Erected at the behest of the Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became important in the development of astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but left behind a legacy of discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.

Dery was born in 1975 in Černošice, a village just outside of Prague in then-Czechoslovakia. Her mother Jana had decided to conceive another child after dreaming about a little girl. Dery's parents were dissidents who had taken part in the failed Prague Spring of 1968, causing them to live under suspicion: Jana's parents, who were among the Communist elite, disowned her, Jarda had difficulty finding or keeping a job, and the family always had to be wary of informers.

Duwisib Castle, sometimes spelt Duwiseb or Duweseb, is a grand pseudo-medieval looking fortress in the hills of the semi-arid Southern Namib region of Namibia. It was built by 'Baron' Captain Hans Heinrich von Wolf (born in Dresden, 1873), who was posted to (then) German West Africa. After the German-Nama war Captain von Wolf went home to Dresden and married the stepdaughter of the US consul, Miss Jayta Humphreys, on 8 April 1907. They decided to settle in South West Africa and bought eight farms in the Maltahöhe area. Eminent architect Wilhelm Sander was commissioned to design a building and construction commenced in 1908. Most materials were imported from Germany and stonemasons were hired from Italy, Sweden and Ireland.
It was hoped that the castle would bear a resemblance to some of the existing German Forts in Namibia. Much of the raw materials for the construction of the fort were imported from Germany, landing at Lüderitz. The resulting edifice consisted of 22 rooms.Alan Murphy, Kate Armstrong, James Bainbridge, Matthew D. Firestone. Lonely Planet South Africa. Lonely Planet, 2010, p. 366-368.
While they were travelling to Europe in 1914, the First World War broke out and the ship carrying Von Wolf and his wife was diverted to Rio de Janeiro. Jayta Humphreys had retained her American citizenship and found passage to Europe on a Dutch ship; legend has it the Baron had to travel disguised as a woman. On arrival in Europe the Baron rejoined the German army, and was killed at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, just two weeks after signing up. His wife could not bring herself to return to Namibia alone and never again laid claim to the majestic castle. She spent the rest of her life in the South of England. What are said to be descendants of their fine thoroughbred horses can be seen today roaming free and wild as Namib Desert Horses along the roadside and in the restricted diamond areas, although whether this is the origin of these herds is not accurately known.Duwisib at NamibWeb.com

A cloak of invisibility is a theme that occurs in fiction, and is a device which is under some scientific inquiry. In folklore, mythology and fairytales, a cloak of invisibility is often portrayed as a unique magical item, which is either used by duplicitous characters for ill gotten means, or an item won by a hero, used to fulfill a quest. It is a common theme in Welsh and Germanic folklore, which may trace its origins to the cap of invisibility, found in ancient Greek myths.

Throughout its history, the Portuguese monarchy has had only two queens regnant: Maria I and Maria II of Portugal (and, arguably, BeatriceAlthough she is usually not listed as de facto queen of Portugal, Beatrice was de jure queen, acclaimed in several cities in Portugal. Her pretensions to the throne were defeated after the Battle of Aljubarrota. for a short period of time in the 14th century).
The other women who used the title of "Queen of Portugal" were merely queens consort, wives of the Portuguese kings. Nevertheless, many of them were highly influential in the country's history, having ruled as regents for their minor children and heirs, as well has having a great influence over their spouses.
Elizabeth of Aragon, who was married to Denis of Portugal, was made a saint after there were said to have been miracles performed after her death.
Portugal also had two male royal consorts - Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg and Ferdinand II of Portugal - both consorts to Maria II of Portugal. The first one died leaving his wife childless, and therefore never became King of Portugal since the husband of a Portuguese Queen Regnant could only be titled King after the birth of any child from that marriage. Maria II's second husband was her consort until the birth of their first child. Upon birth of the heir Ferdinand ceased to be consort and instead became de jure uxoris King of Portugal as Ferdinand II.

CATEGORIES: Mammals of India, Lists of fauna of India, Lists of endangered animals, Wildlife conservation in India

In India there are 410 species, 186 genera, 45 families and 13 orders of which nearly 89 species are listed as threatened in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Animals (IUCN 2006). This includes two species that are locally extinct from India viz. Acinonyx jubatus and Rhinoceros sondaicus.
The mammals are the class of vertebrate animals characterized by the presence of mammary glands, which in females produce milk for the nourishment of young; the presence of hair or fur; specialized teeth; the presence of a neocortex region in the brain; and endothermic or "warm-blooded" bodies. The brain regulates endothermic and circulatory system, including a four-chambered heart. Mammals encompass some 5,500 species (including Humans), distributed in about 1,200 genera, 152 families and up to 46 orders, though this varies with the classification scheme.

[[Carlyle Holiday]]

CATEGORIES: 1981 births, Living people, People from San Antonio, Texas, American football quarterbacks, American football wide receivers, Notre Dame Fighting Irish football players, Arizona Cardinals players, Green Bay Packers players

Carlyle Javar Holiday (born October 4, 1981) is an American football wide receiver who currently is a free agent. 
Holiday attended Roosevelt High School in San Antonio, TX. In football, he was named as the top high school scrambling quarterback in the nation. After a heavy bid from Nebraska, he eventually committed to the University of Notre Dame.  Holiday was the starting quarterback for three years at the university, leading them to the Gator Bowl in his final full season at Quarterback. During that time, he broke the school's rushing record for 100 yard games in a season by a quarterback as well as most completions without an interception and touchdown passes in a game, the later two which were broken by Brady Quinn.  During his senior year at Notre Dame, Holiday was converted to a Wide Receiver and Punt Returner, due to the emergence of true freshman Quarterback Brady Quinn.  Even though Holiday never played college baseball, he was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the 44th round of the MLB amateur draft in 2002, and by the New York Mets in 2003. 
Carlyle made his first NFL start against the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football in his second season with the Arizona Cardinals when Larry Fitzgerald was out with a sprained ankle.  He was later signed out of free agency by the Green Bay Packers on December 5, 2006 after being released from the Arizona Cardinals. He caught Brett Favre's record breaking completion against the Detroit Lions, breaking Dan Marino's career completions mark. Carlyle injured his knee playing against the Philadelphia Eagles in the first game of the 2007 season, ending his year while being placed on injured reserve. In February 2008 Holiday was released by the Green Bay Packers.[tpl]cite web | last = JSOnline.com  | title = Packers release WR Carlyle Holiday | url=http://blogs.jsonline.com/packers/archive/2008/02/29/packers-release-wr-carlyle-holiday.aspx | accessdate = 2008-02-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080304135549/http://blogs.jsonline.com/packers/archive/2008/02/29/packers-release-wr-carlyle-holiday.aspx  |archivedate = 2008-03-04[/tpl]

Missouri Mines State Historic Site occupies Federal Mill No. 3 in Park Hills, Missouri, which processed the lead and zinc ore that was mined in the immediate area for many decades.  The historic site features a geological and mining history museum and interpretive center in the old power building focusing on Missouri's historic old Lead Belt.
This particular plant was built by the Federal Lead Co. in 1906-1907 and subsequently bought by competitor St. Joseph Lead Company in 1923.  The mill was retired in 1972 as much of the ore in the area had been mined and major operations were moving west.[ref]
</ref>
In 1975 the land was donated to the state of Missouri for recreational use.  Much of the land was considered too damaged for return to a natural state and so became set aside for off-roading vehicles as St. Joe State Park, while the mill site has been designated an interpretive center.[ref]

The Elliott Cutoff was a covered wagon road that branched off the Oregon Trail at the Malheur River where present-day Vale, Oregon, U.S. is today.  The first portion of the road was originally known as the Meek Cutoff after Stephen Meek, a former trapper who led over 1,000 emigrants into the Harney Basin in 1845. There were considerable difficulties for the 1845 train and after reaching a hill known as Wagontire, the people left Meek and split into groups. They turned north at the Deschutes River and finally returned to the traditional Oregon Trail near The Dalles, Oregon.Leah Collins Menefee, Donald F. Menefee, and Lowell Tiller. "Cutoff Fever I," Oregon Historical Quarterly (Portland: Oregon Historical Society, Winter 1976), 315.
In 1853 another group left the Oregon Trail at Vale Oregon. This emigration was led by Elijah Elliott who followed, with some exceptions, Meek's 1845 route.  But instead of turning north at the Deschutes River, Elliott turned south and traveled up the Deschutes River about 30 miles where a newly built trail had been prepared for the wagon train. This new road crossed the Cascades in the Willamette Pass and was known as the Free Emigrant Road.  No toll would be collected on this road.

The Ellwood House was built as a private home by barbed wire entrepreneur Isaac Ellwood in 1879. It is located on First Street in DeKalb, Illinois, United States, in DeKalb County. The Victorian style home, designed by George O. Garnsey, underwent remodeling in 1898-1899 and 1911. The house was originally part of 1,000 acres (4 km²) which included a large stable complex known as "Ellwood Green." Isaac Ellwood lived here until 1910 when he passed the estate to his son, Perry Ellwood. 
After Perry Ellwood inherited the home he remodeled the interior and exterior, drastically altering the home's appearance. Thus, the Ellwood House incorporates elements from several architectural styles. The site contains four buildings in addition to the main house. A 50 foot (15 m) tall water tower dominates the west side of the property while a 14-foot (4.3-m) tall miniature Stick style house is located nearer the main house. There is also a carriage house, which houses a visitor's center and a museum house that was once used to hold Harriet Ellwood's (Isaac's wife) collection of "curiosities." In 1964 the home was donated to the city of DeKalb and converted into a museum. The house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

[[Address Windowing Extensions]]

CATEGORIES: Microsoft application programming interfaces, Windows NT architecture, X86 memory management

Address Windowing Extensions (AWE) is a Microsoft Windows application programming interface that allows a 32-bit software application to access more physical memory than it has virtual address space, even in excess of the 4 GB limit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366527%28v=vs.85%29.aspx|title=Address Windowing Extensions|publisher=MSDN|quote="a set of extensions that allows an application to quickly manipulate physical memory greater than 4GB."[/tpl] The process of mapping an application's virtual address space to physical memory under AWE is known as "windowing," and is similar to the overlay concept of other environments.  AWE is beneficial to certain data-intensive applications, such as database management systems and scientific and engineering software, that need to manipulate very large data sets.
The application reserves a region, or "window" of virtual address space, and allocates one or more regions of physical memory.  Using the AWE API, the application can map the virtual window to any one of the physical regions.  The application can reserve more than one virtual address space and map it to any of the allocated regions of physical memory, as long as the number of bytes reserved in the virtual address space matches that of the physical memory region. An application must have the Lock Pages in Memory privilege to use AWE.
AWE depends on Physical Address Extension support when reserving memory above 4 GB. AWE was first introduced in Windows 2000 as a new API superseding the PSE36 method (from the Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition) of accessing more than 4 GB of memory, which was no longer supported in Windows 2000.[tpl]cite book|author=Sajal Dam|title=SQL Server Query Performance Tuning Distilled|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3branTEOAEYC&pg=PA28|year=2004|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-0407-7|pages=28–29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Michael R.

If the /3GB boot flag is used to repartition the 32-bit virtual address space (from the 2 GB kernel and 2 GB userland) to 3 GB userland, then AWE is limited to accessing 16 GB of physical memory.

[[Temporary duty assignment]]

CATEGORIES: Employment, Government, Military slang and jargon

A temporary duty assignment (TDA), also known as "temporary additional duty" (TAD), "temporary duty travel" (TDT) or "temporary duty" (TDY), refers to a United States Government employee travel assignment at a location other than the employee's permanent duty station. This type of secondment is usually of relatively short duration, typically from two days to two months in length. Not all agencies use this designation. A temporary duty assignment can be to any location, be it 50 or 5,000 miles away, and some government agencies including the Defense Department mandate they be less than six months in duration.Army Regulation 614–11: Temporary Duty (TDY)  Those agencies that do not mandate a six-month limit consider longer durations to be a Permanent Change of Station (PCS).
Temporary duty assignments usually come with per diem pay, covering lodging, meals, and incidental expenses.GSA Per Diem FAQ Many employees value the per diem aspect of a TDA, since that money is guaranteed, even if they spend less than their allotted daily value. However, some agencies handle the lodging per diem separately from the meals and incidentals, and employees may not make money by staying at cheaper accommodations, or putting more than one person in a room. Typically, an employee may request a cash advance of 60-80% of the total value of the meals and incidental expenses before the TDA per diem takes place, in order to prevent the employee from having to use his or her own money, or putting money on a personal credit card. Government travel cards are also typically available, though these sometimes carry restrictions on the types of goods or services that can be purchased with them.
Some locations have furnished apartments for long-term stay. These apartments have fully equipped kitchens so TDA recipients have an option of cooking rather than eating out all the time, and some may have free washing machines and clothes dryers.
Some government agencies consider any assignment over 45 days as an extended TDA, which allows the employee to get reimbursed for part of the expenses before the end of the assignment.http://www.defensetravel.osd.mil/ppWBT/traveler_before/extended_TDY.htmExtended TDY - Details, NSSC Customer Service, NSSC Customer Satisfaction & Communications Office

The red reflex refers to the reddish-orange reflection of light from the eye's retina that is observed when using an ophthalmoscope or retinoscope from approximately 30 cm / 1 foot. This examination is usually performed in a dimly lit or dark room. 
Many eye problems may be detected by this test, such as:
Newborns are regularly screened for retinoblastomas with an ophthalmoscope. 
According to Bates' Guide to Physical Exams, retinal detachment would result in the absence of red reflex in the affected eye.

His arrival in Quebec is not documented but by 1735 he was living there and by the next year he owned his own ship and was soon a force in commercial shipping. He became part of the French navy and was active during the Seven Years’ War. He retired after the war and returned to France. His son, Ignace-Michel-Louis-Antoine stayed in Canada and  founded of the family of Irumberry de Salaberry.
Michel's importance to history, and Canadian history in particular, is the forging of ties between France and New France. Through participation in important events in Canada and his marriage into a prominent family, he set in motion a New World lineage that had a significant impact on Canada.Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada Complete List of Posts

In finance, a spread option is a type of option where the payoff is based on the difference in price between two underlying assets.  For example the two assets could be crude oil and heating oil; trading such an option might be of interest to oil refineries, whose profits are a function of the difference between these two prices.  Spread options are generally traded over the counter, rather than on exchange.Global Derivatives: Spread optionInvestopedia:Spread option
A 'spread option' is not the same as an 'option spread'.  A spread option is a new, relatively rare type of exotic option on two underlyings, while an option spread is a combination trade: the purchase of one (vanilla) option and the sale of another option on the same underlying.

The functional protein is an anti-parallel dimer, which cross-links the thin filaments in adjacent sarcomeres, and therefore coordinated contractions between sarcomeres in the horizontal axis.
The non-sarcomeric α-actinins (ACTN1 and ACTN4) are widely expressed.  Both ends of the rod-shaped α-actinin dimer contain actin-binding domains.
Mutations in ACTN4 can cause the kidney disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

There were three releases of the album, a New Zealand release in 1988, a United Kingdom and United States release also in 1988 and an extended album in 1989. The UK/US release featured tracks which had earlier been released in New Zealand on the Life in One Chord EP; the 1989 release contained all the songs from both the New Zealand album and the earlier EP.
Most of the songs on the album were credited to Shayne Carter/Straitjacket Fits, the exceptions being "Sparkle That Shines", "Take From The Years" and "Fabulous Things" (all Andrew Brough/Straitjacket Fits), and a cover of Leonard Cohen's song "So Long, Marianne". This was the only cover version recorded on any of Straitjacket Fits' albums.
The album was well received, though the band were disappointed that the sound of the finished release failed to capture either their live sound or the intensity of their debut EP.Davey, T. & Puschmann, H.

[tpl]Unreferenced|date=January 2007[/tpl]The Makkah Document, formed on 2006-10-20, calls to take practical steps to end the sectarian violence, included forming committees in various areas in Iraq and organising seminars of Sunni and Shia religious leaders and scholars.
The beginning of the Makkah Document was marked with Senior Shiite and Sunni leaders in Iraq starting talks to end sectarian conflict in their homeland. About 24 leaders took part in the two-day meeting held near Haram Mosque in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia under the auspices of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, an offshoot of the OIC. The Makkah Document is supposed to be a religious agreement rather than a political one, being based on the teaches of the Quran and Muhammad. The Iraqi prime minister has backed the conference, even though it is not a political one.
The absence of top Shiite spiritual leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Al Sistani, remained conspicuous at the meeting. However, Al Sistani pledged full support for the meeting.

[[Cedric Boyns]]

CATEGORIES: 1954 births, Living people, People from Harrogate, Worcestershire cricketers, Cambridge University cricketers, Shropshire cricketers, English cricketers

Cedric Nigel Boyns (born 14 August 1954) is a former English cricketer who played at first-class level for a few years in the late 1970s. He was born in Starbeck, Harrogate, Yorkshire.
Boyns started his career at Worcestershire in 1972, making a useful 47 opening for the Second XI against their Derbyshire equivalents on 31 July. He played two more Second XI matches that season, two in 1973, and then a considerable number in the second half of 1974. However, by the end of that year, in 25 innings his debut 47 remained his highest score. 1975 saw Boyns make two Second XI hundreds, on both occasions sharing large partnerships with fellow centurion Keith Wilkinson. Boyns also bowled for the first time in this season.
The following summer, he finally made his first-class debut against Somerset, albeit for Cambridge University rather than Worcestershire. He failed twice with the bat and bowled only four overs, and three further games for the university brought little change in his fortunes. Nevertheless, Worcestershire selected him to make his first-team debut on 23 June in the local derby against Warwickshire in the Benson & Hedges Cup. Despite his county's 12-run victory, it was a personal anticlimax: Boyns neither batted nor bowled. Three days later he did get to bat against Gloucestershire in the Gillette Cup, but was lbw to Procter for a duck. One day later still, he turned out against Surrey in the John Player League, but once more did not get a turn at the crease.
Boyns worked out some of his frustration with a hundred for the second team against Gloucestershire II, and at the start of July he was rewarded with a County Championship debut against Lancashire. Worcestershire won by an innings thanks to a superb all-round display by Imran Khan (111*; 7–53 and 6–46) so Boyns was only allowed a single innings, in which he scored 23. He also bowled seven wicketless overs for a cost of 17 runs. In a losing appearance in the B&H Cup final two weeks later he at least claimed his first senior wickets: Kent's Graham Johnson and Alan Ealham.
The latter part of the 1976 season saw Boyns at last establish himself in the Worcestershire first team, and he claimed his maiden first-class wicket (that of Surrey's Lonsdale Skinner) as well as scoring what would prove to be his highest score, a fighting 95 against Yorkshire which rescued his county from 76/4 in their first innings and eventually helped ensure a draw.
1977 started strangely for Boyns. He took 3–24 (his career best) against Oxford University, but this small bowling success was soon to be overtaken by a large batting crisis. Successive first-team innings of 16, 2, 4, 1, 1 and 2 saw Boyns drop to the seconds in the second week of May, but he immediately made an unbeaten 111 against Somerset II and was just as quickly recalled to the team proper. Once back, however, he struggled again, and this time it did not seem to matter whether he played in the first or the second team. In eight successive innings in all cricket he was dismissed for single-figure scores, and though his form had improved slightly by mid-August it was only in the final innings of the season, with Worcestershire following on against Somerset, that he made a significant score once more, with 77*.
In 1978 Boyns had plenty of first-team opportunities from late May to early July, but on the whole did not make the most of them. His highest score during this period was 41*, and though he claimed a List A career-best of 4–34 in the John Player League against Leicestershire he was soon back in the seconds yet again. Here, as they had on several previous occasions, the runs flowed, with scores of 105*, 87 and 78* leading to his recall. He made 71 against the New Zealanders in the second half of August, but little else was worthy of note. By 1979 Boyns' days as a Worcestershire cricketer were numbered, and indeed he made only one first-class appearance that summer, against the Sri Lankans in mid-July, although he did play six times in one-day matches. His last first-class wicket was that of Sri Lankan Roy Dias, while his last List A scalp was Sussex's Tony Pigott just a few days later.
Although Boyns never again played at first-class level, he did appear for Shropshire for several years in the early 1980s, both in the Minor Counties Championship and, on a single occasion in 1983, at List A level in the NatWest Trophy. Shropshire lost the game by 87 runs, unsurprisingly given that their opponents were the Somerset of Botham, Richards and Garner, while Boyns himself scored 12 and did not bowl. The following year he (and his former Worcestershire team-mate Wilkinson) appeared for the Old Hill side that won the William Younger Cup, while in 1986 Boyns had two minor outings for MCC.
In later life Boyns became a Biology teacher and cricket coach.

Blow is the third album released in 1993 by New Zealand band, Straitjacket Fits. The album has a harder, less melodic sound than the band's previous albums. This reflects the change of line-up, with Andrew Brough having left the band prior to this album's recording, to be replaced by Mark Petersen. It also reflect's the band's change of recording method (for this album the tracks were recorded live) and a change of producer.Davey, T. & Puschmann, H. (1996) Kiwi rock.

Straitjacket Fits at their least user-friendly and most challenging."Rip It Up, April 1993
All the songs on this album are credited to Shayne Carter/John Collie/Straitjacket Fits.
Two of the tracks from the album ("Done" and "Spacing") had previously been released in New Zealand on the Done EP in 1992, though both were re-recorded for the album.

Feminist political ecology is a feminist perspective on political ecology, drawing on theories from  post-structuralism, feminist geography, and cultural ecology. Unlike (but often associated with) ecofeminism, feminist political ecology does not essentialize women by equating the oppression of women with the domination of the environment. Instead it examines gender’s place in the political ecological landscape, exploring gender as a factor in ecological and political relations. Specific areas in which feminist political ecology is focused are development, landscape, resource use, agrarian reconstruction and rural-urban transformation (Hovorka 2006: 209).

He was well known for his strong Art Deco Style combining American and Australian architecture. He was one of the most prolific commercial architects between 1920 and 1930. Most of his works were inspired by his regular overseas trips to observe current architectural trends, mainly to the United States, which became annual from 1928 to 1941. As a consequence, his style developed and transformed continually. In 1929, Harry’s client, George James Coles sent him to Europe and America to study trends in designing chain stores. Soon after he came back, he finished the design of the new Coles store (now David Jones) in Bourke Street, Melbourne. He was elected an associate of RVIA 21 February 1946.

Bridge construction commenced 1927, and was opened to vehicular traffic November 5, 1930. The bridge has an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of nearly 50,000 vehicles, including about 2,000 trucks.Picture this: Drawbridge Operator, The Record (Bergen County), April 11, 2005
When raised, the bridge provides [tpl]convert|100|ft[/tpl] of clearance for ships. Raising the lift span takes 15 minutes. In 2005, the bridge was raised to accommodate 80 boats passing underneath.
The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) is replacing the Wittpenn Bridge and all its approach ramps (including connections to U.S. Route 1/9), a project estimated to cost $600 million, funded by federal dollars. The first phase of construction began in July 2011 and the overall project is expected to take six years to complete.

Ratu Boko is an archaeological site  known to modern Javanese as Kraton Ratu Boko or Ratu Boko's Palace. Ratu Boko is located on a plateau, about three kilometres south of Lara Jonggrang Prambanan temple complex in Yogyakarta  Indonesia. The original name of this site is still unclear, however the local inhabitants named this site after King Boko, the legendary king mentioned in Loro Jonggrang folklore. 
The site covers 16 hectares in two hamlets (Dawung and Sambireja) of the village of Bokoharjo and Prambanan, Sleman Regency. In striking contrast to other Classic-period sites in Central Java and Yogyakarta, which are remains of temples, Ratu Boko displays attributes of an occupation or settlement site, although its precise functions is unknown.Didier Millet, volume editor: John Miksic, Indonesian Heritage Series: Ancient History, pp. 74, Hardcover edition - Aug 2003, Archipelago Press, Singapore 169641, ISBN 981-3018-26-7. Probably the site was a palace complex which belongs to the kings of Sailendra or Mataram Kingdom that also build temples scattered across Prambanan Plain. The argument was based on the fact that this complex was not a temple nor building with religious nature, but a fortified palace instead which evidence in the remnant of fortified walls and the dry moat as defensive structures.Soetarno, Drs. R. second edition (2002). "Aneka Candi Kuno di Indonesia" (Ancient Temples in Indonesia), pp. 67. Dahara Prize. Semarang. ISBN 979-501-098-0. The remains of settlements also founds in Ratu Boko vicinity.
This site is located 196 m above the sea level, on the highest point in the site, there is a small pavilion from which one will be able to see a panoramic view of Prambanan temple with Mount Merapi as the background.

[[List of Soviet Army divisions 1989–91]]

CATEGORIES: Army divisions of the Soviet Union, Military organizational structures, Lists of Russian and Soviet military units and formations

This article is an (incomplete) listing of Soviet Ground Forces divisions in 1990, and corresponding information about their later status in 2006. The primary source is Table 2.5, pages 104-106, V.I. Feskov, K.A. Kalashnikov, V.I. Golikov, The Soviet Army in the Years of the Cold War 1945–91, Tomsk University Publishing House, Tomsk, 2004. However, it is not totally accurate, as some other information from it has been shown to be incorrect. Alternate information and corrections are welcome.
Some divisions are referred to as 'Spare'. Spare is the literal translation of the Russian zapas (reserve). It is not a status of the unit, but rather its personnel. The Soviet Union never had reserve units as such. The personnel just went on the reserve rolls, and for officers and NCOs this means they add 'v zapase' to their rank (e.g. kapitan v zapase). The unit itself changes readiness status from A, to either B (Б), V (В) or G (Г). This means a higher degree of equipment conservation, lower training and operational performance, etc.

Camp Roger is a Christian youth camp located in Belding, Michigan. It was founded in 1913 as a boys choir camp for Saint Mark's Episcopal church in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Originally it was named Camp Anderson after the wealthy donor, William Anderson, purchased the land. In 1911 his son Roger died of tuberculosis and the camp's name was changed in memory of his son. St. Mark's Church operated Camp Roger for many years until the Great Depression, when interest and funding for the camp diminished.
In 1940 a group of Christian Reformed people organized the Christian Youth Camp Association, a non-profit corporation whose purpose was to minister to boys and girls through a Christian summer camp experience. They were able to purchase Camp Roger in 1941 from St. Mark's Church for $9,000. The first summer camp program was offered in 1941, staffed largely by parents and volunteers. The officers of the first board of directors were: Rev. George Goris, President; Mr. Richard "Uncle Dick" Postma, Vice President; Mr. Jelle Hekman, Treasurer; Dr. Anthony Hoekema, Secretary; and Mr. E.R. Post, Camp Director.
Since 1941, generations of men and women have participated in the ministry of Camp Roger as campers, parents, staff, and board members. The Camp Directors are Mr. E.R. Post (1941–49), Mr. John Beukema (1950–52), Mr. Phil Lucasse (1953–58), Mr. Harvey Ribbens (1959–62), Mr. Orin Gelderloos (1963–66), Mr. K.

Camp Roger's mission is to reveal and celebrate God's love for God's children through experiences in God's world. Camp Roger's program includes a weekly overnight summer camp experience for young people. Camp Roger's year-round program is also very active, serving about 10,000 participants in the fall, winter, and spring.

Hastings Mill was a sawmill on the south shore of Burrard Inlet and was the first commercial operation around which the settlement that would become Vancouver developed in British Columbia, Canada.
In 1867, Captain Edward Stamp began producing lumber in Stamp's Mill at the foot of what is now Dunlevy Avenue after a planned site at Brockton Point proved unsuitable due to difficult currents and a shoal. Stamp's efforts in developing the mill are summarized by Robert Macdonald in Making Vancouver: Class, Status and Social Boundaries, 1863-1913:
 
     In 1865 he formed a company in England, backed by capital of $100,000 , to produce lumber in British Columbia. Stamp also secured from the colonial government of British Columbia the right to purchase or lease [tpl]convert|16000|acre|km2[/tpl] of timber on the lower coast, and selected a mill site on a point of land along Burrard Inlet's south shore. Delayed by the failure of crucial machinery parts to arrive from England, Stamp did not begin cutting lumber for export until June 1867. After managing the firm for less than two years he retired, and shortly thereafter his company went into liquidation in England. The mill closed for a period in 1870 but opened again in August after being purchased by Dickson, DeWolf and Company of San Francisco. Known at first as Stamp's Mill, it now became the Hastings Sawmill Company, or Hastings Mill.<ref>McDonald, R. A. (1996). Making Vancouver: Class, status and social boundaries, 1863-1913. Vancouver, BC, Canada: UBC Press, p 7.</ref>

The early settlement was in effect a company town. People shopped at the Hastings Mill Store and sent their children to the Hastings Mill School, which included students from Moodyville on the opposite side of the inlet. This would change after the CPR chose Vancouver as the terminus for the transcontinental railway. Nevertheless, the lumber industry remained the backbone of the new settlement's economy, and Hastings Mill was "the nucleus around which the city of Vancouver grew up in the 1880s" and remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s.Chuck Davis, "A Brief History of Greater Vancouver," from The History of Metropolitan Vancouver website.
When Hastings Mill closed, the building that housed the Hastings Mill Store was transported by barge to the foot of Alma Street to begin a new life as the Old Hastings Mill Store Museum. Operated by the Native Daughters of British Columbia, the museum features Native American, pioneer and immigrant artifacts.http://www.venturevancouver.com/old-hastings-mill-store-vancouver-oldest-building Venture Vancouver
This was also one of the only structures to survive the great fire in 1886 and was used as a hospital and morgue for the fire's victims."The Old Hastings Mill Store Museum," Walking tours of Vancouver with John Atkin website.

Dajabón is the capital city of the Dajabón province in the Dominican Republic, located on the border with Haiti. It is a market town with a population of about 10,000, north of the Cordillera Central mountain range. 
The city was initially founded between 1771 and 1776 but was soon after abandoned during the War of Independence. It was settled again shortly after the Restoration War in 1865.
Dajabón is located on the Dajabón River, also known as the Masacre River due to its connection to the Parsley Massacre of an estimated 20 to 30 thousand Haitians ordered by Trujillo in 1937. The river is shallow enough to make crossing on foot prevalent. The bridge across the river connects Dajabón to its larger Haitian sister city of Ouanaminthe. On Mondays and Fridays, Haitians are permitted to temporarily cross the bridge to sell their goods which mainly consist of the supplies donated to them by various organizations.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl] Most of the goods are used clothes, shoes, and house-wear. On these days, an area of 20 square blocks of the city becomes a crowded business place. In addition to the Haitians, Dominicans go to the market to sell their food (vegetables grown in their part of the country).

Melvin Monroe Stewart (born November 16, 1968) is an American former competition swimmer and former world record-holder who won two gold medals and one bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.  
Stewart was a prominent 200-meter butterfly swimmer of his era.  A 14-time national champion, he won the 200-meter event at the 1991 World Championships in Perth, defeating Hall of Famers Michael Gross of Germany and Tamás Darnyi of Hungary.  Next year he became the gold medalist at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics in Olympic record time, 1:56.26. Stewart, the world-record holder since 1991, won a second gold as a preliminary heat member of the 4×100m medley relay and a bronze on the 4×200m freestyle relay. In his first Olympic Games at Seoul in 1988, he was placed fifth in the 200m butterfly. Stewart held the world record at 1:55.69 from 1991 to 1995 when it was broken by Denis Pankratov of Russia.
Beginning in 1974, under the direction of coach Frankie Bell at the Johnston Memorial YMCA pool in Charlotte, North Carolina, he won several national YMCA titles.  Bell taught him stroke technique and built his love for the sport, motivating the already inspired youngster with a banana split every time he won.  By age 10, he was ranked among the top 10 in the nation in his age group in sixteen events.  "Little Melvin," as he was called, grew up on the grounds of Heritage USA, the PTL Ministries Theme Park and religious retreat where his father was the recreation director of Jim and Tammy Bakker's Heritage Church and athletic director of his school, Heritage Academy.
Stewart became a butterfly side-breather, preferring this unconventional breathing technique to the more traditional head up breathing common to most butterfly swimmers.  At 6 feet, 1 inch tall, 180 pounds, he had flexibility, quick hands and feet, remarkable turning ability and kicking power.
In need of some academic tutoring, his mentor George Baxter enrolled Stewart at Mercersburg Academy, a small boarding school known for its academics and competitive swimming teams.  In his three years there, Stewart became an honor student and a leader.
He followed his Mercersburg coach John Trembley to the University of Tennessee, where he swam for the Tennessee Volunteers swimming and diving team.  He won the 200-meter butterfly at the Goodwill Games of 1986.  He repeated with Goodwill Game wins in 1990 and 1994 in Moscow, and at the Pan Pacific Championships of 1987, 1989 and 1991.  While at Tennessee, he won two NCAA titles in the 200-meter butterfly.
Stewart holds the record in United States Swimming for winning the most national championships (14) in one event (200-meter butterfly).
After failing to qualify for the 1996 U.S. Olympic Team, Stewart began to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.  He appeared in plays, movies and television shows.  He served as an ABC Sports field reporter, hosted ESPN'sAmerican Outback and appeared in several films.  Stewart has written several films, including a new version of the Lee Falk's The Phantom (called The Ghost Who Walks).
Stewart is the co-founder and publisher of the swimming news website, SwimSwam.com, and a producer-director of commercials through his company, Gold Medal Media, LLC.  In addition, he is currently an ambassador to the United States Swimming Foundation.  He lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife Tiffany, and their daughter Bayley.

[[Arimannus]]
CATEGORIES: Medieval Italy

The arimanni (singular arimannus) were a warrior class of freemen in Lombard and later Frankish Italy. In contemporary documents arimanni are sometimes denominated as liberi homines (free men) or exercitales (soldiers). 
The ranks of the arimanni were originally filled by experienced warriors, the descendants of the Lombard freemen who invaded Italy in 569. The position of the arimanni declined after the Frankish conquest of 774. By the mid-ninth century, many Franks were also arimanni, no longer just Lombards. By the tenth century, the arimanni had declined to a position barely above that of serfs. 
The arimanni were typically small or medium landowners with   a few tenants, or none, beneath them. They formed the basis of the Italian state as they owed it service, specifically oste et ponte et placito: army, bridge, and court services. This service was not mediated by feudal obligations. The arimanni held public offices at the local level. The Carolingians took a special interest in the obligations and rights of the arimanni as they were foundational to royal control. Lothair I tried to curb the tide of feudalisation by reasserting the public obligations of the arimanni even if landless, making these obligations due to the local count. In a conscience continuation of Carolingain policy, both Guy and Lambert in the 890s created legislation asserting the obligations, especially military, of the arimanni and outlawing the prevalent practice of granting public obligations to vassals as benefices. The concept of arimanni survived into the eleventh century, when certain Tuscan citizens pleaded that status against the claims of the House of Canossa.

The School was originally known as Manukau Intermediate School, so called for the school's proximity to the Manukau Harbour. With the growth of Manukau City in recent years, the Board of Trustees decided in 1997 that it was time to affirm that it was an Auckland school: accordingly it was decided to rename the school to "Royal Oak Intemediate" to better reflect its location.
Between the years of 1912 and 1922, the area now occupied by the school was the site of the "Boyd Zoo": a major local attraction at the time. Prior to the building being finally commissioned as a school, it was used initially as a temporary hospital during World War II. The school celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1993.

[[CMX 600]]

CATEGORIES: Film and video technology

The CMX 600 was the very first non-linear video editing system. It was introduced in 1971 by CMX Systems, a joint venture between CBS and Memorex.  CMX referred to it as a "RAVE", or Random Access Video Editor.
The 600 had a console with 2 black & white monitors built in, as well as a light pen used to control the system.  The right monitor, which played the preview video, was used by the editor to make cuts and edit decisions, by using the light pen to select from options which were superimposed as text over the preview video. The left monitor was used to display the edited video. 
It recorded and played back black-and-white "skip-field" video in analog on specially modified disk pack drives (supplied by Memorex, and which were commonly used to store data digitally on mainframe computers of the time) that were the size of washing machines.  The audio was recorded digitally using PCM, and was recorded by being inserted in the "back porch" of the horizontal blanking interval pulses of the video.  This audio was somewhat poor, due to a large amount of jitter occurring from the signal being played back from the disk packs.  The video was also of less than stellar quality, due to it being recorded in skip-field mode (which was done to extend recording time on the disk packs).  But all of this did not matter, since the 600's main purpose was solely for off-line editing, in order to create an Edit Decision List (EDL) for later on-line editing.
The 600 was paired with the CMX-200, which took the EDL information from the 600, and used it to control several VTRs to auto-assemble the video program in the on-line editing stage.  The 200 used a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal to input EDL information.
The editing console was interfaced to two equipment racks of support equipment (which were usually located remotely in another room from the console).  The first rack contained the interface electronics for the system, monitoring equipment, and a Digital PDP-11 minicomputer with 32 kilobytes of RAM, which controlled the system.  The second rack contained all the audio & video electronics, and the "Skip-Field Recorder", which took in video & audio for editing from a VTR, and then recorded such to one or several disk pack drives interfaced to the 600.  The CMX 600 could support up to six disk pack drives, for a total recording time of 27 minutes.  Each disk pack could record up to 5.4 minutes of NTSC video, or 4.5 minutes of PAL video.
The CMX 600 was a system quite ahead of the technology of the time, and was quite expensive, costing about $250,000 USD at its introduction.  About 6 systems were manufactured, and were used to edit several television shows and commercials.

The name Mazzanti is found in all parts of Italy, with large concentrations in Emilia-Romagna (especially near Rimini) and Tuscany (near Florence and Lucca).

[[Cochamó Valley]]

CATEGORIES: Landforms of Chile, Valleys of Chile

Cochamó Valley is a U-shaped valley located in the Andes, in Los Lagos Region of Chile, south of Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park and east of the Reloncaví Estuary. The valley has a striking similarity to Yosemite Valley, due to its granite domes and old-growth forests. Like Yosemite, rock climbers from around the world come to climb the valley's several [tpl]Convert|1000|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] granite walls. However, it is also an unexplored paradise for serious and hikers - with trails ranging from easy to challenging, a myriad of rare bird and plant life, and a stunning landscape.
The valley takes its name from the river of Cochamó, about 5 km from the village of Cochamó. A six-km gravel road and hiking trail leads into this east-west running valley. The trail carries on up through Argentina traverses some of the most unspoiled areas of northern Patagonia, and rewards travelers with views of granite walls, plunging waterfalls, soaring condors, towering Alerce trees, and the magical deep-blue Vidal Gormaz Lake, known for trout fishing. The trail is more than 100 years old, and was used to transport Argentinean beef cattle from across the border to be shipped from Cochamó to the hungry nitrate miners in far northern Chile.  In turn, dried and smoked fish and shellfish made the return journey into the mountains and across Paso El León into Argentina. The trail's most famous users were Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, who, while hiding out for a couple of years at their ranch in Argentina, actually drove their own cattle down to sell in Cochamó.
The valley is home to dense, virgin temperate rainforest - one of only three such remaining forests in the world. It is not unusual to find trees close to 1,000 years old, and climbers, vines, and undergrowth that have not known human footsteps. Wild boar (an invasive species), pudú, and the occasional puma inhabit the upper slopes - but are rarely seen and rarely a threat to man. Almost the entire valley is privately owned—mostly in the hand of local residents, having been passed down for 3 or more generations, since the first homesteaders staked their claims in the first quarter of the 20th century. The land is used primarily for free-ranging cattle, with the majority of owners living in Cochamó, and making occasional trips to check on their animals and bring them down for sale when needed. There is minimal raising of crops. 
The main activity in the valley today - aside from cattle rearing and local logging for firewood - is tourism. International tourism was pioneered by German adventurer and maverick, Clark Stede, who brought the trail to the attention of mainly European visitors, and established two lodges - one at the mouth of the River Cochamó, and an "outback" lodge in the upper La Junta Valley (the 'Yosemite' of Chile). These evolved into Campo Aventura. This was in the early 1990s, and since then, the valley has slowly gained more and more recognition, attracting two types of travelers: rock climbers focused on pushing their limits in scaling the granite walls and towers; and visitors who are keen to explore this natural magnificence on horseback or via hiking, and travel with established operators or with local residents.
The valley, as with other river catchments in Chile, is often under threat from large-scale, external economic interests. A few years ago, residents banded together to successfully prevent large-scale logging exploitation, including the building of a road accessible by vehicles through the entire valley. (But not before the first 7 km of gravel track was laid down - which, today, is of benefit to local residents). More recently, the valley has come under threat from hydro-electric companies - that, in 2009, floated plans to create a system of large-scale pipes and tubes, and pylons, to produce vast amounts of electricity. Again, locals have banded together to combat this effort, and preserve the valley. In late 2009, the Cochamó River was designated as a river protected for tourism, but this government designation is likely to be challenged in court or parliament by the business community.

[[House of Mindaugas]]
CATEGORIES: Belarusian nobility, Belarusian rulers, European royal families, Lithuanian noble families

The House of Mindaugas was the first royal family of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, centered around Mindaugas, the first known and undoubted sovereign of Lithuania. He was crowned as King of Lithuania in 1253 and assassinated ten years later. His known family relations end with children; there is no data on his great-grandchildren or any relations with the Gediminids, a dynasty of sovereigns of Lithuania and Poland that started with Butigeidis ca. 1285 and ended with Sigismund II Augustus in 1572. 
Historians have to make considerable assumptions trying to reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about the early history of Lithuania. The matter is further complicated by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.

[[Geoffrey I of Provence]]
CATEGORIES: 1062 deaths, Counts of Provence, Occitan people, Year of birth unknown

Geoffrey I or JosfredAlso spelled Jauffred, Jozfred, Gosfred, or Gausfred. (died February between 1061 and 1063) was the joint Count of Provence with his elder brothers William IV and Fulk from 1018 to his death. He was the third son of William II of Provence and Gerberga of Mâcon and a scion of the younger line of the family. It is possible that he did not carry the title "count" until after the death of his eldest brother William around 1032.
He became Count of Arles in 1032 and he and Fulk made a donation to the Abbey of Cluny on 26 May 1037. During his brother's life, he was secondary to him. With the death of his brother, he became sole count with the title marchyo sive comes Provincie. The title of marchio (margrave) implied that he was the head of the dynasty.
He was a great builder of the church in his region, devastated in the previous century by Saracen raids. He restored the abbey of Sparro, which they had destroyed, and gave it to the archiepiscopal see of Aix.  Following the example of most of his ancestors, he was a patron of Saint Victor in Marseille. In 1045, he consented to a donation of one of his vicecomital vassals to the monastery and in March 1048 to the transferral of property from Raimbaud, Archbishop of Arles, to the church. On 1 July 1055 and again in 1057, with his wife Stephanie and his son Bertrand, he himself donated property to St Victor. His patronage far exceeded his predecessors however. He relinquished his rights over any lands the viscount of Marseilles, Fulk, wished to donate to the monastery in 1044, while in 1032 he had consented to turn over lands to the church as allods. In 1038, he gave over comital rights which had been possessed of his house since the reign of his great-grandfather William the Liberator to his vassals, losing control over many castles and fortresses. The royal fisc, which had been under control of the counts of Provence since the time of William, was mostly parcelled out as allods to the vassals during Geoffrey's tenure and the weakening of the county of Provence as a united polity can be dated from his reign. Even when Rudolf III of Burgundy, his lord, sold any remaining rights over some royal villae, Geoffrey gave these away as allodial holdings.
Geoffrey was succeeded by his son Bertrand. One daughter became the first wife of Raymond IV of Toulouse, another, Stephanie, married William II of Besalú and the third was Gerberga, married Gilbert I of Gévaudan.

[[Pep flags]]
CATEGORIES: Cheerleading

Pep Flags, also known as flaggies, short flags, small flags, or twirl flags is the performing art of twirling one or two flag(s) as part of a choreographed routine. In recent years, some schools have implemented a third and even fourth flag in routines. This performing art is mainly prominent in Southern California high schools in various school districts. It is mainly in high schools but a few are in elementary, middle school and college/university levels. 
Although pep flags has been around for many decades (and has evolved much since then), it has been gaining more and more popularity. This particular style of pep flags has spanned out to other areas in Northern California and Nevada and has been known to have similar styles in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Twirling has also reached other countries such as Australia, Canada, Hungary, Japan, South America, St. Kitts and the United Kingdom. 
Depending on the place, pep flags may be classified with baton (flag baton), majorettes or precision/prop. Usually, pep flags is often associated with cheerleading, as it is one of the main subdivisions of the spirit world: cheerleading, songleading/pom pom, mascots and pep flags). Not to be confused with auxiliary or colorguard, pep flags is a separate discipline. However, much like other auxiliary and spirit teams, Pep Flags takes much hand and eye coordination, athleticism, showmanship and overall teamwork and good sportsmanship. Many flag routines involve choreography to music, dance/cheer elements (such as kicklines, pyramid mounts, etc.), numerous combinations of twirls, flag tricks, and flag tosses (also known as exchanges).
Many schools that have a Pep Flag squad can generally be seen performing at school pep rallies, football games (pre-game, half-time or even along the sideline with the cheerleaders), and cheering at other sporting events during the fall. Some may be seen marching with their school's band during parade season.  In the spring, teams compete in several indoor competitions against other schools. Some of the main competitions that occur are United Spirit Association (USA) Regionals and Nationals, Miss Dance Drill/Team USA, Sharp competitions as well as smaller school-sponsored competitions throughout the Southern California area. Generally, these competitions have two separate divisions for one flag and two flag routines. In addition, they may also include solo, duet, and trio divisions as well.

CATEGORIES: Cumulus, Wildfire ecology, Wildfires

The pyrocumulonimbus cloud (pyroCb) is a type of cumulonimbus cloud that forms above a source of heat, such as a wildfire, and may sometimes even extinguish the fire that formed it. It is the most extreme manifestation of a pyrocumulus cloud. According to the American Meteorological Society’s Glossary of Meteorology, a pyrocumulus is "a cumulus cloud formed by a rising thermal from a fire, or enhanced by buoyant plume emissions from an industrial combustion process."[tpl]cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?query=pyrocumulus|title=AMS Glossary|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=6 January 2012[/tpl] Analogous to the meteorological distinction between cumulus and cumulonimbus, the pyrocumulonimbus is a fire-aided or –caused convective cloud, like a pyrocumulus, but with considerable vertical development. The pyroCb reaches the upper troposphere or even lower stratosphere and may involve precipitation (although usually light), hail, lightning, extreme low-level winds, and in some cases even tornadoes.[tpl]cite doi|10.1029/2005GL025161[/tpl] The pyroCb was named following the discovery that extreme manifestations of this pyroconvection caused direct injection of large abundances of smoke into the lower stratosphere. [tpl]cite doi|10.1029/1999GL011200[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1029/2002GL016820[/tpl] A pyrocumulonimbus may often form from the eruption column of a volcano.
Alternate spellings and abbreviations for pyrocumulonimbus that may be found in the literature include pyro-cumulonimbus, pyro-cb, pyro-Cb and pyrocb. [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]  The World Meteorological Organization does not recognize the pyrocumulonimbus as a distinct cloud type, but instead classifies it simply as cumulonimbus.

[[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain]]

CATEGORIES: Hybrid powertrain, Hybrid vehicles, Engines

Hybrid vehicles are vehicles with two or more power sources in the drivetrain.  There are many different types of hybrid vehicles, although only the gasoline-electric hybrid is currently commercially available.
Hybrids are classified by the division of power between sources; both sources may operate in parallel to simultaneously provide acceleration, or they may operate in series with one source exclusively providing the acceleration and the second being used to augment the first's power reserve. The sources can also be used in both series and parallel as needed, the vehicle being primarily driven by one source but the second capable of providing direct additional acceleration if required.
Current hybrids use both an internal combustion (IC) engine and a battery/electric drive system (using ultracapacitors) to improve fuel consumption, emission, and performance.  Electrically assisted pedal bicycles are a form of hybrid drive.  Other combinations of energy storage and conversion are possible, although not yet in commercial production.
Combustion-electric hybrids have larger battery sets than what a normal combustion engine only vehicle would have. Battery and supercapacitor technology is advancing.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/03/doe-to-award-up-to-24b-for-advanced-batteries-electric-drive-components-and-electric-drive-vehicle-d.html#more |title=DOE to Award Up to $2.4B for Advanced Batteries, Electric Drive Components, and Electric Drive Vehicle Demonstration/Deployment Projects |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=March 19, 2009[/tpl]  A potential advantage is that when these battery sets require renewing in the future, the newer battery sets will be potentially superior having higher energy storage giving greater range enhancing a vehicle.

CATEGORIES: Satellite television, History of television, International broadcasting, Satellite ground stations, Television terminology

Satellite television is television programming delivered by the means of communications satellite and received by an outdoor antenna, usually a parabolic reflector generally referred to as a satellite dish, and as far as household usage is concerned, a satellite receiver either in the form of an external set-top box or a satellite tuner module built into a television set. Satellite television tuners are also available as a card or a USB peripheral to be attached to a personal computer. In many areas of the world satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, often to areas that are not serviced by terrestrial or cable providers. 
Direct-broadcast satellite television comes to the general public in two distinct flavors – analog and digital. This necessitates either having an analog satellite receiver or a digital satellite receiver. Analog satellite television is being replaced by digital satellite television and the latter is becoming available in a better quality known as high-definition television.

"No Depression in Heaven" (or simply "No Depression") is a song that was first recorded by the original Carter Family in 1936 during the Great Depression.  Although A.P. Carter has frequently been credited as the author, some sources attribute the song to James David Vaughan.Bill C. Malone: Don't Get Above Your Raisin' – Country Music and the Southern Working Class; University of Illinois Press , 2002 (ISBN 0-252-02678-0)
Over the years the song has been recorded by artists as diverse as the New Lost City Ramblers and Sheryl Crow.  Uncle Tupelo made the song the title cut of their 1990 album, No Depression.  Since then, the title has become synonymous with alternative country music.  What is now described as the "No Depression movement" No Depression Movement from the Survey of American Popular Music by Frank Hoffmann and modified for the web by Robert Birkline is covered by many fan publications including the magazine No Depression.

Oberia Coffin (December 1, 1883? – October 18, 2006) was an American woman claimed to have been aged [tpl]Age in years and days|1883|12|1|2006|10|18[/tpl] at her death, which if true could have made her the world's oldest person, more than six years older than the official titleholder at the time, Elizabeth Bolden, who died aged 116 and 118 days, and even older than Jeanne Calment, the world's validated oldest person ever. No early-life documents, however, have been located.
Born in Dalby Springs, Texas, Coffin had no birth certificate and no known living relatives. Her social security records, however, listed her as born December 1, 1883. At the time of her death, Coffin was the second-oldest claimant in the United States and seventh-oldest claimant in the world overall (see longevity claims for list), although officially the 'oldest person' title belonged to Elizabeth Bolden, who, unlike Coffin, has been located in the 1900 census.
Coffin was said to have been the oldest of 13 or 14 children; her father was Pink Coffin. She moved to a nursing home in De Kalb, Texas in 1992.
Coffin eventually had a leg amputated and, in her last years, was blind and deaf. A stranger, Gwendolyn Traylor, became her legal guardian when Oberia Coffin was reportedly being 'left for dead'. Coffin lived almost a decade longer.

Patricia Wentworth (born Dora Amy Elles; November 10, 1878 - January 28, 1961) was a British crime fiction writer.
She was born in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, India (then the British Raj). She was educated privately and at Blackheath High School in London. After the death of her first husband, George F. Dillon, in 1906, she settled in Camberley, Surrey. She married George Oliver Turnbull in 1920 and they had one daughter.
She wrote a series of 32 crime novels (classic-style whodunits) many featuring Miss Silver, the first of which was published in 1928, and the last of which was published in the year of her death. Miss Silver is sometimes compared to Jane Marple, the elderly detective created by Agatha Christie. Miss Silver is a retired governess who becomes a private detective. She works closely with Scotland Yard, especially Inspector Frank Abbott. She is fond of quoting the poet Tennyson. "Miss Silver is well known in the better circles of society, and she finds entree to the troubled households of the upper classes with little difficulty.  In most of Miss Silver's cases there is a young couple whose romance seems ill fated because of the murder to be solved, but in Miss Silver's competent hands the case is solved, the young couple are exonerated, and all is right in this very traditional world."Swanson, Jean and Dean James, Killer Books: A Reader's Guide to Exploring the Popular World of Mystery and Suspense.  Berkley, New York: 1998. Wentworth also wrote 34 books outside of that series.
She won the Melrose prize in 1910 for her first novel A Marriage Under The Terror, set in the French Revolution.James Milne, "Best Novel Competition Won by a Woman With Her First Book: Some Inferences Drawn", New York Times, April 9, 1910 http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9C04E5D61430E233A2575AC0A9629C946196D6CF

[[T-mount]]
CATEGORIES: Lens mounts, Film and video technology

The T-mount is a standard lens mount for cameras and other optical assemblies.
The T2 version is a screw mount using a male M42x0.75 metric thread on the lens with a flange focal distance of 55 mm and a mating female thread on a camera adapter or other optical component.  This thread form is referred to as T-thread.  (This should not be confused with the M42 lens mount which is also 42 mm, but has a 1 mm thread pitch.)
The "T" is said to stand for Tamron, a Japanese manufacturer that released in 1957 the first of a line of aftermarket camera lenses that fit 35 mm SLR cameras built by various manufacturers using their universal T-mount. On the first model, the T-mount used a M37x0.75 thread; Tamron's M42x0.75 T-thread didn't appear on the market until about 1962. The company referred to it variously as a T-mount, T-thread, T-adapter, or a T-400, but not as a T-2. The proprietary lens mount of each camera manufacturer was adapted to the T-mount thread with a simple adapter.  Thus a retailer could stock a small number of expensive lenses that would fit a large number of camera brands using a selection of inexpensive adapters.
The original T-mount slides onto a T-mount lens. It is secured only by 3 set screws that match a channel on the lens mount, such that the lens barrel is not deformed by the set screws and can therefore be removed with no damage.
As a common mechanical interface, the T-mount allows components of various manufacturers to be interchanged and assembled. The T-mount is a solely mechanical specification.  Electrical or mechanical connections (such as for autofocus) are generally not provided, although Sigma's YS Mount featured an automatic diaphragm coupling.
Besides cameras, T-mounts are used in optical breadboard prototyping components as well as telescope and microscope attachments.  The T-mount is also the standard way to mount a camera to a microscope to photograph pathological specimen slides or to a 1.25" telescope eyepiece.

Operation Herrick is the codename under which all British operations in the War in Afghanistan have been conducted since 2002. It consists of the British contribution to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and support to the American-led Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  Since 2003, Operation Herrick has increased in size and breadth to match ISAF's growing geographical intervention in Afghanistan.
Operation Herrick superseded two previous efforts in Afghanistan.  The first of these was Operation Veritas, which consisted of support to the War in Afghanistan in October 2001.  The last major action of this was a sweep in east Afghanistan by 1,700 Royal Marines during Operation Jacana, which ended in mid-2002. The second was Operation Fingal, which involved leadership and a 2,000 strong contribution for a newly formed ISAF in Kabul after December 2001.  Command was subsequently transferred to Turkey several months later and the British contingent was scaled back to 300. Since then, all operations in Afghanistan have been conducted under Operation Herrick.
In December 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron announced that 3,800 troops - almost half of the force serving in Helmand Province - would be withdrawn during 2013 with numbers to fall to approximately 5,200.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-2077856 Combat operations are projected to end in 2014.

[[Binaural fusion]]

CATEGORIES: Cognition

Binaural fusion (or binaural integration) is a cognitive process that involves the "fusion" of different auditory information presented binaurally, or to each ear. In humans, this process is essential in understanding speech as one ear may pick up more information about the speech stimuli than the other.
The process of binaural fusion is important for computing the location of sound sources in the horizontal plane (sound localization), and it is important for sound segregation.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Koch |first2=Ursula |title=Dynamics of binaural processing in the mammalian sound localization pathway--the role of GABA(B) receptors |journal=Hearing Research |volume=279 |pages=43–50 |year=2011 |pmid=21447375 |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.03.013[/tpl] Sound segregation refers the ability to identify acoustic components from one or more sound sources.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Andrew |last2=McDermott |first2=Josh |title=Spatial cues alone produce inaccurate sound segregation: The effect of inter aural time differences |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=132 |pages=357–368 |year=2012[/tpl] The binaural auditory system is highly dynamic and capable of rapidly adjusting tuning properties depending on the context in which sounds are heard. Each eardrum moves one-dimensionally; the auditory brain analyzes and compares movements of both eardrums to extract physical cues and synthesize auditory objects.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009[/tpl]
When stimulation from a sound reaches the ear, the eardrum deflects in a mechanical fashion, and the three middle ear bones (ossicles) transmit the mechanical signal to the cochlea, where hair cells transform the mechanical signal into an electrical signal. The auditory nerve, also called the cochlear nerve, then transmits action potentials to the central auditory nervous system.
In binaural fusion, inputs from both ears integrate and fuse to create a complete auditory picture at the brainstem. Therefore, the signals sent to the central auditory nervous system are representative of this complete picture, integrated information from both ears instead of a single ear.
Binaural fusion is responsible for what is known as the cocktail party effect, the ability of a listener to hear a particular speaker against other interfering voices.
The binaural squelch effect is a result of nuclei of the brainstem processing timing, amplitude, and spectral differences between the two ears. Sounds are integrated and then separated into auditory objects. For this effect to take place, neural integration from both sides is required.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Tyler |first1=R.S. |last2=Dunn |first2=C.C. |last3=Witt |first3=S.A. |last4=Preece |first4=J.P. |title=Update on bilateral cochlear implantation |journal=Current Opinion in Otolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery |volume=11 |pages=388–393 |year=2003 |pmid=14502072 |issue=5[/tpl]

[[Brain Donor]]

Brain Donor are an English power trio, formed in July 1999 by Julian Cope and two Spiritualized members, Doggen Foster (lead guitar) and drummer Kevin 'Kevlar' Bales. Wearing full make-up in the kabuki style of early KISS, the band's curious aims are said to be a desire to combine Van Halen-esque heavy metal with garage rock in the style of Blue Cheer, and Japanese bands High Rise and Mainliner.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
The band's debut album Love Peace & Fuck was hammered by the press for its gratuitous soloing and guitar heavy production. But with the recent return of heavy metal values to underground music via re-appraissals of Blue Cheer and Sir Lord Baltimore, Love Peace & Fuck has since come to be regarded by the new American Underground as something of a classic,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] and a US compilation album of the band was released in 2005, on San Francisco's Mister E. Records. The same year, a song entitled "Messages" from the second Brain Donor album, Too Freud To Rock 'n' Roll, Too Jung To Die, appeared in the American film, The Lost.
Bales has since been replaced by new drummer, known as Mr. E.

É (Cuneiform: [tpl]cuneiform|𒂍[/tpl])The word is phonologically simply /e/; the acute accent is an assyriological convention specifying the corresponding cuneiform sign. is the Sumerian word or symbol for house or temple.
The Sumerian term  É.GAL  ("palace", literally "big house") denoted a city's main building. 
É.LUGAL ("king's house") was used synonymously. In the texts of Lagash, the É.GAL is the center of the ensi's administration of the city, and the site of the city archives.Aage Westenholz, Old Sumerian and old Akkadian texts in Philadelphia, Volume 3 of Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, Volume 1 of Bibliotheca Mesopotamica,  Museum Tusculanum Press, 1987, ISBN 978-87-7289-008-1,p. 96
Sumerian É.GAL "palace" is the probable etymology of Semitic words for "palace, temple", such as Hebrew היכל heikhal,The New Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew-English Lexicon by Francis Brown et al. (ISBN 0-913573-20-5), p. 228 and Arabic هيكل haykal. It has thus been speculated that the word É originated from something akin to *hai or *ˀai, especially since the cuneiform sign È is used for /a/ in Eblaite.
The term temen appearing frequently after É in names of ziggurats is translated as "foundation pegs", apparently the first step in the construction process of a house; compare, for example, verses 551–561 of the account of the construction of E-ninnu:
Temen has been occasionally compared to Greek temenos "holy precinct", but since the latter has a well established Indo-European etymology (see temple), the comparison is either mistaken, or at best describes a case of popular etymology or convergence.
In E-temen-an-ki, "the temple of the foundation pegs of heaven and earth", temen has been taken to refer to an axis mundi connecting earth to heaven (thus re-enforcing the Tower of Babel connection), but the term re-appears in several other temple names, referring to their physical stability rather than, or as well as, to a mythological world axis; compare the Egyptian notion of Djed.

Baška Voda ([tpl]IPA-sh|bâʃkaː vɔ̌da|pron[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-it|Porto Bestonio[/tpl]), is a municipality in Croatia in the Split-Dalmatia County. It has a population of 2,775 (2011 census), 96.2% of which are Croats.[tpl]Croatian Census 2011|E|17[/tpl] It is located on the Adriatic coastline of Dalmatia 10 km northwest of Makarska.
In ancient times, the little village of Bast nestled by a freshwater spring which supplied the Biokovo area. During the 18th century, after the expulsion of the Turks, its inhabitant left the slopes of St. Ilija's (Elijah's) Ridge and descended to the shore, where they established Baška Voda, today a well-known tourist resort on the Makarska Riviera.
The name Baška Voda is mythological in origin and is linked with Biston, the patriarch of the Thracian Biston tribe, son of Ares, the Greek god of war, and the goddess Calliope, protectress of water. The military fort and springs near Baška Voda bear out this theory. Some of the richest archaeological sites that have yielded finds from Roman times are on the heights of Gradina and its surroundings.
These include burial sites with urns, lamps, jewellery, coins with the head of Alexander Severus Aurelianus and headstones bearing the names of 13 of the ancient inhabitants of Baška Voda, the loveliest of which commemorates a boy called Ursinus, who died in a shipwreck between 100 and 150 AD.
Baška Voda first appeared on the “Coranelli” geographical map, produced in 1688, as “Basca”. It was a small village which thrived on agriculture and fishing. The Late Baroque church of St. Lovro (Laurence), built in 1750, probably occupies an Antique site, while the parish church of St. Nikola (Nicholas), the patron saint of travellers and sailors, was built in the early 20th century.

Fleay, Dr. Alfred Senier (1853-I918) (later Professor of Chemistry in the University of Galway), Mr. Herbert Burrows, Mr. Edward Clarkson, and Mr. Alfred Lowe (Carr, 1928-1929, pp.360). which resolved "to constitute a society of about twenty and to include ladies; the society to meet fortnightly, on Mondays at 8 o'clock, at the rooms of the Spelling Reform Association…"Carr (1928-1929), pp.360.
Amongst other things, the rules of the Society stipulated:
According to H. Wildon Carr, in choosing a name for the society, it was:
The Society's first president was Mr. Shadworth H. Hodgson. He was president for fourteen years from 1880 until 1894, when he proposed Dr. Bernard Bosanquet as his replacement.
Professor Alan Willard Brown http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/15/obituaries/dr-alan-w-brown.html noted in 1947 that 'Society's members were not all men of established intellectual position. It welcomed young minds just out of university as well as older amateur philosophers with serious interests and purposes. But many distinguished men were faithful members, and not the least virtue of the society has remained, even to the present day, the opportunity it affords for different intellectual generations to meet in an atmosphere of reasoned and responsible discussion.'."Brown (1947), p.249.
The Society continues to meet fortnightly at the University of London's Senate House to hear and discuss philosophical papers from all philosophical traditions. The current President is Sarah Broadie, a Professor of Philosophy at University of St Andrews.The Executive Committee, Aristotelian Society website
Its other work includes giving grants to support the organisation of academic conferences in philosophy, and, with Oxford University Press, the production of the 'Lines of Thought' series of philosophical monographs.
Its annual conference, organised since 1918 in conjunction with the Mind Association (publishers of the philosophical journal Mind), known as the Joint Session of the Aristotelian Society and the Mind Association, is hosted by different university departments in turn in July each year.

Maama Molitika (26 August 1974) was a Tongan rugby union footballer. He is 6'5". He has played numerous times for the national Tongan team, making his debut in June 1997 against Fiji. He was also in the Pacific Islanders rugby union team squad that toured Europe in 2006. He played as a blind-side flanker.
In 2002–03 he was Bridgend's joint top try scorer of the season, and was a part of the team that went onto win the Welsh Premiership for the first time in the club's history. Following the regionalisation of Welsh rugby in 2003–04, he joined the now defunct Celtic Warriors, and played the one season that the region existed for, including playing for them in the Heineken Cup. After the Warriors were dissolved at the end of the 2003–04 season, he signed to play for Harlequin F.C. in the English premiership. He then moved to Welsh region the Cardiff Blues.
In 2006 he went to Japan and played for Japanese team IBM Big Blue. 
However, it was announced in 2007 that he would be returning to the Cardiff Blues to cover for players that would be absent due to Wales' World Cup campaign, as well as covering for any injured players.
On his return to the Cardiff Blues, Molitika dispelled previous concerns that his standard of play would have decreased from a year in the less-competitive Japanese League, with some outstanding performances for the Blues. Molitika had established himself as the Blues' first-choice flanker with his effective ball-carrying and his tireless work-rate winning much praise from coaches and fans alike.  
Maama in the 2012-13 season will be hired by the Rugby San Donà, a newly promoted Italian team that were excelling after winning the Serie A 2011-2012. Maama became a very important man for the Venetian team.
Maama also has a cousin, Haloti Molitika, who is currently playing for Worcester Rugby Club's Academy side.
Maama also coaches local rugby Team Sully Sports Rfc who play in the WRU Div 7 league.

[[Latakia (tobacco)]]

CATEGORIES: Pipe smoking, Tobacco, Latakia

Latakia tobacco ([tpl]lang-ar|تبغ اللاذقية[/tpl]) is a specially prepared tobacco originally produced in Syria and named after the port city of Latakia. Now the tobacco is mainly produced in Cyprus. It is initially sun-cured like other Turkish tobaccoshttp://tobacconistuniversity.org/tobacco-college/pipe-special-types3.asp and then further cured over a pine or oak wood fire, which gives it an intense smokey-peppery taste and smell. Too strong for most people's tastes to smoke straight, it is used as a "condiment" or "blender" (a basic tobacco mixed with other tobaccos to create a blend), especially in English, Balkan, and some American Classic blends.
Latakia is the result of a process whereby the leaves are cured over controlled fires of aromatic woods and fragrant herbs. Latakia is mainly grown in Cyprus and northern Syria. After the leaves are harvested and dried, they are hung in tightly closed barns and smoke-cured. Small smoldering fires of oak and pine fill the barn with smoke, and covering the leaves with smoke particles.
Latakia was "discovered" when a bumper crop resulted in surplus, and the excess tobacco was stored in the rafters. The peasant farmers traditionally used wood for cooking and heating in the winter. The smoke-cured tobacco's unique flavoring and taste was discovered the following spring.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] Latakia produces a very rich, heavy taste, with an aroma that has a "smoky" characteristic. Latakia is an ingredient of traditional English mixtures. The content can vary from a few percent to about 40-50%, or even more. A few smokers like it at 100%.
A modern perfume called Fumerie Turque (Turkish Smoke) was created by French company Serge Lutens, reproducing a fragrance in emulation of Latakia tobacco.Fumerie Turque

Ithaca Intersystems was a microcomputer manufacturer in the 1970s and 1980s, located in Ithaca, New York.  The early years drew on engineering talent from Cornell University when the founders worked in a small rented space in the Collegtown neighborhood adjacent to the university campus.  They initially produced the Ithaca Intersystems DPS-1 S-100 bus, Z80-based computer.  As a large commercial success, the company moved to larger spaces outside of town, and designed and produced a larger system, the Zilog Z8002-based DPS-8000.  This used the Coherent Unix operating system from Mark Williams Company. The company languished in the 1980s, not being part of the domination of the IBM PC and PC clones.
This was one of the last S100 computers to have front panel switches like the original Altair.

CATEGORIES: Filters, Rooms

Air showers are specialised antechambers which personnel need to pass through before entering cleanrooms in order to decontaminate. Decontamination is done by clearing off dust and dirt particles from bodies of cleanroom personnel to minimize contamination of equipment or products.
Designs to an air shower unit include single-side shower, double-side shower, three-side shower, and top shower. Spraying wind speed is around 25 m/s or above through stainless steel nozzles. HEPA filters are generally used to filter out particles greater than 0.3 micrometres in size from the shower air.
In fields where sterile or dust-free conditions are critical - for example, life science and biomedical research, pharmaceutical, parenteral drug, microelectronics, aerospace and precision manufacturing — air showers are considered essential equipment.

Live in Japan is a 1982 double live album by English guitarist, composer and improvisor Fred Frith. It was recorded during an improvised solo performance tour of Japan in July 1981. The double album was a limited edition release of 1,000 by Recommended Records Japan on two LP records in a black corrugated box containing posters, artwork and booklets in English and Japanese. It was also released as two single LPs, entitled Live in Japan, Vol. 1 and Live in Japan, Vol. 2.
On Live in Japan, subtitled "The Guitars on the Table Approach", Frith continued his pioneering guitar work he began on his landmark [tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r637538|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Guitar Solos |work=AllMusic.com |first=Sean |last=Westergaard |accessdate=20 June 2011[/tpl] 1974 album Guitar Solos. Comprising eight improvised pieces taken from four concerts in Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka and Maebashi in 1981, Frith used an old 1961 solid body Burns guitar, built by British craftsman Jim Burns, a homemade six- and eight-string double-neck guitar created by a friend Charles Fletcher, and a battered violin. The guitars were laid flat on a table and "played" by plucking, scraping and beating the strings with a variety of found objects. Frith also wore a WW II pilot's throat microphone to amplify his periodic vocal utterances. The same microphone had been used by Frith during some of the Massacre concerts held earlier in 1981.

Herbert Deinert (December 13, 1930 – August 4, 2010) was a Professor Emeritus in the Department of German Studies, Cornell University. He was a noted scholar focusing on German literature and intellectual history since the time of Martin Luther.  His early work centered on the influence of Rilke on music but later focused on the works of Goethe (especially Faust), Hesse, Kafka, Mann, Brecht.  More recently he has helped to understand the influence of Protestantism on Germany directly after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Writing on the subject, Deinert said:
Many forces contributed to the collapse of the GDR as a separate state, the final and most visible was the mass exodus via Hungary and  Czechoslovakia.  The Communist regime resisted change when change was taking place in most of East Germany's neighbors to the east and southeast.  But an ever increasing number of increasingly restless citizens insisted on it and, not given a chance to change matters by improving the system, effected the most radical change of all: they swept away an unresponsive, cynical and calcified government.  In this process  the role of one institution stands out, that of the Protestant Church... http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/hd11/ProtestantRevol.html

[[Joseph Taylor (actor)]]
CATEGORIES: 1652 deaths, English male stage actors, 17th-century English male actors, Male Shakespearean actors, Boy players, King's Men (playing company), Year of birth unknown

Joseph Taylor (died 1652) was a 17th-century actor. As the successor of Richard Burbage with the King's Men, he was arguably the most important actor in the later Jacobean and the Caroline eras.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 486.
Taylor started as a child actor with the Children of the Chapel in the first decade of the century. As he matured he remained in the profession, with the Lady Elizabeth's Men and Prince Charles's Men. With those companies, he developed into an important leading man.
Richard Burbage died in March 1619; Taylor joined the King's Men the next month, and over the coming years he acted all the major roles of the Shakespearean canon. According to James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), Taylor "acted Hamlet incomparably well" and was noted for his Iago. He was also famous for the parts of Paris in The Roman Actor (Philip Massinger), Ferdinand in The Duchess of Malfi (John Webster), and Mosca in Volpone, Face in The Alchemist, and Truewit in Epicene (all by Ben Jonson). Taylor starred in many King's men plays; he played the protagonists in Massinger's The Picture and Arthur Wilson's The Swisser; he was the Duke in Lodowick Carlell's The Deserving Favourite.
Taylor and John Lowin became leaders of the King's Men after the deaths of Henry Condell (1627) and John Heminges (1630). At the same time (1630), Taylor gained a share in the Blackfriars Theatre, and two shares in the Globe. Together with Cuthbert Burbage, Richard Robinson and Winifred (d.1642), his wife, William Heminges, and John Lowin, Taylor filed a Bill of Complaint on 28 January 1632 in the Court of Requests against the owner of the Globe, Sir Matthew Brend, in order to obtain confirmation of an extension of the 31-year lease originally granted by Sir Matthew Brend's father, Nicholas Brend.[tpl]Harvnb|Berry|1987|p=197[/tpl].
He was one of the King's Men who signed the dedication of the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647.
Taylor and other King's Men struggled during the Commonwealth period when the theatres were officially closed; they performed when and where they could. On 1 January 1649, Taylor, Lowin, and other company members were arrested while acting Rollo Duke of Normandy at the Cockpit Theatre. (Taylor played the title role.) They were incarcerated for a short time, then released.Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, "New Light on English Acting Companies in 1646, 1648, and 1660," Review of English Studies Vol. 42 No. 168 (November 1991), pp. 487-509.
In 1652 a special publication of John Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase was issued; the proceeds went to Lowin and Taylor to relieve their financial need. Taylor and Lowin had played the roles of Belleur and Mirabel in the King's Men's production of the play. The Wild Goose Chase had been lost and was left out of the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio, then rediscovered and published.
In the 25 cast lists that were added to the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679, Taylor is mentioned in 18, for the following plays:
His total is second only to Lowin's 21. The lists for The Coxcomb and The Humorous Lieutenant refer to the companies to which Taylor belonged early in his career; the other 16 refer to the King's Men. On 11 of the lists, Taylor is mentioned first, an index of his standing as the company's leading player. (For comparison, Burbage is on seven of the lists, and always in first place.)
The date of Taylor's death is not known with certainty, though he was buried on 4 November 1652.

This is a list of Sheriffs and High Sheriffs of Rutland. The Sheriff is the oldest secular office under the Crown: there has been a Sheriff of Rutland since 1129. Formerly the Sheriff was the principal law enforcement officer in the county but over the centuries most of the responsibilities associated with the post have been transferred elsewhere or are now defunct, so that its functions are now largely ceremonial. Under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the office previously known as Sheriff was retitled High Sheriff. The High Sheriff changes every March. The High Sheriff changes every March.
After some 22 years as part of Leicestershire, Rutland was split away in 1996 as a Unitary Authority with its own shrievalty, thus establishing the separate High Sheriff of Rutland.

The Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI) is an open-source JavaScript library for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as Ajax, DHTML, and DOM scripting. YUI includes several core CSS resources. It is available under a BSD License.[ref]
</ref>
Development on YUI began in 2005 and Yahoo! properties such as My Yahoo! and the Yahoo! front page began using YUI in the summer of that year. YUI was released for public use in February 2006. It is actively developed by a core team of Yahoo! engineers.
In September 2009, Yahoo! released YUI 3, a new version of YUI rebuilt from the ground up to modernize the library and incorporate lessons learned from YUI 2. Among the enhancements are a CSS selector driven engine, like jQuery, for retrieving DOM elements, a greater emphasis on granularity of modules, a smaller seed file that loads other modules when necessary, and a variety of syntactic changes intended to make writing code faster and easier.
The YUI Library project at Yahoo! was founded by Thomas Sha and sponsored internally by Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang; its principal architects have been Sha, Adam Moore, and Matt Sweeney.  The library's developers maintain the YUIBlog; the YUI community discusses the library and implementations in its community forum.

[[Replantation]]

CATEGORIES: Surgery, Amputations

Replantation has been defined by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand as "the surgical reattachment of a body part, most commonly a finger, hand or arm, that has been completely cut from a person's body".http://www.assh.org/Public/HandConditions/Pages/Replantation.aspx 
Replantation of amputated parts has been performed on fingers, hands, forearms, arms, toes, feet,  legs, ears, avulsed scalp injuries, a face, lips, penis and a  tongue.
The repair of the nerves and vessels (artery & vein) of the amputated part is essential for survival and function of the replanted part of the body. Using an operating microscope for replantatation is termed microvascular replantation. However, vessels and nerves of large amputated parts (e.g. arm and forearm) may be reconnected using loupe or no magnification.

Philip Norman Hocking (27 October 1925 – 17 August 2008) was a British Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom.  He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Coventry South from 1959 to 1964.
During his tenure in the House of Commons he was Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Foreign Office. Hocking's victory in Coventry was certainly an achievement as the constituency was seen as a fairly strong Labour Party area and indeed he remains to this day the only Conservative to have won the seat. He became a close friend of Denys Bullard, another Conservative MP with agricultural interests whose seat depended on a small and hard-won majority in a difficult constituency. Hocking's most memorable contribution to the politics of the day was when he appeared on BBC Television following the Profumo Affair. Hocking was asked if Harold Macmillan was finished politically, Hocking compared Macmillan to a pheasant once it has been shot. "It may have been shot," he said, "but it is still going to run and run." Having replaced Elaine Burton at the 1959 general election with the song "High Hopes" as his anthem, Hocking lost the 1964 election to William Wilson.
He lived in the Cotswolds throughout the rest of life, although latterly he had spent much time in America.

James Woods starred as the adult Joshua, Gabrielle Lazure as his wife, and Alan Arkin as Joshua's father.  It was directed by Ted Kotcheff who had previously directed Richler's The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.

The cast included Michael Sarrazin as Kevin Hornby (Pauline's brother), Robert Joy as Colin Fraser (Pauline's first husband), Linda Sorenson as Esther Shapiro (Joshua's mother), Alan Scarfe as Jack Trimble, Ken Campbell as Sidney Murdoch, Kate Trotter as Jane Trimble, Alexander Knox as Senator Hornby, and Eric Kimmel as young Joshua.

[[Magnetic dip]]
CATEGORIES: Geomagnetism, Orientation

Magnetic dip, dip angle, or magnetic inclination is the angle made with the horizontal by the Earth's magnetic field lines. This angle varies at different points on the Earth's surface. Positive values of inclination indicate that the magnetic field of the Earth is pointing downward, into the Earth, at the point of measurement, and negative values indicate that it is pointing upward. The dip angle is in principle the angle made by the needle of a vertically held compass, though in practice ordinary compass needles may be weighted against dip or may be unable to move freely in the correct plane. The value can be measured more reliably with a special instrument typically known as a dip circle. 
Dip angle was discovered by the engineer Georg Hartmann in 1544. A method of measuring it with a dip circle was described by Robert Norman in England in 1581.
