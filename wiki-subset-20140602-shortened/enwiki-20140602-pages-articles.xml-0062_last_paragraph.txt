John Boynton Priestley, OM (13 September 1894 – 14 August 1984), known as J. B. Priestley, was an English novelist, playwright and broadcaster.
His Yorkshire background is reflected in much of his fiction, notably in The Good Companions (1929), which first brought him to wide public notice. Many of his plays are structured around a time-slip, and he went on to develop a new theory of time, with different dimensions that link past, present and future.
In 1940, he broadcast a series of short propaganda talks that were credited with saving civilian morale during the Battle of Britain. His left-wing beliefs brought him into conflict with the government, but influenced the birth of the Welfare State.

Evans, from Toronto, Ontario, and his friend Henry Woodward, made the light bulb by sending electricity through a filament made of carbon. 
The two men had patented it but did not have enough money to develop their invention, so they sold their US patent 181,613 to Thomas Edison for US$5,000 ($US 100,000 in 2006 dollars).[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl]  They also granted Edison an exclusive licence to their equivalent Canadian patent.

Alfred Carl Fuller (January 13, 1885 – December 4, 1973) was a Canadian-born American businessman. He was the original "Fuller Brush Man."
Fuller was born on an Annapolis Valley farm in Welsford, Kings County, Nova Scotia. He moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1903 at the age of 18 to live with his sister. He went to work for the Somerville Brush and Mop Company, and became a successful salesman for them.Daniel H. Pink, "To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others,"   Riverhead, 2012, pp 11-13 In 1906, with a $75.00 investment, he started the Fuller Brush Company in Hartford, Connecticut, selling brushes door to door. By 1919, the company had achieved sales of more than $1 million per year.
Fuller Brush went on to be recognized throughout North America, even inspiring two comedy films, The Fuller Brush Man (1948) and The Fuller Brush Girl (1950).   In 1961 Fuller recorded the secrets to his success on Folkways Records on an album entitled, Careers in Selling: An Interview with Alfred C.

The term was popularized in the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, wherein thoughtcrime is the criminal act of holding unspoken beliefs or doubts that oppose or question the ruling party. In the book, the government attempts to control not only the speech and actions, but also the thoughts of its subjects. To entertain unacceptable thought is known as  crimethink in Newspeak, the ideologically purified dialect of the party.[tpl]Citation |last=Orwell |first=George |last2=Rovere |first2=Richard Halworth |title=The Orwell Reader: Fiction, Essays, and Reportage |page=409 |year=1984 |origyear=1956 |location=San Diego |publisher=Harcourt, Brace |isbn=0-15-670176-6 [/tpl].

[[Regin]]

CATEGORIES: Nibelung tradition, Norse dwarves, Völsung cycle

Reginn, often Anglicized as Regin, in Norse mythology, was the son of Hreiðmarr and foster father of Sigurd. His brothers are Fafnir and Ótr. When Loki mistakenly kills Ótr, Hreiðmarr demands to be repaid with the amount of gold it takes to fill Ótr's skin and cover the outside. Loki takes this gold from the dwarf Andvari, who curses it and especially the ring Andvaranaut. Fafnir kills his father for this gold, and Regin gets none of it and becomes smith to the king. He eventually becomes Sigurd's foster father, and teaches him many languages as well as sports, chess, and runes.[tpl]Harvnb|Byock|1990|p=56[/tpl] 
Regin had all wisdom and deftness of hand. Of his two brothers, he has the ability to work iron as well as silver and gold and he makes many beautiful and useful things. While Sigurd is living with Regin, Regin challenges Sigurd's respect in the kingdom. He tells Sigurd to ask for a horse. Sigurd asks the advice of an old man in the forest, and the old man shows him how to get a horse that is descended from Sleipnir, the eight legged horse of Odin.[tpl]Harvnb|Byock|1990|pp=55–57[/tpl] Regin continues to goad Sigurd, this time into killing Regin's brother Fafnir. He offers to make a sword for Sigurd, but Sigurd broke every sword Regin forged for him by striking at an anvil. Sigurd retrieves the broken pieces of his father Sigmund's sword, Gram, and brings them to Regin. Regin repairs the sword and gives it back to Sigurd.  When Sigurd again tests the blade by striking the anvil, the anvil this time is split down to its base, and when Sigurd places a piece of wool in a stream, the current pushing the wool against the sword was enough to cause the blade to cut it in two.  Sigurd is finally very pleased with Regin's repaired weapon.[tpl]Harvnb|Byock|1990|pp=59–60[/tpl] 
After using Gram to kill Fafnir, Sigurd returns to ask Regin what to do. Regin instructs him to roast the heart of Fafnir, his brother, and let him eat it. As juice from the dragon's heart foamed out, Sigurd tested it with his finger to see if it was done cooking.  As the blood touches his tongue, Sigurd understands the speech of birds, who warn him that Regin will kill him. Before he lets any of this happen, Sigurd first wields Gram and cuts off Regin's head.[tpl]Harvnb|Byock|1990|pp=65–66[/tpl]
The Norwegian Thidrekssaga relates a slightly different tale, with Regin as the dragon and Mimir as his brother and foster father to Sigurd.
In the operatic cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen, by Richard Wagner, the role of Regin is played by the Nibelung dwarf Mime, brother of Alberich (the Nibelung who forged the cursed ring out of the Rhinegold). Except for the change in name, probably inspired by the Thidrekssaga, the story of Regin, Sigurd and Fafner in Wagner's opera Siegfried follows closely the text of the Eddas. However in this version Mime is unable to reforge the sword, only one who doesn't know fear can forge Nothung. This is Siegfried.

He owned a house of glittering gold and flashing gems built by Regin and guarded by Fafnir. After Otr was accidentally killed by Loki, the Æsir repaid Hreiðmarr with Andvari's gold and the cursed ring Andvarinaut. Fafnir and Regin killed Hreiðmarr for the ring. Fafnir decided he wanted Andvarinaut for himself, so he turned into a dragon and drove Regin away.

[[Heaviside step function]]

CATEGORIES: Special functions, Generalized functions

The Heaviside step function, or the unit step function, usually denoted by H (but sometimes u or θ), is a discontinuous function whose value is zero for negative argument and one for positive argument.
It seldom matters what value is used for H(0), since H is mostly used as a distribution. Some common choices can be seen below.
The function is used in the mathematics of control theory and signal processing to represent a signal that switches on at a specified time and stays switched on indefinitely. It is also used in structural mechanics together with the Dirac delta function to describe different types of structural loads. It was named after the English polymath Oliver Heaviside.
It is the cumulative distribution function of a random variable which is almost surely 0. (See constant random variable.)
The Heaviside function is the integral of the Dirac delta function: H′ = δ. This is sometimes written as
although this expansion may not hold (or even make sense) for x = 0, depending on which formalism one uses to give meaning to integrals involving δ.

In Norse mythology, Völsung ([tpl]lang-non|Vǫlsungr[/tpl]) was the son of Rerir and the eponymous ancestor of the ill-fortuned Völsung clan ([tpl]lang|non|Vǫlsungar[/tpl]), which includes the well known Norse hero Sigurð. He was murdered by the Geatish king Siggeir and later avenged by one of his sons, Sigmund, and his daughter Signy, who was married to Siggeir.
Völsung's story is recorded in the Völsung Cycle, a series of legends about the clan. The earliest extant versions of the cycle were recorded in medieval Iceland; the tales of the cycle were expanded with local Scandinavian folklore, including that of Helgi Hundingsbane (which appears to originally have been part of the separate tradition of the Ylfings), and form the material of the epic poems in the Elder Edda and of [tpl]lang|is|Völsunga saga[/tpl], which preserves material from lost poems.

[[Andvaranaut]]

In Norse mythology, Andvaranaut (Andvari's Gift), first owned by Andvari, is a magical ring that can make gold.
The mischievous god Loki tricked Andvari into giving him the Andvaranaut. In revenge, Andvari cursed the ring to bring misfortune and destruction to whoever possessed it. Loki quickly gave the cursed Andvaranaut to Hreidmar, King of the Dwarves, as reparation for having inadvertently killed Hreidmar's son, Ótr. Ótr's brother, Fafnir, then murdered Hreidmar and took the ring, turning into a dragon to guard it. Sigurd (Siegfried) later killed Fafnir and gave Andvaranaut to Brynhildr (Brünnehilde). Queen Grimhild of the Nibelungs then manipulated Sigurd and Brynhildr into marrying her children, bringing Andvaranaut's curse into her family.

[[Grimhild]]

CATEGORIES: Burgundian queens consort, Nibelung tradition, People in Norse mythology and legends, Witchcraft in folklore and mythology

In Norse mythology, Grimhild (masked battlehttp://www.nordicnames.de/wiki/Gr%C3%ADmRhttp://www.nordicnames.de/wiki/Hildr) was a beautiful but evil woman.  She was married to king Gjúki, of southern Rhine, Burgundy. She had three sons, Gunnar, Hogni and Guttorm, and a daughter, Gudrun. She is the sorceress who gave Sigurd a magic potion that makes him forget that he ever married his wife Brünnehilde, so that he will marry Gudrun, her daughter. But she did not stop there. She wanted her son Gunnar to marry Brünnehilde, but she refused to marry him, and she would only marry the man who could cross the ring of flames she put up around herself. So Grimhild talks Sigurd into helping Gunnar marry Brünnehilde.  Since Sigurd was the only one who could cross the flames him and Gunnar switched bodies, so Gunnar's body could cross the flames. Brünnehilde then married Gunnar, because she made a promise. When Brünnehilde learned that Sigurd had betrayed her with another woman (Gudrun), not knowing he had been bewitched into doing so by Grimhild, she was out to get revenge.  She ended up killing Sigurd and herself by the end of the saga. Grimhild then made Gudrun marry Brünnehilde's brother Alti. Gudrun didn't want to marry him because she knew he would end up killing her brothers. This was the last that we hear of Grimhild in the Völsunga saga; it is probable that the ring's curse also brings misfortune and even death upon Grimhild herself.[tpl]cite web|author=Jimmy Joe |url=http://www.timelessmyths.com/norse/witches.html#Grimhild |title=Witches |publisher=Timelessmyths.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06[/tpl]  
The name was also given to another beautiful, evil sorceress woman who married king Áli of Alfheim (modern Bohuslän) in Illuga saga Gríðarfóstra. King Ali had a daughter before he married Grimhild, named Signy. Signy had a daughter with a king she had married but he died in battle, so she returned home to her father, with her daughter. Grimhild poisoned the king and then had ruled the kingdom in such an evil manner that it was laid waste. She then banned Signy and Hildr, her daughter, from the kingdom and put a curse on them, that Hildr would turn into a troll woman and they would have to live in a cave. Every man that came would fall in love with Hildr, and then Signy would have to kill them, until one man is not afraid. In turn, Hildr had put a curse on Grimhild, that she would stand over a fire between her legs, burning her from below while she was freezing from the other side, into which Grimhild would drop when their own curse was broken. Grimhild attempted to reason with Hildr, as she would rather that neither of their curses hold, but to no avail as Hildr desired revenge.http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10063/988/thesis.pdf Eleven years and sixteen men later, a young Dane IIlugi came along and broke Grimhild's curse, thus also causing her to die at last.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Illugi.htm |title=The Saga of Illugi, Grid’s Foster Son |publisher=Oe.eclipse.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germanicmythology.com/FORNALDARSAGAS/IlugaGridafostraSagaChappell.html |title=Fornaldarsögur Norðurlanda |publisher=Germanicmythology.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06[/tpl] (This Grimhild was an inspiration for Queen Grimhilde from Disney's Snow White.)

[[International Financial Reporting Standards]]
CATEGORIES: Financial regulation, International Financial Reporting Standards, Accounting terminology

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are designed as a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are a consequence of growing international shareholding and trade and are particularly important for companies that have dealings in several countries. They are progressively replacing the many different national accounting standards. The rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which is comparable, understandable, reliable and relevant as per the users internal or external.
IFRS, with the exception of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies and IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29, are authorized in terms of the historical cost paradigm. IAS 29 and IFRIC 7 are authorized in terms of the constant purchasing power paradigm.
IFRS began as an attempt to harmonize accounting across the European Union but the value of harmonization quickly made the concept attractive around the world. They are sometimes still called by the original name of International Accounting Standards (IAS). IAS were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the Board of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). On 1 April 2001, the new International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) took over from the IASC the responsibility for setting International Accounting Standards. During its first meeting the new Board adopted existing IAS and Standing Interpretations Committee standards (SICs). The IASB has continued to develop standards calling the new standards International Financial Reporting Standards.
 ''In the absence of a Standard or an Interpretation that specifically applies to a transaction, management must use its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that is relevant and reliable. In making that judgement, IAS 8.11 requires management to consider the definitions, recognition criteria, and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income, and expenses in the Framework. 
Criticisms of IFRS are (1) that they are not being adopted in the US (see  GAAP) , (2) a number of criticisms from France and (3) that IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies had no positive effect at all during 6 years in Zimbabwe´s hyperinflationary economy. The IASB offered responses to the first two criticisms, but has offered no response to the last criticism while IAS 29 is currently (March 2014) being implemented in its original ineffective form in Venezuela and Belarus.

[[Tyrfing]]

CATEGORIES: Artifacts in Norse mythology, Mythological swords, Tyrfing cycle

Tyrfing, Tirfing or Tyrving (The name is of uncertain origin, possibly connected to the Terwingi) was a magic sword in Norse mythology, which figures in the Tyrfing Cycle, which includes a poem from the Poetic Edda called Hervararkviða, and the Hervarar saga. The name is also used in the saga to denote the Goths. The form Tervingi was actually recorded by Roman sources in the 4th century.
Svafrlami was the king of Gardariki, and Odin's grandson. He managed to trap the dwarves Dvalinn and Durin when they had left the rock where they dwelt. Then he forced them to forge a sword with a golden hilt that would never miss a stroke, would never rust and would cut through stone and iron as easily as through clothes.
The dwarves made the sword, and it shone and gleamed like fire. However, in revenge they cursed it so that it would kill a man every time it was drawn and that it would be the cause of three great evils. They finally cursed it so that it would also kill Svafrlami himself.
When Svafrlami heard the curses he tried to slay Dvalin, but the dwarf disappeared into the rock and the sword was driven deep into it, though missing its victim.
Svafrlami was killed by the berserker Arngrim who took the sword in his turn. After Arngrim, it was worn by Angantyr and his eleven brothers. They were all slain at Samsø, by the Swedish champion Hjalmar, and his Norwegian sworn brother Orvar-Odd; but Hjalmar, being wounded by Tyrfing (its first evil deed), has only time to sing his death-song before he dies, and asks Orvar-Odd to bring his body to Ingeborg, daughter of Yngvi at Uppsala. 
Angantyr's daughter, Hervor (by his wife Tófa) is brought up as a bond-maid, in ignorance of her parentage. When at last she learns it, she arms herself as a shieldmaiden, and goes to Munarvoe in Samsø, in quest of the dwarf-cursed weapon. She finds it and marries King Gudmund's son Höfund. They have two sons, Heidrek and Angantyr. Hervor secretly gave her son the sword Tyrfing. While Angantyr and Heidrek walked, Heidrek wanted to have a look at the sword. Since he had unsheathed it, the curse the dwarves had put on the sword made Heidrek kill his brother Angantyr. This was the second of Tyrfing's three evil deeds.
Heidrek became king of the Goths. During a voyage, Heidrek camped at the Carpathians (Harvaða fjöllum, cf. Grimm's law). He was accompanied by eight mounted thralls, and when Heidrek slept at night, the thralls broke into his tent and took Tyrfing and slew Heidrek. This was the last one of Tyrfing's three evil deeds. Heidrek's son, also named Angantyr, caught and killed the thralls, and reclaimed the magic sword, and the curse had ceased. 
Angantyr was the next king of the Goths, but his illegitimate half-Hun brother Hlod (or Hlöd, Hlöðr) wanted half of the kingdom. Angantýr refused, and Gizur called Hlod a bastard and his mother a slave-girl. Hlod and 343,200 mounted Huns invade the Goths (See The Battle of the Goths and Huns). The Huns greatly outnumber the Goths.  The Goths won because Angantyr used Tyrfing. He killed his brother Hlod on the battleground. The bodies of the numerous warriors choke the rivers, causing a flood which filled the valleys with dead men and horses.

[[History of music]]

CATEGORIES: Musical eras, Musicology

Music is found in every known culture, past and present, varying wildly between times and places. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently music may have been in existence for at least 50,000 years and the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life.[tpl]cite book|last=Wallin|first=Nils Lennart|title=The Origins of Music|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-262-73143-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&printsec=frontcover|coauthors=Steven Brown, Björn Merker[/tpl] Krause, Bernie. (2012). "The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places," Little Brown/Hachette, New York.
A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology.  The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. "Music history" is the distinct subfield of musicology and history which studies music (particularly Western art music) from a chronological perspective.

The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, commonly known by its abbreviation PSLV, is an expendable launch system developed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into sun synchronous orbits, a service that was, until the advent of the PSLV, commercially available only from Russia. PSLV can also launch small size satellites into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).

[[Alf and Alfhild]]
CATEGORIES: Mythological kings, People in Norse mythology and legends, Geats

According to Gesta Danorum, Alfhild, daughter of the Geatish king Siward, was a shield maiden, who had her own fleet of viking ships, with crews of young female pirates, who raided along the coasts of the Baltic Sea.
As a young princess, Alfhild's chamber was guarded by a lizard and a snake, which scared away unworthy suitors. A Danish prince named Alf, also of Geatish descent, came to Geatland and defeated the animal guards. But Alfhild, advised by her mother, fled from Alf dressed as a man, and she became a shield maiden.
Alf and his Scanian comrade, Borgar, together with their Danish sea-warriors, searched for and eventually found Alfhild and her fleet by the coast of southern Finland. After some deadly fighting aboard the ships, Alfhild's helmet was knocked off, and she was recognised. Alf and Borgar ordered their men to stop fighting, and Alf embraced Alfhild, happy to finally have found her. She then decided to lay off her warrior clothes and follow Alf to Denmark, where they got married.
Some years later, in a war fought against a revolting Danish viking clan, Alf and his brothers and their father king Sigar were killed. Only Alf's and Alfhild's daughter Gurid had survived of the royal family. After being queen for a while, Gurid married one of Borgar's sons, Halfdan, and they had a son named Harald, who became the new king of Denmark.

Prophecy is a process in which one or more messages that have been communicated to a prophetProphecy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) are then communicated to others. Such messages typically involve divine inspiration, interpretation, or revelation of conditioned events to come (cf. divine knowledge). The process of prophecy especially involves reciprocal communication of the prophet with the (divine) source of the messages. Throughout history, clairvoyance has commonly been used and associated with prophecy.The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy - Page 59, Rosemary Guiley - 2006
Various concepts of prophecy are found throughout all of the world's religions and cults. To a certain degree prophecy can be an integral concept within any religion or cult. The term has found deep usage in the Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Baha'i along with many others.Jewish Encyclopedia: "Prophets and Prophecy" at JewishEncyclopedia.com

"Orwellian" is an adjective describing the situation, idea, or societal condition that George Orwell identified as being destructive to the welfare of a free and open society. It connotes an attitude and a brutal policy of draconian control by propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial of truth, and manipulation of the past, including the "unperson" — a person whose past existence is expunged from the public record and memory, practiced by modern repressive governments. Often, this includes the circumstances depicted in his novels, particularly Nineteen Eighty-Four.[tpl]cite book|last=Drabble |first=Margaret |title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature |edition=Sixth |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford and New York |year=2000 |page=726 |isbn=0198614535[/tpl][tpl]verify source|reason="Orwellian" does not appear in either the 5th or 7th edition.

Orwell's ideas about personal freedom and state authority developed when he was a British colonial administrator in Burma. He was fascinated by the effect of colonialism on the individual, requiring acceptance of the idea that the colonialist exists only for the good of the colonised.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
There has also been a great deal of discourse on the possibility that Orwell galvanized his ideas of oppression during his experience, and his subsequent writings in the English press, in Spain. Orwell was a member of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) militia and suffered suppression and escaped arrest by the Comintern faction working within the Republican Government. Following his escape he made a strong case for defending the Spanish revolution from the Communists there, and the misinformation in the press at home. During this period he formed strong ideas about the reportage of events, and their context in his own ideas of imperialism and democracy.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
This often brought him into conflict with literary peers such as W.H.

[[Graph of a function]]

CATEGORIES: Charts, Functions and mappings

In mathematics, the graph of a function f is the collection of all ordered pairs [tpl]nowrap|(x, f(x))[/tpl]. If the function input x is an ordered pair [tpl]nowrap|(x1, x2)[/tpl] of real numbers, the graph is the collection of all ordered triples [tpl]nowrap|(x1, x2, f(x1, x2))[/tpl], and for a continuous function is a surface (see three-dimensional graph).
Informally, if x is a real number and f is a real function, graph may mean the graphical representation of this collection, in the form of a line chart: a curve on a Cartesian plane, together with Cartesian axes, etc. Graphing on a Cartesian plane is sometimes referred to as curve sketching. The graph of a function on real numbers may be mapped directly to the graphic representation of the function. For general functions, a graphic representation cannot necessarily be found and the formal definition of the graph of a function suits the need of mathematical statements, e.g., the closed graph theorem in functional analysis.
The concept of the graph of a function is generalized to the graph of a relation.  Note that although a function is always identified with its graph, they are not the same because it will happen that two functions with different codomain could have the same graph.  For example, the cubic polynomial mentioned below is a surjection if its codomain is the real numbers but it is not if its codomain is the complex field.
To test whether a graph of a curve is a function of x, use the vertical line test. To test whether a graph of a curve is a function of y, use the horizontal line test. If the function has an inverse, the graph of the inverse can be found by reflecting the graph of the original function over the line [tpl]nowrap|1=y = x[/tpl].
In science, engineering, technology, finance, and other areas, graphs are tools used for many purposes. In the simplest case one variable is plotted as a function of another, typically using rectangular axes; see Plot (graphics) for details.

GEM (Graphical Environment Manager) was an operating environment created by Digital Research, Inc. (DRI) for use with the CP/M operating system on the Intel 8088 and Motorola 68000 microprocessors. Later versions ran over DOS as well.
GEM is known primarily as the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Atari ST series of computers, and was also supplied with a series of IBM PC-compatible computers from Amstrad. It also was available for standard IBM PC, at the time when the 6 MHz IBM PC AT (and the very concept of a GUI) was brand new. It was the core for a small number of DOS programs, the most notable being Ventura Publisher. It was ported to a number of other computers that previously lacked graphical interfaces, but never gained popularity on those platforms. DRI also produced FlexGem for their FlexOS real-time operating system.

The rest of the population is dispersed along the coastal strip, which includes the other five main towns of Layou, Barrouallie, Chateaubelair, Georgetown, and Calliaqua.

Digital Research, Inc. (a.k.a. DR or DRI; originally Intergalactic Digital Research) was the company created by Dr. Gary Kildall to market and develop his CP/M operating system and related products. It was the first large software company in the microcomputer world.[tpl]cite journal | last = Cole | first = Maggie | title = Gary Kildall and the Digital Research Success Story | journal = InfoWorld | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 52–53 | publisher = Popular Computing | location = Palo Alto, CA | date = May 25, 1981 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=3j4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA52 | issn = 0199-6649[/tpl] Digital Research was based in Pacific Grove, California.
The company's operating systems, starting with CP/M for 8080/Z80-based microcomputers, were the de facto standard of their era, as MS-DOS and MS Windows came later. DR's product suite included the original CP/M and its various offshoots; DR-DOS which was a MS-DOS compatible version of CP/M, and MP/M, the multi-user CP/M. The first 16-bit system was CP/M-86, which was to be unsuccessful in competition with MS-DOS. There followed Concurrent CP/M, a single-user version of the multi-tasking MP/M-86 featuring "virtual consoles" from which applications could be launched to run concurrently. Successive revisions of this system, which gradually supported MS-DOS applications and the FAT filesystem, were labelled Concurrent DOS, Concurrent DOS XM and Concurrent DOS 386.
In May 1983 the company announced that it would offer PC DOS versions of all of its languages and utilities.[tpl]cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V2588uIxmAQC&lpg=PA55&pg=PA403#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=The New View From Digital Research | work=PC Magazine | date=July 1983 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Hughes, George D. Jr. | pages=403[/tpl] In 1985, soon after the introduction of the Intel 80286, Digital Research introduced a real-time system, initially called Concurrent DOS 286 and subsequently FlexOS. This exploited the greater memory addressing capability of the new CPU to provide a more flexible multi-tasking environment. There was a small but powerful set of system APIs, each with a synchronous and an asynchronous variant. Pipes were supported, and all named resources could be aliased by setting Environment variables. This system was to enjoy enduring favour in point-of-sale systems and was adopted by the IBM 4690 OS.
Digital Research was purchased by Novell in 1991, primarily for Novell to gain access to the operating system line.
DR produced a selection of programming language compilers and interpreters for their OS-supported platforms, including C, Pascal, COBOL, Forth, PL/I, PL/M, CBASIC, BASIC, and Logo. They also produced a microcomputer version of the GKS graphics standard (related to NAPLPS) called GSX, and later used this as the basis of their GEM GUI. Less known are their application programs, limited largely to the GSX-based DR DRAW, Dr. Halo for DOS and a small suite of GUI programs for GEM.

Armenia lies in the highlands surrounding the Biblical mountains of Ararat. The original Armenian name for the country was Hayk, later Hayastan ([tpl]lang-hy|Հայաստան[/tpl]), translated as the land of Haik, and consisting of the name of the ancient Mesopotamian god Hayahttp://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/haya/ (ha-ià) and the Iranian suffix '-stan' ("land"). The historical enemy of Hayk (the legendary ruler of Armenia), Hayastan, was Bel, or in other words Baal (Akkadian cognate Bēlu). The word "Bel" is named in the Bible at Isaiah 46:1 and Jeremiah 50:2 and 51:44."Vahan Kurkjian, "History of Armenia", The Beginnings of Armenia, Chapter VIII Michigan, 1968, penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/8*.html
The name Armenia was given to the country by the surrounding states, and it is traditionally derived from Armenak or Aram (the great-grandson of Haik's great-grandson, and another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of all Armenians).
In the Bronze Age, several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the Hittite Empire (at the height of its power), Mitanni (South-Western historical Armenia), and Hayasa-Azzi (1600–1200 BC). Soon after the Hayasa-Azzi were the Nairi (1400–1000 BC) and the Kingdom of Urartu (1000–600 BC), who successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highland.

[[Additive function]]
CATEGORIES: Arithmetic functions

In mathematics the term additive function has two different definitions, depending on the specific field of application.
In algebra an additive function (or additive map) is a function that preserves the addition operation:
for any two elements x and y in the domain. For example, any linear map is additive. When the domain is the real numbers, this is Cauchy's functional equation.
In number theory, an additive function is an arithmetic function f(n) of the positive integer n such that whenever a and b are coprime, the function of the product is the sum of the functions:Erdös, P., and M. Kac. On the Gaussian Law of Errors in the Theory of Additive Functions. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1939 April; 25(4): 206–207. online
The remainder of this article discusses number theoretic additive functions, using the second definition.
For a specific case of the first definition see additive polynomial. Note also that any homomorphism f between abelian groups is "additive" by the first definition.

Human rights in the Soviet Union have been viewed differently, one view by the communist ideology adopted by the Soviet Union and another by its critics. The Soviet Union was established after a revolution that ended centuries of Tsarist monarchy. The emerging Soviet leaders sought to establish a new order and understanding of equality based on Marxist–Leninist ideology.
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ruled the country and mobilized the entire population in support of state ideology and policies. As a result, civil and political rights were limited. The emphasis was placed on the principles of guaranteed economic and social rights.

Les Guignols de l'info ([tpl]lang-en|News Puppets[/tpl]) is a satirical latex puppet show broadcast on Canal+, a French subscription-based television channel, the show being available without subscription. Hosted by a puppet facsimile of TF1 news anchor Patrick Poivre d'Arvor, Les Guignols is similar to the 1984–1996 British show Spitting Image. A segment appeared every weeknight on the Canal+ program Nulle part ailleurs, with a weekly recapitulation on Sundays ("La Semaine des Guignols", replay of the week's episodes). While Nulle part ailleurs no longer runs, the Guignols are still running inside the Canal+ TV Show Le Grand Journal.
The show started in 1988 as Les Arènes de l'info (News Arena). It originally did not follow the news of the day and was not very popular. It was not until 1990–1991 and the first Gulf War that the show began to follow the news. It enjoyed a tremendous growth in popularity and quickly eclipsed its rival, Le Bébête Show.

Franco-Belgian comics ([tpl]lang-fr|Bande dessinée franco-belge[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-nl|Franco-Belgische strip[/tpl]) are comics that are created for a Belgian and French audience. These countries have a long tradition in comics and comic books, where they are known as BDs, an abbreviation of bandes dessinées (literally drawn strips) in French and stripverhalen (literally strip stories) in Dutch. Flemish Belgian comic books (originally written in Dutch) are influenced by francophone comics, yet have a distinctly different style.
In Europe, the French language is spoken natively not only in France but also by about 40% of the population of Belgium and about 20% of the population of Switzerland. The shared language creates an artistic and commercial market where national identity is often blurred.
Flemish publications are often[tpl]dubious|date=April 2014[/tpl] translated to French and brought on the French-language market. Despite the shared language, Flemish comic books are not common in the Netherlands (with some exceptions).  
Among the most popular Franco-Belgian comics that have achieved international fame are The Adventures of Tintin, Asterix, and The Smurfs.

[[Duke of Lancaster]]

CATEGORIES: Extinct dukedoms in the Peerage of England

There were several Dukes of Lancaster in the 14th and early 15th centuries.  See also Duchy of Lancaster.
There were three creations of the Dukedom of Lancaster.
The first creation was on 6 March 1351, for Henry of Grosmont, 4th Earl of Lancaster, a great-grandson of Henry III; he was also 4th Earl of Leicester, 1st Earl of Derby, 1st Earl of Lincoln and Lord of Bowland. 
The second creation was on 13 November 1362, for John of Gaunt, 1st Earl of Richmond, who was both the 1st Duke's son-in-law and also fourth son of King Edward III. John had married Blanche of Lancaster, 6th Countess of Lancaster, daughter of the 1st Duke of the first creation. When John of Gaunt, the 1st Duke of this creation died on 4 February 1399, the Dukedom passed to his son, Henry of Bolingbroke, 1st Duke of Hereford.  Later that same year, the new 2nd Duke usurped the throne of England from Richard II, ascending the throne as Henry IV, at which point the Dukedom merged in the crown.
The third creation was on 10 November 1399, for Henry of Monmouth, Prince of Wales, eldest son of the new king. In 1413, the 1st Duke ascended the throne as King Henry V, and the Dukedom merged in the crown again.
The Duchy of Lancaster continues to exist as a separate entity from the Crown Estate and currently provides income for the British monarch.
It is customary at formal dinners in Lancashire and in Lancastrian regiments of the armed forces for the Loyal Toast to the crown to be announced as "The Queen, Duke of Lancaster." In addition, in Lancaster it was quite common as late as the second half of the twentieth century to hear the national anthem sung as "God save our gracious Queen, long live our noble Duke," but this is a tradition that has no constitutional warrant, and the British monarch is not styled legally so within either the County Palatine of Lancashire nor the Duchy of Lancaster in any official capacity (for example, Letters Patent or Acts of Parliament), merely as a sign of local, 'Lancastrian' loyalty.

WEB is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming": the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming languages), in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.
WEB consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source texts, and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX.
CWEB is a version of WEB for the C programming language, while noweb is a separate literate programming tool, which is inspired by WEB (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic.
The most significant programs written in WEB are TeX and Metafont.  Modern TeX distributions use another program Web2C to convert WEB source to C.

In computing, iSCSI ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=ISCSI pronunciation.ogg|aɪ|ˈ|s|k|ʌ|z|i[/tpl] [tpl]respell|eye|SKUZ|ee[/tpl]), is an acronym for Internet Small Computer System Interface, an Internet Protocol (IP)-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities.
By carrying SCSI commands over IP networks, iSCSI is used to facilitate data transfers over intranets and to manage storage over long distances. iSCSI can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the Internet and can enable location-independent data storage and retrieval.
The protocol allows clients (called initiators) to send SCSI commands (CDBs) to SCSI storage devices (targets) on remote servers. It is a storage area network (SAN) protocol, allowing organizations to consolidate storage into data center storage arrays while providing hosts (such as database and web servers) with the illusion of locally attached disks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/iSCSI|title=iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface)|last=Rouse|first=Margaret|date=May 2011|publisher=SearchStorage|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl]

[[Coral reef]]

CATEGORIES: Coral reefs, Animal products, Fisheries, Coastal and oceanic landforms, Islands, Ecosystems

Coral reefs are underwater structures made from calcium carbonate secreted by corals. Coral reefs are colonies of tiny  animals found in marine waters that contain few nutrients. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, which in turn consist of polyps that cluster in groups. The polyps belong to a group of animals known as Cnidaria, which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish. Unlike sea anemones, coral polyps secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons which support and protect their bodies. Reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated waters.
Often called "rainforests of the sea", coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean surface, about half the area of France, yet they provide a home for 25% of all marine species,[tpl]cite journal| author=Spalding MD and Grenfell AM |doi=10.1007/s003380050078| title=New estimates of global and regional coral reef areas| year=1997| journal=Coral Reefs| volume=16| issue=4| page=225[/tpl]Mulhall M (Spring 2009) Saving rainforests of the sea: An analysis of international efforts to conserve coral reefs Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum 19:321–351. including fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates and other cnidarians.[tpl]cite book |title=Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's Sea Creatures |last=Hoover |first=John |isbn=1-56647-220-2 |publisher=Mutual |date=November 2007[/tpl] Paradoxically, coral reefs flourish even though they are surrounded by ocean waters that provide few nutrients. They are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters, but deep water and cold water corals also exist on smaller scales in other areas.
Coral reefs deliver ecosystem services to tourism, fisheries and shoreline protection. The annual global economic value of coral reefs is estimated between US$ 29.8-375 billion. However, coral reefs are fragile ecosystems, partly because they are very sensitive to water temperature. They are under threat from climate change, oceanic acidification, blast fishing, cyanide fishing for aquarium fish, overuse of reef resources, and harmful land-use practices, including urban and agricultural runoff and water pollution, which can harm reefs by encouraging excess algal growth.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=12183 | title= Corals reveal impact of land use | accessdate = September 21, 2013 | publisher=ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hcri.ssri.hawaii.edu/files/media/pr-water_quality.pdf |title=Urban runoff and coastal water quality being researched for effects on coral reefs |first=Charissa |last=Minato |date=July 1, 2002 |accessdate=December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/oceb/fact4.cfm |title=Coastal Watershed Factsheets – Coral Reefs and Your Coastal Watershed |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency Office of Water |date=July 1998 |accessdate=December 2010[/tpl]

[[Alvíss]]

CATEGORIES: Norse dwarves

Alvíss ("All-Wise") was a dwarf in Norse mythology.
Thor's daughter, Þrúðr, was promised to Alvíss. However, Thor did not want Alviss married to his daughter, so he devised a plan to stop Alvíss from doing so. He told Alvíss that, because of his small height, he had to prove his wisdom. Alvíss agreed. Thor made the tests last until after the sun had risen. Alviss, because he was a dwarf, was petrified when he was exposed to sunlight, and Þrúðr remained unmarried.
He has a small appearance in Neil Gaiman's novel American Gods.

[[Andhrímnir]]

Andhrímnir (Old Norse "sooty"Orchard (1997:6).) is the chef of the Æsir and einherjar in Norse mythology. Every day in Valhalla, he slaughters the beast Sæhrímnir and cooks it in Eldhrímnir, his cauldron. At night, Sæhrímnir is restored to life to be eaten again the next day. He also makes the Æsir's mead from the milk of Heiðrún, a goat.

[[Sæhrímnir]]

CATEGORIES: Creatures in Norse mythology, Mythological pigs

In Norse mythology, Sæhrímnir is the creature killed and eaten every night by the Æsir and einherjar. The cook of the gods, Andhrímnir, is responsible for the slaughter of Sæhrímnir and its preparation in the cauldron Eldhrímnir. After Sæhrímnir is eaten, the beast is brought back to life again to provide sustenance for the following day. Sæhrímnir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.
The enthroned figure of High quotes this stanza in the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning and specifically states that Sæhrímnir is a boar. However, some scholars have translated the Poetic Edda attestation, which the Prose Edda attestation quotes, as not referring to the creature as any specific type. Those scholars who recognize a difference between the taxonomy of the creature between the two sources have commented on the matter, further issues have been raised about the apparently contradictory etymology of the name of the creature in relation to its apparent status as a boar, and some scholars have theorized that the ritual killing of the animal may ultimately stem from religious practices in Germanic paganism.

The instrument consists of at least 23 cast bronze, cup-shaped bells, which are serially played to produce a melody, or sounded together to play a chord. A traditional manual carillon is played by striking a keyboard — the stick-like keys of which are sometimes called batons — with the fists, and by pressing the keys of a pedal keyboard with the feet. The keys mechanically activate levers and wires that connect to metal clappers that strike the inside of the bells, allowing the performer on the bells, or carillonneur,in Australia the carillonnist to vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to the key.
The carillon is the heaviest of all extant musical instruments;The Mark II and Mark III Telharmonium[tpl]full|date=October 2013[/tpl]

[tpl]Canadian politics[/tpl]
The Parliament of Canada ([tpl]lang-fr|Parlement du Canada[/tpl]) is the federal legislative branch of Canada, seated at Parliament Hill in the national capital, Ottawa, Ontario. The body consists of the Canadian monarch, represented by a viceroy, the governor general; an upper house—the Senate; and a lower house—the House of Commons. Each element has its own officers and organization. The governor general summons and appoints each of the 105 senators on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, while the 308 members of the House of Commons—called members of parliament (MPs)—are directly elected by eligible Canadian voters, with each MP representing a single electoral district, commonly referred to as a riding.
By constitutional convention, the House of Commons is the dominant branch of parliament, the Senate and Crown rarely opposing its will. The Senate reviews legislation from a less partisan standpoint and the monarch or viceroy provides the necessary Royal Assent to make bills into law. The governor general also summons parliament, while either the viceroy or monarch can prorogue or dissolve parliament, the latter in order to call a general election. Either will read the Throne Speech. The current parliament, summoned by Governor General David Johnston on 2 June 2011, is the 41st since Confederation in 1867.

[[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska]]

CATEGORIES: Alaska boroughs, Alaska census areas, Lists of U.S. counties by state, Alaska geography-related lists

The U.S. state of Alaska is divided into 19 organized boroughs and one "Unorganized Borough". Alaska and Louisiana are the only states that do not call their first-order administrative subdivisions counties (Louisiana uses parishes instead).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uscounties.org/cffiles_web/counties/state.cfm?statecode=ak|accessdate=2012-04-07|title=Find A County|work=National Association of Counties[/tpl]
Many of the most densely populated regions of the state are part of Alaska's boroughs, which function similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county equivalents in the other 49 states, the organized boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any organized borough is referred to as the unorganized borough. For the 1970 census, the U.S. Census Bureau, in cooperation with the state, divided the unorganized borough into 11 census areas, each roughly corresponding to an election district. However, these areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation. They have no government of their own. Boroughs and census areas are both treated as county-level equivalents by the Census Bureau.
Some areas in the unorganized borough receive limited public services directly from the Alaska state government, usually law enforcement from the Alaska State Troopers and educational funding.
Six consolidated city-county governments exist—Juneau City and Borough, City and Borough of Haines, Sitka City and Borough, Yakutat City and Borough, Wrangell City and Borough, as well as the state's largest city, Anchorage. Though its legal name is the Municipality of Anchorage, it is considered a consolidated city-borough under state law.
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 55-2,3,4 codes, which are used by the United States Census Bureau to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip6-4.htm|title= FIPS Publish 6-4|publisher= National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate= 2007-04-11[/tpl] Alaska's code is 02, so each code is of the format 02XXX.

CATEGORIES: Terminology used in multiple sports, Waves, Mexican culture

The wave (known as the Mexican wave in the anglosphere outside North America) is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a packed stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and raise their arms. Immediately upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position.
The result is a wave of standing spectators that travels through the crowd, even though individual spectators never move away from their seats. In many large arenas the crowd is seated in a contiguous circuit all the way around the sport field, and so the wave is able to travel continuously around the arena; in discontiguous seating arrangements, the wave can instead reflect back and forth through the crowd. When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can sometimes pass through it. Usually only one wave crest will be present at any given time in an arena. Simultaneous, counter-rotating waves have been produced.How To Do the Wave at Michigan Stadium

The City and Borough of Juneau [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|uː|n|oʊ[/tpl] is the capital city of Alaska. It is a unified municipality located on the Gastineau Channel in the Alaskan panhandle and is the 2nd largest city in the United States by area. It has been the capital of Alaska since 1906, when the government of the then-District of Alaska was moved from Sitka as dictated by the U.S. Congress in 1900.  The municipality unified on July 1, 1970, when the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current home rule municipality.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.juneau.org/history-old/histoutl.php|title=An Outline History of Juneau Municipal Government|last=Miller|first = Marian |date=9 June 1997|publisher=City and Borough of Juneau|accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl]
The area of Juneau is larger than that of Rhode Island and Delaware individually and almost as large as the two states combined. Downtown Juneau [tpl]coord|58|18|07|N|134|25|11|W|scale:10000[/tpl] is nestled at the base of Mount Juneau and across the channel from Douglas Island. As of the 2010 census, the City and Borough had a population of 31,275. As of July 2011 the population estimate from the United States Census Bureau is 32,164, making it the second most populous city in Alaska.Quickfacts: Juneau However, Fairbanks is the second-largest metropolitan area in the state, with more than 97,000 residents. The city is rather unusual among U.S. capitals in that there are no roads connecting Juneau to the rest of Alaska or the rest of North America (though ferry service is available for cars).
Juneau is named after gold prospector Joe Juneau, though the place was for a time called Rockwell and then Harrisburg (after Juneau's co-prospector, Richard Harris).  The Tlingit name of the town is Dzántik'i Héeni ("Base of the Flounder’s River", dzánti ‘flounder’, –kʼi ‘base’, héen ‘river’), and Auke Bay just north of Juneau proper is called Áak'w ("Little lake", áa ‘lake’, -kʼ ‘diminutive’) in Tlingit. The Taku River, just south of Juneau, was named after the cold t'aakh wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.
Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging [tpl]convert|16|ft|m|0[/tpl], below steep mountains about [tpl]convert|3500|ft|m|-2[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|4000|ft|m|-2[/tpl] high. Atop these mountains is the Juneau Icefield, a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the Mendenhall Glacier and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system; the Mendenhall glacier has been generally retreating; its front face is declining both in width and height.
The Alaska State Capitol in downtown Juneau was originally built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, the federal courthouse and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, it is still the home of the state legislature and the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor. Other executive branch offices have largely moved elsewhere, in Juneau or elsewhere in the state, in the ongoing battle between branches for space in the building, as well as the decades-long capital move issue. Recent discussion has been focused between relocating the seat of state government outside of Juneau and building a new capitol building in Juneau. Neither position has advanced very far. The Alaska Committee, a local community advocacy group, has led efforts to thus far keep the capital in Juneau.

The Coptic calendar, also called the Alexandrian calendar, is used by the Coptic Orthodox Church and still used in Egypt. This calendar is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar. To avoid the calendar creep of the latter, a reform of the ancient Egyptian calendar was introduced at the time of Ptolemy III (Decree of Canopus, in 238 BC) which consisted of the intercalation of a sixth epagomenal day every fourth year. However, this reform was opposed by the Egyptian priests, and the idea was not adopted until 25 BC, when the Roman Emperor Augustus formally reformed the calendar of Egypt, keeping it forever synchronized with the newly introduced Julian calendar. To distinguish it from the Ancient Egyptian calendar, which remained in use by some astronomers until medieval times, this reformed calendar is known as the Coptic calendar. Its years and months coincide with those of the Ethiopian calendar but have different numbers and names.

Head cheese or brawn is a cold cut that originated in Europe. A version pickled with vinegar is known as souse. Head cheese is not a dairy cheese, but a terrine or meat jelly made with flesh from the head of a calf or pig, or less commonly a sheep or cow, and often set in aspic. The parts of the head used vary, but the brain, eyes, and ears are usually removed. The tongue, and sometimes even the feet and heart, may be included.
Head cheese may be flavored with onion, black pepper, allspice, bay leaf, salt, and vinegar. It is usually eaten cold or at room temperature as a luncheon meat. It can also be made from quality trimmings from pork and veal, adding gelatin to the stock as a binder.
Historically, meat jellies were made of the cleaned (all organs removed) head of the animal, which was simmered to produce stock, a peasant food made since the Middle Ages. When cooled, the stock congeals because of the natural gelatin found in the skull. The aspic may need additional gelatin, or more often, reduction to set properly.

CATEGORIES: Oryza, Poaceae genera

Oryza is a genus of seven to twenty species of grasses in the tribe Oryzeae, within the subfamily Bambusoideae, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Northern AustraliaAbbie Thomas Native rice may hold key to food future 15 October 2010 http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/10/15/3038568.htm?topic= and Africa. The genus includes the major food crop rice species Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima. Members of the genus grow as tall, wetland grasses, growing to 1–2 m tall; the genus includes both annual and perennial species.
Oryza is situated within the tribe Oryzeae, which is characterized morphologically by its single-flowered spikelets whose glumes are almost completely suppressed. In Oryza, two sterile lemma simulate glumes. The tribe Oryzeae is within the subfamily Bambusoideae, a group of Poaceae tribes with certain features of internal leaf anatomy in common. The most distinctive leaf characteristics of this subfamily are the arm cells and fusoid cells found in their leaves. The Bambusoideae are in the family Poaceae, as they all have fibrous root systems, cylindrical stems, sheathing leaves with parallel-veined blades, and inflorescences with spikelets.Heywood, V.H. Flowering Plants of the World 1993 Oxford University Press
While the United States Department of Agriculture has a plants list with only seven species of Oryza, others have identified up to 17, including O. sativa, O. barthii, O. glaberrima, O. meridionalis, O. nivara, O. rufipogon, O. punctata, O. latifolia, O. alta, O. grandiglumis, O. eichingeri, O. officinalis, O. rhisomatis, O. minuta, O. australiensis, O. granulata, O. meyeriana, and O. brachyantha.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] One species, Asian rice (O. sativa), provides 20% of global grain and is a food crop of major global importance.

[[Snowshoe]]

CATEGORIES: Footwear, Traditional footwear, Hiking equipment, Snow, Snowshoeing

A snowshoe is footwear for walking over the snow. Snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called "flotation".
Traditional snowshoes have a hardwood frame with rawhide lacings. Some modern snowshoes are similar, but most are made of materials such as lightweight metal, plastic, and synthetic fabric. In addition to distributing the weight, snowshoes are generally raised at the toe for maneuverability. They must not accumulate snow, hence the latticework, and require bindings to attach them to the feet.
In the past, snowshoes were essential tools for fur traders, trappers and anyone whose life or living depended on the ability to get around in areas of deep and frequent snowfall, and they remain necessary equipment for forest rangers and others who must be able to get around areas inaccessible to motorized vehicles when the snow is deep. However, today snowshoes are mainly used for recreation, primarily by hikers and runners who like to continue their hobby in wintertime. Snowshoeing is easy to learn, and in appropriate conditions is a relatively safe and inexpensive recreational activity. However, snowshoeing in icy, steep terrain is more dangerous.

Inuit mythology has many similarities to the religions of other polar regions. Inuit traditional religious practices could be very briefly summarised as a form of shamanism based on animist

In some respects, Inuit mythology stretches the common conception of what the term "mythology" means. Unlike Greek mythology, for example, at least a few people have believed in it, without interruption, from the distant past up to and including the present time.Inuit Culture, Traditions, and History[tpl]Cite web|title=Inuit at Encarta|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761561130&pn=2|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwrQcN0b|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes[/tpl]Inuit - Eskimo Religion While the dominant religious system of the Inuit today is Christianity, many Inuit do still hold to at least some element of their traditional religious beliefs. Some see the Inuit as having adapted traditional beliefs to a greater or lesser degree to Christianity, while others would argue that it is rather the reverse that its true: The Inuit have adapted Christianity to their worldview.
Inuit traditional cosmology is not religion in the usual theological sense, and is similar to what most people think of as mythology only in that it is a narrative about the world and the place of people in it. In the words of Inuit writer Rachel Attituq Qitsualik:
Indeed, the traditional stories, rituals and taboos of the Inuit are so tied into the fearful and precautionary culture required by their harsh environment that it raises the question as to whether they qualify as beliefs at all, much less religion. Knud Rasmussen asked his guide and friend Aua, an angakkuq (shaman), about Inuit religious beliefs among the Iglulingmiut (people of Igloolik) and was told: "We don't believe. We fear." Living in a varied and irregular world, the Inuit traditionally did not worship anything, but they feared much. Some authors[tpl]Who|date=October 2009[/tpl] debate the conclusions we might deduce from Aua's words, because the angakkuq was under the influence of missionaries, and later he even converted to Christianity — converted people often see the ideas in polarisation and contrasts, the authors say. Their study also analyses beliefs of several Inuit groups, concluding (among others) that fear was not diffuse.Kleivan & Sonne 1985:32

Using a net provided by Ran, Loki catches him as a pike and forces him to give up his gold and Andvaranaut. Andvari cursed the stolen gold which would destroy anyone who possessed it. After the deaths of Brynhild and Sigurd, Gunnar left Andvari's gold in a cave. Years later, Andvari discovered the cave and his lost gold, although his ring was lost forever.

The Tlatelolco massacre, also known as The Night of Tlatelolco (from a book title by the Mexican writer Elena Poniatowska), was a killing of an estimated 30 to 300 students and civilians by military and police on October 2, 1968, in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco section of Mexico City, where the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) is located. The events are considered part of the Mexican Dirty War, when the government used its forces to suppress political opposition. The massacre occurred 10 days before the opening of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. More than 1300 persons were arrested by security police. There has been no consensus on how many were killed that day in the plaza area.
At the time the government and the mainstream media in Mexico claimed that government forces had been provoked by protesters shooting at them.Kara Michelle Borden, Mexico '68: An Analysis of the Tlatelolco Massacre and its Legacy, University of Oregon thesis, p. 3. But government documents made public since 2000 suggest that the snipers had been employed by the government.

Maurice Papon ([tpl]IPA-fr|moʁis papɔ̃[/tpl]; September 3, 1910 – February 17, 2007) was a French civil servant, leading the police in major prefectures and in Paris during the Nazi Occupation of France and into the 1960s. Forced to resign because of allegations of abuses, he became an industrial leader and Gaullist politician. In 1998 he was convicted of crimes against humanity for his participation in the deportation of more than 1600 Jews to concentration camps during World War II when he was secretary general for police in Bordeaux.
Papon was known to have tortured insurgent prisoners (1954–62) as prefect of the Constantinois department during the Algerian War. He was named chief of the Paris police in 1958. On October 17, 1961 he ordered the severe repression of a peaceful pro-National Liberation Front (FLN) demonstration against a curfew which he had imposed. What became known as the Paris massacre of 1961 left between one hundred and three hundred dead at the hands of the police, with many more wounded.French official quoted in Drowning by Bullets (2001) documentary, directed by Philip Brooks & Alan Hayling That same year, Papon was personally awarded the Legion of Honour by French President Charles de Gaulle, whose government was struggling to retain the French colony.
Papon was in charge of the Paris police during the February 1962 massacre at the Charonne metro station, which took place during a peaceful anti-Organisation armée secrète (OAS) demonstration organized by the Communist Party (PCF). 
After the 1965 disappearance of the Moroccan dissident Mehdi Ben Barka, leader of the Tricontinental Conference, in which the police were suspected of killing him, Papon was forced to resign.  He was supported by Gaulle in being named as director of Sud Aviation company, which created the first Concorde plane.
After May 1968, Papon was elected as a representative (député) in the French legislature, and served several terms.  From 1978 to 1981, he served as the appointed Minister of the Budget under prime minister Raymond Barre and president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. 
On May 6, 1981 details about his past under Vichy emerged, when Le Canard enchaîné newspaper published documents signed by Papon that showed his responsibility in the deportation of 1,690 Bordeaux Jews to Drancy internment camp from 1942 to 1944. After a long investigation by the government, Papon was tried (1995-1998); in 1998 he was convicted of crimes against humanity. In that year he was stripped of all his decorations.

Afrikaner Calvinism is, according to theory, a unique cultural development that combined the Calvinist religion with the political aspirations of the white Afrikaans speaking people of South Africa.

Before that, he fronted the group The Birthday Party in the early 1980s, a band renowned for its highly gothic, challenging lyrics and violent sound influenced by post-punk, blues and free jazz. In 2006, he formed the garage rock band Grinderman that released its debut the following year.

[[Corn dolly]]

CATEGORIES: Straw art, Arts and crafts, Agriculture in society

Corn dollies or corn mothers are a form of straw work made as part of harvest customs of Europe before mechanization.
Before Christianisation, in traditional pagan European culture it was believed that the spirit of the corn (in modern American English, "corn" would be "grain") lived amongst the crop, and that the harvest made it effectively homeless. James Frazer devotes chapters in The Golden Bough to "Corn-Mother and Corn-Maiden in Northern Europe" (chs. 45-48) and adduces European folkloric examples collected in great abundance by the folklorist Wilhelm Mannhardt. Among the customs attached to the last sheaf of the harvest were hollow shapes fashioned from the last sheaf of wheat or other cereal crops. The corn spirit would then spend the winter in this home until the "corn dolly" was ploughed into the first furrow of the new season. "Dolly" may be a corruption of "idol" or may have come directly from the Greek word eidolon (apparition); that which represents something else.

The Gordon Riots of 1780 began as an anti-Catholic protest in London against the Papists Act of 1778, which intended to reduce official discrimination against British Catholics. The protest evolved into riots and looting.
The Popery Act 1698 had imposed a number of penalties and disabilities on Roman Catholics in England; the 1778 Act eliminated some of these. An initial peaceful protest led on to widespread rioting and looting[tpl]Cite book | publisher = Printed by W.

The Riots came at the height of the American War of Independence with Britain fighting American rebels, France, Spain and the Dutch Republic. They led to unfounded fears that they had been a deliberate attempt by France to destabilise Britain before an imminent French invasion.

The Saab JAS 39 Gripen (English: Griffin[tpl]#tag:ref |Literally "the Griffin", as the names of Swedish combat aircraft are in the definite form, like Viggen or Draken.|group = Nb|name= "Naming"[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |last = Nilsson |first = Axel |url = https://www.fmv.se/en/Projects/JAS-39-Gripen/Milestones/ |title = JAS 39 Gripen − Milestones |work= Projects |publisher = Swedish Defence Materiel Administration |date= 13 Jan 2012 |accessdate = 12 Feb 2014 |quote= Gripen is the Swedish word for Griffin[/tpl]) is a light single-engine multirole fighter aircraft manufactured by the Swedish aerospace company Saab.  It was designed to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen in the Swedish Air Force (Flygvapnet).  The Gripen has a delta wing and canard configuration with relaxed stability design and fly-by-wire flight controls. It is powered by the Volvo RM12, and has a top speed of Mach 2. Later aircraft are modified for NATO interoperability standards and to undertake in-flight refuelling.
In 1979, the Swedish government began development studies for an aircraft capable of fighter, attack and reconnaissance missions to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen. A new design from Saab was selected and developed as the JAS 39, first flying in 1988. Following two crashes during flight development and subsequent alterations to the aircraft's flight control software, the Gripen entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1997. Upgraded variants, featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times, began entering service in 2003.
In order to market the aircraft to export customers, Saab has formed several partnerships and collaborative efforts with multiple overseas aerospace companies.  One example of such efforts was Gripen International, a joint partnership between Saab and BAE Systems formed in 2001. Gripen International was responsible for marketing the aircraft, and was heavily involved in the successful export of the type to South Africa; the organization was later dissolved amidst allegations of bribery being employed to secure foreign interest and sales.  On the export market, the Gripen has achieved moderate success in sales to nations in Central Europe, South Africa and Southeast Asia.  As of 2013, more than 247 Gripens have been built.[tpl]#tag:ref | Comprising 204 (30 Batch I, 110 Batch II, 64 Batch III) Gripens delivered to Sweden, 26, South Africa, and 12, Thailand.  This figure does not include those of the Empire Test Pilots School, or Czech and Hungarian Gripens, with the latter two having received ex-Swedish Air Force aircraft.

A further version, designated Gripen JAS 39 E/F, is under development as of 2014; it has been referred to as Gripen NG or Super-JAS.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20120727/42260 |title= ‘Super-Jas’ costlier than expected: report |work= The Local | location = SE | date= 27 July 2012 |accessdate = 13 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140113035555/http://www.thelocal.se/20120727/42260 |archivedate= 13 January 2014[/tpl]  The changes include the adoption of a new powerplant, the General Electric F414G, an active electronically scanned array radar, and significantly increased internal fuel capacity.  Saab has proposed other derivatives, including a navalised Sea Gripen for carrier operations and an optionally-manned aircraft for unmanned operations.  Sweden has ordered the Gripen NG and Brazil and Switzerland selected it for procurement.

[[Noise music]]

CATEGORIES: Noise music

Noise music is a category of music that is characterised by the expressive use of noise within a musical context. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound.Priest, Eldritch. "Music Noise" in Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and The Aesthetics of Failure, p. 132. London: Bloomsbury Publishing; New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2013. Noise music includes a wide range of musical styles, and sound based creative practices, that feature noise as a primary aspect. It can feature acoustically or electronically generated noise, and both traditional and unconventional musical instruments. It may incorporate live machine sounds, non-musical vocal techniques, physically manipulated audio media, processed sound recordings, field recording, computer generated noise, stochastic process and other randomly produced electronic signals such as distortion, feedback, static, hiss and hum. There may also be emphasis on high volume levels and lengthy, continuous pieces. More generally noise music may contain aspects such as improvisation, extended technique, cacophony and indeterminacy, and in many instances conventional use of melody, harmony, rhythm and pulse is often dispensed with.Chris Atton, "Fan Discourse and the Construction of Noise Music as a Genre", Journal of Popular Music Studies 23, no. 3 (September 2011): 324–42.

The Futurist art movement was important for the development of the noise aesthetic, as was the Dada art movement (a prime example being the Antisymphony concert performed on April 30, 1919 in Berlin),Matthew Biro, The Dada Cyborg: Visions of the New Human in Weimar Berlin, 2009, p. 50.Documents at The International Dada archive at The University of Iowa show that Antisymphonie was held at the Graphisches Kabinett, Kurfürstendamm 232, at 7:45 PM. The printed program lists 5 numbers: "Proclamation dada 1919" by Huelsenbeck, "Simultan-Gedicht" performed by 7 people, "Bruitistisches Gedicht" performed by Huelsenbeck (these latter 2 pieces grouped together under the category "DADA-machine"), "Seelenautomobil" by Hausmann, and finally, Golyscheff's Antisymphonie in 3 movements, subtitled "Musikalische Kriegsguillotine". The 3 movements of Golyscheff's piece are titled "provokatorische Spritze", "chaotische Mundhöhle oder das submarine Flugzeug", and "zusammenklappbares Hyper-fis-chendur". and later the Surrealist and Fluxus art movements, specifically the Fluxus artists Joe Jones, Yasunao Tone, George Brecht, Robert Watts, Wolf Vostell, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Walter De Maria's Ocean Music, Milan Knížák's Broken Music Composition, early LaMonte Young and Takehisa Kosugi.Owen Smith, Fluxus: The History of an Attitude (San Diego: San Diego State University Press, 1998), pp. 7 & 82.

Godfrey Harold "G. H." Hardy FRS (7 February 1877 – 1 December 1947)GRO Register of Deaths: DEC 1947 4a 204 Cambridge – Godfrey H. Hardy, aged 70 was an English mathematician, known for his achievements in number theory and mathematical analysis.[tpl]MacTutor Biography|id=Hardy[/tpl][tpl]MathGenealogy |id=17806[/tpl]
He is usually known by those outside the field of mathematics for his essay from 1940 on the aesthetics of mathematics, A Mathematician's Apology, which is often considered one of the best insights into the mind of a working mathematician written for the layman.
Starting in 1914,  he was the mentor of the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, a relationship that has become celebrated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.storyofmathematics.com/20th_hardy.html|title=20TH CENTURY MATHEMATICS – HARDY AND RAMANUJAN|accessdate=2010-12-02[/tpl] Hardy almost immediately recognised Ramanujan's extraordinary albeit untutored brilliance, and Hardy and Ramanujan became close collaborators. In an interview by Paul Erdős, when Hardy was asked what his greatest contribution to mathematics was, Hardy unhesitatingly replied that it was the discovery of Ramanujan. He called their collaboration "the one romantic incident in my life."THE MAN WHO KNEW INFINITY: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan.

Mitchum rose to prominence for his starring roles in several major works of the film noir style, and is considered a forerunner of the anti-heroes prevalent in film during the 1950s and 1960s. He may be best-remembered for his roles in such films as 
The Story of G.I. Joe (1945), Crossfire (1947), Out of the Past (1947), The Night of the Hunter, and Cape Fear (1962).

[[Electronica]]
CATEGORIES: Electronica

Electronica is a music genre encompassing a wide range of contemporary electronic music designed for a wide range of uses, including foreground listening, some forms of dancing, and background music for other activities. Unlike electronic dance music (EDM), not all examples of electronica are necessarily made for dancing.[tpl]citation|quote=Electronica is a broad term used to describe the emergence of electronic music that is geared for listening instead of strictly for dancing. |title=The Techno Primer: The Essential Reference for Loop-Based Music Styles |last=Verderosa |first=Tony |page=28 |publisher=Hal Leonard Music/Songbooks |year=2002 |isbn=0-634-01788-8[/tpl] The genre is loosely defined and has different connotations in different regions and time periods.
Electronica has grown to influence mainstream crossover recordings. Electronic sounds began to form the basis of a wide array of popular music in the late 1970s, and became key to the mainstream pop and rock sounds of the 1980s. Since the adoption of "electronica" in the 1990s to refer to more underground music with an electronic aesthetic, elements of modern electronica have been adopted by many popular artists in mainstream music.

USS ''Missouri'' (BB-63) ("Mighty Mo" or "Big Mo") is a United States Navy [tpl]sclass-|Iowa|battleship[/tpl] and was the third ship of the U.S. Navy to be named in honor of the US state of Missouri. Missouri was the last battleship commissioned by the United States and was the site of the surrender of the Empire of Japan which ended World War II.
Missouri was ordered in 1940 and commissioned in June 1944. In the Pacific Theater of World War II she fought in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa and shelled the Japanese home islands, and she fought in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. She was decommissioned in 1955 into the United States Navy reserve fleets (the "Mothball Fleet"), but reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the 600-ship Navy plan, and provided fire support during Operation Desert Storm in January/February 1991.
Missouri received a total of 11 battle stars for service in World War II, Korea, and the Persian Gulf, and was finally decommissioned on 31 March 1992, but remained on the Naval Vessel Register until her name was struck in January 1995. In 1998, she was donated to the USS Missouri Memorial Association and became a museum ship at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

[[Tresor]]
CATEGORIES: Nightclubs in Berlin, Electronic music record labels, German record labels, 1991 establishments in Germany, Techno record labels

Tresor (German for safe or vault) is an underground techno nightclub and record label. The club was founded in March 1991 in the vaults of the former old Wertheim department store in Mitte, the central part of the former East Berlin, next to the famous Potsdamer Platz, however the history of the club goes back to 1988 when the electronic music label Interfisch opened the Ufo Club in Berlin. Ufo was the original centre of Berlin house and techno, but due to financial problems that club closed in 1990.
After Ufo closed, Interfisch's head, Dimitri Hegemann and some investors in the club found the new space in East Berlin. This was advantageous timing, as it was only a few months before Germany unified.  The vaults under the Wertheim department store proved to be the perfect location for a club, and Tresor quickly became the place to be in Berlin. Tresor continued to be a popular club to this day, having expanded and reconstructed continuously several times to include an outdoor garden area, and a second "Globus" floor. The concept for the Tresor floor in the basement was specifically hard techno, industrial and acid music while Globus was featuring mainly more mellow house sound. The recordlabel Tresor Records was founded soon after the club first opened, in October 1991. Featured artists on the label include Jeff Mills, Blake Baxter, Juan Atkins, Robert Hood, Stewart Walker, Joey Beltram, DJ Surgeon, Pacou, Cristian Vogel, House of Fix and many others.
In 2004 the documentary "Tresor Berlin: The Vault & the Electronic Frontier" was released.  Directed by Mike Andrawis, it features interviews with Hegemann, Carola Stoiber, and DJs & artists associated with the club & label.Birmingham 7 lnch Cinema programme listing[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl] The film covers the period from Hegemann's involvement with the Fishladen and UFO clubs in Berlin-Kreuzberg to the final months prior to Tresor's closure.
Tresor closed on the 16th April, 2005, after several years prolonged short-term rent. The city sold the land to an investor group to build  offices on the Leipziger Straße location.  It was open for each night of April 2005, with the final event starting the Saturday night with queues stretching all the way down the road, and still going Monday morning.
Tresor reopened on 24 May 2007 in a renovated power plant on Köpenicker Straße in Mitte.

Mickey Rooney (born Joseph Yule, Jr.; September 23, 1920 – April 6, 2014) was an American actor of film, television, Broadway, radio, and vaudeville. Beginning as a child actor, his career extended over 90 years, making him one of the most enduring performers in show business history. He appeared in more than 300 films and was one of the last surviving stars of the silent film era, having one of the longest careers in the medium’s history."Mickey Rooney, an enduring star", The Boston Globe, April 7, 2014 
At the height of a career that was marked by precipitous declines and raging comebacks, he played the role of Andy Hardy in a series of fifteen films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A prolific talent, he became a noted character actor later in his career, and could sing, dance, clown and play various musical instruments. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney "the greatest actor of them all," and Clarence Brown, who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, National Velvet and The Human Comedy, said he was "the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with.""Iconic Actor Mickey Rooney Dies At 93", CBS, April 7, 2014
Rooney first performed in vaudeville as a child and made his film debut at age six. At age thirteen he played the role Puck in the play and later the film, A Midsummer Night's Dream in an acclaimed performance, which critic David Thomson praised as "one of cinema's most arresting pieces of magic." He co-starred in Boys Town (1938) with Spencer Tracy, who won an Oscar for his role. At nineteen he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar, for his leading role in Babes in Arms, co-starring Judy Garland, and was awarded a special Juvenile Academy Award in 1939.[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-mickey-rooney-career-20140407,0,3547872,full.story#axzz2yVrN04QO "Mickey Rooney: A long and remarkable career in film, TV", Los Angeles Times, April 7, 2014  Overall, between the age of 15 and 25, while at his peak, he made forty-three pictures and co-starred alongside leading actors, including Judy Garland, Wallace Beery, Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor. Rooney developed into one of MGM's most consistently successful actors, and a favorite of studio head, Louis B. Mayer.
He was the top box office attraction of 1939, but his career never rose to such heights again. He was drafted into the Army during World War II, serving nearly two years entertaining over 2 million troops on stage and on the radio. He was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones. After he returned from the war in 1945, too old for juvenile roles but too short to be a movie star, he was not able to obtain acting roles as significant as before. Nevertheless, Rooney was tenacious and he rebounded, his popularity renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962), It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), and The Black Stallion (1979), for which he was Oscar nominated. In the early 1980s he returned to Broadway in Sugar Babies and once more was a celebrated star. He also made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs and talk shows. During his career, he received four Academy Award nominations and was nominated for five Emmy Awards, winning one.
Rooney's personal life was as tumultuous as his career. He struggled with alcohol and pill addiction, and was married eight times, the first time to actress Ava Gardner. Despite earning millions during his career, he had to file for bankruptcy in 1962 due to mismanagement of his finances. Shortly before his death in 2014 at age 93, he alleged mistreatment by some family members, and testified in Congress about what he alleged was physical abuse and exploitation by family members. By the end of his life, his millions in earnings had dwindled to an estate that was valued at only $18,000,http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/mickey-rooney-s-estate-goes-to-stepson-who-served-as-caregiver-1.2604463 "Mickey Rooney's estate goes to stepson who served as caregiver", The Associated Press, April 9, 2014 and he died owing back taxes and medical bills, with contributions solicited from the public.

[[Daisy wheel printing]]

CATEGORIES: Computer printers, Impact printers, Office equipment

Daisy wheel printing is an impact printing technology invented in 1969 by David S. Lee at Diablo Data Systems. It uses interchangeable pre-formed type elements, each with typically 96 glyphs, to generate high-quality output comparable to premium typewriters such as the IBM Selectric, but two to three times faster. Daisy wheel printing was used in electronic typewriters, word processors and computers from 1972. The daisy wheel is considered to be so named because of its resemblance to the daisy flower.[tpl] cite web|title= Merriam Webster On-line|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/daisy%20wheel [/tpl]
By 1980 daisy wheel printers had become the dominant technology for high-quality print. Dot-matrix impact or thermal printers were used where higher speed was required and poor print quality was acceptable. Both technologies were rapidly superseded for most purposes when dot-based printers—in particular laser printers—that could print any characters or graphics rather than being restricted to a limited character set became able to produce output of comparable quality. Daisy wheel technology is now found only in some electronic typewriters.

The territory that made up the former Chita Oblast was first explored by Cossacks led by Pyotr Beketov in 1653. People began to move into and develop the area in order to strengthen Russia's border with China and Mongolia, extract mineral resources, and build the Trans-Siberian Railway. In 1920, Chita became the capital of the Far East Republic, which merged with Russia in November 1922, a month before the Soviet Union was constituted. In 1923, Chita Oblast was formed.
The oblast was rich in ferrous, non-ferrous, rare, and precious metals, coal, charcoal, and mineral waters. Russia's estimated reserves of ores with a high uranium content are 145,400 tons. Most of these deposits are located in the former Chita Oblast, near Krasnokamensk, site of the Priargunsky Mining and Chemical Combine (PMCC).http://www.nti.org/db/nisprofs/russia/fissmat/minemill/overview.htm Forests cover about 60% of its territory. As a result, the oblast's main industries were metallurgy, fuel, and timber. It also had advanced light and food industries. Local agriculture focused on cattle, sheep, and reindeer breeding.

Television, Television series set on islands

Gilligan's Island is an American sitcom created and produced by Sherwood Schwartz and originally produced by United Artists Television. The situation comedy series featured Bob Denver, Alan Hale, Jr., Jim Backus, Natalie Schafer, Russell Johnson, Tina Louise, and Dawn Wells. It aired for three seasons on the CBS network from September 26, 1964, to April 17, 1967. Originally sponsored by Philip Morris & Company and Procter & Gamble, the show followed the comic adventures of seven castaways as they attempted to survive (and in a later movie escape from) the island on which they had been shipwrecked. Most episodes revolve around the dissimilar castaways' conflicts and their failed attempts (invariably Gilligan's fault) to escape their plight.
Gilligan's Island ran for a total of 98 episodes. The first season, consisting of 36 episodes, was filmed in black-and-white. These episodes were later colorized for syndication. The show's second and third seasons (62 episodes) and the three television movie sequels were filmed in color.
The show enjoyed solid ratings during its original run, then grew in popularity during decades of syndication, especially in the 1970s and 1980s when many markets ran the show in the late afternoon after school. Today, the title character of Gilligan is widely recognized as an American cultural icon.

[[Carolingian dynasty]]
CATEGORIES: Carolingian period, History of the Germanic peoples, Carolingian dynasty, Early Middle Ages, Christianity of the Middle Ages, Descendants of individuals

The Carolingian dynasty (known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolings, or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The name "Carolingian" (Medieval Latin karolingi, an altered form of an unattested Old High German *karling, kerling, meaning "descendant of Charles", cf. MHG kerlinc)Babcock, Philip (ed). Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged. Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, Inc., 1993: 341. derives from the Latinised name of Charles Martel: Carolus.Hollister, Clive, and Bennett, Judith. Medieval Europe: A Short History, p. 97. The family consolidated its power in the late 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and dux et princeps Francorum hereditary and becoming the de facto rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the throne.
By 751, the Merovingian dynasty, which until then had ruled the Franks by right, was deprived of this right with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian, Pepin the Short, was crowned King of the Franks. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first emperor in the west in over three centuries.  His death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the territories of France and Germany.
The area that was eventually to become known as France, however, grew in prosperity under the Carolingian Period due to economic activity brought on by greater international trade.

[[Askafroa]]
CATEGORIES: Germanic legendary creatures, Nordic folklore

The Askafroa (Swedish "wife of the ash tree"Carol (1996:22).), also known as the Danish Askefrue and German Eschenfrau, is a type of legendary creature in Scandinavian and German folklore, similar to the Greek Hamadryads. The Askafroa is the guardian of the ash tree. The Askafroa was thought be a malicious creature which did much damage, and to propriate her it was necessary to make a sacrifice to her on Ash Wednesday.Porteous (2006:93).Hyltén-Cavallius (1864:310).
The Swedish scholar Hyltén-Cavallius recorded in his ethnographic work Wärend och Wirdarne a belief of a female creature living in the ash tree, in Ljunit Hundred. The elders used to sacrifice to the Askafroa on the morning of Ash Wednesday. Before the sun had risen, they poured water over the roots of the ash tree. While doing this they said: "Nu offrar jag, så gör du oss ingen skada" meaning "Now I sacrifice you, so that you do us no harm". Hyltén-Cavallius further writes that they believed that if anyone broke branches or twigs from the ash tree, they would become ill.
The Askafroa is, by any name, quite obscure, and consequently not prominently featured in modern fiction, although the online role-playing game Dark Age of Camelot features enemies in the form of Askefruer/Askafroa.

In Norse Mythology, the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr are nine sisters who gave birth to the god Heimdallr. The Nine Mothers of Heimdallr are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; in the poetry of skalds; and possibly also in a poem in the Poetic Edda, a book of poetry compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material. Scholars have debated what being "born of nine mothers" implies and have sought to connect the notion to other European folk motifs.

[[Ymir]]
CATEGORIES: Jötnar

In Norse mythology, Ymir, Aurgelmir, Brimir, or Bláinn is a primeval being born of primordial elemental poison and the ancestor of all jötnar. Ymir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, in the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, and in the poetry of skalds. Taken together, several stanzas from four poems collected in the Poetic Edda refer to Ymir as a primeval being who was born from venom that dripped from the icy rivers Élivágar and lived in the grassless void of Ginnungagap. Ymir birthed a male and female from the pits of his arms, and his legs together begat a six-headed being. The gods Odin, Vili, and Vé fashioned the Earth (elsewhere personified as a goddess; Jörð) from his flesh, from his blood the ocean, from his bones the hills, from his hair the trees, from his brains the clouds, from his skull the heavens, and from his eyebrows the middle realm in which mankind lives, Midgard. In addition, one stanza relates that the dwarfs were given life by the gods from Ymir's flesh and blood (or the Earth and sea).
In the Prose Edda, a narrative is provided that draws from, adds to, and differs from the accounts in the Poetic Edda. According to the Prose Edda, after Ymir was formed from the elemental drops, so too was Auðumbla, a primeval cow, whose milk Ymir fed from. The Prose Edda states that three gods killed Ymir; the brothers Odin, Vili, and Vé, and details that, upon Ymir's death, his blood caused an immense flood. Scholars have debated as to what extent Snorri's account of Ymir is an attempt to synthesize a coherent narrative for the purpose of the Prose Edda and to what extent Snorri drew from traditional material outside of the corpus that he cites. By way of historical linguistics and comparative mythology, scholars have linked Ymir to Tuisto, the Proto-Germanic being attested by Tacitus in his 1st century AD work Germania and have identified Ymir as an echo of a primordial being reconstructed in Proto-Indo-European mythology.

Auðumbla is not mentioned again in the Prose Edda and, apart from one mention in Nafnaþulur, her name does not occur in any other ancient source. Nevertheless she is generally accepted by scholars as a genuine part of the Norse mythos and not dismissed as an invention of Snorri Sturluson.

Le Bébête Show was a satirical puppet show shown on French television. The show was introduced in Stéphane Collaro's Collaroshow on channel TF1, in 1982, before becoming a daily broadcast. Major French political figures were designed by artists: Alain Duverne, Jacques Loup, Jean-Yves Grall... representing as characters similar to those of The Muppet Show, with, for instance, François Mitterrand portrayed as a frog named Kermitterrand (and naming himself God), a reference to Kermit the Frog. Most characters were voiced by Jean Roucas, who also acted as the show's host. 
Although some French politicians expressed appreciation for their caricatures, some have greeted them with less enthusiasm. Jean-Marie Le Pen sued the show, as he disliked being represented as the vampire "Pencassine", shown wearing a traditional girl's costume from Brittany - a reference to "Bécassine", a 1910s classic French comic character, and to Le Pen's origins in Brittany, while retaining his vampire fangs. Édith Cresson expressed great displeasure at her own puppet: she was depicted as an air-headed panther, submissive to the sexual whims of "Kermitterrand".
Success began to decline with the competition from Les Guignols de l'info. After Roucas' departure, Collaro revamped the puppets in 1994, but this proved unsuccessful, as the show now looked like an imitation of Les Guignols. The show was eventually canceled in 1995.

[[Straw marquetry]]

CATEGORIES: Art genres, Straw art

Straw marquetry is a craft very similar to that of wood marquetry, except that straw replaces the wood veneer. It is thought to have first been practised in the East; examples were brought to England in the 17th century.
To mimic the varying shades of wood veneer, wheat or oat straw has to be split, then soaked in cold, warm, or hot water. The strips are then ironed, and there will be a variety of tones from pale gold to deepest dark brown. 
There are accounts of nuns in France and Switzerland making a variety of items using straw marquetry.
The most famous straw marquetry was practised by prisoners of war from the Napoleonic wars. Dartmoor and other prisons had been built for them; the prison most famous for straw marquetry was Norman Cross, Huntingdon. 
Easter eggs are decorated with straw applique, especially in Eastern European countries. Geometric shapes, stars and flower motifs are the most common themes. There is a slight difference in the way the straw is prepared, however; for marquetry, the straws are soaked, split and ironed; for egg decoration the straw is not ironed.

[[Marquetry]]

CATEGORIES: Decorative arts, Surface decorative techniques in woodworking, History of furniture, Woodworking

Marquetry (also spelled as marqueterie) is the art and craft of applying pieces of veneer to a structure to form decorative patterns, designs or pictures. The technique may be applied to case furniture or even seat furniture, to decorative small objects with smooth, veneerable surfaces or to freestanding pictorial panels appreciated in their own right. Parquetry is very similar in technique to marquetry: in the former the pieces of veneer are of simple repeating geometric shapes, forming tiling patterns such as would cover a floor (parquet), or forming basketweave or brickwork patterns, trelliswork and the like.  
Marquetry (and parquetry too) differs from the more ancient craft of inlay, or intarsia, in which a solid body of one material is cut out to receive sections of another to form the surface pattern.  The word derives from a Middle French word meaning "inlaid work".

CATEGORIES: Accipitridae, Bird families, Birds of prey

The Accipitridae, one of the two major families within the order Accipitriformes (the diurnal birds of prey), are a family of small to large birds with strongly hooked bills and variable morphology based on diet. They feed on a range of prey items from insects to medium-sized mammals, with a number feeding on carrion and a few feeding on fruit. The Accipitridae have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found on all the world's continents (except Antarctica) and a number of oceanic island groups. Some species are migratory.
Many well-known birds, such as hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures are included in this group. The Osprey is usually placed in a separate family (Pandionidae), as is the Secretary bird (Sagittariidae), and the New World vultures are also usually now regarded as a separate family or order. Karyotype data[tpl]sfn|de Boer|1975[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Amaral|Jorge|2003[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Federico|Cantarella|Scavo|Saccone|2005[/tpl] indicated that the accipitrids hitherto analysed are indeed a distinct monophyletic group, but whether this group should be considered a family of the Falconiformes or one or several order(s) on their own is a question that is still to be resolved.

[[Cargo cult]]
CATEGORIES: Cargo cults, Messianism

A cargo cult is a Melanesian millenarian movement encompassing a diverse range of practices and occurring in the wake of contact with the commercial networks of colonizing societies.  The name derives from the apparent belief that various ritualistic acts will lead to a bestowing of material wealth ("cargo").[tpl]cite book |last=Burridge |first=Kenelm |title=New Heaven, New Earth: A study of Millenarian Activities |year=1969 |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=London |page=48[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Lindstrom |first=Lamont |title=Cargo Cult: Strange Stories of desire from Melanesia and beyond |year=1993 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu[/tpl]
Cargo cults often develop during a combination of crises. Under conditions of social stress, such a movement may form under the leadership of a charismatic figure. This leader may have a "vision" (or "myth-dream") of the future, often linked to an ancestral efficacy thought to be recoverable by a return to traditional morality.[tpl]cite book |last=Burridge |first=Kenelm |editor1-last=Lockwood |editor1-first=V.

Contact with colonizing groups brought about a considerable transformation in the way indigenous peoples of Melanesia have thought about other societies.  Early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that practitioners simply failed to understand technology, colonization, or capitalist reform; in this model, cargo cults are a misunderstanding of the trade networks involved in resource distribution and an attempt to acquire such goods in the wake of interrupted trade. However, many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new social relationships, with material relations being secondary.[tpl]cite journal|last=Otto|first=Ton|title=What happened to Cargo Cults? Material Religions in Melanesia and the West|journal=Social Analysis|year=2009|volume=53|issue=1|pages=93–4[/tpl]
Since the late twentieth century, alternative theories have arisen.  For example, some scholars, such as Kaplan and Lindstrom, focus on Europeans' characterization of these movements as a fascination with manufactured goods and what such a focus says about Western commodity fetishism. Others point to the need to see each movement as reflecting a particularized historical context, even eschewing the term "cargo cult" for them unless there is an attempt to elicit an exchange relationship from Europeans.[tpl]cite journal |last=Otto |first=Ton |title=What happened to Cargo Cults?

Cargo cults—the religious practice that has appeared in many traditional tribal societies in the wake of interaction with technologically advanced cultures—focus on obtaining the material wealth (the "cargo") of the advanced culture by building mock aircraft, landing strips, and the like.

That Was the Week That Was, informally TWTWTW or TW3, was a satirical television comedy programme on BBC Television in 1962 and 1963. It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.
The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday 24 November 1962.

[[Government of the Cayman Islands]]

CATEGORIES: Government of the Cayman Islands

Government of the Cayman Islands takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic overseas territory, whereby the Premier is the head of government, and of a  two-party system.[tpl]clarify|this seems to suggest that a two-party system is required by constitution. I assume this is untrue and needs to be separated from the previous sentence and stated more offhandedly that this "happens" to occur in a 2-party system. It is not required, presumably|date=June 2013[/tpl] Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Legislative Assembly. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
The Cayman Islands' physical isolation under early British colonial rule allowed the development of an indigenous set of administrative and legal traditions which were codified into a constitution in 1959.  A constitution, which devolved some authority from the United Kingdom to the Cayman Islands government, was passed by referendum on 20 May 2009.  Subsequently, the islands have become largely self-governing.
The Cayman Islands' government is aided by a tradition of restrained civil governance from the United Kingdom.

Coming Up for Air is a novel by George Orwell, first published in June 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. It combines premonitions of the impending war with images of an idyllic Thames-side Edwardian era childhood. The novel is pessimistic, with its view that speculative builders, commercialism and capitalism are killing the best of rural England,  "everything cemented over", and there are great new external threats.

CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Dog breeds originating in France, Dog breeds originating in the Netherlands, Sporting dogs

The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon (called the Korthals  Griffon in the UK, and the Griffon d'arrêt à poil dur Korthals in France and Quebec) is a breed of dog used in hunting as a gundog.  It is sometimes considered to be Dutch in ancestry, due to the nationality of the breed founder, Eduard Karel Korthals.  Others consider the Griffon to be a German breed because Korthals' kennel, Ipenwoud, was located in Biebesheim am Rhein, Germany.  It was there for over twenty years that Korthals dedicated his life to the development  and perfection of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon.
The breed is still relatively rare in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom despite long recognition by their respective kennel clubs, as well as the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale).  The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is particularly adapted for hunting in thick undergrowth and around water, where its harsh coat is excellent protection.

CATEGORIES: Servants in Norse mythology

Beyla is one of Freyr's servants along with her husband, Byggvir, in Norse mythology. Beyla is mentioned in stanzas 55, 66, and the prose introduction to the Poetic Edda poem Lokasenna. Since this is the only mention of Beyla, scholars have turned to the etymology of Beyla's name for additional information about her. However, the meaning of her name is unclear and her name has been proposed as related to "cow," "bean," or "bee."

Byggvir is a figure in Norse mythology. The only surviving mention of Byggvir appears in the prose beginning of Lokasenna, and stanzas 55 through 56 of the same poem, where he is referred to as one of Freyr's servants and as the husband of Beyla.
Bygg is the Old Norse word for barley. Subsequently, Byggvir is often identified with this etymology of his name and connections have been placed with the mentioning of Byggvir's described involvement with mill-grinding as being potential references to barley processing.Lindow (2001:90-91) Comparisons to the Anglo-Saxon figure of Beowa (Old English "barley") have been put forth.Bruce (2002:28).

Oedipus the King ([tpl]lang-grc|Οἰδίπους Τύραννος[/tpl], Oidipous Turannos), also known by the Latin title Oedipus Rex, is an Athenian tragedy by Sophocles that was first performed c. 429 BC.Although Sophocles won second prize with the group of plays that included Oedipus the King, its date of production is uncertain. The prominence of the Theban plague at the play's opening suggests to many scholars a reference to the plague that devastated Athens in 430 BC, and hence a production date shortly thereafter. See, for example, [tpl]cite journal|authorlink=Bernard Knox|first=Bernard|last=Knox|title=The Date of the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles|journal=American Journal of Philology|volume=77|issue=2|year=1956|pages=133–147|jstor=292475 [/tpl] It was the second of Sophocles's three Theban plays to be produced, but it comes first in the internal chronology, followed by Oedipus at Colonus and then Antigone. Oedipus Rex chronicles the story of Oedipus, a man who becomes the king of Thebes while in the process unwittingly fulfilling a prophecy that he would murder his father Laius and marry his mother Jocasta. The play is an example of a classic tragedy, noticeably containing an emphasis on how Oedipus's own faults contribute to the tragic hero's downfall, as opposed to having fate be the sole cause. Over the centuries, Oedipus Rex has come to be regarded by many as the Greek tragedy par excellence.It is widely argued that Aristotle in his Poetics identifies Oedipus the King as the best Greek tragedy.

In Mexican cuisine, pico de gallo ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈpiko ðe ˈɣaʎo[/tpl], literally rooster's beak), also called  salsa fresca, is a fresh, uncooked salad made from chopped tomato, white onion, and chilis (generally jalapeños, serranos or habaneros). Other ingredients may also be added, such as shrimp, vienna sausage or squid, avocado, key lime juice, lime juice or apple cider vinegar, fresh coriander leafs, cucumber, radish or firm fruit such as mango. It is generally eaten with tortilla chips.
Pico de gallo can be used in much the same way as other salsas, Kenyan kachumbari, or Indian chutneys, but since it contains less liquid, it can also be used as a main ingredient in dishes such as tacos and fajitas.
The tomato-based variety is widely known as salsa picada (minced/chopped sauce). In Mexico it is sometimes called salsa mexicana (Mexican sauce). Because the colors of the red tomato, white onion, green chili are reminiscent of the colors of the Mexican flag, it is also sometimes called salsa bandera (flag sauce).
In many regions of Mexico the term refers to any of a variety of salads (including fruit salads), salsa, or fillings made with tomato, tomatillo, avocado, melon, orange, jícama, cucumber, papaya, or mild chilis. The ingredients are tossed in lime juice and either hot sauce or chamoy, then sprinkled with a salty chili powder.

CATEGORIES: Tortilla, Flatbreads, Appetizers, Nahuatl words and phrases

In Mexico and Central America, a tortilla is a type of thin, unleavened flat bread, made from finely ground maize (usually called "corn" in the United States). In Guatemala and Mexico, there are three colors of maize dough for making tortillas: white maize, yellow maize and blue maize (or black maize).
A similar bread from South America, called arepa (though arepas are typically much thicker than tortillas), predates the arrival of Europeans to America, and was called tortilla by the Spanish from its resemblance to the traditional Spanish round, unleavened cakes and omelettes (originally made without potatoes, which are native to South America). The Aztecs and other Nahuatl-speakers call tortillas tlaxcalli [tpl]IPA-nah|t͡ɬaʃˈkalːi|[/tpl];Nahuatl Dictionary. (1997). Wired Humanities Project. University of Oregon. Retrieved August 29, 2012, from link these have become the prototypical tortillas.
Maize kernels naturally occur in many colors, depending on the cultivar: from pale white, to yellow, to red and bluish purple. Likewise, corn meal and the tortillas made from it may be similarly colored. White and yellow tortillas are by far the most common, however.

He made significant contributions to the fields of analysis, number theory, and both classical and celestial mechanics.
In 1766, on the recommendation of Euler and d'Alembert, Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, Prussia, where he stayed for over twenty years, producing volumes of work and winning several prizes of the French Academy of Sciences. Lagrange's treatise on analytical mechanics (Mécanique Analytique, 4. ed., 2 vols. Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1888–89), written in Berlin and first published in 1788, offered the most comprehensive treatment of classical mechanics since Newton and formed a basis for the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century.
In 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to Paris and became a member of the French Academy. He remained in France until the end of his life. 
He was significantly involved in the decimalisation in Revolutionary France, became the first professor of analysis at the École Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794,  founding member of the Bureau des Longitudes and  Senator in 1799.

It belongs to the Bantu branch of the Niger–Congo language family. Typologically, it is a highly agglutinating language with subject–verb–object word order and nominative–accusative morphosyntactic alignment.
With about seven million first-language-speakers in the Buganda region and about ten million others with a working knowledge, it is the most widely spoken Ugandan language, and as second language it follows English and precedes Swahili. The language is used in some primary schools in Buganda as pupils begin to learn English, the primary official language of Uganda.  Until the 1960s, Ganda was also the official language of instruction in primary schools in Eastern Uganda.

Son of Adad-nirari I, he succeeded his father as king in 1265 BC.
According to his annals, discovered at Assur, in his first year he conquered eight countries in the northwest and destroyed the fortress of Arinnu, the dust of which he brought to Assur. In his second year he defeated Shattuara, king of Hanilgalbat (Mitanni), and his Hittite and Ahlamu allies. He incorporated the remains of the Mittani kingdom as part of one of the Assyrian provinces. Shalmaneser I also claimed to have blinded 14,400 enemy prisoners in one eye. He was one of the first Assyrian kings who was known to deport his defeated enemies to various lands rather than simply slaughtering them all.
He conquered the whole country from Taidu to Irridu, from Mount Kashiar to Eluhat, and from the fortresses of Sudu and Harranu to Carchemish on the Euphrates.

[[Ratio]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary mathematics, Algebra, Ratios

In mathematics, a ratio is a relationship between two numbers of the same kindWentworth, p. 55 (e.g., objects, persons, students, spoonfuls, units of whatever identical dimension), expressed as "a to b" or a:b, sometimes expressed arithmetically as a dimensionless quotient of the twoNew International Encyclopedia that explicitly indicates how many times the first number contains the second (not necessarily an integer).Penny Cyclopedia, p. 307
In layman's terms a ratio represents, for every amount of one thing, how much there is of another thing. For example, supposing one has 8 oranges and 6 lemons in a bowl of fruit, the ratio of oranges to lemons would be 4:3 (which is equivalent to 8:6) while the ratio of lemons to oranges would be 3:4. Additionally, the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 4:7 (equivalent to 8:14). The 4:7 ratio can be further converted to a fraction of 4/7 to represent how much of the fruit is oranges.

For some time in the late 1980s many considered the transputer to be the next great design for the future of computing. While Inmos and the transputer did not ultimately live up to this expectation, the transputer architecture was highly influential in provoking new ideas in computer architecture, several of which have re-emerged in different forms in modern systems.

Paranoid Schizophrenia.  Mayo Clinic.  Retrieved from http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/paranoid-schizophrenia/DS00862/DSECTION=symptoms  Schizophrenia is divided into subtypes based on the “predominant symptomatology at the time of evaluation”.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  DSM-IV Criteria for Schizophrenia.  DNA Learning Center.  Retrieved from http://www.dnalc.org/view/899-DSM-IV-Criteria-for-Schizophrenia.html The clinical picture is dominated by relatively stable, often paranoid, delusions, usually accompanied by hallucinations, particularly of the auditory variety (hearing voices), and perceptual disturbances. These symptoms can have a huge effect on functioning and can negatively impact a person’s quality of life. Paranoid schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, but with proper treatment, a person suffering from the illness can live a higher quality of life.
Although paranoid schizophrenia is defined by those two symptoms, it is also defined by a lack of certain symptoms (negative symptoms). The following symptoms are not prominent:  “disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, or flat or inappropriate affect”.  Those symptoms are present in another form of schizophrenia, disorganized-type schizophrenia. The criteria for diagnosing paranoid schizophrenia must be present from at least one to six months. This helps to differentiate schizophrenia from other illnesses, such as bipolar disorder. It also ensures that the illness is chronic and not acute, and will not go away in time.
Paranoid schizophrenia is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, but it was dropped from the 5th Edition. The American Psychological Association chose to eliminate schizophrenia subtypes because they had “limited diagnostic stability, low reliability, and poor validity”.Grohol, John M. (2013).  DSM-V changes:  schizophrenia and psychotic disorders.  Psych Central.  Retrieved from http://pro.psychcentral.com/2013/dsm-5-changes-schizophrenia-psychotic-disorders/004336.html# The symptoms and lack of symptoms that were being used to categorize the different subtypes of schizophrenia were not concrete enough to be able to be diagnosed. The APA also believed that the subtypes of schizophrenia should be removed because “they did not appear to help with providing better targeted treatment, or predicting treatment response”. Targeted treatment and treatment response vary from patient to patient, depending on his or her symptoms associated with the illness. It is more beneficial, therefore, to look at the severity of the symptoms when considering treatment options.

CATEGORIES: Antimatter, Baryons, Nucleons

The antiproton, [tpl]SubatomicParticle|Antiproton[/tpl], pronounced p-bar) is the antiparticle of the proton. Antiprotons are stable, but they are typically short-lived since any collision with a proton will cause both particles to be annihilated in a burst of energy.
The existence of the antiproton with −1 electric charge, opposite to the +1 electric charge of the proton, was predicted by Paul Dirac in his 1933 Nobel Prize lecture.[ref]

The antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicists Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics. An antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark ([tpl]SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up antiquark[/tpl][tpl]SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up antiquark[/tpl][tpl]SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down antiquark[/tpl]).  The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception that the antiproton has electric charge and magnetic moment that are the opposites of those in the proton.  The questions of how matter is different from antimatter, and the relevance of antimatter in explaining how our universe survived the Big Bang remain open problems - open, in part, due to  the relative dearth of antimatter in today's universe.

Drawn thread work also known as pulled thread work, is a form of counted-thread embroidery based on removing threads from the warp and/or the weft of a piece of even-weave fabric. 
The remaining threads are grouped or bundled together into a variety of patterns. The more elaborate styles of drawn thread work use in fact a variety of other stitches and techniques, but the drawn thread parts are their most distinctive element. It is also grouped as whitework embroidery because it was traditionally done in white thread on white fabric and is often combined with other whitework techniques.

The Wandering Jew is a figure whose legend began to spread in Europe in the 13th century.as described in the first chapter of Curious Myths of the Middle Ages where Sabine Baring-Gould attributed the earliest extant mention of the myth of the Wandering Jew to Matthew Paris. The chapter began with a reference to Gustave Doré's series of twelve illustrations to the legend, and ended with a sentence remarking that, while the original legend was so 'noble in its severe simplicity' that few could develop it with success in poetry or otherwise, Doré had produced in this series 'at once a poem, a romance, and a chef-d'oeuvre of art'. First published in two parts in 1866 and 1868, the work was republished in 1877 and in many other editions.http://archive.org/stream/curiousmythsofmi00bariuoft/curiousmythsofmi00bariuoft_djvu.txt
The original legend concerns a Jew who taunted Jesus on the way to the Crucifixion and was then cursed to walk the earth until the Second Coming. The exact nature of the wanderer's indiscretion varies in different versions of the tale, as do aspects of his character; sometimes he is said to be a shoemaker or other tradesman, while sometimes he is the doorman at Pontius Pilate's estate.

Depending on manuscript variation, the Prose Edda adds that Dagr is either Dellingr's son by Nótt, the personified night, or Jörð, the personified Earth.

[[Skinfaxi and Hrímfaxi]]

CATEGORIES: Horses in Norse mythology

In Norse mythology, Skinfaxi and Hrímfaxi are the horses of  Dagr (day) and Nótt (night). The names Skinfaxi and Hrímfaxi are bahuvrihis, meaning "shining mane" and "rime mane" (or "frost mane"), respectively. Skinfaxi pulled Dagr's chariot across the sky every day and his mane lit up the sky and the earth below.
A general problem with the Nordic mythology is the lack of written and reliable sources. Scandinavia is an area with huge impact of geological transformations with lead to many changes in settlement structure. The artefact of Tundholm is one of  the strongest evidences for the mythology of Skinfaxi.
The myth of Skinfaxi is believed to originate in Nordic Bronze Age religion, for which there is strong evidence of beliefs involving a horse pulling the sun across the sky. The Trundholm sun chariot is drawn by a single horse, and was possibly imagined to be pulled back across the sky west to east by a second horse. Related are Arvak and Alsvid, the horses of the chariot of Sól, now a team of two horses pulling a single chariot. 
In the Codex Regius, Skinfaxi and Hrimfaxi are mentioned in the Vafþrúðnismál during the battle of wits between Odin and Vafþrúðnir (the jotun). This is the oldest manuscript that has these two horses mentioned in verses 7 and 8.

The Prose Edda adds that, depending on manuscript variation, he is either the third husband of Nótt, the personified night, or the husband of Jörð, the personified earth. Dellingr is also attested in the legendary saga Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks.

Nótt's third marriage was to the god Dellingr and this resulted in their son Dagr, the personified day (although some manuscript variations list Jörð as Dellingr's wife and Dagr's mother instead).

Mount Tahan ([tpl]lang-ms|Gunung Tahan[/tpl]), at 2,187 m, is the highest point in Peninsular Malaysia. It is located within the Taman Negara national forest, in the state of Pahang. The mountain is part of the Tahan Range in the Tenasserim Hills and is popular with local climbers.
In the Malay language, "gunung" means "mountain," while "tahan" means "endure". Thus, the name of the mountain suggests that a certain level of physical endurance is required to conquer it. Gunung Tahan is considered by many to be one of the toughest treks in Peninsular Malaysia.

[[Einherjar]]

CATEGORIES: Heroes in Norse myths and legends, Norse mythology, Ghosts, Woden

In Norse mythology, the einherjar (Old Norse "single (or once) fighters"Orchard (1997:36) and Lindow (2001:104).) are those that have died in battle and are brought to Valhalla by valkyries. In Valhalla, the einherjar eat their fill of the nightly-resurrecting beast Sæhrímnir, and are brought their fill of mead (from the udder of the goat Heiðrún) by valkyries. The einherjar prepare daily for the events of Ragnarök, when they will advance for an immense battle at the field of Vígríðr; the battle which the "ein" (here meaning single-time) refers to.
The einherjar are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, the poem Hákonarmál (by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir) as collected in Heimskringla, and a stanza of an anonymous 10th century poem commemorating the death of Eric Bloodaxe known as Eiríksmál as compiled in Fagrskinna.
Scholarly theories have been proposed etymologically connecting the einherjar to the Harii (a Germanic tribe attested in the 1st century AD), the eternal battle of Hjaðningavíg, and the Wild Hunt. The einherjar have been the subject of works of art and poetry.

The name of the county is the Spanish word for the peace, and is taken from the early settlement (now ghost town) of La Paz along the Colorado River.
La Paz County was established in 1983 after voters approved separating the northern portion of Yuma County, making it the first and only county to be established after Arizona became a state in 1912. The county did not have a large enough tax base to begin supporting a separate county government immediately and had to rely on state money at first. As a result Arizona laws were changed to make splitting other existing counties much more difficult.
The Colorado River Indian Reservation is located in the western portion of the county. Part of the reservation extends westward into San Bernardino and Riverside Counties in California.

The cor anglais is a transposing instrument pitched in F, a perfect fifth lower than the oboe (a C instrument), and is consequently approximately one and a half times the length of the oboe. The fingering and playing technique used for the cor anglais are essentially the same as those of the oboe, and most oboists double on the cor anglais. Music for the cor anglais is thus written a perfect fifth higher than the instrument actually sounds. Because the cor anglais normally lacks the lowest B-flat key found on most oboes, its sounding range stretches from the E (written B natural) below middle C to the C two octaves above middle C.

[[Abkhaz alphabet]]

CATEGORIES: Cyrillic alphabets, Abkhaz language

The Abkhaz alphabet is an alphabet for the Abkhaz language which consists of 62 letters.
Abkhaz did not become a written language until the 19th century. Hitherto, Abkhazians, especially princes, had been using Greek (up to c. 9th century), Georgian (9–19th centuries), and partially Turkish (18th century) languages.Бгажба Х. С. Из истории письменности в Абхазии. — Тбилиси. 1967. С. 34 The Abkhaz word for alphabet is анбан (anban), which was borrowed from Georgian ანბანი (anbani).
The first dedicated Abkhaz alphabet was created in 1862 by the Russian general Peter von Uslar. It had 37 letters and was based on the Cyrillic script. In 1909, it was expanded to 55 letters by Aleksey Chochua to adjust to the extensive consonantal inventory of Abkhaz.
In 1926, during the korenizatsiya policy in the Soviet Union, the Cyrillic alphabet was replaced by a Latin alphabet devised by Nikolay Marr. It featured 77 letters and was called the "Abkhaz analytical alphabet". In 1928, this was replaced by another Latin alphabet. (See illustration at right.) From 1938 to 1954 the Abkhaz language was written in the Georgian alphabet.
Since 1954, the Abkhaz language has been written in a new 62-letter Cyrillic alphabet (see chart below). Of these, 38 are graphically distinct; the rest are digraphs with [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ь[/tpl][/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|ә[/tpl][/tpl] which indicate palatalization and labialization, respectively. Unusually, the Cyrillic plosive letters К П Т represent ejective consonants; the non-ejectives (pulmonic consonants) are derived from these by means of a descender at the bottom of the letter. In the case of the affricates, however, the plain letter are pulmonic, and the derived letters ejective.
The modern Abkhaz orthography gives preference to the letters Г П with descender ([tpl]unicode|Ӷ Ԥ[/tpl]) instead of hook ([tpl]unicode|Ҕ Ҧ[/tpl]). The characters [tpl]unicode|Ԥ[/tpl] and [tpl]unicode|ԥ[/tpl] are encoded in Unicode since version 5.2.http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3435.pdf

Ten months later, she moved up in weight and challenged undefeated Mary Elizabeth Ortega for the WIBA super bantamweight title, again winning a 10-round unanimous decision.
Vélez won her first 10 pro fights before suffering her first loss as a professional, in her first defense of the WIBA title. On June 21, 2002, Melissa Del Valle decisioned Vélez in Waco, Texas in the featured bout on an all-women's card featuring world champions Anne Wolfe, Sumya Anani, Delia Gonzalez and Kelsey Jeffries.
On December 21, she bounced back to reclaim the IBA version of the world bantamweight title by decisioning Lakeysha Williams over 10 rounds. 
Vélez has added the WIBA bantamweight title to her IBA belt on June 28, 2003, when she beat Gonzalez on a seventh-round disqualification.
Vélez traveled to Denmark to defend her WIBA bantamweight title against Anita Christensen. on January 17, 2004, Vélez lost a highly controversial 10 round split decision to Christensen.
Vélez had knocked down Christensen in the 9th round, and looked to be the obvious winner of their encounter. The Danish press strongly criticized this decision, saying on record that Vélez was robbed of her title.

This is a list of counties in Connecticut. There are currently eight counties in the U.S. state of Connecticut. Four of them were created in 1666, during the first consolidation of the colony of Connecticut from a number of smaller colonies. Two counties were created during colonial times, and two counties, Middlesex and Tolland, were created after American independence (both in 1785). Six of the counties are named for locations in England, where many early Connecticut settlers originated.[tpl]cite book | last=Clark, George Larkin | title =A History of Connecticut, Its People and Institutions | publisher =G.P.

Although Connecticut is divided into counties, there is no county government in Connecticut and local government consists of cities and towns.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/ctportal/cwp/view.asp?a=843&q=246434|title=About Connecticut|work=CT.gov|accessdate=2007-07-17[/tpl]An Overview of County Government, National Association of Counties website, accessed 5 January 2008 County government was abolished in Connecticut in 1960, although the names remain for geographical purposes. Counties are, however, still used by the state to organize its judicial and state marshal system. Connecticut's court jurisdictions still adhere to the county boundaries, except for Fairfield, Hartford and New Haven, which have been further subdivided into several jurisdictions.
The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Fairfield County, Connecticut is 001, Belknap County, New Hampshire and Alachua County, Florida are also 001. To uniquely identify Fairfield County, Connecticut, one must use the state code of 09 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Fairfield County, Connecticut is 09001.

[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]

CATEGORIES: 1999 books, Futurology books, Transhumanist books, Viking Press books, Books about cognition

The Age of Spiritual Machines is a non-fiction book by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil about artificial intelligence and the future course of humanity. First published in hardcover on January 1, 1999 by Viking, it has received attention from The New York Times, The New York Review of Books and The Atlantic. In the book Kurzweil outlines his vision for how technology will progress during the 21st century.
Kurzweil believes evolution provides evidence that humans will one day create machines more  intelligent than they are. He presents his law of accelerating returns to explain why "key events" happen more frequently as time marches on. It also explains why the computational capacity of computers is increasing exponentially. Kurzweil writes that this increase is one ingredient in the creation of artificial intelligence, the others are automatic knowledge acquisition and algorithms like recursion, neural networks, and genetic algorithms.
Kurzweil predicts machines with human-level intelligence will be available from affordable computing devices within a couple of decades, revolutionizing most aspects of life. He says nanotechnology will augment our bodies and cure cancer even as humans connect to computers via direct neural interfaces or live full-time in virtual reality. Kurzweil predicts the machines "will appear to have their own free will" and even "spiritual experiences".[tpl]sfn|Kurzweil|1999|p=6[/tpl] He says humans will essentially live forever as humanity and its machinery become one and the same. He predicts that intelligence will expand outward from earth until it grows powerful enough to influence the fate of the universe.
Reviewers appreciated Kurzweil's track record with predictions, his ability to extrapolate technology trends, and his clear explanations. However there was disagreement on whether computers will one day be conscious. Philosophers John Searle and Colin McGinn insist that computation alone cannot possibly create a conscious machine. Searle deploys a variant of his well-known Chinese room argument, this time tailored to computers playing chess, a topic Kurzweil covers. Searle writes that computers can only manipulate symbols which are meaningless to them, an assertion which if true subverts much of the vision of the book.

[[Educational reform in occupied Japan]]

CATEGORIES: Occupied Japan, History of education in Japan

During World War II, many Japanese students were enlisted to actively help in the war effort, effectively turning schools into factories. Bombings destroyed many schools. After the war, this left a lot for the occupation forces to help rebuild.
The occupation team addressed the educational system. The Japanese methods were nearly opposite to that of the United States: control of schools was highly centralized, rote memorization of verbatim book knowledge without much interaction described the standard student-teacher relationship and the study texts were described as boring. The ratio of school years was made to resemble that of the United States' which was 6 years Elementary education : 3 years Lower Secondary education : 3 years Upper Secondary education : 4 years Higher Education.  Over the period of occupation, these and many other trends were changed. A less centralized hierarchy of school administrators was introduced; totally unprecedented, parents were allowed to vote for school boards. A new textbook industry was created.
However, after the end of occupation, much of Japan's educational system reverted to the older system.

The menstrual cycle is essential for the production of eggs, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. The cycle occurs only in fertile female humans and other female primates. In human females, the menstrual cycle occurs repeatedly between the age of menarche, when cycling begins, until menopause, when it ends.
In humans, the length of a menstrual cycle varies greatly among women (ranging from 21 to 35 days), with 28 days designated as the average length.[tpl]cite book |last1 = Widmaier|first1 = Eric P.|last2 = Raff|first2 = Hershel|last3 = Strang|first3 = Kevin T.|title = Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanism of Body Function | edition=12th |publisher = McGrawHill |location = New York, NY | year = 2010 |isbn = 0-077-35001-4 |pages=555–631[/tpl] Each cycle can be divided into three phases based on events in the ovary (ovarian cycle) or in the uterus (uterine cycle). The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle is divided into menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase. Both cycles are controlled by the endocrine system and the normal hormonal changes that occur can be interfered with using hormonal contraception to prevent reproduction.[tpl]cite journal |author=Klump KL, Keel PK, Racine SE, et al. |title=The interactive effects of estrogen and progesterone on changes in emotional eating across the menstrual cycle |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=122 |issue=1 |pages=131–7 |date=February 2013 |pmid=22889242 |doi=10.1037/a0029524[/tpl]
By convention, the length of an individual menstrual cycle in days is counted starting with the first day of menstrual bleeding. Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of estrogen in the follicular phase, discharges of blood (menses) slow then stop, and the lining of the uterus thickens. Follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles atrophy and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24–36 hours after the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an ovum, or egg, in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the egg only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a corpus luteum; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of progesterone. Under the influence of progesterone, the endometrium (uterine lining) changes to prepare for potential implantation of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing sharp drops in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining and egg in a process termed menstruation.
In the menstrual cycle, changes occur in the female reproductive system as well as in other bodily systems (which can lead to breast tenderness or mood changes, for example). A woman's first menstruation is termed menarche, and occurs typically around age 12-13. The end of a woman's reproductive phase of life is called the menopause, and this commonly occurs somewhere between the ages of 45 and 55.

In Norse mythology, Gleipnir (Old Norse "open one"Orchard (1997:58).) is the binding that holds the mighty wolf Fenrir (as attested in chapter 34 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning). The Gods had attempted to bind Fenrir twice before with huge chains of metal, but Fenrir was able to break free both times. Therefore, they commissioned the dwarves to forge a chain that was impossible to break. To create a chain to achieve the impossible, the dwarves fashioned the chain out of six supposedly impossible things: 
Therefore, even though Gleipnir is as thin as a silken ribbon, it is stronger than any iron chain. It was forged by the dwarves in their underground realm of Niðavellir.
Gleipnir, having bound Fenrir securely, was the cause of Týr's lost hand, for Fenrir bit it off in revenge when he was not freed. Gleipnir is said to hold until Ragnarök, when Fenrir will finally break free and devour Odin.

Myopia ([tpl]lang-grc|μυωπία[/tpl], muōpia, from myein "to shut" – ops (gen. opos) "eye"[tpl]OEtymD|myopia[/tpl]), commonly known as being nearsighted (American English) and shortsighted (British English), is a condition of the eye where the light that comes in does not directly focus on the retina but in front of it, causing the image that one sees when looking at a distant object to be out of focus, but in focus when looking at a close object.
Eye care professionals most commonly correct myopia through the use of corrective lenses, such as glasses or contact lenses. It may also be corrected by refractive surgery, though there are cases of associated side effects. The corrective lenses have a negative optical power (i.e. have a net concave effect) which compensates for the excessive positive diopters of the myopic eye. Negative diopters are generally used to describe the severity of the myopia, as this is value of the lens to correct the eye. High-degree myopia, or severe myopia, is defined as -6 diopters or worse.[tpl]citation|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=21992936|title=Etiopathogenesis and management of high-degree myopia.

However, many men with prostate cancer never have symptoms, undergo no therapy, and eventually die of other unrelated causes. Many factors, including genetics and diet, have been implicated in the development of prostate cancer. Recently the prevalence of light pollution has been implicated in the development of prostate cancer.[tpl]cite book|last=Haim|first=Abraham|title=Light Pollution as new risk factor for human Breast and Prostate cancers|year=2013|isbn=978-94-007-6220-6[/tpl]
The presence of prostate cancer may be indicated by symptoms, physical examination, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or biopsy. Prostate-specific antigen testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality.  The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2012 recommended against screening for prostate cancer using the PSA testing, due to the risk of over-diagnosis and over-treatment with most prostate cancer remaining asymptomatic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/prostatecancerscreening/prostatecancerscript.pdf |title=Talking With Your Patients About Screening for Prostate Cancer |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-02[/tpl]  The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefit of testing does not outweigh the expected harms.
Management strategies for prostate cancer should be guided by the severity of the disease. Many low-risk tumors can be safely followed with active surveillance. Curative treatment generally involves  surgery, various forms of radiation therapy, proton therapy or, less commonly, cryosurgery; hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are generally reserved for cases of advanced disease (although hormonal therapy may be given with radiation in some cases). Several studies suggest that masturbation reduces the risk of prostate cancer, but the results are controversial.[tpl]cite journal|last=Leitzmann|first=MF|coauthors=Platz, EA; Stampfer, MJ; Willett, WC; Giovannucci, E|title=Ejaculation frequency and subsequent risk of prostate cancer.|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Apr 7, 2004|volume=291|issue=13|pages=1578–86|pmid=15069045|doi=10.1001/jama.291.13.1578[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Giles|first=G.G.|coauthors=Severi, G.; English, D.R.; McCredie, M.R.E.; Borland, R.; Boyle, P.; Hopper, J.L.|title=Sexual factors and prostate cancer|journal=BJU International|date=23 July 2003|volume=92|issue=3|pages=211–216|doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04319.x|pmid=12887469[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Dimitropoulou|first=P|coauthors=Lophatananon, A; Easton, D; Pocock, R; Dearnaley, DP; Guy, M; Edwards, S; O'Brien, L; Hall, A; Wilkinson, R; Eeles, R; Muir, KR; UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study, Collaborators; British Association of Urological Surgeons Section of, Oncology|title=Sexual activity and prostate cancer risk in men diagnosed at a younger age.|journal=BJU international|date=Jan 2009|volume=103|issue=2|pages=178–85|pmid=19016689|doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.08030.x[/tpl]
The age and underlying health of the man, the extent of metastasis, appearance under the microscope and response of the cancer to initial treatment are important in determining the outcome of the disease. The decision whether or not to treat localized prostate cancer (a tumor that is contained within the prostate) with curative intent is a patient trade-off between the expected beneficial and harmful effects in terms of patient survival and quality of life.

Lorenzo Mascheroni (May 13, 1750 – July 14, 1800) was an Italian mathematician.
He was born near Bergamo, Lombardy. At first mainly interested in the humanities (poetry and Greek language), he eventually became professor of mathematics at Pavia.
In his Geometria del Compasso (Pavia, 1797), he proved that any geometrical construction which can be done with compass and straightedge, can also be done with compasses alone. However, the priority for this result (now known as the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem) belongs to the Dane Georg Mohr, who had previously published a proof in 1672.  
This problem was the source of a musical composition called "Mascheroni Circles", performed by David Stutz on the album Iolet.
In his Adnotationes ad calculum integrale Euleri (1790) he published a calculation of what is now known as the Euler–Mascheroni constant, usually denoted as γ (gamma).
He died in Paris.

CATEGORIES: Mythological weapons, Lightning

A thunderbolt or lightning bolt is a symbolic representation of lightning when accompanied by a loud thunderclap. In ancient Hellenic and Roman religious traditions, the thunderbolt represents Zeus or Jupiter (etymologically "Right Father"), thence the origin and ordaining pattern of the universe, as expressed in Heraclitus' fragment describing "the Thunderbolt that steers the course of all things".DK B64. It is the same in other Indo-European traditions, for example the Vedic Vajra.
In its original usage the word may also have been a description of the consequences of a close approach between two planetary cosmic bodies, as Plato suggested in Timaeus,[tpl]cite book|last=Plato|title=Timaeus|year=2008|publisher=1st World Publishing|isbn=9781421893945|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=uzn3RLipf4wC&pg=PA15|accessdate=August 3, 2012|page=15, paragraph 22C-D in original[/tpl] or, according to Victor Clube, meteors,[tpl]cite book|last=Clube|first=Victor|title=The cosmic serpent: a catastrophist view of earth history|year=1982|publisher=Universe Books|isbn=9780876633793|coauthors=Napier, Bill|page=173ff[/tpl] though this is not currently the case. As a divine manifestation the thunderbolt has been a powerful symbol throughout history, and has appeared in many mythologies. Drawing from this powerful association, the thunderbolt is often found in military symbolism and semiotic representations of electricity.

Dos Pilas is a Pre-Columbian site of the Maya civilization located in what is now the department of Petén, Guatemala. It dates to the Late Classic Period, being founded by an offshoot of the dynasty of the great city of Tikal in AD 629 in order to control trade routes in the Petexbatún region, particularly the Pasión River.Salisbury, Koumenalis & Barbara Moffett 2002. In AD 648 Dos Pilas broke away from Tikal and became a vassal state of Calakmul, although the first two kings of Dos Pilas continued to use the same emblem glyph that Tikal did.Webster 2002, p. 263. It was a predator state from the beginning, conquering Itzan, Arroyo de Piedra and Tamarindito. Dos Pilas and a nearby city, Aguateca, eventually became the twin capitals of a single ruling dynasty. The kingdom as a whole has been named as the Petexbatun Kingdom, after Lake Petexbatún, a body of water draining into the Pasión River.
Dos Pilas gives an important glimpse into the great rivalries and political strife that characterised the Late Classic. Much of the history of Dos Pilas can now be reconstructed, with a level of detail which is almost unparalleled in the Maya area.Martin & Grube 2000, p. 55.
On June 12, 1970, the site was declared a National Monument according to Article 1210 of the Guatemalan Ministry of Education.

Schiedam ([tpl]IPA-nl|sχiˈdɑm||Nl-Schiedam.ogg[/tpl]) is a city and municipality in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands. It is part of the Rotterdam metropolitan area. The city is located west of Rotterdam, east of Vlaardingen, and south of Delft. In the south it is connected with the village of Pernis by the Beneluxtunnel.
The city is known for its historical center with canals, and for having the tallest windmills in the world. Schiedam is also famous for the distilleries and malthouses and production of jenever (gin) − such as the internationally-renowned Ketel One − so much so that in French and English the word schiedam (usually without a capital s-) refers to the town's Holland gin. This was the town's main industry during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th century, a dark period to which it owed its former nickname "Zwart Nazareth" or "Black Nazareth". Furthermore, the city is known for Saint Lidwina, one of the most famous Dutch saints (her relics are located in the Liduina Basilica in Schiedam).

The [tpl]Audio|Deutsche Mark.ogg|Deutsche Mark[/tpl] ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə ˈmaʁk[/tpl], German mark, abbreviated "DM") was the official currency of West Germany (1948–1990) and unified Germany (1990–2002) until the adoption of the euro in 2002. It is commonly called the "Deutschmark" in English but not in German. Germans often say [tpl]Audio|Mark.ogg|"Mark"[/tpl] or [tpl]Audio|D-Mark.ogg|"D-Mark"[/tpl]. It was first issued under Allied occupation in 1948 replacing the Reichsmark, and served as the Federal Republic of Germany's official currency from its founding the following year until 1999, when the mark was replaced by the euro; its coins and banknotes remained in circulation, defined in terms of euros, until the introduction of euro notes and coins in early 2002. The Deutsche Mark ceased to be legal tender immediately upon the introduction of the euro—in contrast to the other Eurozone nations, where the euro and legacy currency circulated side by side for up to two months. Mark coins and banknotes continued to be accepted as valid forms of payment in Germany until 28 February 2002.
The Deutsche Bundesbank has guaranteed that all German marks in cash form may be changed into euros indefinitely, and one may do so at any branch of the Bundesbank in Germany.

Andy Müller-Maguhn (born 3 October 1971) is a member of the German hacker association Chaos Computer Club. Having been a member since 1986, he was appointed as a spokesman for the club in 1990, and later served on its board until 2012.
In an election in autumn 2000, he was voted in as an at-large director of ICANN, which made him jointly responsible with 18 other directors for the worldwide development of guidelines and the decision of structural questions for the Internet structure. His term lasted two years, and from June 2002 to June 2004, he operated as an honorary board member of the European Digital Rights Institution (EDRI), an umbrella organization for European NGOs which campaigns for human rights in the digital age.
In 1995, Müller-Maguhn founded the "Datenreisebüro" ('Data Travel Agency'), since 2002 based in a Berlin office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.datenreisen.de/arbyte.html|title=Datenreisen - Arbyte|date=2010-10-28[/tpl] Besides organising the Chaos Computer Club and hosting an electronic archive, the Datenreisebüro organises workshops which train system administrators in data protection and data security. Workshops are also held in order to create policies and structures which make data protection easier to achieve. Müller-Maguhn has also helped at several of Hackers on Planet Earth conferences.
In 2005 and 2006, Müller-Maguhn was involved on the side of the parents of the deceased hacker Boris Floricic, better known as Tron, in the case where they sought to prevent Wikipedia from disclosing his true name, although the name had appeared in many press accounts by that point in time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/suing-wikipedia-how-a-dead-hacker-shut-down-wikipedia-germany-a-396307.html|title=Suing Wikipedia: How a Dead Hacker Shut Down Wikipedia Germany|date=2006-01-20|work=Der Spiegel|accessdate=2012-11-28[/tpl]
In 2011, Müller-Maguhn was criticized for his role in the CCC board's controversial decision to expel former Wikileaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg, which was often attributed to Müller-Maguhn's close relation to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and an ongoing conflict between Assange and Domscheit-Berg.[tpl]cite news|last=Laaf|first=Meike|title=Domscheit-Berg zurück im Club|url=https://www.taz.de/CCC-macht-Entscheidung-rueckgaengig/!87146/|newspaper=die tageszeitung|date=2012-02-06|accessdate=2012-11-28|language=German[/tpl] At an extraordinary general meeting in February 2012, this decision was reverted, while Müller-Maguhn was not reelected to the board.[tpl]cite news|title=Stühlerücken beim CCC: Müller-Maguhn nicht mehr im Vorstand|url=http://www.computerwoche.de/management/it-macher/2504522/|newspaper=Computerwoche|date=2012-01-20|accessdate=2012-11-28|language=German[/tpl]

[[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]]

CATEGORIES: Neoplastic and hyperplastic prostate disorders

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called benign enlargement of the prostate (BEP), adenofibromyomatous hyperplasia and benign prostatic hypertrophy (technically incorrect usage), is a benign increase in size of the prostate.
BPH involves hyperplasia of prostatic stromal and epithelial cells, resulting in the formation of large, fairly discrete nodules in the periurethral region of the prostate. When sufficiently large, the nodules compress the urethral canal to cause partial, or sometimes virtually complete, urinary tract obstruction by the urethra, which interferes with the normal flow of urine. It leads to symptoms of urinary hesitancy, frequent urination, increased risk of urinary tract infections, urinary retention, or contribute to or cause insomnia. Although prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated in these patients because of increased organ volume and inflammation due to urinary tract infections, BPH does not lead to cancer or increase the risk of cancer.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22792684
BPH involves hyperplasia (an increase in the number of cells) rather than hypertrophy (a growth in the size of individual cells), but the two terms are often used interchangeably, even amongst urologists.[tpl]cite book |first=D. G. |last=Bostwick |chapter=The Pathology of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia |editor-first=Roger S. |editor-last=Kirby |editor2-first=John D. |editor2-last=McConnell |editor3-first=John M. |editor3-last=Fitzpatrick |editor4-first=Claus G. |editor4-last=Roehrborn |editor5-first=Peter |editor5-last=Boyle |title=Textbook of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia |publisher=Isis Medical Media |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-901865-55-4[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
Adenomatous prostatic growth is believed to begin at approximately age 30 years. An estimated 50% of men have histologic evidence of BPH by age 50 years and 75% by age 80 years; in 40–50% of these men, BPH becomes clinically significant.[tpl]cite web |first1=Jonathan |last1=Rubenstein |first2=Kevin T. |last2=McVary |date=6 February 2008 |title=Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy of the Prostate (TUMT) |publisher=eMedicine |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/449623-overview[/tpl]

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين - القيادة العامة) or PFLP-GC is a small Palestinian nationalist militant organization based in Syria. It was founded in 1968 by Ahmed Jibril after splitting from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). In the 1970s and 1980s it was involved in the Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon and launched a number of attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians; including the Avivim school bus massacre (1970), the bombing of Swissair Flight 330 (1970), the Kiryat Shmona massacre (1974) and the Night of the Gliders (1987). Since the late 1980s it has been largely inactive, but during the Syrian civil war it fought for the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.Syrian rebels take over Palestinian camp in Damascus
It is sometimes called the Popular ''Liberation Front'' of Palestine – General Command (PLFP-GC).

The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup  (also known by the abbreviation CWC) was a football club competition contested annually by the most recent winners of all European domestic cup competitions.  The cup is one of the many inter-European club competitions that have been organised by UEFA. The first competition was held in the 1960–61 season—but not recognised by the governing body of European football until two years later.uefadirect, Issue 100: August 2010, Page 15 "European Cup Winners' Cup makes its debut".   The final tournament was held in 1998–99, after which it was absorbed into the UEFA Cup.
Prior to its abolition, the Cup Winners' Cup was regarded as the second most prestigious European club competition out of the three major tournaments, behind the European Cup/UEFA Champions League and ahead of the UEFA Cup, although many commentators felt the Cup Winners' Cup was the easiest of the three competitions to win. However, no club successfully defended the Cup Winners' Cup throughout its history. In the 1985–86 season, English clubs were banned from Europe which prevented Everton from playing in the Champions Cup after winning a double of the English league title and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1985.1996/97: Ronaldo spot on for Barçahttp://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/31/newsid_2481000/2481723.stm
From 1972 onwards, the winner of the tournament would go on to play the winner of the European Cup (later the UEFA Champions League) in the UEFA Super Cup. Since the abolition of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup place previously reserved for the CWC winner has been taken by the winner of the UEFA Cup, now UEFA Europa League. The competition's official name was originally the European Cup Winners' Cup; it was renamed the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup before the 1994–95 season.

Dual-ported RAM (DPRAM) is a type of Random Access Memory that allows multiple reads or writes to occur at the same time, or nearly the same time, unlike single-ported RAM which only allows one access at a time. 
Video RAM or VRAM is a common form of dual-ported dynamic RAM mostly used for video memory, allowing the CPU to draw the image at the same time the video hardware is reading it out to the screen.
Apart from VRAM, most other types of dual-ported RAM are based on static RAM technology.
Most CPUs implement the processor registers as a small dual-ported or multi-ported RAM (see Register File).

[[List of national parks of Brazil]]
CATEGORIES: National parks of Brazil, Lists of national parks, Brazil geography-related lists

The system of national parks in Brazil started in 1937 with the creation of Itatiaia National Park. Another two national parks have been created in 1939, and after a period of 20 years, the program of park creation has been restarted. Since then the number of parks increased steadily to 33 by 1990 and 67 by 2010.Ariane Janér: The National Parks of Brazil, EcoBrasil - Brazilian Ecotourism AssociationDavid Braun: Brazil beefs up protection of Atlantic rain forest, in National Geographic, 14 June 2010
Size of the parks varies vastly between the 3,300 ha Tijuca National Park and the 3,800,000 ha Tumucumaque National Park. Of the 67 national parks, 19 protect an area that represents 5% of the original Amazon Rainforest, and another 22 protect 1% of the original Atlantic Forest. Seven parks protect the Caatinga ecoregion and twelve the Cerrado ecoregion. There are only six coastal and marine parks, including one that protects the Pantanal wetland. No park protects the Pampas.
Visitors can only visit parks with a management plan and a public use plan. By 2010 only 30 parks were accessible to the public. Of these, the two most visited were the Tijuca National Park with 1.7 million visitors and the Iguaçu National Park with 1 million visitors, together accounting for 71% of all visitors to national parks in Brazil in 2009.

[[Berlin wool work]]

CATEGORIES: Embroidery

Berlin wool work is a style of embroidery similar to today's needlepoint. It was typically executed with wool yarn on canvas.Beeton, Isabella, (1870) Beeton's Book of Needlework Ward, Lock & Tyler ISBN 1-85152-023-6 p.559. Beeton also considers the use of silk thread and/or beads as Berlin Work. It is usually worked in a single stitch, such as cross stitch or tent stitch although Beeton's book of Needlework (1870) describes 15 different stitches for use in Berlin work. It was traditionally stitched in many colours and hues, producing intricate three-dimensional looks by careful shading. The design of such embroidery was made possible by the great progresses made in dyeing in the 1830s, especially by the discovery of aniline dyes which produced bright colors.
This kind of work created very durable and long-lived pieces of embroidery that could be used as furniture covers, cushions, bags, or even on clothing.

[[Bass trumpet]]

CATEGORIES: Brass instruments, C instruments, B-flat instruments

The bass trumpet is a type of low trumpet which was first developed during the 1820s in Germany. It is usually pitched in 8' C or 9' B[tpl]music|b[/tpl] today, but is sometimes built in E[tpl]music|b[/tpl] and is treated as a transposing instrument sounding either an octave, a sixth or a ninth lower than written, depending on the pitch of the instrument. Having valves and the same tubing length, the bass trumpet is quite similar to the valve trombone, although the bass trumpet has a harder, more metallic tone. Certain modern manufacturers offering 'valve trombones' and 'bass trumpets' use the same tubing, valves, and bell, in different configurations - in these cases the bass trumpet is virtually identical to the valve trombone.

[[Apsis]]
CATEGORIES: Orbits, Earth

An apsis (Greek ἁψίς, gen. ἁψίδος), plural apsides ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|s|ɨ|d|iː|z[/tpl]; Greek: ἁψίδες), is a point of greatest or least distance of a body in an elliptic orbit about a larger body.  For a body orbiting the Sun the greatest and least distance points are called respectively aphelion and perihelion ([tpl]IPAc-en|æ|p|'|h|i:|l|i|ə|n[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|p|Er|i-|ˈ|h|i:|l|i|ə|n[/tpl]), whereas for any satellite of Earth including the Moon the corresponding points are apogee and perigee ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|Er|i-|dZ|i:[/tpl]).  The generic suffix, independent of the particular central body, can be either apsis or centre, hence apoapsis, apocentre or apapsis ([tpl]ety||ἀπ(ό) (ap(ó))|from[/tpl]), and periapsis or pericentre ([tpl]ety||περί (peri)|around[/tpl]). During the Apollo program, the terms pericynthion and apocynthion (referencing Cynthia, an alternative name for the Greek Moon goddess Artemis) were used when referring to the Moon.[tpl]cite web | title = Apollo 15 Mission Report | work= Glossary | url= http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15mr-f.htm | accessdate = October 16, 2009 [/tpl]
A straight line connecting the periapsis and apoapsis is the line of apsides. This is the major axis of the ellipse, its greatest diameter.  For a two-body system the center of mass of the system lies on this line at one of the two foci of the ellipse. When one body is sufficiently larger than the other it may be taken to be at this focus.  However whether or not this is the case, both bodies are in similar elliptical orbits each having one focus at the system's center of mass, with their respective lines of apsides being of length inversely proportional to their masses.  Historically, in geocentric systems, apsides were measured from the center of the Earth.  However in the case of the Moon, the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system or Earth-Moon barycenter, as the common focus of both the Moon's and Earth's orbits about each other, is about 75% of the way from Earth's center to its surface.
In orbital mechanics, the apsis technically refers to the distance measured between the centers of mass of the central and orbiting body. However, in the case of spacecraft, the family of terms are commonly used to describe the orbital altitude of the spacecraft from the surface of the central body (assuming a constant, standard reference radius).

[[Bradford carpet]]

CATEGORIES: British rugs and carpets, Embroidery

The Bradford Carpet is a canvas work embroidery made in the early 17th century (ca. 1600–1615) that originally belonged to the Earl of Bradford at Castle Bromwich.Digby 1964, p. 102, plates 46 and 47
The carpet measures [tpl]convert|16|x|6|ft[/tpl]. In the Victoria and Albert Museum it covers an entire wall. However, it was made neither for wall nor floor, but as a table covering.  Its [tpl]convert|17|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide[/tpl] border was designed to hang down over the edges of a table, and it would have been removed or covered with a linen cloth when the table was used.V&A Museum, Life in Tudor and Stuart times
The carpet is worked with silk embroidery thread in tent stitch on a linen ground.Levey & King 1993, p. 23 The stitching is very fine (400 stitches/inch, 62 stitches/cm) and was worked in at least 23 different colours.  The tension of the tent stitches over time has distorted the shape of the carpet.  It is characteristic of professional canvas work popular for furnishings in the Elizabethan era.  The field design is a grape vine trellis.  The border, thought to represent human progression from a wild state to civilisation,Levey & King 1993, p. 16 depicts a variety of country pursuits set against a pastoral landscape, described as "perhaps the finest range of genre scenes to come down to us from Elizabethan times". A manor house, shepherd, travelling vendor with his packhorse, lords and ladies, hunting scenes, milkmaids, millers, water mills and windmills are all shown.

[[List of IBM products]]
CATEGORIES: IBM products, Computing-related lists, Products by company

The following is a list of products, some notable, some less so, from the International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation and its predecessor corporations, beginning in the 1890s, and spanning punched card equipment, time clocks, and typewriters, via mainframe computers and minicomputers, to microprocessors, software, and more.
This list is eclectic; it includes, for example, the AN/FSQ-7, which was not a product in the sense of offered for sale, but was a product in the sense of manufactured - produced by the labor of IBM.  Several machines manufactured for the Astronomical Computing Bureau at Columbia University are included, as are some machines built only as demonstrations of IBM technology.  Missing are RPQs, OEM products (semiconductors, for example), supplies (punched cards, for example). That products are missing is not by fiat, but simply because no one has added them.
IBM sometimes uses the same number for a system and for the principal component of that system. For example, the IBM 604 Calculating Unit is a component of the IBM 604 Calculating Punch.
IBM also uses two different naming structures for its modern hardware products.  Products are normally given a 3 or 4 digit machine type and a model number (can be a mix of letters and numbers).  A product may also have a marketing or brand name.  For instance, 2107 is the machine type for the IBM System Storage DS8000.  While the majority of products are listed here by machine type, there are instances where only a marketing or brand name is used.  Care should be taken when searching for a particular product as sometimes the type and model numbers overlap.  For instance the IBM storage product known as the Enterprise Storage Server is machine type 2105, and the IBM printing product known as the IBM Infoprint 2105 is machine type 2705, so searching for an IBM 2105 could result in two different products - or the wrong product - being found.
IBM introduced the 80-column rectangular hole punched card in 1928.  Pre-1928 machine models that continued in production with the new 80-column card format had the same model number as before.  Machines manufactured prior to 1928 were, in some cases, retrofitted with 80-column card readers and/or punches thus there exist machines with pre-1928 dates of manufacture that contain 1928 technology.
This list is organized by classifications of both machines and applications, rather than by product name.  Thus some (few) entries will be duplicated.  The 1420, for example, is listed both as a member of the 1401 family and as a machine for Bank and finance.
IBM product names have varied over the years; for example these two texts both reference the same product.
This article uses the name, or combination of names, most descriptive of the product. Product numbers include leading zeros; 080 not 80 for example.  Thus the entry for the above is

Textile arts are those arts and crafts that use plant, animal, or synthetic fibers to construct practical or decorative objects.
Textiles have been a fundamental part of human life since the beginning of civilization,Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance: World Textiles, p. 10-11Barber, Elizabeth Wayland: Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years, p. 42-70 and the methods and materials used to make them have expanded enormously, while the functions of textiles have remained the same.  The history of textile arts is also the history of international trade.  Tyrian purple dye was an important trade good in the ancient Mediterranean.  The Silk Road brought Chinese silk to India, Africa, and Europe.  Tastes for imported luxury fabrics led to sumptuary laws during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.  The Industrial Revolution was a revolution of textiles technology: the cotton gin, the spinning jenny, and the power loom mechanized production and led to the Luddite rebellion.

Seebeck was born in Reval (today Tallinn, Estonia) to a wealthy Baltic German merchant family. He received a medical degree in 1802 from the University of Göttingen, but preferred to study physics. In 1821 he discovered the thermoelectric effect, where a junction of dissimilar metals produces an electric current when exposed to a temperature gradient. This is now called the Peltier–Seebeck effect and is the basis of thermocouples and thermopiles.

Joseph Chamberlain (8 July 1836 – 2 July 1914) was a British politician and statesman. Unlike most major politicians of the time, he was a self-made businessman who had not attended university.
Born in London, Chamberlain made his career in Birmingham, first as a manufacturer of screws and then as a notable Mayor of the city. During his early adulthood he was a radical Liberal Party member and a campaigner for educational reform. He entered the House of Commons aged almost forty, relatively late in life for a front-rank politician. Rising to power through his influence with the Liberal grassroots organisation, he served as President of the Board of Trade in Gladstone's Second Government (1880–85). At the time, Chamberlain was notable for his attacks on the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury, and in the 1885 general election he proposed the "Unauthorised Programme" of benefits for newly enfranchised agricultural labourers. Chamberlain resigned from Gladstone's Third Government in 1886 in opposition to Irish Home Rule, and after the Liberal Party split he became a Liberal Unionist, a party which included a bloc of MPs based in and around Birmingham.
From the 1895 general election the Liberal Unionists were in coalition with the Conservative Party, under Chamberlain's former opponent Lord Salisbury. Chamberlain accepted the post of Secretary of State for the Colonies, declining other positions. In this job, he presided over the Second Boer War and was the dominant figure in the Unionist Government's re-election at the "Khaki Election" in 1900. In 1903, he resigned from the Cabinet to campaign for tariff reform. He obtained the support of most Unionist MPs for this stance, but the split contributed to the landslide Unionist defeat at the 1906 general election. Some months later, shortly after turning seventy, he was disabled by a stroke.
Despite never becoming Prime Minister, he is regarded as one of the most important British politicians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as a renowned orator and an interesting character who split both main parties. Winston Churchill later wrote of him that he was the man "who made the weather". Chamberlain was the father, by different marriages, of Sir Austen Chamberlain and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.

[[Splashdown]]

CATEGORIES: Spaceflight concepts, Lists of coordinates, Types of landing

Splashdown is the method of landing a spacecraft by parachute in a body of water. It was used by American manned spacecraft prior to the Space Shuttle program, and is planned for use by the upcoming Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle. It is also possible for the Russian Soyuz spacecraft and Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft to land in water, though this is only a contingency.  The only example of an unintentional manned splashdown in Soviet history is the Soyuz 23 landing.
As the name suggests, the capsule parachutes into an ocean or other large body of water.  The properties of water cushion the spacecraft enough that there is no need for a braking rocket to slow the final descent as was the case with Russian and Chinese manned space capsules, which returned to Earth over land.  The American practice came in part because American launch sites are on the coastline and launch primarily over water.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] Russian and Chinese launch sites are far inland and most early launch aborts were likely to descend on land.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

[[Shankill Butchers]]

CATEGORIES: Anti-Catholicism in Northern Ireland, Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom, Shankill Butchers, The Troubles in County Antrim

The Shankill Butchers was an Ulster loyalist gang—many of whom were members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF)—that was active between 1975 and 1982 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was based in the Shankill area and was responsible for the deaths of at least 23 people, most of whom were killed in sectarian attacks. The gang was notorious for kidnapping and murdering random civilians from the Catholic community; each was beaten ferociously and had their throat hacked with a butcher's knife. Some were also tortured and attacked with a hatchet. The gang also killed six Protestants over personal disputes, and two other Protestants mistaken for Catholics.
Most of the gang were eventually caught and, in February 1979, received the longest combined prison sentences in United Kingdom legal history. However, gang leader Lenny Murphy and his two chief "lieutenants" escaped prosecution. Murphy was killed in November 1982 by the Provisional IRA, likely acting with loyalist paramilitaries who perceived him as a threat.Dillon, pp 312-16
The Butchers brought a new level of paramilitary violence to a country already hardened by death and destruction.Dillon, Shankill Butchers (foreword) The judge who oversaw the 1979 trial described their crimes as "a lasting monument to blind sectarian bigotry".

The silent majority is an unspecified large majority of people in a country or group who do not express their opinions publicly."Silent majority" Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary (1995), accessed 22/2/2011. The term was popularized (though not first used) by U.S. President Richard Nixon in a November 3, 1969, speech in which he said, "And so tonight—to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans—I ask for your support."http://www.watergate.info/nixon/silent-majority-speech-1969.shtml Nixon's "Silent Majority" speech In this usage it referred to those Americans who did not join in the large demonstrations against the Vietnam War at the time, who did not join in the counterculture, and who did not participate in public discourse. Nixon along with many others saw this group of Middle Americans as being overshadowed in the media by the more vocal minority.
The phrase was used in the 19th century as a euphemism referring to all the people who have died, and others have used it before and after Nixon to refer to groups of voters in various nations of the world.

[[Chromosome 15q trisomy]]
CATEGORIES: Genetic disorders with no OMIM

Chromosome 15q trisomy is an extremely rare genetic disorder, caused by a chromosomal aberration in which there is an excess copy of the long ("q") arm of human chromosome 15. The disorder is also known as Distal Duplication 15q and Partial Duplication 15q Syndrome.  
The disorder is primarily characterized by growth abnormalities, which range from growth retardation to accelerated growth, intellectual disability, and distinctive malformations of the head and face. Additional abnormalities may involve malformation of the skeleton, spine and neck; fingers and/or toes; genitals (particularly in males); and, in some cases, heart problems. When accelerated growth is present, it is thought to result from the duplication of the IGF1 receptor gene.

The ''Challenger'' expedition of 1872–76 was a scientific exercise that made many discoveries to lay the foundation of oceanography. The expedition was named after the mother vessel, HMS Challenger.
Prompted by Charles Wyville Thomson—of the University of Edinburgh and Merchiston Castle School—the Royal Society of London obtained the use of Challenger from the Royal Navy and in 1872 modified the ship for scientific work, equipping her with separate laboratories for natural history and chemistry. The expedition, led by Captain George Nares, sailed from Portsmouth, England, on 21 December 1872.[tpl]cite book|last=Rice|first=A.L.|title=Understanding the Oceans: Marine Science in the Wake of HMS Challenger|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|pages=27–48|chapter=The Challenger Expedition|isbn=978-1-85728-705-9|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F5agn3NSzEoC&pg=PA27[/tpl] Other naval officers included Commander John Maclear.The Voyage of H.M.S.

Separate Tables is the collective name of two one-act plays by Terence Rattigan, both taking place in the Beauregard Private Hotel, Bournemouth, a seaside town on the south coast of England. The first play, entitled Table by the Window, focuses on the troubled relationship between a disgraced Labour politician and his ex-wife.  The second play, Table Number Seven, is set about eighteen months after the events of the previous play, and deals with the touching friendship between a repressed spinster and a kindly but bogus man posing as an upper-class retired army officer, Major Pollock. The two principal roles in both plays are written to be played by the same performers.

[tpl]Very long|date=July 2013[/tpl][tpl]split-apart|date=December 2013[/tpl]

The Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes. Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings. Golden Eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey (mainly hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels).[tpl]cite book|author=Watson, Jeff |title=The Golden Eagle|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aj5MNvCkun0C|year=2010|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-1420-9[/tpl]
Golden Eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as [tpl]convert|200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. They build large nests in high places (mainly cliffs) to which they may return for several breeding years. Most breeding activities take place in the spring; they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life. Females lay up to four eggs, and then incubate them for six weeks. Typically, one or two young survive to fledge in about three months. These juvenile Golden Eagles usually attain full independence in the fall, after which they wander widely until establishing a territory for themselves in four to five years.
Once widespread across the Holarctic, it has disappeared from many areas which are now more heavily populated by humans. Despite being extirpated from or uncommon in some its former range, the species is still fairly ubiquitous, being present in sizeable stretches of Eurasia, North America, and parts of North Africa. It is the largest and least populous of the five species of true accipitrid to occur as a breeding species in both the Palearctic and the Nearctic.Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World by Leslie Brown & Dean Amadon. The Wellfleet Press (1986), ISBN 978-1555214722.
For centuries, this species has been one of the most highly regarded birds used in falconry, with the Eurasian subspecies having been used to hunt and kill prey such as Gray Wolves (Canis lupus) in some native communities. Due to its hunting prowess, the Golden Eagle is regarded with great mystic reverence in some ancient, tribal cultures.
The Golden Eagle is one of the most extensively studied species of raptor in the world in some parts of its range, such as the Western United States and the Western Palearctic.

The story of Geirröd is told in Þórsdrápa.  Loki, while flying as a hawk, was captured by Geirröd. Because he hated Thor, Geirröd demanded that Loki bring his enemy to Geirröd's castle without his magic belt and hammer.  Loki agreed to lead Thor to the trap. On the way to Geirröd's castle, Loki and Thor stopped at the home of Grid, a giantess. She waited until Loki left the room, then told Thor what was happening and gave him her iron gloves and magical belt and staff. Thor killed Geirröd, followed by all other frost giants he could find, including Geirrod's daughters, Gjalp and Greip.

Interstate 75 (I-75) is a major north–south Interstate Highway in the Great Lakes and Southeastern regions of the United States. It travels from State Road 826 (Palmetto Expressway) and State Road 924 (Gratigny Parkway) on the Hialeah–Miami Lakes border (northwest of Miami, Florida) to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, at the Ontario border. Interstate 75 is the seventh longest interstate highway after Interstate 95 and passes through six different states: Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan.
Due to traffic levels on the Interstate, much of the route is six lanes even in rural areas. The longest continuous segment of six-lane (or more) roadway in the U.S. is along I-75 from the Florida's Turnpike junction in Wildwood, Florida to I-24 in the Chattanooga area, using I-475 to bypass Macon, Georgia, though this long stretch has an exception to its 3 lanes or more continuity around the I-75/I-475 split where it is 2 lanes on each side for only a few miles.

[[Gerðr]]

CATEGORIES: Ásynjur, Jötnar

In Norse mythology, Gerðr (Old Norse "fenced-in"Orchard (1997:54).) is a jötunn, goddess, and the wife of the god Freyr. Gerðr is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in the poetry of skalds. Gerðr is sometimes modernly anglicized as Gerd or Gerth.
In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Freyr sees Gerðr from a distance, becomes deeply lovesick at the sight of her shimmering beauty, and has his servant Skírnir go to Jötunheimr (where Gerðr and her father Gymir reside) to gain her love. In the Poetic Edda Gerðr initially refuses, yet after a series of threats by Skírnir she finally agrees. In the Prose Edda, no mention of threats is made. In both sources, Gerðr agrees to meet Freyr at a fixed time at the location of Barri and, after Skírnir returns with Gerðr's response, Freyr laments that the meeting could not occur sooner. In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Gerðr is described as the daughter of Gymir and the mountain jötunn Aurboða.
In Heimskringla, Gerðr is recorded as the wife of Freyr, euhemerized as having been a beloved  king of Sweden. In the same source, the couple are the founders of the Yngling dynasty and produced a son, Fjölnir, who rose to kinghood after Freyr's passing and continued their line. Gerðr is commonly theorized to be a goddess associated with the earth. Gerðr has inspired works of art and literature.

[[Glen]]

CATEGORIES: Valleys, Glens of Scotland, Slope landforms

A glen is a valley, typically one that is long, deep, and often glacially U-shaped, or one with a watercourse running through it. WhittowWhittow, John (1984). Dictionary of Physical Geography. London: Penguin, 1984. ISBN 0-14-051094-X. defines it as a "Scottish term for a deep valley in the Highlands" that is "narrower than a strath."
The word is Goidelic: gleann in Scottish and Irish Gaelic, glion in Manx. In Manx, glan is also to be found meaning glen. It is cognate with Welsh glyn. The word is sometimes found in tautological placenames where its meaning was opaque to a new linguistic community, an example perhaps being Glendale (literally "valley valley") which is a combination of Norse "dale" and Gaelic "glen".
As the name of a river, it is thought to derive from the Irish word glan meaning clean, or the Welsh word gleindid meaning purity. An example is the Glens of Antrim in Northern Ireland where nine glens radiate out from the Antrim plateau to the sea along the coast between Ballycastle and Larne.
In the Finger Lakes Region of New York State, the southern ends of Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake in particular are etched with glens, although in this region the term "glen" refers most frequently to a narrow gorge, as opposed to a wider valley or strath. The steep hills surrounding these lakes are filled with loose shale from glacial moraines. This material has eroded over the past 10,000 years to produce beautiful rocky glens (e.g., Watkins Glen and Treman State Parks) and waterfalls (e.g., Taughannock Falls) as rainfall has descended toward the lakes below.
The designation "glen" also occurs often in place names such as Great Glen in Scotland, Glenrothes in Fife, Scotland, Glendalough in Republic of Ireland (Éire), Glengowrie in Australia, Glenn Norman in Canada, Klamath Glen in California, Glen Waverley in Australia and Glendowie in Auckland, New Zealand.

[[Sköll]]

CATEGORIES: Wolves in Norse mythology

In Norse mythology, Sköll (Old Norse "Treachery")Orchard (1997:150). is a wolf that chases the horses Árvakr and Alsviðr, that drag the chariot which contains the sun (Sól) through the sky every day, trying to eat her. Sköll has a brother, Hati, who chases Máni, the moon. At Ragnarök, both Sköll and Hati will succeed in their quests.
Sköll, in certain circumstances, is used as a heiti to refer indirectly to the father (Fenrir) and not the son. This ambiguity works in the other direction also, for example in Vafþrúðnismál, where confusion exists in stanza 46 where Fenrir is given the sun-chasing attributes of his son Sköll. This can mostly be accounted for by the use of Hróðvitnir and Hróðvitnisson to refer to both Fenrir and his sons.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

[[Hati Hróðvitnisson]]

CATEGORIES: Wolves in Norse mythology

In Norse mythology, Hati Hróðvitnisson (first name meaning "He Who Hates, Enemy"Byock, Jesse. (Trans.) The Prose Edda, page 164. (2006) Penguin Classics ISBN 0-14-044755-5) is a wolf that according to Gylfaginning chases the Moon across the night sky, just as the wolf Sköll chases the Sun during the day, until the time of Ragnarök when they will swallow these heavenly bodies, after which Fenrir will break free from his bonds and kill Odin. Hatí is possibly alluded to in Völuspá as "moon-snatcher".
Hati's surname is Hróðvitnisson, attested in both Grímnismál and Gylfaginning, which indicates that he is the son of Fenrir, whose alternate name is Hróðvitnir ("Famous Wolf"). Hati's mother is the giantess, not named but mentioned in Völuspá and Gylfaginning, who dwells to the east of Midgard in the forest of Járnviðr ("Ironwood"). Snorri Sturluson states that this giantess and witch bears many giants for sons, all in the form of wolves including one named Mánagarm ("Moon Hound") who shall swallow the Moon and is thus identified with Hati. From this passage it is also presumed that Sköll is Hati's brother. Hati is the god of solar eclipses as well.

Aqua Teen Hunger Force (also known by various alternative titles) is an American animated television series on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim. The pilot episode originally aired at 5:00 AM on Cartoon Network unannounced on December 30, 2000 as a special sneak peek; the series later made its official debut on September 9, 2001 on Adult Swim. The show is about the surreal adventures and antics of three anthropomorphic fast food items: Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad, who live together as roommates and frequently interact with their human nextdoor neighbor Carl Brutananadilewski.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force is one of the spin-offs of the show Space Ghost Coast to Coast, and as of 2014, the longest running original series on Adult Swim, as well as one of the top 10 longest-running American animated television series of all time.Aqua Teen Hunger Force premiered in December 2000 and is still in production as of 2014; in number of years on the air, ATHF is number 7 on the top 10 list, behind The Simpsons, Arthur, South Park, King of the Hill, SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats'." Each episode is written and directed by series creators Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro, who also provide several voices.  Starting in 2011, each season has been given a different alternative title, accompanied by a different opening sequence, as a running gag by the creators. Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters,'' a film adaptation of the series, was released in theaters on April 13, 2007, marking the first time an Adult Swim series was adapted into a movie.
There have been a total of [tpl]Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode count[/tpl] episodes during the show's run.  An episode titled "Boston" was scheduled to air during the fifth season, but was pulled to avoid further controversy surrounding the 2007 Boston bomb scare, and has never aired or been released to the public in any format.
Since its release, the series has developed a cult following, and its popularity has resulted in three different spin-offs: Spacecataz, Carl's Stone Cold Lock of the Century of the Week, and Soul Quest Overdrive. Maiellaro has stated that there are no plans to end the series at any time in the foreseeable future. The series also airs in syndication outside the United States and has been released on various DVD sets and other forms of home media, including on demand streaming of the first and second season on Netflix.

Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a 1986 American coming-of-age comedy film written, produced and directed by John Hughes.
The film follows high school senior Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), who decides to skip school and spend the day in downtown Chicago. Accompanied by his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), he creatively avoids his school's Dean of Students Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), his resentful sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), and his parents. During the film, Bueller frequently breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera to explain to the audience his thoughts and techniques.
Hughes wrote the screenplay in less than a week and shot the film—on a budget of $5.8 million—over several months in late 1985. Featuring many famous Chicago landmarks including the then Sears Tower and the Art Institute of Chicago, the film was Hughes' love letter to the city: "I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could. Not just in the architecture and landscape, but the spirit."
Released by Paramount Pictures on June 11, 1986, Ferris Bueller's Day Off became one of the top-grossing films of the year and was enthusiastically received by critics and audiences alike.

[[Tell (poker)]]

CATEGORIES: Poker gameplay and terminology

A tell in poker is a change in a player's behavior or demeanor that is claimed by some to give clues to that player's assessment of their hand. A player gains an advantage if they observe and understand the meaning of another player's tell, particularly if the tell is unconscious and reliable. Sometimes a player may fake a tell, hoping to induce their opponents to make poor judgments in response to the false tell. More often, people try to avoid giving out a tell, by maintaining a poker face regardless of how strong or weak their hand is.

Gullveig/Heiðr is solely attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material. Scholars have variously proposed that Gullveig/Heiðr is the same figure as the goddess Freyja, that Gullveig's death may have been connected to corruption by way of gold among the Æsir, and/or that Gullveig's treatment by the Æsir may have led to the Æsir-Vanir War.

In Europe, the Eastern Imperial Eagle is threatened with extinction. It has nearly vanished from many areas of its former range, e.g. Hungary and Austria. Today, the only European populations are increasing in the Carpathian basin, mainly the northern mountains of Hungary and the southern region of Slovakia. The breeding population in Hungary consists of about 105 pairs.Horváth M et al. 2010. Spatial variation in prey composition and its possible effect on reproductive success in an expanding eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) population. Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, 56, 187–200. The most western breeding population on the border between Austria and Czech republic consists of 15 - 20 pairs.
There are many Eastern Imperial Eagle nests in the Bulgaria/Turkey section of the European Green Belt (the uncultivated belt along the former Iron Curtain.)
The monarchy of Austria-Hungary once chose the Imperial Eagle to be its heraldic animal, but this did not help this bird. The eagle's preferred habitat is open country with small woods; unlike many other species of eagle, it does not generally live in mountains, large forests or treeless steppes.
Eastern Imperial Eagles generally prefer to construct a nest in a tree which is not surrounded by other trees, so that the nest is visible from a considerable distance, and so that the occupants may observe the surroundings unobstructed. Tree branches are taken in order to build the nest, which is upholstered with grass and feathers. Very rarely it nests on cliffs or the ground.
In March or April the female lays two to three eggs. The chicks hatch after about 43 days and leave the nest after 60–77 days. Often, however, only one will survive to leave the nest, with the others dying before becoming fully fledged. In at least a part of its range, more than a third of all nesting attempts are entirely unsuccessful.
The Eastern Imperial Eagle feeds mainly on European Hares, European Hamsters and Common Pheasants as well as a variety of other birds and mammals.

[[Athame]]

CATEGORIES: Ceremonial knives, Wicca, Ritual weapons, Wiccan terminology

An Athame or Athamé ([tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|θ|ɒ|m[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|θ|əm|eɪ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|θ|eɪ|m|iː[/tpl]) is a ceremonial dagger, with a double-edged blade and usually a black handle. It is the main ritual implement or magical tool among several used in the religion of Wicca, and is also used in various other neopagan witchcraft traditions. A black-handled knife called an arthame appears in certain versions of the Key of Solomon, a grimoire originating in the Middle Ages.MacGregor Mathers, S. Liddell (ed.) The Key of Solomon (Clavicula Salomonis) Revised by Peterson, Joseph H. (1999, 2004, 2005).
The athame is mentioned in the writings of Gerald Gardner in the 1950s, who claimed to have been initiated into a surviving tradition of Witchcraft, the New Forest Coven. The athame was their most important ritual tool, with many uses, but was not to be used for actual physical cutting.Gardner, Gerald. Witchcraft Today (1954) London: Rider. p.150
There has been speculation[tpl]cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots[/tpl] that Gardner's interest and expertise in antique swords and knives, and in particular the kris knives of Malaysia and Indonesia, may have contributed to the tool's central importance in modern Wicca.Gardner, Gerald. Keris and other Malay weapons (1936) Singapore: Progressive Publishing Company  
On the other hand, the athame stands as one of the four elemental tools in Wicca; traditionally standing for fire, as does the ritual sword. (From the known origins of Wicca, with Gardner's own Book of Shadows, the athame represents fire; where the wand corresponds to air. Other varieties of Wiccan practice may switch those two around.) The other three elemental tools are the wand, the pentacle, and the cup or chalice. These four magical tools correspond to four 'weapons' of significance in Celtic myth - the sword, the spear, the shield, and the cauldron (and/or grail). The same four ritual tools also appear in the magical practices of the western hermetic tradition, derived from The Golden Dawn; and they appear in tarot decks as the four card suits: swords, cups, wands, and pentacles. The athame is an individual ritual tool, while the sword is more appropriate as a coven tool, or the personal tool of the high priest or high priestess. There are obvious risks associated with an entire group of people all wielding swords, while confined within a small ritual circle space nine feet in diameter; this safety factor, as well as ease of use, may explain why the emphasis within Wicca is more on each witch's personal athame, rather than the ritual sword.

[[Book of Shadows]]

CATEGORIES: Texts used in Wicca

A Book of Shadows is a book containing religious texts and instructions for magical rituals found within the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Originating within the Gardnerian tradition of the Craft, the first Book of Shadows was created by the pioneering Wiccan Gerald Gardner sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, and which he utilised first in his Bricket Wood coven and then in other covens which he founded in following decades. The concept of the Book of Shadows was then adopted by other Wiccan traditions, such as Alexandrianism and Mohsianism, and with the rise of books teaching people how to begin following Wicca in the 1970s onward, the idea of the Book of Shadows was then further propagated amongst solitary practitioners unconnected to earlier traditions.
Initially, when Wicca was still dominated by covens, "only one copy the Book existed for an entire coven, kept by the high priestess or high priest. That rule has proved unfeasible, and it is now commonplace for all Witches to have their own copies."Guiley 2008. p. 35. In the various traditions that make up British Traditional Wicca,  copies of the original Book composed by Gerald Gardner with the aid of his High Priestess Doreen Valiente, along with alterations and additions that have been made since then, is followed by adherents. They have tried to keep the contents of this Book a secret, although it has been published on a number of occasions by figures such as Charles Cardell, Lady Sheba and Janet and Stewart Farrar. In other Wiccan traditions and amongst a number of solitary practitioners, alternate versions of the Book have been written that are independent of Gardner's original.
Numerous associations and traditions have since grown up around the Book of Shadows. Traditionally, "a Witch's book of shadows is destroyed upon death."Guiley 2008. p. 36. The concept of the Book of Shadows has subsequently appeared in popular culture, for instance being utilised in the American television series Charmed and providing the title of films, musical albums and comics. However, in all these cases it was taken out of its original Wiccan context[tpl]fact|date=November 2013[/tpl].

CATEGORIES: Counties of the United States, Country subdivisions of the Americas, Second-level administrative country subdivisions, Subdivisions of the United States

In the United States, a county is a political and geographic subdivision of a state, usually assigned some governmental authority.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/Overview.aspx|title=An Overview of County Government|work=National Association of Counties|accessdate=April 25, 2013[/tpl] The term "county" is used in 48 of the 50 U.S. states. The exceptions are Louisiana and Alaska, where the functionally equivalent subdivisions are called, respectively, parishes and boroughs. Numerous consolidated city–counties exist throughout the U.S. in which a city has merged with its county to form one unified jurisdiction with the governmental powers of both entities.
The U.S. federal government uses the term "county equivalent" to describe administrative or statistical areas that are comparable to counties. Louisiana parishes; the organized boroughs of Alaska; the District of Columbia; and the independent cities of the states of Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, and Nevada are equivalent to counties for administrative purposes. Alaska's Unorganized Borough is divided into 11 census areas which are statistically equivalent to counties. As of 2013, the United States has 3,007 counties and 137 county equivalents for a total of 3,144 counties and county equivalents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2012/CO-EST2012-alldata.html|title=County Totals Datasets: Population, Population Change and Estimated Components of Population Change: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|work=2012 Population Estimates|publisher=United States Census Bureau, Population Division|date=March 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2013[/tpl]
The number of counties per state ranges from the 3 counties of Delaware to the 254 counties of Texas.

An amusement arcade or video arcade is a venue where people play arcade games such as video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games, merchandisers (such as claw cranes), or coin-operated billiards or air hockey tables. In some countries, some types of  arcades are also legally permitted to provide gambling machines such as slot machines or pachinko machines. Games are usually housed in cabinets. The term used for ancestors of these venues in the beginning of 20th century was penny arcades.[tpl]cite book|pages=154|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P0eySLn7b6EC&pg=PA154 |title=Going out: the rise and fall of public amusements |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-05-30 |quote=First use of the term ... between 1905 and 1910[/tpl]
Video games were introduced in amusement arcades in the late 1970s and were most popular during the golden age of arcade video games, the early 1980s. Arcades became popular with young adults and particularly adolescents, which led parents to be concerned that video game playing might cause children to skip school. Many video arcades began closing in the late 1990s, as the technology of home video game consoles began to rival that of arcade games. However, video arcades remain popular in Japan, where they are called game centers (ゲームセンター).

[[List of counties in Maryland]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of U.S. counties by state, Maryland counties, U.S. county name etymologies, Maryland geography-related lists

There are twenty-four counties and county-equivalents in the U.S. state of Maryland. Though an independent city rather than a county, the City of Baltimore is considered the equal of a county for most purposes and is a county-equivalent. Many of the counties in Maryland were named for relatives of the Barons Baltimore who were the proprietors of the Maryland colony from its founding in 1634 through 1771. The Barons Baltimore were Catholic, and George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, originally intended that the colony be a haven for English Catholics, though for most of its history Maryland has had a majority of Protestants.Brugger, Robert J. (1988). Maryland: A Middle Temperament, 1634–1980. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. ISBN 0-8018-3399-X
The last new county formation in Maryland occurred when Garrett County was formed in 1872 from portions of Allegany County.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/county.html|title=Counties|work=Maryland Manual Online|accessdate=2007-06-24[/tpl] However, there have been numerous border changes since that time, most recently when portions of the city of Takoma Park that had previously been part of Prince George's County were absorbed into Montgomery County in 1997.
Outside of Baltimore (which is an independent city) the county is the default unit of local government. Under Maryland law, counties exercise powers reserved in most other states at the municipal or state levels, so there is little incentive for a community to incorporate. Many of the state's most populous and economically important communities, such as Bethesda, Silver Spring, Columbia, and Towson are unincorporated and receive their municipal services from the county. In fact, there are no incorporated municipalities at all in Baltimore County or Howard County. The county-equivalent is also the provider of public schools - school districts as a separate level of government do not exist in Maryland.
The City of Baltimore generally possesses the same powers and responsibilities as the counties within the state. It is an entity nearly surrounded by but separate from the County of Baltimore, which has its county seat in Towson.
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip6-4.htm|title= FIPS Publish 6-4|publisher= National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate= 2007-04-11[/tpl] Maryland's code is 24, which when combined with any county code would be written as 24XXX.

[[Pressed flower craft]]

CATEGORIES: Flowers, Floristry, Design, Textile arts, Handicrafts, Illustration, Herbaria

Pressed flower craft consists of drying flower petals and leaves in a flower press to flatten and exclude light and moisture. Pressing flowers makes them appear flat, and often there is a change in color, ranging from faded colors to a greater intensity of vibrant colors.
The pressed flowers and leaves can then be used for a variety of craft projects. They are often mounted on special paper, such as handmade paper, Ingres paper, Japanese paper, or paper decorated by marbling. With meticulous attention to detail each leaf and flower is glued onto a precise location.  With a creative approach to the use of materials, a leaf becomes a tree and petals form mountains.
Washes of watercolor painting are sometimes applied to the backing paper before the pressed material is attached to it. It is also popular to mount pressed material on fabrics, such as velvet, silk, linen or cotton.
Petals and leaves can also be applied to wood furnishings using the technique of Decoupage.
The craft gained popularity in the Victorian era and has experienced a revival in the last 30 years or so.

[[Boarding school]]

CATEGORIES: Boarding schools, Education in popular culture, School types, Total institutions

A boarding school is a school where some or all people study and live during the school year with their fellow students and possibly teachers or administrators. The word 'boarding' is used in the sense of "bed and board," i.e., lodging and meals. Some boarding schools also have day students who attend the institution by day and return off-campus to their families in the evenings.
Many independent (private) schools in the Commonwealth of Nations are boarding schools.  Boarding school pupils (a.k.a. "boarders") normally return home during the school holidays and, often, weekends, but in some cultures may spend the majority of their childhood and adolescent life away from their families.  In the United States, boarding schools comprise various grades, most commonly grades seven or nine through grade twelve - the high school years. Specialized military schools also feature military education and training. Some American boarding schools offer a post-graduate year of study in order to help students prepare for college entrance, most commonly to assimilate foreign students to American culture and academics before college.
In the former Soviet Union similar schools were introduced; these sometimes are known as Internat-schools (Russian: Школа-интернат) (from Latin: internus). They varied in their organization. Some schools were a type of specialized school with a specific focus in a particular field or fields such as mathematics, physics, language, science, sports, etc. Other schools were associated with orphanages after which all children enrolled in Internat-school automatically. Also, separate boarding schools were established for children with special needs (schools for blind, for deaf and other). General schools offered "extended stay" programs (Russian: Группа продленного дня) featuring cheap meals for children and preventing them from coming home too early before parents were back from work (education in the Soviet Union was free). In post-soviet countries, concept of boarding school differs from country to country.

The naval Battle of Valcour Island, also known as the Battle of Valcour Bay, took place on October 11, 1776, on Lake Champlain.  The main action took place in Valcour Bay, a narrow strait between the New York mainland and Valcour Island.  The battle is generally regarded as one of the first naval battles of the American Revolutionary War, and one of the first fought by the United States Navy.  Most of the ships in the American fleet under the command of Benedict Arnold were captured or destroyed by a British force under the overall direction of General Guy Carleton.  However, the American defense of Lake Champlain stalled British plans to reach the upper Hudson River valley.
The Continental Army had retreated from Quebec to Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point in June 1776 after British forces were massively reinforced.  They spent the summer of 1776 fortifying those forts, and building additional ships to augment the small American fleet already on the lake.  General Carleton had a 9,000 man army at Fort Saint-Jean, but needed to build a fleet to carry it on the lake.  The Americans, during their retreat, had either taken or destroyed most of the ships on the lake.  By early October, the British fleet, which significantly outgunned the American fleet, was ready for launch.
On October 11, Arnold drew the British fleet to a position he had carefully chosen to limit their advantages.  In the battle that followed, many of the American ships were damaged or destroyed.  That night, Arnold sneaked the American fleet past the British one, beginning a retreat toward Crown Point and Ticonderoga.  Unfavorable weather hampered the American retreat, and more of the fleet was either captured or grounded and burned before it could reach Crown Point.  Upon reaching Crown Point Arnold had the fort's buildings burned and retreated to Ticonderoga.
The British fleet included four officers who later became admirals in the Royal Navy: Thomas Pringle, James Dacres, Edward Pellew and John Schank.  Valcour Bay, the site of the battle, is now a National Historic Landmark, as is [tpl]USS|Philadelphia|1776|6[/tpl], which sank shortly after the October 11 battle, and was raised in 1935.

See info-box below.)  Its two huge spires give it the largest façade of any church in the world. The choir has the largest height to width ratio, 3.6:1, of any medieval church.Banister Fletcher, A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method
Cologne's medieval builders had planned a grand structure to house the reliquary of the Three Kings and fit its role as a place of worship for the Holy Roman Emperor. Despite having been left incomplete during the medieval period, Cologne Cathedral eventually became unified as "a masterpiece of exceptional intrinsic value" and "a powerful testimony to the strength and persistence of Christian belief in medieval and modern Europe".

[[AppleScript]]

CATEGORIES: Mac OS development, OS X development, Proprietary software, Scripting languages

AppleScript is a scripting language created by Apple Inc. and built into Macintosh operating systems since System 7. The term "AppleScript" may refer to the scripting system itself, or to an individual script written in the AppleScript language.
AppleScript is primarily a scripting language developed by Apple to do Inter-Application Communication (IAC) using AppleEvents.  AppleScript is related to, but different from, AppleEvents. AppleEvents is designed to exchange data between and control other applications in order to automate repetitive tasks.  AppleScript has some limited processing abilities of its own, in addition to sending and receiving AppleEvents to applications.  AppleScript can do basic calculation, and can do intricate text processing – and it is extensible, allowing the addition of scripting additions which add new functions to the language itself.  Mainly, however, AppleScript relies on the functionality of applications and processes to handle complex tasks.  As a structured command language, AppleScript can be compared to, say, one of the UNIX shells; the Microsoft Windows Script Host; or IBM REXX in its functionality, but it is unique from all three. Essential to its functionality is the fact that Macintosh applications publish "dictionaries" of addressable objects and operations.
AppleScript has some elements of object-oriented programming, particularly in the construction of script objects, and natural language programming tendencies in its syntax, but does not strictly conform to either category.

The Château de Montsoreau is a castle in the market town of Montsoreau, in the Maine-et-Loire département of France. It was constructed in 1455 by Jean de Chambes, a senior councillor to King Charles VII. Erected on the bank of the Loire river, it was a strategic fortress, controlling river traffic between Chinon and Saumur. In fact the castle of Montsoreau has an exceptional position at the confluence of two rivers, the Loire and the Vienne, and at the meeting point of three historic regions: Anjou, Poitou and Touraine. Unlike other castles by the Loire, Montsoreau was directly built in the river.

In Norse mythology, Vígríðr or Óskópnir is a large field foretold to host a battle between the forces of the gods and the forces of Surtr as part of the events of Ragnarök. The field is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and in the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. The Poetic Edda briefly mentions the field as where the two forces will battle, whereas the Prose Edda features a fuller account, foretelling that it is the location of the future death of several deities (and their enemies) before the world is engulfed in flames and reborn. A huge expanse of land, Vigrid was said to stretch 120 leagues in every direction. Even so, it was predicted that the assembled hosts covered it completely.

Chilaquiles ([tpl]IPA-es|tʃilaˈkiles[/tpl]) from the Nahuatl word chīlāquilitl [tpl]IPA-es|t͡ʃiːlaːˈkilit͡ɬ|[/tpl] is a traditional Mexican dish. Typically, corn tortillas cut in quarters and lightly fried are the basis of the dish.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Kennedy | first1 = Diana | authorlink1 = Diana Kennedy | title = The Cuisines of Mexico | chapter = Tortillas and Tortilla Dishes | publisher = Harper & Row | year = 1972 | pages = 67 | isbn =978-0-06-012344-4[/tpl] Green or red salsa or mole is poured over the crisp tortilla triangles, called totopos. The mixture is simmered until the tortilla starts softening. Eggs (scrambled or fried) and pulled chicken are sometimes added to the mix. The dish is topped with cheese (typically queso fresco) and/or sweet Mexican cream (crema), and it is served with refried beans. As with many Mexican dishes, regional and familial variation is quite common.
In central Mexico it is common for the tortilla chips to remain crisp. To achieve this, all ingredients except the salsa are placed on a plate and the salsa is poured at the last moment, seconds before serving. It is commonly garnished with cream, shredded queso fresco, raw onion rings and avocado slices.
Usually, chilaquiles are eaten at breakfast or brunch. This makes them a popular recipe to use leftover tortillas and salsas.
Chilaquiles are frequently confused with the Tex-Mex migas, as each is a dish that uses tortilla chips/strips served primarily in the morning. In Guadalajara, cazuelas are kept simmering filled with chilaquiles that become thick in texture similar to polenta.

During the events of Ragnarök, Naglfar is foretold to sail to Vígríðr, ferrying hordes that will there battle with the gods. Naglfar is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. The boat itself has been connected by scholars with a larger pattern of ritual hair and nail disposal among Indo-Europeans, stemming from Proto-Indo-European custom, and it may be depicted on the Tullstorp Runestone in Scania, Sweden.

In Norse mythology, Iðunn is a goddess associated with apples and youth. Iðunn is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, she is described as the wife of the skaldic god Bragi, and in the Prose Edda, also as a keeper of apples and granter of eternal youthfulness.
The Prose Edda relates that Loki was once forced by the jötunn Þjazi to lure Iðunn out of Asgard and into a wood, promising her interesting apples. Þjazi, in the form of an eagle, snatches Iðunn from the wood and takes her to his home. Iðunn's absence causes the gods to grow old and gray, and they realize that Loki is responsible for her disappearance. Loki promises to return her and, in the form of a falcon, finds her alone at Þjazi's home.  He turns her into a nut and takes her back to Asgard. After Þjazi finds that Iðunn is gone, he turns into an eagle and furiously chases after Loki. The gods build a pyre in Asgard and, after a sudden stop by Loki, Þjazi's feathers catch fire, he falls, and the gods kill him.
A number of theories surround Iðunn, including potential links to fertility, and her potential origin in Proto-Indo-European religion. Long the subject of artworks, Iðunn is sometimes referenced in modern popular culture.

A phosphor, most generally, is a substance that exhibits the phenomenon of luminescence. Somewhat confusingly, this includes both phosphorescent materials, which show a slow decay in brightness (> 1 ms), and fluorescent materials, where the emission decay takes place over tens of nanoseconds. Phosphorescent materials are known for their use in radar screens and glow-in-the-dark toys, whereas fluorescent materials are common in cathode ray tube (CRT) and plasma video display screens, sensors, and white LEDs.
Phosphors are often transition metal compounds or rare earth compounds of various types. The most common uses of phosphors are in CRT displays and fluorescent lights. CRT phosphors were standardized beginning around World War II and designated by the letter "P" followed by a number.
Phosphorus, the chemical element named for its light-emitting behavior, emits light due to chemiluminescence, not phosphorescence;[tpl]cite book|author =Emsley, John|year = 2000|title = The Shocking History of Phosphorus |location= London|publisher =Macmillan|isbn=0-330-39005-8[/tpl] hence it is not a phosphor.

The Monarchs of Portugal ruled from the establishment of the Kingdom of Portugal, in 1139, to the deposition of the Portuguese monarchy and creation of the Portuguese Republic with the 5 October 1910 revolution.
Through the nearly 800 years which Portugal was a monarchy, the kings held various other titles and pretensions. Two Kings of Portugal, Ferdinand I and Afonso V, also claimed the crown of Castile. When the House of Habsburg came into power, the Kings of Spain, and Naples, also became Kings of Portugal. The House of Braganza brought numerous titles to the Portuguese Crown, including King of Brazil and then Emperor of Brazil.
After the demise of the Portuguese monarchy, in 1910, Portugal almost restored its monarchy in a revolution known as the Monarchy of the North, though the attempted restoration only lasted a month before destruction. With Manuel II's death, the Miguelist branch of the House of Braganza became the pretenders to the throne of Portugal. They have all been acclaimed King of Portugal by their monarchist groups. This is purely symbolic and no one can have a place among the Kings of Portugal unless they were acclaimed by the Portuguese state and parliament. The Portuguese government states that the current representative of the House of Braganza, Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, is the legitimate successor to the Kings of Portugal, but only recognizes him as Duke of Braganza and not King.
The monarchs of Portugal all came from a single ancestor, Afonso I Henriques, but direct lines have sometimes ended. This has led to a variety of royal houses coming to rule Portugal, though all having Portuguese royal lineage. These houses are:

There are fourteen counties in the U.S. state of Vermont. These counties together contain 255 political units, or places, including 237 towns, 9 cities, 5 unincorporated areas, and 4 gores. Each county has a county seat, known in Vermont as shire town. In 1779, Vermont had two counties. The western side of the state was called Bennington County and the eastern was called Cumberland County.[tpl]cite web |url=http://genealogytrails.com/ver/county_info.html |title=Vermont County Information  |accessdate=2007-07-22 |work=Genealogy Trails[/tpl] In 1781, Cumberland County was separated into three counties in Vermont plus another county named Washington (not the same as the modern Washington County) that eventually became part of New Hampshire. Today's Washington County was known as Jefferson County from its creation in 1810 until it was renamed in 1814. Essex County, Orleans County, and Caledonia County are commonly referred to as the Northeast Kingdom.
The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States.  The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code.  This means that, for example, while Addison County, Vermont is 001, Belknap County, New Hampshire and Alachua County, Florida are also 001.  To uniquely identify Addison County, Vermont, one must use the state code of 50 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Addison County, Vermont is 50001.

The Château de Langeais is a medieval castle, rebuilt as a château, in Indre-et-Loire, France, built on a promontory created by the small valley of the Roumer River at the opening to the Loire Valley. Founded in 992 by Fulk Nerra, Count of Anjou, the castle was soon attacked by Odo I, Count of Blois. After the unsuccessful attack, the now-ruined stone keep was built; it is one of the earliest datable stone examples of a keep. Between 994 and 996 the castle was besieged unsuccessfully twice more. During the conflict between the counts of Anjou and Blois, the castle changed hands several times, and in 1038 Fulk captured the castle again.
After it was destroyed during the Hundred Years' War, King Louis XI (1461–1483) rebuilt Château de Langeais into what today is one of the best known examples of late medieval architecture. It is especially noted for its monumental and highly decorated chimneypieces. Restored in the late 19th century, Château de Langeais came under the control of the Institut de France, who own the site today. It is listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture and is open to the public.

The Spanish Revolution was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante. Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party influence, as the Soviet Union-controlled party actively tried to crush attempts at worker empowerment. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes. Even places like hotels, barber shops, and restaurants were collectivized and managed by their workers.

The collectivization effort was primarily orchestrated by the rank-and-file members of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT; English: National Confederation of Labor) and the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI; English: Iberian Anarchist Federation), with the two often abbreviated as CNT-FAI due to the affinity between the two organizations and the major role of the latter within the former in maintaining anarchist "purity." The non-anarchist socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT; English: General Union of Workers) also participated in the implementation of collectivization, albeit to a far lesser degree.

Shada is an unaired serial of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who.  It was intended to be the final serial of the 1979–80 season (Season 17), but was never completed due to strike action at the BBC during filming. In 1992, its recorded footage was released on video using linking narration by Tom Baker, who played the Doctor in the serial, to complete the story.
The script, with adaptations, was later produced by Big Finish Productions as an audio play, with animation and was made available on BBCi and the BBC website in 2003.  This version saw Paul McGann take on the role of the Doctor, with Lalla Ward reprising her role as Romana, with an otherwise different cast.
A novelisation of the story written by Gareth Roberts, returning the action to the Fourth Doctor and Romana, was released in March 2012.

[[English Revolution]]

CATEGORIES: English Civil War, Glorious Revolution

In Marxism, the "English Revolution" is the period of the English Civil Wars and Commonwealth period (1640–1660), in which Parliament challenged King Charles I's authority, engaged in civil conflict against his forces, and executed him in 1649.  This was followed by a ten-year period of bourgeois republican government, the "Commonwealth", before monarchy was restored in the shape of Charles' son, Charles II in 1660.

[[City of Death]]

CATEGORIES: Fourth Doctor serials, Paris in fiction, 1979 television episodes, Screenplays by Douglas Adams, Ancient astronauts in fiction, Doctor Who stories set on Earth, Leonardo da Vinci in television

City of Death is the second serial of the seventeenth season of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which depicts the adventures of a time-travelling humanoid alien known as the Doctor. It was produced by the BBC and first broadcast in four weekly parts between 29 September 1979 and 20 October 1979 on BBC1. The serial was written by "David Agnew" – a pseudonym for David Fisher, Douglas Adams, and Graham Williams – and directed by Michael Hayes.
City of Death features the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and his companion Romana (Lalla Ward). Set mainly in Paris in 1979, the plot concerns a scheme by an alien, Scaroth, to steal the Mona Lisa to finance experiments in time travel in the hope of averting the accident that marooned him on Earth four hundred million years previously, which began the existence of life on the planet as well.
The serial's storyline was devised by Fisher but was heavily re-written by script editor Adams, aided by producer Williams. It was the first Doctor Who serial to film on location outside of the United Kingdom; the production team worked in Paris during April and May 1979. The studio work was completed in June. Partially due to the strike of BBC's rival ITV, City of Death scored high ratings; the fourth episode was watched by over sixteen million viewers, the highest UK television audience ever attained by an episode of Doctor Who. Though in retrospect it has been regarded as one of the best serials from Doctor Who[tpl]'s[/tpl] classic run, initial reception to it was not as positive, with criticism of its humorous tone.

The Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) was founded in 1984 and is located on the site of a former sardine cannery on Cannery Row of the Pacific Ocean shoreline in Monterey, California, United States. It has an annual attendance of 1.8 million visitors. It holds thousands of plants and animals, representing more than 600 species on display. The aquarium benefits from a high circulation of fresh ocean water which is obtained through pipes which pump it in continuously from Monterey Bay.
The centerpiece of the Ocean's Edge Wing, is a [tpl]convert|28|ft|sp=us[/tpl] high [tpl]Convert|333000|gal|sing=on[/tpl] tank for viewing California coastal marine life. In this tank, the aquarium was the first in the world to grow live California Giant Kelp. Visitors are able to inspect the creatures of the kelp forest at several levels in the building. The largest tank in the aquarium is a [tpl]Convert|1200000|gal|adj=on|sp=us[/tpl] tank in the Open Sea galleries (formerly the Outer Bay), which features one of the world's largest single-paned windows. It is one of the few aquariums to hold the ocean sunfish in captivity.
Sealife on exhibit includes stingrays, jellyfish, sea otters, and numerous other native marine species, which can be viewed above and below the waterline. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of very few in the world to exhibit both bluefin and yellowfin tuna. For displaying jellyfish, it uses a Kreisel tank, which creates a circular flow to support and suspend the jellies. The aquarium does not house mammals other than otters.

As the foremost pioneer of Republic of China, Sun is referred to as the "Father of the Nation" in the Republic of China (ROC), and the "forerunner of democratic revolution" in the People's Republic of China. Sun played an instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the years leading up to the Double Ten Revolution. He was appointed to serve as Provisional President of the Republic of China, when it was founded in 1912. He later co-founded the Kuomintang (KMT), serving as its first leader.Derek Benjamin Heater. 1987 (1987). Our world this century. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-913324-7, ISBN 978-0-19-913324-6. Sun was a uniting figure in post-Imperial China, and remains unique among 20th-century Chinese politicians for being widely revered amongst the people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Although Sun is considered one of the greatest leaders of modern China, his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile. After the success of the revolution, he quickly resigned, due to Beiyang Clique pressure, from his post as President of the newly founded Republic of China, and led successive revolutionary governments as a challenge to the warlords who controlled much of the nation. Sun did not live to see his party consolidate its power over the country during the Northern Expedition. His party, which formed a fragile alliance with the Communists, split into two factions after his death. Sun's chief legacy resides in his developing of the political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People: nationalism, democracy, and the people's livelihood.Schoppa, Keith R. 2000 (2000).

John Curtis Holmes (August 8, 1944 – March 13, 1988) better known as John C. Holmes or Johnny Wadd (after the lead character in a series of related films), was one of the most prolific male pornographic film actor of all time, appearing in about 2250 adult loops and pornographic feature movies in the 1970s and 1980s. 
He was best known for his exceptionally large penis, which was heavily promoted as being the longest, thickest, and hardest in the porn industry, although no documented measurement of Holmes' actual penis length has ever been confirmed. Near the end of his life, Holmes attracted notoriety for his involvement in the Wonderland murders in 1981, and eventually for his death from complications caused by AIDS.
Holmes was the subject of several books, a lengthy essay in Rolling Stone, two feature length documentaries, and was the inspiration for two Hollywood movies (Boogie Nights and Wonderland).

Jack Leonard "J. L." Warner (August 2, 1892 – September 9, 1978), born Jacob Warner in London, Ontario, was a Canadian-born American film executive who was the president and driving force behind the Warner Bros. Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Warner's career spanned some forty-five years, its duration surpassing that of any other of the seminal Hollywood studio moguls.Thomas (1990), p. 4.
As co-head of production at Warner Bros. Studios, he worked with his brother, Sam Warner, to procure the technology for the film industry's first talking picture.Thomas (1990), pp. 52–62. After Sam's death, Jack clashed with his surviving older brothers, Harry and Albert Warner. He assumed exclusive control of the film production company in the 1950s, when he secretly purchased his brothers' shares in the business after convincing them to participate in a joint sale of stocks.
Although Warner was feared by many of his employees and inspired ridicule with his uneven attempts at humor, he earned respect for his shrewd instincts and tough-mindedness. He recruited many of Warner Bros.'s top starsThomas (1990), pp. 45–49. and promoted the hard-edged social dramas for which the studio became known.Buhle and Wagner (2002), p. 59. Given to decisiveness, Warner once commented, "If I'm right fifty-one percent of the time, I'm ahead of the game."
Throughout his career, he was viewed as a contradictory and enigmatic figure.Thomas (1990), pp. 4–7. Although he was a staunch Republican, Warner encouraged film projects that promoted the agenda of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. He opposed European fascism and criticized Nazi Germany well before America's involvement in World War II.Buhle and Wagner (2002), p. 68.  An opponent of Communism, after the war Warner appeared as a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee, voluntarily naming screenwriters who had been fired as suspected Communists or sympathizers.Buhle and Wagner (2002), pp. 377–378. Despite his controversial public image, Warner remained a force in the motion picture industry until his retirement in the early 1970s.Thomas (1990), p. 3.

Jumpman is a platform game written by Randy Glover and released by Epyx in 1983. Originally developed for the Atari 400/800, versions were also released for the Commodore 64, Apple II, IBM PC, and ColecoVision.
The object of the game is to defuse all bombs in a platform-filled screen. Jumpman defuses a bomb by touching it. According to the story, these are placed on Jupiter by terrorists. Jumpman can climb up and down ladders, and of course jump, and there are two kinds of rope each allowing a single direction of climbing only. Hazards include falling "smart darts" (small bullets that fly slowly across the screen, but when orthogonally lined up with Jumpman, greatly speed up and shoot straight in his direction) and other hazards that are unique to a certain level.
Points are awarded for each bomb defused, with bonus points available for completing a level quickly. Jumpman's game run-speed can be chosen by the player, with faster speeds being riskier but providing greater opportunity to earn bonus points.
"Jumpman" was the original name used for Mario in the 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong, which featured several elements that appear in Jumpman.  Randy Glover has stated that Donkey Kong was the original inspiration for Jumpman.[tpl]cite web |url=http://home.arcor.de/cybergoth/gamesa/jumpinterview1.html |title=I talked to Randy Glover about Jumpman. |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080115074357/http://home.arcor.de/cybergoth/gamesa/jumpinterview1.html | archivedate=15 January 2008 |accessdate=3 June 2007[/tpl] It is not clear whether the naming commonality is anything other than a coincidence.

The Bush Doctrine is a phrase used to describe various related foreign policy principles of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. The phrase was first used by Charles Krauthammer in June 2001 to describe the Bush Administration's "unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty and rejecting the Kyoto protocol."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202457.html  |title=Charlie Gibson's Gaffe |first=Charles |last=Krauthammer |work=The Washington Post |date=September 13, 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-31[/tpl] According to Charles Krauthammer, who was the first to use it in June 2001, the phrase has had four distinct meanings, each one succeeding another over the eight years of the George W. Bush presidency:  firstly, unilateralism, i.e. unilaterally withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and rejecting the Kyoto Protocol; secondly, after 9-11-2001, the “with us or against us” policy on terror; thirdly, a doctrine of pre-emptive war, e.g. Iraq; and fourthly, the idea that the fundamental mission of American foreign policy is to spread democracy throughout the world. After 9/11 the phrase described the policy that the United States had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3DE123CF930A25757C0A9649C8B63 |title=Editorial Observer; President Bush and the Middle East Axis of Ambiguity |first=Steven R. |last=Weisman |work=The New York Times |date=April 13, 2002[/tpl]
Different pundits would attribute different meanings to "the Bush Doctrine", as it came to describe other elements, including the policy of preventive war, which held that the United States should depose foreign regimes that represented a potential threat to the security of the United States, even if that threat was not immediate; a policy of spreading democracy around the world, especially in the Middle East, as a strategy for combating terrorism; and a willingness to unilaterally pursue U.S. military interests.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1616724,00.html |title= Edwards Rejects the 'War on Terror' |first=Mike |last=Allen |journal=TIME|date=May 2, 2007[/tpl][ref]

The phrase "Bush Doctrine" was rarely used by members of the Bush administration. The expression was used at least once, though, by Vice President Dick Cheney, in a June 2003 speech in which he said, "If there is anyone in the world today who doubts the seriousness of the Bush Doctrine, I would urge that person to consider the fate of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq."Vice President Tells West Point Cadets "Bush Doctrine" Is Serious, American Forces Press Service, June 2, 2003

[[Foreign policy doctrine]]
CATEGORIES: Diplomacy, Foreign policy doctrines

A foreign policy doctrine is a general statement of foreign policy and belief system through a doctrine. In some cases, the statement is made by a political leader, typically a nation’s chief executive or chief diplomat, and comes to be named after that leader. Richard Nixon’s justification for the phased withdrawal of the United States from Vietnam, for example, came to be called the Nixon Doctrine. This pattern of naming is not universal, however; Chinese doctrines, for example, are often referred to by number.
The purpose of a foreign policy doctrine is to provide general rules for the conduct of foreign policy through decisions on international relations.  These rules allow the political leadership of a nation to deal with a situation and to explain the actions of a nation to other nations. “Doctrine” is usually not meant to have any negative connotations; it is especially not to be confused with “dogma.”

[[Hersir]]

CATEGORIES: Norse mythology, Viking warriors, Noble titles, Obsolete occupations

A Hersir was a local Viking military commander of a hundred (a county subdivision) of about 20 men and owed allegiance to a jarl or king. They were also aspiring landowners, and, like the middle class in many feudal societies, supported the kings in their centralization of power. Originally, the term Hersir referred to a wealthy farmer who owned land and had the status of a leader. Throughout the Viking Age, Hersir was eventually redefined as someone who organized and led raids. In the 10th century, the influence of Hersirs began to decrease due to the development of effective national monarchies in Scandinavia. Hersir was again redefined later on, to mean a local leader or representative. The independence of the Hersir as a military leader eventually vanished, to be replaced only by the title of a royal representative.  The "Hávamál", which was the mythical advice of the supreme creator Odin to mankind, contains a number of verses emphasizing the virtue of cautious consideration and strategical attack. This theme, in its oral form, was one of the major influences on the mind of the Viking Hersir.[tpl]cite book|last=Harrison|first=Mark|title=Viking Hersir|year=1993|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|url=http://brego-weard.com/lib2/003_Viking_Hersir_AD_793-1066(OCR)%5B1855323184%5D.pdf[/tpl]

Truman, Foreign policy doctrines of the United States, History of the foreign relations of the United States, Soviet Union–United States relations, 1947 in international relations, Soviet Union–Turkey relations, Turkey–United States relations, Greece–United States relations, 1947

The Truman Doctrine was an international relations policy set forth by the U.S. President Harry Truman in a speechlisten to speech on March 12, 1947, which stated that the U.S. would support Greece and Turkey with economic and military aid to prevent them from falling into the Soviet sphere."Special Message to the Congress on Greece and Turkey: The Truman Doctrine." Truman Library Public Papers, 12 March 1947. Web. May. 2012.  Historians often consider it as the start of the Cold War, and the start of the containment policy to stop Soviet expansion.Fraser J. Harbutt, The Cold War era (Wiley-Blackwell, 2002) pp 19–20 '''
Truman pledged the US to contain in Europe and elsewhere and impelled the US to support any nation with both military and economic aid if its stability was threatened by communism or the Soviet Union.  The Truman Doctrine became the foundation of the president's foreign policy and placed the U.S. in the role of global policeman. As Foner reminds us, the Truman Doctrine "set a precedent for American assistance to anticommunist regimes throughout the world, no matter how undemocratic, and for the creation of a set of global military alliances directed against the Soviet Union" (1st edition, p. 781; 2nd edition, p. 844).
President Harry S. Truman told Congress that "it must be the policy of the United States to support free people who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."[tpl]cite book|author=Michael Beschloss|title=Our Documents: 100 Milestone Documents From The National Archives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qqDA6OGvhmUC&pg=PA194|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=194–99|isbn=9780195309591[/tpl]  Truman reasoned, because these "totalitarian regimes" coerced "free peoples", they represented a threat to international peace and the national security of the United States.  Truman made the plea amid the crisis of the Greek Civil War (1946–1949). He argued that if Greece and Turkey did not receive the aid that they urgently needed, they would inevitably fall to communism with grave consequences throughout the region. Because Turkey and Greece were historic rivals, it was necessary to help both equally, even though the threat to Greece was more immediate.
For years Britain had supported Greece, but was now near bankruptcy and was forced to radically reduce its involvement. In February 1947, Britain formally requested the United States take over its role in supporting the Greek government.Alan Bullock, Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary pp 368–9; Arnold Offner, Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945–2002 (2002) p 197; Denise M. Bostdorff, Proclaiming the Truman Doctrine (2008) p 51
The policy won the support of Republicans who controlled Congress and involved sending $400 million in American money, but no military forces, to the region.  The effect was to end the Communist threat, and in 1952 both countries (Greece and Turkey) joined NATO, a military alliance that guaranteed their protection.George McGhee, The U.S.-Turkish-NATO Middle East Connection: How the Truman Doctrine and Turkey's NATO Entry Contained the Soviets in the Middle East, (1990)
The Doctrine was informally extended to become the basis of American Cold War policy throughout Europe and around the world. It shifted American foreign policy toward the Soviet Union from détente (a relaxation of tension) to a policy of containment of Soviet expansion as advocated by diplomat George Kennan.

[[Eisenhower Doctrine]]

CATEGORIES: Soviet Union–United States relations, Middle East, 1957 in the United States, 1957 in international relations, Foreign policy doctrines of the United States

The term Eisenhower Doctrine refers to a speech by President Dwight David Eisenhower on 5 January 1957, within a "Special Message to the Congress on the Situation in the Middle East".  Under the Eisenhower Doctrine, a Middle Eastern country could request American economic assistance or aid from U.S. military forces if it was being threatened by armed aggression from another state.Buescher, John. "The U.S. and Egypt in the 1950s", Teachinghistory.org, accessed August 20, 2011. Eisenhower singled out the Soviet threat in his doctrine by authorizing the commitment of U.S. forces "to secure and protect the territorial integrity and political independence of such nations, requesting such aid against overt armed aggression from any nation controlled by international communism.""The Eisenhower Doctrine, 1957"; see http://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/eisenhower-doctrine
In the global political context, the Doctrine was made in response to the possibility of a generalized war, threatened as a result of the Soviet Union's attempt to use the Suez War as a pretext to enter Egypt.  Coupled with the power vacuum left by the decline of British and French power in the region after the U.S. protested against the conduct of their allies during the Suez War, Eisenhower felt that a strong position needed to better the situation was further complicated by the positions taken by Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was rapidly building a power base and using it to play the Soviets and Americans against each other, taking a position of "positive neutrality" and accepting aid from the Soviets.
On the regional level, the intent was that the Doctrine would help to provide the independent Arab regimes with an alternative to Nasser's political control, strengthening them while isolating Communist influence through isolation of Nasser.  The doctrine largely failed on that front, with Nasser's power quickly rising by 1959 to the point where he could shape the leadership outcomes in neighboring Arab countries, including Iraq and Saudi Arabia; in the meantime, Nasser's relationship with the Soviet leaders deteriorated, allowing the U.S. to switch to a policy of accommodation. 
The Eisenhower Administration also saw the Middle East as being influential for future foreign policy not only regarding the United States, but also its allies. The region contains a large percentage of the world's oil supply, and it was perceived that if it were to fall to communism, the United States and its allies would suffer immense economic consequences. Eisenhower's protests against longtime allies — the United Kingdom and France — during the Suez Canal Crisis meant that the U.S. was the lone Western power in the Middle East and placed U.S. oil security in jeopardy as the USSR filled the power vacuum. The Eisenhower Doctrine was a backflip against the previous policy, however — the U.S. now had the burden of military action in the Middle East to itself.
The military action provisions of the Doctrine were applied in the Lebanon Crisis the following year, when the United States intervened in response to a request by that country's president.

The Savoy Theatre is a West End theatre located in the Strand in the City of Westminster, London, England. The theatre opened on 10 October 1881 and was built by Richard D'Oyly Carte on the site of the old Savoy Palace as a showcase for the popular series of comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, which became known as the Savoy Operas as a result.
The theatre was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity."The Savoy Theatre", The Times, 3 October 1881 In 1889, Richard D'Oyly Carte built the Savoy Hotel next to the theatre. For many years, the Savoy was the home of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, and it was run by the Carte family for over a century. Richard's son Rupert D'Oyly Carte rebuilt and modernised the theatre in 1929, and it was rebuilt again in 1993 following a fire. It is a Grade II* listed building.[tpl]IoE|427797|Grade II*[/tpl]
In addition to The Mikado and other famous Gilbert and Sullivan premières, the theatre has hosted such notable premières as the first public performance in England of Oscar Wilde's Salome (1931) and Noël Coward's Blithe Spirit (1941). In recent years it has presented opera, Shakespeare and other non-musical plays, and musicals, including revivals, new shows including Never Forget, and the original London production of Legally Blonde.

The Nixon Doctrine (also known as the Guam Doctrine)  was put forth during a "Silent Majority" speech in a press conference in Guam on July 25, 1969 by U.S. President Richard Nixon. According to Gregg Brazinsky,Gregg Brazinsky, author of "Nation Building in South Korea: Koreans, Americans, and the Making of a Democracy" Nixon stated that "the United States would assist in the defense and developments of allies and friends," but would not "undertake all the defense of the free nations of the world." This doctrine meant that each ally nation was in charge of its own security in general, but the United States would act as a nuclear umbrella when requested. The Doctrine argued for the pursuit of peace through a partnership with American allies. The Nixon Doctrine implied the intentions of Richard Nixon shifting the direction on international policies in Asia, especially aiming for "Vietnamization of the Vietnam War."

The iBook is a line of laptop computers sold by Apple Computer from 1999 to 2006. The line targeted entry level, consumer and education markets, with lower specifications and prices than the PowerBook, Apple's higher-end line of laptop computers.
Three distinct designs of the iBook were introduced during its lifetime. The first, known as the "Clamshell", was influenced by the design of Apple's popular iMac line at the time. It was a significant departure from previous portable computer designs due to its shape, bright colors, incorporation of a handle into the casing, lack of a hinged cover over the external ports, and built-in wireless networking. Two years later, the second generation abandoned the original form factor in favor of a more conventional, rectangular design. In October 2003, a third iteration was released that added a PowerPC G4 chip and a slot-loading drive.
Apple replaced the iBook line with the MacBook in May 2006 during Apple’s transition to Intel processors. The MacBook has also evolved into different models, such as the MacBook Pro targeting high performance and the MacBook Air targeting the entry level, consumer ultrabook-market.
They were also a major name for education, with Henrico County Public Schools being the first of many school systems in the USA to distribute one to every student.

[[Carter Doctrine]]

The Carter Doctrine was a policy proclaimed by President of the United States Jimmy Carter in his State of the Union Address on January 23, 1980, which stated that the United States would use military force if necessary to defend its national interests in the Persian Gulf.
It was a response to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, and was intended to deter the Soviet Union—the United States' Cold War adversary—from seeking hegemony in the Gulf.
The following key sentence, which was written by Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's National Security Adviser, concludes the section:
 Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.
 
Brzezinski modeled the wording on the Truman Doctrine,Brzezinski, Zbigniew. Power and Principle: Memoirs of the National Security Adviser, 1977-1981. New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1983. ISBN 0-374-23663-1. pg. 444. and insisted that the sentence be included in the speech "to make it very clear that the Soviets should stay away from the Persian Gulf".[tpl]Citation|url=http://www.artsandmedia.net/cgi-bin/dc/newsdesk/2003/03/18_centcom_1 |title=A Cold War Legacy of Persian Gulf Conflict |publisher=Artsandmedia.net |date=March 19, 2003 |accessdate=2008-10-16[/tpl]
In The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power, author Daniel Yergin notes that the Carter Doctrine "bore striking similarities" to a 1903 British declaration, in which British Foreign Secretary Lord Landsdowne warned Russia and Germany that the British would "regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal".[tpl]harv|Yergin|1991|pp=140, 702[/tpl]

The Reagan Doctrine was a strategy orchestrated and implemented by the United States under the Reagan Administration to oppose the global influence of the Soviet Union during the final years of the Cold War. While the doctrine lasted less than a decade, it was the centerpiece of United States foreign policy from the early 1980s until the end of the Cold War in 1991.
Under the Reagan Doctrine, the United States provided overt and covert aid to anti-communist guerrillas and resistance movements in an effort to "roll back" Soviet-backed communist governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The doctrine was designed to diminish Soviet influence in these regions as part of the administration's overall Cold War strategy.

Python reticulatus, also known as the (Asiatic) reticulated python,[tpl]ITIS |id=209567 |taxon=Python reticulatus |accessdate=12 September 2007[/tpl] is a species of python found in Southeast Asia. Adults can grow to [tpl]convert|6.95|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length[tpl]cite journal|author=Fredriksson, G. M. |title=Predation on Sun Bears by Reticulated Python in East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo|journal= Raffles Bulletin of Zoology |volume=53|issue=1|year= 2005|pages=165–168|url=http://dare.uva.nl/document/161117[/tpl] but normally grow to an average of 3–6 m (10–20 ft). They are the world's longest snakes and longest reptile, but are not the most heavily built. Like all pythons, they are nonvenomous constrictors and normally not considered dangerous to humans.  Although large specimens are powerful enough to kill an adult human, attacks are only occasionally reported.
An excellent swimmer, Python reticulatus has been reported far out at sea and has colonised many small islands within its range. The specific name, reticulatus,  is Latin meaning "net-like", or reticulated, and is a reference to the complex color pattern.Gotch AF. 1986. Reptiles – Their Latin Names Explained.

[[Rock opera]]
CATEGORIES: Musical theatre, Rock operas

A rock opera is a work of rock music that presents a storyline told over multiple parts, songs or sections in the manner of opera. A rock opera differs from a conventional rock album, which usually includes songs that are not unified by a common theme or narrative. More recent developments include metal opera and rap opera (sometimes also called hip-hopera).[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7390649.stm |date=2008-05-09 |accessdate=2009-11-02 | work=BBC News | title=R Kelly: Successes and scandals[/tpl] A rock opera tells a coherent story, and may involve songs performed as if sung by separate characters in a drama, as in classical opera.
A rock opera may or may not be presented in a staged performance. In recorded form it can be similar to a concept album (of which it is a subset), though the latter may simply set a mood or maintain a theme.
In Russian music, the term zong-opera (Зонг-опера) is sometimes used since the first Soviet-Russian rock-opera Orpheus and Eurydice was described with this term, for political reasons. While the term "rock-opera" was already known in the Soviet rock music circles, the term "rock" was blacklisted by the Soviet Ministry of Culture. Therefore the term "zong" was used - a Russian-language rendering of the German word "Song", borrowed from German  for philosophical Songs embedded in the dramaturgy of Bertold Brecht, officially popularized in the Soviet Union.

Dork Tower is an online comic created, written and drawn by John Kovalic. It chronicles the lives of a group of geeks living in the fictional town of Mud Bay, Wisconsin.  Mud Bay's design is strongly influenced by the author's home town of Madison, Wisconsin.  Topics have included role-playing games (RPGs), comic books, video games, and fandom in general.  The comic strip began in January 1997[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/comics/dorktower/page.asp?id=7| title=Dork Tower FAQs| last=Kovalic| first=John| accessdate=2007-10-16[/tpl] and has made appearances in publications like Dragon magazine, Shadis, and Comic Shop News.  Starting in 2000, the strip began web publication roughly three times a week and is featured in Pyramid. The bimonthly comic book made its first appearance in 1998 and features continuing storylines.  It has recently gone to full color with issue #32, and it is collected in trade paperback.
During its first year in Dragon, Dork Tower was called Shop Keep, making the comics focusing on Bill Blyden and Pegasaurus Games a separate series from the comics focusing on Matt and his group that were published elsewhere (although the Dork Tower cast, especially Igor, also appeared in Shop Keep as customers). This was later discontinued, and subsequent Pegasaurus-based strips were also titled Dork Tower. The name is a cacographic of both Stephen King's The Dark Tower and the Judges Guild Advanced Dungeons & Dragons module Dark Tower.

According to the Prose Edda, Odin took Loki's three children by Angrboða, the wolf Fenrir, Hel and Jörmungandr, and tossed Jörmungandr into the great ocean that encircles Midgard.Sturluson, Gylfaginning ch. xxxiv, 2008:37. The serpent grew so large that he was able to surround the earth and grasp his own tail. As a result, he received the name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. When he lets go, the world will end. Jörmungandr's arch-enemy is the god Thor. It is an example of an ouroboros.

In Norse mythology, Þrymr (Thrymr, Thrym; "uproar") was king of the jotnar.  In one legend, he stole Mjollnir, Thor's hammer, to extort the gods into giving him Freyja as his wife. His kingdom was called Jötunheimr, but according to Hversu Noregr byggdist, it was the Swedish province Värmland, then a part of Norway.
Þrymr was foiled in his scheme by the gracefulness of Heimdall, the cunning of Loki, and the sheer violence of Thor.  Thor, son of Odin, later killed Thrym, his sister, and all of his jotnar kin, which had been present at the wedding reception. The poem Þrymskviða gives the details of how Thor got his hammer back. Bergfinnr is a son of Thrymr, the Giant of Vermland.

(anglicized as  Thrymheim) was the abode of Þjazi, a jötunn, located in Jötunheimr. Þjazi once abducted the goddess Iðunn, and in Þrymheimr he held her, causing the gods to age until her rescue, in turn resulting in the death of Þjazi. After the death of Þjazi, his daughter—the goddess Skaði—inhabits the location. During Skaði's marriage to the god Njörðr, the two split over Skaði's preference for her home in Þrymheimr.
Manuscripts of the Prose Edda contain the spellings Þrumheimr and Þruþheimr. Rudolf Simek translates Þruþheimr as "power house" and notes that the variant is also a fitting name for a jötunn.Simek (2007:330).

The Jötnar are a mythological race that live in Jötunheimr, one of the nine worlds of Norse cosmology. They were banished there by the Æsir who refuse them entry to their world, Asgard. The Jötnar frequently interact with the Æsir, as well as the Vanir. They are usually in opposition to, or in competition with, them but also interact with them in a non-hostile manner. Some Jötnar even intermarry with the Æsir and Vanir. This very complex relationship between these two comparable races develops most notably in the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda.

[[Kvasir]]
CATEGORIES: Norse gods, Wisdom gods

In Norse mythology, Kvasir was a being born of the saliva of the Æsir and the Vanir, two groups of gods. Extremely wise, Kvasir traveled far and wide, teaching and spreading knowledge. This continued until the dwarfs Fjalar and Galar killed Kvasir and drained him of his blood. The two mixed his blood with honey, resulting in the Mead of Poetry, a mead which imbues the drinker with skaldship and wisdom, and the spread of which eventually resulted in the introduction of poetry to mankind.
Kvasir is attested in the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, both written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, and in the poetry of skalds. According to the Prose Edda, Kvasir was instrumental in the capture and binding of Loki, and an euhemerized account of the god appears in Heimskringla, where he is attested as the wisest among the Vanir.
Scholars have connected Kvasir to methods of beverage production and peacemaking practices among ancient peoples, and have pointed to a potential basis in Proto-Indo-European myth by way of Sanskrit tales involving the holy beverage Soma and its theft by the god Indra.

The Lion King is a 1994 American animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 32nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, and was influenced by the biblical tales of Joseph and Moses and the Shakespeare play Hamlet. The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance. The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton. Its songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, with an original score by Hans Zimmer. The film features a large ensemble voice cast led by  Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly and Nathan Lane. The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as king; however, after Simba's uncle Scar murders Mufasa, Simba is fooled into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile in shame and despair. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny.
Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical, and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences took place at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede scene.
The Lion King was released on June 15, 1994 to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music, story and animation. Following a 3D re-release in 2011, with earnings of over US $987 million worldwide as of 2011, the film is the highest-grossing hand-drawn film in history, the highest-grossing 2D animated film in the United States and the 19th-highest-grossing feature film of all time. The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.  The film lead to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation, two direct-to-video follow-ups - sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and the prequel/parallel The Lion King 1½ (2004) — and the spin-off series Timon and Pumbaa.

[[Quarter note]]

[tpl]Redirect|Negra|other uses|La Negra (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]La Negra|and|Negro[/tpl]
A quarter note (American) or crotchet (British, from the sense 'hook') is a note played for one quarter of the duration of a whole note (or semibreve). Often, musicians will say that a crotchet is one beat, however, this is not always correct, as the beat is indicated by the time signature of the music; a quarter note may or may not be the beat. Quarter notes are notated with a filled-in oval note head and a straight, flagless stem. The stem usually points upwards if it is below the middle line of the stave or downwards if it is on or above the middle line. However, the stem direction may differentiate more than one part. The head of the note also reverses its orientation in relation to the stem. (See image.)

[[Half note]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

In music, a half note (American) or minim (British) is a note played for half the duration of a whole note (or semibreve) and twice the duration of a quarter note (or crotchet).  In time signatures with a bar length of 4 beats, such as 4/4 or 3/4 time, the half note is two beats long.
Half notes are notated with a hollow oval note head (like a whole note) and a straight note stem with no flags (like a quarter note; see Figure 1). The half rest (or minim rest) denotes a silence for the same duration. Half rests are drawn as filled-in rectangles sitting on top of the middle line of the musical staff. As with all notes with stems, half notes are drawn with stems to the right of the note head, facing up, when they are below the middle line of the staff. When they are on or above the middle line, they are drawn with stems on the left of the note head, facing down.
Its rhythm syllables are ta-ah.
The note derives from the minima in mensural notation, which is Latin for 'least or smallest,' because at one stage it was the shortest of all note values used. The word minim comes from this name. The American term half note is a 19th-century loan translation of German halbe Note.
The names of this note (and rest) in other languages vary greatly:
The Catalan, French and Spanish names for the note (all meaning "white") derive from the fact that the minima was the shortest unfilled note in mensural white notation, which is true as well of the modern form. The form in the earlier black notation resembles the modern quarter note (crotchet). The Greek, Chinese, Japanese and Korean names mean "half" and in Greek, both the modern word (miso - μισό) and the older (imisi - ήμισι) are used. For the rest, the word "pafsi" (παύση) is used; this means "pause".

"Professional Widow" is a 1996 song written by singer-songwriter Tori Amos. It is a harpsichord-driven rock dirge and was included on her 1996 album Boys for Pele. The eponymous "professional widow" is widely rumoured to be Courtney Love, former wife of Kurt Cobain, whom Trent Reznor blames for the destruction of the friendship (whatever its extent) between himself and Amos.
In 1999, Reznor's band Nine Inch Nails released a single called "Starfuckers, Inc.", with "Starfucker" being a word that appears in "Professional Widow".
Lyrically the song borrows directly from the short story "The Sphinx" by Edgar Allan Poe. Specifically the lyric "what is termed a landslide of principal proportion" is taken from the line "what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees"; and the lyric "prism perfect" from the line "in shape a perfect prism."
It was remixed by house music producer Armand van Helden (marketed as "Armand's Star Trunk Funkin' Mix"), and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, and the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the U.S. The song was then further remixed by artist Mr. Roy, spawning an entirely new CD-single of remixes that again charted.

[[Whole note]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

In music, a whole note (American) or semibreve (British) is a note represented by a hollow oval note head, like a half note (or minim), and no note stem (see Figure 1). Its length is equal to four beats in 4/4 time. Most other notes are fractions of the whole note; half notes are played for one half the duration of the whole note, quarter notes (or crotchets) are each played for one quarter the duration, etc.
A whole note lasts half as long as a double whole note (or breve).
A related symbol is the whole rest (or semibreve rest), which usually denotes a silence for the same duration. Whole rests are drawn as filled-in rectangles hanging under the second line from the top of a musical staff.

[[Steve Caton]]

CATEGORIES: American record producers, American male singers, American singer-songwriters, American composers, Living people

Steve Caton is a professional guitarist/singer, song writer, producer, and visual artist, whose career has spanned almost three decades.
Catons first time in a band was in Tedd Armstrongs' band "PEGASUS" in the late 1970s into early 1980s. Even as a beginner, Caton's talent as a lead guitarist was apparent. Songs like "California Girl" and "At First Sight" and the cover or J. Kidds "Shakin All Over" with Armstrong as lead vocal rhythm guitar and composer, Matt Rydell keyboards, Jim Bender bass and Van Harter drums. Can be heard at Teddarmstrong.com.
Caton came to wider public attention while playing in a band called Y Kant Tori Read with then-unknown singer Tori Amos.http://www.yessaid.com/timeline6.html He played with various bands and artists throughout the 80's including Human Drama, The Boxboys, Al Kooper, Sandra Bernhard, Francis X and the Bushman, Mercury 5, and Sphinx In Cairo. Eventually Caton worked on many of Amos's subsequent albums, including Little Earthquakes and Under The Pink, and toured with her from 1996 to 1999. His last collaboration with Amos was To Venus and Back. 
Released on A Piano: The Collection, Amos wrote a song that is believed to be about Caton called "Not David Bowie." It is about how she thinks he was latching onto her for fame and then blamed her when he didn't get famous too.
He was signed to a publishing agreement with Famous Music (Paramount Pictures) from the late 1980s through the 1990s and has written songs for movies and TV productions such as the big-screen hit Point Break starring Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze and the well-known TV series' Beverly Hills, 90210 and 21 Jump Street featuring Johnny Depp.
Called "Caton" by friends, he started the band Binge in 1997 with drummer Matt Sorum of Guns N' Roses fame, and eventually parted ways with Amos at the end of 2000.http://thedent.com/binge.htmlhttp://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB722196CBE5F9D&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM San Jose Mercury News (CA), September 11, 1998  - Google News Archive

[[Y Kant Tori Read]]

CATEGORIES: American pop music groups, Synthpop groups, Tori Amos

Y Kant Tori Read was a 1980s synthpop band, fronted by singer-songwriter Tori Amos. The band released one album, also called Y Kant Tori Read, which was largely unsuccessful; Atlantic Records abandoned promoting the record completely after only two months of release. The band originally consisted of Amos, Steve Caton, Matt Sorum (later of Guns N' Roses), and bassist Brad Cobb. They worked with record producer Joe Chiccarelli, and Kim Bullard, later of Kajagoogoo. The name comes from an incident in Amos' childhood where she was asked to leave the Peabody Conservatory because she refused to read sheet music.*David Wallechinsky & Amy Wallace: The New Book of Lists, p. 9.  Canongate, 2005.  ISBN 1-84195-719-4.
A music video for their song "The Big Picture" was made, but the only member of the band featured was Amos, since by then, unable to withstand pressure from Atlantic Records, she had jettisoned the rest of them with the exception of Steve Caton.
Two singles were released. The first, "The Big Picture", was commercially issued exclusively as a 7" vinyl single, and without a picture sleeve, though the 12" vinyl promo did have one. The second single, "Cool on Your Island", was issued as a cassette single and 7" vinyl single, this time with a picture sleeve; and in various promo 7" vinyl singles. Neither single was successful. 
The record company has honored Amos' request that no Y Kant Tori Read material be re-released, although bootleg copies do exist.

[[Eighth note]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

An eighth note (in the US and Canada) or a quaver (other English-speaking countries) is a musical note played for one eighth the duration of whole note (US and Canada.  Semibreve, or half a breve, other English-speaking countries), hence the name.
Eighth notes are notated with an oval, filled-in note head and a straight note stem with one flag note flag (see Figure 1). A related symbol is the eighth rest (or quaver rest), which denotes a silence for the same duration. 
In unicode, the symbols U+266A ([tpl]Unicode|♪[/tpl]) and U+266B ([tpl]Unicode|♫[/tpl]) are an eighth note and beamed pair of eighth notes respectively. The former is inherited from the early 1980s code page 437, where it has code 13.
As with all notes with stems, the general rule is that eighth notes are drawn with stems to the right of the notehead, facing up, when they are  below the middle line of the musical staff. When they are on or above the middle line, they are drawn with stems on the left of the note head, facing down.  Alternatively, stems are used to indicate voicing or parts; all stems for the upper voice's notes (or "parts") are drawn facing up, regardless of their position on the staff.  Similarly, stems for the next lower part's notes are down facing down.  This makes the voices/parts clear to the player and singer.
Flags are always on the right side of the stem, and curve to the right. On stems facing up, the flag starts at the top and curves down; for downward facing stems, the flags start at the bottom of the stem and curve up. When multiple eighth notes or sixteenth notes (or thirty-second notes, etc.) are next to each other, the stems may be connected with a beam rather than a flag, as shown in Figure 2. Its rhythm syllable is 'ti'.'
Eighth notes in 3/8, 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8 are beamed 3 eighth notes at a time.

[[Strange Little Girls]]
CATEGORIES: 2001 albums, Covers albums, Tori Amos albums, Concept albums, Atlantic Records albums, Baroque pop albums

Strange Little Girls  is a concept album released by singer-songwriter Tori Amos in 2001. The album's 12 tracks are covers of songs written and originally performed by men, reinterpreted by Amos from a female's point of view. Amos created female personae for each track (one song featured twins) and was photographed as each, with makeup done by Kevyn Aucoin. In the United States the album was issued with four alternative covers depicting Amos as the characters singing "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" (pictured), "Strange Little Girl", "Time" and "Raining Blood". A fifth cover of the "I Don't Like Mondays" character was also issued in the UK and other territories. Text accompanying the photos and songs was written by novelist Neil Gaiman. The complete short stories in which this text appears can be found in Gaiman's 2006 collection Fragile Things.
As with Amos's previous two studio albums, the cover album was recorded at her Cornwall studio. The album received mixed reviews upon its release in September 2001 with critics largely seeing the album as a mixed bag, praising the unlikely re-workings of Eminem's "'97 Bonnie and Clyde" and Slayer's "Raining Blood", while panning the versions of The Beatles' "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" and Neil Young's "Heart of Gold". Amos also tackled songs by artists such as Tom Waits, The Velvet Underground, Depeche Mode, and The Stranglers.
The album's greatest attention was garnered from Amos' cover of Eminem's "'97 Bonnie and Clyde", a rap song.  The album's cover of "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" was translated into a discussion on the right to bear arms, and included sound bites from both George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, as well as from Amos' own minister father. The album entered the charts at US #4, selling 111,000 copies, making it her third album to debut in the US Top 10, her second-highest debut in terms of sales,[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | title = Jay-Z's 'Blueprint' Enters Second Week At No. 1 | publisher = | url =http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78287/jay-zs-blueprint-enters-second-week-at-no-1 | accessdate =2001-09-27[/tpl] and her best position in the US for almost six years.
A planned commercial single, "Strange Little Girl" (The Stranglers), including "After All" (David Bowie) and "Only Women Bleed" (originally by Alice Cooper), was pulled from shelves soon after being shipped to stores in Europe. Despite being recalled from the shelves, limited copies of the single were sold and a promotional video was made. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
Additionally, Amos later acknowledged that she had attempted to reinterpret four other songs that she "couldn't find her way into." They were "Fear of a Black Planet" by Public Enemy, "Hoover Factory" by Elvis Costello, "I'm Sick of You" by Iggy Pop and "Marlene Dietrich's Favorite Poem" by Peter Murphy. These tracks have not been released. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]

Lofn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry.

[[Fárbauti]]

CATEGORIES: Jötnar

In Norse mythology, Fárbauti (Old Norse: "cruel striker") is the jötunn husband of Laufey or Nál and the father of Loki, and possibly also of Helblindi and Byleistr. He is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the poetry of Viking Age skalds. Fárbauti's name and character are thought to have been inspired by the observation of the natural phenomena surrounding the appearance of wildfire.
In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High says Loki is the son of the jötunn Fárbauti and that "Laufey or Nál is his mother".Faulkes (1995:26). In Skáldskaparmál, Fárbauti receives another three mentions. In chapter 16, Lokakenningar or "ways of referring to Loki" are provided, one of which reads "son of Fárbauti and Laufey, or Nál".Faulkes (1995:76). In chapter 17, a work by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason is quoted referring to Loki as "Fárbauti's terribly sly son".Faulkes (1995:77). In chapter 22, Fárbauti is referenced in the Haustlöng of 10th century skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir, where Loki is referred to as "Fárbauti's son".Faulkes (1995:87).

[[Móði and Magni]]

CATEGORIES: Æsir, Jötnar

In Norse mythology, Móði (anglicized Módi or Mothi) and Magni are the sons of Thor. Their names mean "Angry" and "Strong," respectively. Rudolf Simek states that, along with Thor's daughter Þrúðr ("Strength"), they embody their father's features.Simek 1987.
Móði and Magni's descent from Thor is attested by the kennings "Móði's father" (faðir Móða, in Hymiskviða, 34) and "Magni's father" (faðir Magna, in Þórsdrápa and Hárbarðsljóð, 53). Snorri Sturluson confirms it (Gylfaginning, 53, Skáldskaparmál, 4). According to Skáldskaparmál (17) Magni is the son of Thor and the Jötunn Járnsaxa. There is no mention of Móði's mother.

[[Herpetoculture]]
CATEGORIES: Amphibians in captivity, Reptiles

Herpetoculture is the keeping of live reptiles and amphibians in captivity, whether as a hobby or as a commercial breeding operation. "Herps" is an informal term that refers to both reptiles and amphibians. It is undertaken by people of all ages and from all walks of life, including, but not limited to career herpetologists, professional reptile or amphibian breeders, and casual hobbyists. It is considered by many to be different from pet keeping in that few of its practitioners consider their animals as "pets"; most herpetoculturists do not give their animals names, and most do not bond in the same way as pet keepers bond with their cats and dogs. However, some amateur herpetoculturists do treat their animals as pets and interact with them accordingly.

[[Muspell]]
CATEGORIES: Germanic mythology

Muspell ([tpl]lang-on|Múspell[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-goh|Mūspilli[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-osx|Mūdspelli, Mūtspelli[/tpl]) is a common Germanic envisioning of the end times. In Norse mythology, Muspell is merely an element of the end times, the end itself being called Ragnarök. In the Continental Germanic mythology of the Germans and Saxons, however, Muspell referred to the end of the world itself.
The Old Norse Múspell appears in the 13th-century Prose Edda written by Snorri Sturluson, where it is of uncertain meaning. Muspelheim (Múspellsheimr, literally "home of Múspell") is the world of fire, at odds with Niflheim, the world of ice. Muspelheim is one of the first of the 9 worlds under Yggdrasil, guarded by the Fire-Giant (eldjötnar) Surtr (black, cf. English “swarthy”), who wields a flaming sword and protects the gates of Muspelheim. In the Prose Edda, Snorri Sturlson recounts the creation myth, in which the sparks from the giant Surtr’s sword melt the ice from Niflheim, and the steam in the Gunnungagap forms the giant Ymir (Aurgelmir), and from Ymir’s body, the first humans are born. 
Muspell is also mentioned in the Prose Edda as the element which is central to the final battle against the Gods. During Ragnarök (the final fate of the gods), the Fire-Giants (eldjötnar), called the "sons of Múspell" (Múspellz synir or Múspells megir) or "people of Múspell" (Múspellz lȳðir), will break the Bifröst bridge, thus heralding the beginning of Ragnarök. The giant Surtr will then lead his army of eldjötnar to storm Asgard, and set fire to Yggdrasil, the world tree. In Surtr's fury, he will strike and kill the God Freyr with his flaming sword. 
The word Muspilli is used in a 9th-century Old High German epic poem of the same name to mean the end of the world as described in Christian theology. The Christian understanding of Muspell speaks of flames which fall from the heavens and demolish the world. The words Mūdspelli and Mūtspelli are used in the same way in the 9th-century Old Saxon poem Heliand. Similar to the Eddic version of Muspell, the Germans and Saxons use the term Muspilli or Mudspelli to describe the end of the world in an apocalyptic volcanic enigma. Because of the re-occurrence of these similar terms, and their similar meanings, there is an ongoing scholarly dispute about the origin of Muspell.

In Norse mythology, Sinmara is a female figure or jötunn,[tpl]Refn|"Sinmara.. furia [tpl]linktext|gigantea[/tpl] allegoricae"[/tpl] usually considered a consort to the fire jötunn Surtr, the lord of Muspelheim. Sinmara is attested solely in the poem Fjölsvinnsmál, where she is mentioned alongside Surt in one (emended) stanza, and described as keeper of the legendary weapon Lævateinn in a later passage.  Assorted theories have been proposed about the etymology of her name, and her connection with other figures in Norse mythology.

[[Metronome]]

CATEGORIES: Pendulums, 1815, Dutch inventions, German inventions, Rhythm and meter

A metronome is any device that produces regular, metrical ticks (beats, clicks) — settable in beats per minute. These ticks represent a fixed, regular aural pulse; some metronomes also include synchronized visual motion (e.g. pendulum-swing). The metronome dates from the early 19th century, where it was patented by Johann Maelzel in 1815 as a tool for musicians, under the title "Instrument/Machine for the Improvement of all Musical Performance, called Metronome".
The metronome is used by musicians to help keep a steady tempo as they play, or to work on issues of irregular timing, or to help internalize a clear sense of timing and tempo. The metronome is also often used by composers as a standard tempo reference, to indicate the intended tempo for the piece.
Human beings seldom play music at an exact tempo with all the beats exactly the same. This makes it impossible to align metronome clicks with the beats of a musically expressive performance.Paul Lamere Revisiting the click track from Music Machinery, a blog about music technology - great post with graphs of variation in timing and tempo for various songs, with and without click tracks.Andrew Robertson DECODING TEMPO AND TIMING VARIATIONS IN MUSIC RECORDINGS FROM BEAT ANNOTATIONS 13th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2012)Vijay Iyar Microtiming Studies(from thesis at Berkeley university).The Metronomic Performance Practice: A History of Rhythm, Metronomes, and the Mechanization of Musicality (pdf); PhD Thesis by Alexander Bonus (May, 2010)
This also has led many musicians to criticize use of a metronome. Some go as far as to suggest that metronomes shouldn't be used by musicians at all. The same criticism has been applied to metronome markings as well. See Criticism of metronome use.
Those in favour of metronome use understand this as a criticism of metronome technique as commonly practiced by musicians, rather than criticism of the tool as such.Frederick Franz,  revised by Jon Truelson Metronome TechniquesCHAPTER III PotPourri - many quotes in favour of metronome use Their response has been to develop better methods of metronome technique to address the various issues raised by the critics. See Metronome Technique. These techniques however aren't widely known by musicians generally, including many of the critics of metronome use. What Frederick Franz wrote in the introduction to his book is still true today (the original version was published in 1947).Metronome techniques: : being a very brief account of the history and use of the metronome with many practical applications for the musician ISBN 999834834X Metronome technique has developed considerably since his day, but the amount published is still small. As in his day, it is understandable that critics should be under the impression that metronome technique simply consists of playing your music along with the metronome.

[[Improvisation]]

CATEGORIES: Improvisation, Engineering, Film techniques, Music genres, Poetic devices, Sculpture techniques, Theatre

Improvisation is a state of being and creating action without pre-planning.  This can be when an individual or group is acting, dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, talking, creating artworks, problem solving, or reacting in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one's immediate environment and inner feelings. This can result in the invention of new thought patterns, new practices, new structures or symbols, and/or new ways to act.  
Improvisation can be thought of as an "on the spot" or "off the cuff" spontaneous moment of sudden inventiveness that can just come to mind, body and spirit as an inspiration.  No preparation or training is needed.  However, improvisation in any life or art form, can occur more often if it is practiced as a way of encouraging creative behavior. That practice includes learning to use one's intuition, as well as learning a technical understanding of the necessary skills and concerns within the domain in which one is improvising.

The USDA requires that the product contain a minimum of 30% liver (pork, calf, veal, beef, etc.), lean meat (can include mechanically separated poultry), fat meat, binders and seasonings.Code of Federal Regulations 9 CFR 319.182 http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/janqtr/pdf/9cfr319.182.pdf  Retrieved 29 June 2010 A typical commercial formula is about 40% pork liver or scalded beef liver, 30% scalded pork jowl, 20% lean pork trimmings and 10% bacon ends and pieces.  Added seasonings include salt and often include white pepper, onion powder or chopped onion, and mace. Curing ingredients (sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite) are optional.
Braunschweiger has a very high amount of vitamin A, iron, protein and fat. The meat has a very soft, spread-like texture and a distinctive spicy liver-based flavor, very similar to the Nordic leverpastej. It is usually used as a spread for toast, but can also be used as a filling for sandwiches, often paired with stone-ground mustard, sliced tomato, onion and cheese. In the Midwestern United States, braunschweiger is typically enjoyed in a sandwich with various condiments such as ketchup, mustard, and dill pickles, or simply spread on crackers. There are also a few recipes for pâté and cheese balls which use braunschweiger as a primary ingredient. Pâté is creamier than braunschweiger.

[tpl]For|other meanings of words and phrases starting with "tweet"|Tweet (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Tweet[/tpl]

Tweety (Tweety Bird) is a fictional yellow canary in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated cartoons.  The name "Tweety" is a play on words, as it originally meant "sweetie", along with "tweet" being a typical English onomatopoeia for the sounds of birds. His characteristics are based on Red Skelton's famous "Mean Widdle Kid." Tweety appeared in 49 cartoons in the golden age.
Despite the perceptions that people may hold, owing to the long lashes and high pitched voice of Tweety, Tweety is male. This is established several times in the animated series The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries, and in the film-short Bad Ol' Putty Tat when Sylvester tries to trick Tweety using a fake female bird. On the other hand, a 1951 cartoon was entitled "Ain't 'She' Tweet." Also, his species is ambiguous; although originally and often portrayed as a young canary, he is also frequently called a rare and valuable "tweety bird" as a plot device, and once called "the only living specimen". Nevertheless, the title song directly states that the bird is a canary. His shape more closely suggests that of a baby bird, which in fact is what he was during his early appearances (although the "baby bird" aspect has been used in a few later cartoons as a plot device). The yellow feathers were added but otherwise he retained the baby-bird shape.
In his early appearances in Bob Clampett cartoons, Tweety is a very aggressive character who tries anything to foil his foe, even kicking his enemy when he is down. One of his most notable malicious moments is in the cartoon Birdy and the Beast. A cat chases Tweety by flying until he remembers that cats cannot fly, causing him to fall. Tweety says sympathetically, "Awww, the poor kitty cat! He faw down and go (in a loud, tough, masculine voice) BOOM!!" and then grins mischievously. A similar use of that voice is in A Tale Of Two Kitties when Tweety, wearing an air raid warden's helmet, suddenly yells, "Turn out those lights!" Tweety was toned down when Friz Freleng started directing the series into a more cutesy bird, and even more when Granny was introduced, but occasionally Tweety still showed his malicious side.

Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler (January 25, 1886[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]November 30, 1954) was a German conductor and composer. He is considered to be one of the greatest symphonic and operatic conductors of the 20th century.
During the 1920s and 1930s, Furtwängler was one of the world's leading conductors. He became the principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1922, was principal conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra (1922–26), and was a major guest conductor of other leading orchestras including the Vienna Philharmonic. He was the leading conductor to remain in Germany during the Second World War and, although not an adherent to the Nazi regime,David Cairns "Wilhelm Furtwängler" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians London: Macmillan, 1980 this decision caused lasting controversy. The extent to which his presence lent prestige to the Third Reich is still debated. Furtwängler's interpretive art is well documented in commercial and broadcast recordings and has contributed to his lasting reputation.
Furtwängler's conducting style is often contrasted with that of his older contemporary Arturo Toscanini, whose work during this period is also well documented. Like Toscanini, Furtwängler was a major influence on many later conductors, and his name is often mentioned when discussing their interpretive styles.[tpl]cite web | last=Cowan | first=Rob | title=Furtwängler – Man and Myth | url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/HallofFame/Furtwangler/Feature/Manandmyth | publisher=Gramophone | accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl] Unlike Toscanini, Furtwängler sought a weighty, less rhythmically strict, more bass-oriented orchestral sound, with a more conspicuous use of tempo changes not indicated in the printed score.The difference is sometimes mis-characterized by the terms "objective" and "subjective", but Furtwängler's tempo inflections were often planned and reflected his studies with the harmonic theorist Heinrich Schenker from 1920 to 1935.

A top-spinner is a type of delivery bowled by a cricketer bowling either wrist spin or finger spin. In either case, the bowler imparts the ball with top spin by twisting it with his or her fingers prior to delivery. In both cases, the topspinner is the halfway house between the stock delivery and the wrong'un - in the wrist spinner's case his googly, and in the finger spinner's case his doosra.

Bristol Temple Meads railway station is the oldest and largest railway station in Bristol. It is an important transport hub for public transport, with bus services to many parts of the city and surrounding districts and a ferry to the city centre in addition to the train services. Bristol's other main-line station, Bristol Parkway, is on the northern outskirts of the conurbation.
It opened on 31 August 1840 as the western terminus of the Great Western Railway from London Paddington. The railway including Temple Meads was the first one designed by the British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Soon the station was also used by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, the Bristol Harbour Railway and the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. To accommodate the increasing number of trains the station was expanded in the 1870s by Francis Fox and again in the 1930s by P E Culverhouse.  Brunel's terminus is no longer part of the operational station.  The historical significance of the station has been noted, and most of the site is Grade 1 listed.
Temple Meads is one of 19 stations managed by Network Rail.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/managed-stations/ |title=Commercial information |date=April 2014 |work=Our Stations |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page= |accessdate=12 April 2014 [/tpl] The majority of services are operated by franchise holder First Great Western, which provides services to London Paddington, and local and inter-urban trains to destinations such as Cardiff Central, [tpl]Stnlnk|Southampton[/tpl], Portsmouth and [tpl]Stnlnk|Weymouth[/tpl]. Long distance inter-city trains are operated by CrossCountry to destinations as diverse as [tpl]Stnlnk|Exeter St Davids[/tpl], [tpl]Stnlnk|Plymouth[/tpl] in the South West and [tpl]Stnlnk|Penzance[/tpl] in Cornwall; [tpl]Stnlnk|Birmingham New Street[/tpl] in the Midlands; [tpl]Stnlnk|Manchester Piccadilly[/tpl], [tpl]Stnlnk|Leeds[/tpl] and [tpl]Stnlnk|Newcastle[/tpl] in the North; and Edinburgh, [tpl]Stnlnk|Aberdeen[/tpl] and [tpl]Stnlnk|Glasgow Central[/tpl] in Scotland. A few trains to [tpl]Stnlnk|London Waterloo[/tpl] are provided by South West Trains.
More than 7.8 million people entered and left the station in the twelve months to March 2010, an increase of more than 2 million in five years. It is the 33rd-most-used Network Rail station and the 13th busiest outside the London area, and it was estimated that more than 975,000 people used the station to change trains. The platforms are numbered 1 to 15, but passenger trains are confined to just eight tracks. Most platforms are numbered separately at each end with odd numbers at the east end, even numbers at the west end. Platform 2 is not signalled for passenger trains, and platform 14 does not exist.

[[AmigaDOS]]

CATEGORIES: AmigaOS, Disk operating systems, MorphOS

AmigaDOS is the disk operating system of the AmigaOS, which includes file systems, file and directory manipulation, the command-line interface, and file redirection.
In AmigaOS 1.x, AmigaDOS was based on a TRIPOS port by MetaComCo, written in BCPL. BCPL does not use native pointers, so the more advanced functionality of the operating system was difficult to use and error-prone. The third-party AmigaDOS Resource Projecthttp://uk.aminet.net/misc/antiq/ARP_13.readme (ARP, formerly the AmigaDOS Replacement Project),ARP is referred to as the AmigaDOS Replacement Project in ARP version 1.1's arpbase.h, available from ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/amiga/ancient/ex-amiga-s/archive/ a project begun by Amiga developer Charlie Heath, replaced many of the BCPL utilities with smaller, more sophisticated equivalents written in C and assembler, and provided a wrapper library, arp.library. This eliminated the interfacing problems in applications by automatically performing conversions from native pointers (such as those used by C or assembler) to BCPL equivalents and vice versa for all AmigaDOS functions.
From AmigaOS 2.x onwards, AmigaDOS was rewritten in C, retaining 1.x compatibility where possible. Starting with AmigaOS 4, AmigaDOS abandoned its legacy with BCPL. Starting from AmigaOS 4.1, AmigaDOS has been extended with 64-bit file-access support.

[[Nile perch]]
CATEGORIES: Latidae, Megafauna of Africa, Animals described in 1758, Invasive fish species

The Nile perch (Lates niloticus) is a species of freshwater
fish in family Latidae of order Perciformes. It is widespread throughout much of the Afrotropic ecozone, being native to the Congo, Nile, Senegal, Niger, and Lake Chad, Volta, Lake Turkana, and other river basins.  It also occurs in the brackish waters of Lake Maryut in Egypt.  Originally described as Labrus niloticus, among the marine wrasses, the species has also been referred to as Centropomus niloticus.  Common names include African snook, Victoria perch (a misleading trade name, as the species is not native to Lake Victoria), and a large number of local names in various African languages, such as the Luo name mbuta or mputa. In Tanzania, it is called sangara, sankara or chenku. In Francophone African countries, it is known as capitaine and in Egypt/Sudan as am'kal. Its name in the Hausa language is giwan ruwa, meaning "water elephant".
Lates niloticus is silver in colour with a blue tinge. It has  distinctive dark-black eyes, with a bright-yellow outer ring.  One of the largest freshwater fish, it reaches a maximum length of nearly 2 m (more than 6 ft), weighing up to 200 kg (440 lb).[tpl]cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Les|authorlink=Les Kaufman|title=Catastrophic Change in Species-Rich Freshwater Ecosystems: The lessons of Lake Victoria|journal=BioScience|volume=42|issue=11|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1312084|accessdate=31 July 2013[/tpl] Mature fish average 121–137 cm (48–54 in), although many fish are caught before they can grow this large.[tpl]cite book|last=Wood|title=The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|year=1983|isbn=978-0-85112-235-9[/tpl]
Adult Nile perch occupy all habitats of a lake with sufficient oxygen concentrations, while juveniles are restricted to shallow or nearshore environments. A fierce predator that dominates its surroundings, the Nile perch feeds on fish (including its own species), crustaceans, and insects; the juveniles also feed on zooplankton. Nile perch use schooling as a mechanism to protect them from other predators.
Nile perch have been introduced to many other lakes in Africa, including Lake Victoria  (see below) and the artificial Lake Nasser. The IUCN's (World Conservation Union) Invasive Species Specialist Group considers L. niloticus one of the world's 100 worst invasive species.
The state of Queensland in Australia levies heavy fines on anyone found in possession of a living Nile perch, since it competes directly with the native barramundi, which is similar and grows to 1.8m long while the Nile Perch grows to 2m long.
The species is of great commercial importance as a food fish.  The Nile perch is also popular with sport anglers, as it attacks artificial fishing lures and is also raised in aquaculture.

The royal Château de Chambord at Chambord, Loir-et-Cher, France, is one of the most recognizable châteaux in the world because of its very distinct French Renaissance architecture which blends traditional French medieval forms with classical Renaissance structures.[tpl]#tag:ref|Viollet-le-Duc, however, in his Dictionnaire raisonné de l'architecture française (1875) found that there was "nothing Italianate Chambord ..., in thought or in form".[tpl]harvnb|Viollet-le-Duc|1875|p=189[/tpl], quoted in [tpl]harvnb|Tanaka|1992|p=85[/tpl]|group="nb"[/tpl] The building, which was never completed, was constructed by King François I.
Chambord is the largest château in the Loire Valley; it was built to serve as a hunting lodge for François I, who maintained his royal residences at Château de Blois and Château d'Amboise. The original design of the Château de Chambord is attributed, though with several doubts, to Domenico da Cortona. Some authors claim that the French Renaissance architect Philibert Delorme had a considerable role in the château's design,Félibien, Mémoires pour servir a l'histoire des maisons royalles (1681). and others have suggested that Leonardo da Vinci may have designed it.
Chambord was altered considerably during the twenty-eight years of its construction (1519–1547) during which it was overseen on-site by Pierre Nepveu. With the château nearing completion, François showed off his enormous symbol of wealth and power by hosting his old archnemesis, Emperor Charles V, at Chambord.
In 1792, some of the furnishings were sold and timber removed. For a time the building was left abandoned, though in the 19th century some attempts were made at restoration. During the Second World War art works from the collections of the Louvre and Compiègne were moved to Château de Chambord. The château is now open to the public, receiving 700,000 visitors in 2007.

SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) is a fictional global terrorist organisation featured in the James Bond novels by Ian Fleming, the films based on those novels, and James Bond video games. Led by evil genius and supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the supranational organisation first formally appeared in the novel Thunderball (1961) and in the movie Dr. No (1962). SPECTRE is not aligned to any nation or political ideology, enabling the later Bond books and Bond films to be regarded as apolitical. SPECTRE began in the novels as a small group of criminals but became a vast international organisation with its own SPECTRE Island training base in the films, to replace the Soviet SMERSH.

[[Blood transfusion]]

CATEGORIES: Transfusion medicine, Hematology, Blood

Blood transfusion is generally the process of receiving blood products into one's circulation intravenously. Transfusions are used for various medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood. Early transfusions used whole blood, but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, clotting factors, and platelets.
Units of packed red blood cells are typically only recommended when either a patient's hemoglobin level falls below 10g/dL or hematocrit falls below 30%; recently, this 'trigger' level has been decreased to 7-8g/dL, as a more restrictive strategy has been shown to have better patient outcomes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Carson|first=JL|coauthors=Grossman, BJ, Kleinman, S, Tinmouth, AT, Marques, MB, Fung, MK, Holcomb, JB, Illoh, O, Kaplan, LJ, Katz, LM, Rao, SV, Roback, JD, Shander, A, Tobian, AA, Weinstein, R, Swinton McLaughlin, LG, Djulbegovic, B, for the Clinical Transfusion Medicine Committee of the, AABB|title=Red Blood Cell Transfusion: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the AABB|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=Mar 26, 2012|pmid=22454395|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-156-12-201206190-00429|doi_brokendate=2014-02-06[/tpl] This is in part due to the increasing evidence that there are cases where patients have worse outcomes when transfused.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=23281973|year=2013|last1=Villanueva|first1=C|last2=Colomo|first2=A|last3=Bosch|first3=A|last4=Concepción|first4=M|last5=Hernandez-Gea|first5=V|last6=Aracil|first6=C|last7=Graupera|first7=I|last8=Poca|first8=M|last9=Alvarez-Urturi|first9=C|last10=Gordillo|first10=J|last11=Guarner-Argente|first11=C|last12=Santaló|first12=M|last13=Muñiz|first13=E|last14=Guarner|first14=C|title=Transfusion strategies for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding|volume=368|issue=1|pages=11–21|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1211801|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine[/tpl] One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath. Globally around 85 million units of red blood cells are transfused in a given year. In cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin but are cardiovascularly stable, parenteral iron is increasingly a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.gasche.at/pdf/IBD_Journal_2007.pdf|pmid=17985376|year=2007|last1=Gasche|first1=C|last2=Berstad|first2=A|last3=Befrits|first3=R|last4=Beglinger|first4=C|last5=Dignass|first5=A|last6=Erichsen|first6=K|last7=Gomollon|first7=F|last8=Hjortswang|first8=H|last9=Koutroubakis|first9=I|last10=Kulnigg|first10=S|last11=Oldenburg|first11=B|last12=Rampton|first12=D|last13=Schroeder|first13=O|last14=Stein|first14=J|last15=Travis|first15=S|last16=Van Assche|first16=G|title=Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anemia in inflammatory bowel diseases|volume=13|issue=12|pages=1545–53|doi=10.1002/ibd.20285|journal=Inflammatory bowel diseases[/tpl] Other blood products are given where appropriate, such as clotting deficiencies.
When a patient's own blood is salvaged and reinfused during a surgery (e.g. using a cell salvage machine such as a Cell Saver), this can be considered a form of autotransfusion (and thus a form of transfusion) even though no "blood product" is actually created. Before this was possible, autotransfusion had referred only to pre-donating one's own blood autologously, which still occurs as well.

Alabama is an American country, southern rock and bluegrass band formed in Fort Payne, Alabama, in 1969. The band was founded by Randy Owen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and his cousin Teddy Gentry (bass guitar, background vocals), soon joined by their other cousin, Jeff Cook (lead guitar, fiddle, keyboards). First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the Southeast bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and signed a record deal with GRT, creating a minor sensation with debut single "I Wanna Be With You Tonight". GRT soon went bankrupt and due to a hidden clause in their contract, the band was prohibited from recording and releasing new music; they secured a loan to buy themselves out of the contract as the decade closed.
Alabama's biggest success came in the 1980s, where the band had over 27 number one hits, seven multi-platinum albums and received numerous awards. Alabama's first single on RCA Records, "Tennessee River", began a streak of number one singles, including "Love in the First Degree" (1981), "Mountain Music" (1982), "Dixieland Delight" (1983), "If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)" (1984) and "Song of the South" (1987). The group's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to receive hit singles and multi-platinum record sales. The group disbanded in 2006 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2010 and have continued to record and tour worldwide.
The band's blend of traditional country music and southern rock combined with elements of gospel music, and pop music gave it a crossover appeal that helped lead to their unprecedented success.  They also toured extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and "sets" inspired by rock concerts into their shows.  The band has over 30 number one country records on the Billboard charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million albums, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2003-02-04-alabama_x.htm|title=For Alabama, this farewell tour feels so right |publisher=USA Today|date=2003-02-04|first=Brian|last=Mansfield|accessdate=2013-08-31[/tpl] Allmusic credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band, and wrote that "it's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alabama-mn0000936206/biography|title=Alabama: Biography |publisher=Allmusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=December 17, 2013[/tpl]

[[Chromosome 15q partial deletion]]

CATEGORIES: Genetic disorders with no OMIM

Chromosome 15q partial deletion is an extremely rare human genetic disorder, caused by a chromosomal aberration in which the long ("q") arm of one copy of chromosome 15 is deleted, or partially deleted.  If the mother's copy of the chromosomal arm is deleted, Angelman syndrome results. If the father's copy of the chromosomal arm is deleted, Prader-Willi syndrome results.  The smallest observed region that can result in these syndromes when deleted is therefore called the PWS/AS critical region and is situated at 15q11-q13.  In addition to deletions, uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 gives rise to the same genetic disorders, indicating that genomic imprinting must occur in this region.

[[Nest]]

CATEGORIES: Shelters built or used by animals

A nest is a structure built by animals to hold its eggs, its offspring, or occasionally the animal itself.  Although nests are most closely associated with birds, members of all classes of vertebrates and some invertebrates construct nests.  They may be composed of organic material such as twigs, grass, and leaves, or may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a rock, tree, or building. Human-made materials, such as string, plastic, cloth, or paper, may also be used. Nests can be found in all types of habitat.
Nest building is driven by a biological urge known as the nesting instinct in birds and mammals. Generally each species has a distinctive style of nest.  Nest complexity is roughly correlated with the level of parental care by adults.  Nest building is considered a key adaptive advantage among birds, and they exhibit the most variation in their nests ranging from simple holes in the ground to elaborate communal nests hosting hundreds of individuals.  Nests of prairie dogs and several social insects can host millions of individuals.

Sheffield [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Sheffield.ogg|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|f|iː|l|d[/tpl] is a city and metropolitan borough in South Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, its name derives from the River Sheaf, which runs through the city. With some of its southern suburbs annexed from Derbyshire, the city has grown from its largely industrial roots to encompass a wider economic base. The population of the City of Sheffield is [tpl]English district population|GSS=E08000019[/tpl] ([tpl]English statistics year[/tpl])The mid-[tpl]English statistics year[/tpl] population for the whole City of Sheffield was [tpl]English district population|GSS=E08000019[/tpl] according to the Office for National Statistics ([tpl]English district population citation[/tpl]), though some population figures, like those given at List of English cities by population, use just the urban core of the city and are therefore lower. and it is one of the eight largest regional English cities that make up the Core Cities Group. Sheffield is the third largest English district by population.
During the 19th century, Sheffield gained an international reputation for steel production. Many innovations were developed locally, including crucible and stainless steel, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population during the Industrial Revolution. Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in traditional local industries during the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.
The 21st century has seen extensive redevelopment in Sheffield along with other British cities. Sheffield's gross value added (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at £9.2 billion in 2007. The economy has experienced steady growth averaging around 5% annually, greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.
The city is located within the valleys of the River Don and its four tributaries, the Loxley, the Porter Brook, the Rivelin, and the Sheaf. 61% of Sheffield's entire area is green space, and a third of the city lies within the Peak District national park. There are more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens in the city, and an estimated 2 million trees, giving Sheffield the highest ratio of trees to people of any city in Europe.

Pygmalion (also known as Pu'mayyaton) was king of TyreThe traditional king-list of Tyre is derived from Josephus, Against Apion i. 18, 21, and Jewish Antiquities viii. 5.3; 13.2. His list was based on Menander of Ephesus, who drew his information from the chronicles of Tyre. (Jewish Encyclopedia: "Phenicia"). from 831 to 785 BC and a son of King Mattan I (840-832 BC).
During Pygmalion's reign, Tyre seems to have shifted the heart of its trading empire from the Middle East to the Mediterranean, as can be judged from the building of new colonies including Kition on Cyprus, Sardinia (see Nora Stone discussion below), and, according to tradition, Carthage. For the story surrounding the founding of Carthage, see Dido.

George Barbier ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʒɔʁʒ baʁbje|lang[/tpl]) (1882–1932) was one of the great French illustrators of the early 20th century. Born in Nantes, France on October 10, 1882, Barbier was 29 years old when he mounted his first exhibition in 1911 and was subsequently swept to the forefront of his profession with commissions to design theatre and ballet costumes, to illustrate books, and to produce haute couture fashion illustrations. For the next 20 years Barbier led a group from the Ecole des Beaux Arts who were nicknamed by Vogue "The Knights of the Bracelet"—a tribute to their fashionable and flamboyant mannerisms and style of dress. Included in this élite circle were Bernard Boutet de Monvel and Pierre Brissaud (both of whom were Barbier's first cousins), Paul Iribe, Georges Lepape, and Charles Martin. During his career Barbier also turned his hand to jewellery, glass and wallpaper design, wrote essays and many articles for the prestigious Gazette du bon ton. In the mid-1920s he worked with Erté to design sets and costumes for the Folies Bergère and in 1929 he wrote the introduction for Erté's acclaimed exhibition and achieved mainstream popularity through his regular appearances in L'Illustration magazine. Barbier died in 1932 at the very pinnacle of his success.

Preston and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient Roman activity in the area, largely in the form of a Roman road which led to a camp at Walton-le-Dale. The Angles established Preston; the name Preston is derived from Old English words meaning "Priest settlement" and in the Domesday Book appears as "Prestune". During the Middle Ages, Preston formed a parish and township in the hundred of Amounderness and was granted a Guild Merchant charter in 1179, giving it the status of a market town. Textiles have been produced in Preston since the middle of the 13th century, when locally produced wool was woven in people's houses. Flemish weavers who settled in the area during the 14th century helped to develop the industry. Sir Richard Arkwright, inventor of the spinning frame, was born in Preston. The most rapid period of growth and development in Preston's history coincided with the industrialisation and expansion of textile manufacturing. Preston was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, becoming a densely populated engineering centre, with large industrial plants.
In the early 18th century Edmund Calamy wrote that Preston was "a pretty town with an abundance of gentry in it, commonly called Proud Preston". The town's textile sector fell into a terminal decline, however, from the mid-20th century and Preston has subsequently faced similar challenges to other post-industrial northern towns, including deindustrialisation, economic deprivation and housing issues.
Preston is the seat of Lancashire County Council and home to Preston North End F.C., one of the founder members of the Football League and the first English football champions.

[[Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories]]

CATEGORIES: Conspiracy theories by subject, Biological warfare, AIDS origin hypotheses

Various alternative theories have arisen speculating about the hidden origins of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), ranging from suggestions that they were the inadvertent result of experiments in the development of vaccines to claims that they were intentionally developed by scientists working for the U.S. government. (Alternative theories regarding the hidden origin — accidential or intentional — of HIV/AIDS must be distinguished from AIDS denialism, which is the view of those who deny that HIV is the cause of AIDS. AIDS denialists, however, overlap with the alternative origin theorists in sharing the conspiratorial view that government officials and the biomedical establishment have been complicit in suppressing the truth about HIV/AIDS.) Speculations notwithstanding, the current scientific consensus is that HIV originated naturally in West Central Africa in the mid-1930s from the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).[tpl]cite doi |10.1098/rstb.2001.0863[/tpl]

Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known by his stage names Snoop Doggy Dogg, Snoop Dogg, and later Snoop Lion, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and actor. Snoop has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. His music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by Dr. Dre. He collaborated on Dre's solo debut The Chronic (1992), and on the theme song to the feature film Deep Cover.
Snoop's debut album, Doggystyle, was released in 1993 under Death Row Records, debuting at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Selling almost a million copies in the first week of its release, Doggystyle became certified 4× platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit singles, including "What's My Name" and "Gin & Juice". In 1994, Snoop released a soundtrack on Death Row Records for the short film Murder Was The Case, starring himself. His second album Tha Doggfather (1996), also debuted at No. 1 on both charts with "Snoop's Upside Ya Head" as the lead single. The album was certified double platinum in 1997.
After leaving Death Row, Snoop signed with No Limit Records, where he recorded his next three albums. Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). Snoop then signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records in 2002, where he released Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss.

[[Cataract]]

CATEGORIES: Ophthalmology, Eye, Vision, Aging-associated diseases, Blindness, Disorders of lens

A cataract is a clouding of the lens inside the eye which leads to a decrease in vision. It is the most common cause of blindness and is conventionally treated with surgery. Visual loss occurs because opacification of the lens obstructs light from passing and being focused on to the retina at the back of the eye.[tpl]cite journal |author=Quillen DA |title=Common causes of vision loss in elderly patients |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=99–108 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10414631 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990700ap/99.html[/tpl]
It is most commonly due to biological aging, but there are a wide variety of other causes. Over time, yellow-brown pigment is deposited within the lens and this, together with disruption of the normal architecture of the lens fibers, leads to reduced transmission of light, which in turn leads to visual problems.
Those with cataracts commonly experience difficulty in appreciating colors and changes in contrast, driving, reading, recognizing faces, and coping with glare from bright lights.[tpl]Cite journal  | last1 = Allen | first1 = D. | last2 = Vasavada | first2 = A. | title = Cataract and surgery for cataract. | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7559 | pages = 128–32 |date=Jul 2006 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.333.7559.128 | PMID = 16840470 [/tpl]

The plan to occupy the strategic forks was formed by Virginia Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie with the advice of Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, who Dinwiddie had sent on a mission to warn French commanders in late 1753, and who had made a military assessment of the site.  Captain Trent was in command of the force that was constructing the fort, which was driven off by a force of 1,000 French and Indians led by Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur.  At the time of the appearance of the French and Indians, Trent had been recalled to Wills Creek for a conference and his second-in-command, Lieutenant  John Fraser (frontiersman), was at his own plantation at Turtle Creek on the Mononghela River, leaving Ensign Edward Ward in charge at the time of Fort Prince George's surrender on April 18, 1754.  This was the first real aggression of the war, and led to George Washington's surprise attack at the Battle of Jumonville Glen.
Fraser was later court-martialled for desertion at Williamsburg but was acquitted and later served as Chief of Scouts to General Edward Braddock.
It was the first of five forts that were built to control the strategic "Forks of the Ohio". The French built Fort Duquesne after seizing the site, and the British built Fort Pitt after they captured the site in the 1758 Forbes Expedition.  Mercer's Fort was a temporary British fort built to repel a French counterattack while Fort Pitt was being built.  The last fort in the immediate area of what is now downtown Pittsburgh was named Fort Lafayette and was located further up the Allegheny River.

The charango is a small Andean stringed instrument of the lute family, originated in Quichua and Aymara poblations in post-columbian times, after America met the stringed instruments as they were known in Europe, and surviving in what are today the Andean regions of Bolivia, Peru, north of Chile and the northwest of Argentina, where it is widespread as a popular music instrument.http://www.charango.cl/paginas/encuentros.htm About 66 cm long, the charango was traditionally made with the shell of the back of an armadillo (quirquincho, mulita), but also it can be made of wood which is informed as a better resonance cage than the first one and it's the most common material found today,http://www.charango.cl/paginas/cualidad.htm eventually there can be found charangos for children made of any of these or of calabash.http://jlfeijooi.en.eresmas.com/Familia_de_los_charangos.htm The charango is primarily played in traditional Andean music, but is sometimes used by other Latin American musicians. Many contemporary charangos are now made with different types of wood. It typically has 10 strings in five courses of 2 strings each, but other variations exist.
A charango player is called a charanguista.

[[Anosmia]]

CATEGORIES: Olfactory system, Neurological disorders

Anosmia (pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|ɒ|z|m|i|ə|[/tpl]) is the inability to perceive odor, or in other words a lack of functioning olfaction. Anosmia may be temporary but traumatic anosmia can be permanent. Anosmia is due to an inflammation of the nasal mucosa; blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe. Specifically, according to The Lancet journal, inflammation is due to chronic mucosa changes in the paranasal sinus lining and the middle and superior turbinates. Since anosmia causes inflammatory changes in the nasal passage ways, it is treated by simply reducing the presence of inflammation.Knight, Allan, "Anosmia", The Lancet, August 27, 1988 It can be caused by chronic meningitis and neurosyphilis that would increase intracranial pressure over a long period of time,[tpl]cite news|last=The Lancet|date=January 1943|title=ANOSMIA[/tpl] and in some cases by ciliopathyImpact of Defective Cilia including ciliopathy due to primary ciliary dyskinesia (Kartagener syndrome, Afzelius' syndrome or Siewert's syndrome).[tpl]Cite pmid | 21475513 [/tpl] Many patients may experience unilateral anosmia, often as a result of minor head trauma. This type of anosmia is normally only detected if both of the nostrils are tested separately. Using this method of testing each nostril separately will often show a reduced or even completely absent sense of smell in either one nostril or both, something which is often not revealed if both nostrils are simultaneously tested.Harvey, Peter. "Anosmia". Practical Neurology, 206, p. 65
A related term, hyposmia, refers to a decreased ability to smell, while hyperosmia refers to an increased ability to smell. Some people may be anosmic for one particular odor. This is known as "specific anosmia". The absence of the sense of smell from birth is called Congenital Anosmia.

[[Theory of multiple intelligences]]
CATEGORIES: Curricula, Education reform, Education theory, Psychological theories, Intelligence by type, Life skills

The theory of multiple intelligences is a theory of intelligence that differentiates it into specific (primarily sensory) "modalities", rather than seeing intelligence as dominated by a single general ability. This model was proposed by Howard Gardner in his 1983 book Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences. Gardner articulated seven criteria for a behavior to be considered an intelligence.[tpl]r|Gilman[/tpl] These were that the intelligences showed: potential for brain isolation by brain damage, place in evolutionary history, presence of core operations, susceptibility to encoding (symbolic expression), a distinct developmental progression, the existence of savants, prodigies and other exceptional people, and support from experimental psychology and psychometric findings.
Gardner chose eight abilities that he held to meet these criteria:Slavin, Robert (2009) Educational Psychology, p. 117 ISBN 0-205-59200-7 musical–rhythmic, visual–spatial, verbal–linguistic, logical–mathematical, bodily–kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic. He later suggested  that existential and moral intelligence may also be worthy of inclusion.[tpl]r|Smith[/tpl]  Although the distinction between intelligences has been set out in great detail, Gardner opposes the idea of labeling learners to a specific intelligence.  Each individual possesses a unique blend of all the intelligences.  Gardner firmly maintains that his theory of multiple intelligences should "empower learners", not restrict them to one modality of learning.McKenzie, W. (2005). Multiple intelligences and instructional technology. ISTE (International Society for Technology Education). ISBN 156484188X
Gardner argues intelligence is categorized into three primary or overarching categories, those of which are formulated by the abilities.  According to Gardner, intelligence is:
1) The ability to create an effective product or offer a service that is valued in a culture, 2) a set of skills that make it possible for a person to solve problems in life, and 3) the potential for finding or creating solutions for problems, which involves gathering new knowledge.[tpl]cite book|last=Gardner|first=Howard|title=Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences for the 21st Century|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books Inc|isbn=978-0-465-02611-1[/tpl]

Eva Marie Cassidy (February 2, 1963 – November 2, 1996) was an American vocalist and guitarist known for her interpretations of jazz, blues, folk, gospel, country, rock and pop classics. In 1992, she released her first album, The Other Side, a set of duets with go-go musician Chuck Brown, followed by the 1996 live solo album entitled Live at Blues Alley. Although she had been honored by the Washington Area Music Association, she was virtually unknown outside her native Washington DC, when she died of melanoma in 1996.
Four years later, Cassidy's music was brought to the attention of British audiences when her versions of "Fields of Gold" and "Over the Rainbow" were played by Mike Harding and Terry Wogan on BBC Radio 2. Following the overwhelming response, a camcorder recording of "Over the Rainbow", taken at Blues Alley in Washington by her friend Bryan McCulley, was shown on BBC Two's Top of the Pops 2. Shortly afterwards, the compilation album Songbird climbed to the top of the UK Albums Charts, almost three years after its initial release. The chart success in the United Kingdom and Ireland led to increased recognition worldwide; her posthumously released recordings, including three UK number 1 records, have sold more than ten million copies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/127691-blix-street-records-celebrates-10th-anniversary-of-eva-cassidys-songbird.html|title=Blix Stree Records Celebrates 10th Anniversary of Eva Cassidy's  'Songbird' CD Reaching number 1 on U.K. Music Chart with Gold Certification of New 'Simply Eva' Acoustic CD|publisher=AltSounds|accessdate=March 23, 2011[/tpl] Her music has also charted top 10 positions in Australia, Germany, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland.

Orders for the freeway were granted in 1960, followed by planning stages. Construction, amid enormous community protest, was begun in the late 1980s, although the road did not open until December 12, 1997.

The Château d'Ussé is located in the commune of Rigny-Ussé in the Indre-et-Loire département, in France. The stronghold at the edge of the Chinon forest overlooking the Indre Valley was first fortified in the eleventh century by the Norman seigneur of Ussé, Gueldin de Saumur, who surrounded the fort with a palisade on a high terrace.  The site passed to the Comte de Blois, who rebuilt in stone.
In the fifteenth century, the ruined castle of Ussé was purchased by Jean V de Bueil, a captain-general of Charles VII who became seigneur of Ussé in 1431 and began rebuilding it in the 1440s; his son Antoine de Bueil married in 1462 Jeanne de Valois, the biological daughter of Charles VII and Agnès Sorel, who brought as dowry 40000 golden écus. Antoine was heavily in debt and in 1455, sold the château to Jacques d’Espinay, son of a chamberlain to the Duke of Brittany and himself chamberlain to the king; Espinay built the chapel, completed by his son Charles in 1612, in which the Flamboyant Gothic style is mixed with new Renaissance motifs, and began the process of rebuilding the fifteenth-century château that resulted in the sixteenth-seventeenth century aspect of the structure to be seen today. 
In the seventeenth century Louis I de Valentinay, comptroller of the royal household, demolished the north range of buildings in order to open the interior court to the spectacular view over the parterre terrace, to a design ascribed to André Le Nôtre. Valentinay's son-in-law was the military engineer Vauban, who visited Ussé on numerous occasions. The tradition maintained at Ussé is that this was the castle Charles Perrault had in mind when writing "The Sleeping Beauty"[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] . Later Ussé passed to the Rohan. In 1802 Ussé was purchased by the duc de Duras; as early as March 1813, low-key meetings were held at Ussé among a group of Bourbon loyalists, who met to sound out the possibilities of a Bourbon Restoration: such men as Trémouille,  duc de Fitzjames, the prince de Polignac, Ferrand, Montmorency and the duc de  Rochefoucault attended.A. de Beauchamps, Histoire des campagnes de 1814-1815 (Paris, 1817), vol. II:44, noted in E. J. Knapton, "Some Aspects of the Bourbon Restoration of 1814" The Journal of Modern History 6.4 (December 1934:405-424) p. 408 note 13. Here later François-René de Chateaubriand worked on his Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe as the guest of duchesse Claire de Duras. 
In 1885 the comtesse de la Rochejaquelein bequeathed Ussé to her great-nephew, the comte de Blacas.  Today the château belongs to his descendent Casimir de Blacas d' Aulps the 7th Duke of Blacas.

[[Dievturība]]

CATEGORIES: Latvian mythology, Religious organizations established in 1925, Baltic Neopaganism

Dievturība is a Neopagan religious movement, which claims to be a modern revival of the folk religion of the Latvians before Christianization in the 13th century. Adherents call themselves Dievturi (singular: Dievturis), literally "Dievs keepers", "people who live in harmony with Dievs".
The Dievturi movement was founded in 1925 by Ernests Brastiņš. It was forcibly suppressed by Russian Communists in 1940, but later was revived. Approximately 650 persons are officially active members of Dievturi movement.Reliģisko lietu pārvaldes 2007. gada pārskats http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/documents/parskati/2007/RLP_gada_parskats_2007.doc

[[Analogy of the Sun]]

CATEGORIES: Analogy, Concepts in epistemology, Concepts in metaphysics, Platonism, Philosophical arguments, Metaphors referring to places

The Analogy of the Sun (or Simile of the Sun or Metaphor of the Sun) is found in The Republic VI (507b–509c), and was written by the Greek philosopher Plato as a dialogue between Glaucon (Plato's elder brother) and Socrates  (narrated by the latter). Upon being urged to explain the idea of goodness, a cautious Socrates doubts his ability to do so. Instead he offers to talk about its ‘offspring’ (506e). Socrates reveals this ‘offspring’ to be the sun, proposing that just as the sun illumines the visible with light so the idea of goodness illumines the intelligible with truth. While the analogy sets forth both epistemological and ontological theories, it is debated whether these are most authentic to the teaching of Socrates or its later interpretations by Plato. "The Sun consists of an extended analogy between the visible and intelligible realms: just as the sun is the source of light and growth,and is responsible for sight and seeing, and is the acme of the visible realm, so goodness is the source of truth and reality,..." (Classics of Philosophy 169). The Sun is according to Plato the God that can bring us to the absolute truth through light and the eye. The Sun is an analogy about how the truth illuminates and makes us understand it. 
Socrates says that the sense of sight is unusual. He argues that for the other senses to be used all that is needed is the sense itself and that which can be sensed by it. (e.g., to taste sweetness, one needs the sense of taste and that which can be tasted as sweet) The sense of sight, however, needs something additional, namely light, in order to see that which is visible. Both the sense of sight is able to see and that which is visible can be seen when light is present but of course not when absent. Socrates asserts “Then with no slight idea have the sense and the power of being seen been united by a more precious bond than the other pairs!—unless light is quite without worth.” (507e-508a)
Having made these claims, Socrates asks Glaucon, “…which of the gods in heaven can you put down as cause and master of this, whose light makes our sight see so beautifully and the things to be seen?” (508a)  Glaucon responds that both he and all others would answer that this is the sun. Analogously, Socrates says, as the sun illuminates the visible with light so the idea of goodness illuminates the intelligible with truth. Also, as the eye’s ability to see is made possible by the light of the sun so the soul’s ability to know is made possible by the truth of goodness.
 Understand then, that it is the same with the soul, thus: when it settles itself firmly in that region in which truth and real being brightly shine, it understands and knows it and appears to have reason; but when it has nothing to rest on but that which is mingled with darkness—that which becomes and perishes, it opines, it grows dim-sighted, changing opinions up and down, and is like something without reason. ('The Republic, VI - 508d; trans. W.H.D. Rouse) 
The allusion to "…that which becomes and perishes…" relates to all of that which is perceived by the bodily senses. The bodily senses make it clear that all visible things are subject to change, which Socrates categorizes into either the change of becoming or the change of perishing. Socrates argues that the bodily senses can only bring us to opinions, conveying an underlying assumption that true knowledge is of that which is not subject to change.
Instead, Socrates continues, knowledge is to be found in  "… that region in which truth and real being brightly shine…" (508d) This is the intelligible illuminated by the highest idea, that of goodness.  Since truth and being find their source in this highest idea, only the souls that are illumined by this source can be said to possess knowledge, whereas those souls which turn away are "…mingled with darkness…".  This subject is later vividly illustrated in the Allegory of the Cave (514a-520a), where prisoners bound in a dark cave since childhood are examples of these souls turned away from illumination.
Socrates further asserts that as the sun provides generation, growth and nurture to all that is visible, so the idea of goodness provides knowledge and truth to all that is knowable:
Incidentally, the metaphor of the sun exemplifies a traditional interrelation between metaphysics and epistemology: interpretations of fundamental existence create — and are created by — ways of knowing. It also neatly sums up two views for which Plato is recognized: his rationalism and his realism (about universals).
Socrates, using the Simile of the Sun as a foundation, continues with the Metaphor of the Line (509d-513e) after which follows the Allegory of the Cave (514a-520a).

Pueraria montana is a species of plant in the botanical family Fabaceae. At least three sub-species (alternatively called varieties) are known. It is closely related to other species in the genus Pueraria (P. edulis and P. phaseoloides) and the common name kudzu is used for all of these species and hybrids between them. The morphological differences between them are subtle, they can breed with each other, and it appears that introduced kudzu populations in the United States have ancestry from more than one of the species.[tpl]citation | title = Characterizing Specimens of Kudzu and Related Taxa with RAPD's | author = D.

Centaurea ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛ|n|t|ɔː|ˈ|r|iː|ə[/tpl])Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 is a genus of between 350 and 600 species of herbaceous thistle-like flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Members of the genus are found only north of the equator, mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere; the Middle East and surrounding regions are particularly species-rich. Common names for this genus are centaury, centory, starthistles, knapweeds, centaureas and the more ambiguous "bluets"; a vernacular name used for these plants in parts of England is "loggerheads" (common knapweed). The Plectocephalus group – possibly a distinct genus – is known as basketflowers. "Cornflowers" is used for a few species, but that term more often specifically means C. cyanus (sometimes also called "Basket Flower"). The common name "centaury" is sometimes used, although this also refers to the unrelated plant genus Centaurium.Keil (2006), Keil & Ochsmann (2006)

Flushing Meadows (1965) is an American short film by Larry Jordan, with director Joseph Cornell. The film is 8 minutes long, in color, 16mm, and silent.
The film is an ode to the memory of Joyce Hunter, a Queens waitress Cornell met in 1962.  Cornell apparently had an infatuation with Hunter even though she was found to have stolen items and attempted to fence them.  Cornell never pressed charges against Hunter and she was murdered in December 1964.
The film was produced after Hunter's death and is largely a series of scenes from Flushing Cemetery where Hunter was buried.New York Times (December 21, 2003)
The film was first shown publicly at the Gramercy Theatre in New York on December 22, 2003. The short aired twice at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival, in commemoration of the centennial of Cornell's birth.

Garret Augustus Hobart (June 3, 1844 – November 21, 1899) was the 24th Vice President of the United States (1897–1899), serving under President William McKinley.  He was the sixth American vice president to die in office.
Hobart was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, on the Jersey Shore, and grew up in nearby Marlboro.  After attending Rutgers College, Hobart read law with prominent Paterson attorney Socrates Tuttle.  Hobart both studied with Tuttle, and married his daughter.  Although he rarely set foot in a courtroom, Hobart became wealthy as a corporate lawyer.
Hobart served in local governmental positions, and then successfully ran for office as a Republican, serving in both the New Jersey General Assembly and the New Jersey Senate.  He became Speaker of the first, and president of the latter.  Hobart was a longtime party official, and New Jersey delegates went to the 1896 Republican National Convention determined to nominate the popular lawyer for vice president.  Hobart's political views were similar to those of McKinley, who was the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. With New Jersey a key state in the upcoming election, McKinley and his close adviser, future senator Mark Hanna, decided to have the convention select Hobart.  The vice-presidential candidate emulated his running mate with a front porch campaign, though spending much time at the campaign's New York City office.  McKinley and Hobart were elected.
As vice president, Hobart proved a popular figure in Washington and was a close adviser to McKinley.  Hobart's tact and good humor were valuable to the President, as in mid-1899 when Secretary of War Russell Alger failed to understand that McKinley wanted him to leave office.  Hobart invited Alger to his New Jersey summer home, and broke the news to the secretary, who submitted his resignation to McKinley on his return to Washington.  Hobart died in November 1899 of heart disease at age 55; his place on the Republican ticket in 1900 was taken by New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt.

[[Glycosidic bond]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical bonding, Glycosides, Carbohydrates, Carbohydrate chemistry

In chemistry, a glycosidic bond is a type of covalent bond that joins a carbohydrate (sugar) molecule to another group, which may or may not be another carbohydrate.
A glycosidic bond is formed between the hemiacetal group of a saccharide (or a molecule derived from a saccharide) and the hydroxyl group of some organic compound such as an alcohol. If the group attached to the carbohydrate residue is not another saccharide it is referred to as an aglycone. If it is another saccharide, the resulting units can be termed as being at the reducing end or the terminal end of the structure. This is a relative nomenclature where the reducing end of the di- or polysaccharide is towards the last anomeric carbon of the structure, and the terminal end is in the opposite direction.
In the literature, the bond between an amino group or other nitrogen-containing group and the sugar is often referred to as a glycosidic bond (although IUPAC seems to suggest that the term is a misnomer). For example, the sugar-base bond in a nucleoside may be referred to as a glycosidic bond.[tpl]cite journal | doi=10.1093/nar/1.6.803 | author=Andre A and Guschlbauer W.| year=1974 | journal=Nucleic Acids Res.| pages=803–7 | issue=6 |volume=1 | title=Nucleoside conformations. 15.

[[Nucleobase]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleobases, DNA, RNA

Nucleobases are nitrogen-containing biological compounds (nitrogenous bases) found within nucleotides—the basic building blocks of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Nucleobases are also found in nucleosides (a nucleobase linked to a sugar). Often simply called bases in genetics, their ability to form base-pairs and to stack upon one another lead directly to the helical structure of DNA and RNA.
Use of the word base is historical, in reference to the chemical properties of nucleobases in acid-base reactions within the test tube, and is not especially relevant or important for understanding most of their biological functions.
The primary nucleobases are cytosine (DNA and RNA), guanine (DNA and RNA), adenine (DNA and RNA), thymine (DNA) and uracil (RNA), abbreviated as C, G, A, T, and U, respectively. Because A, G, C, and T appear in the DNA, these molecules are called DNA-bases; A, G, C, and U are called RNA-bases.
Uracil replaces thymine in RNA. These two bases are identical except that uracil lacks the 5' methyl group. Adenine and guanine belong to the double-ringed class of molecules called purines (abbreviated as R). Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are all pyrimidines (abbreviated as Y).
In normal spiral DNA the bases form pairs between the two strands: A with T and C with G. Purines pair with pyrimidines mainly for dimensional reasons - only this combination fits the constant width geometry of the DNA spiral. The A-T and C-G pairings are required to match the hydrogen bonds between the amine and carbonyl groups on the complementary bases.
The compound formed when a nucleobase forms a glycosidic bond with the 1' anomeric carbon of a ribose or deoxyribose is called a nucleoside, and a nucleoside with one or more phosphate groups attached at the 5' carbon is called a nucleotide.
Apart from adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) and uracil (U), DNA and RNA also contain bases that have been modified after the nucleic acid chain has been formed. In DNA, the most common modified base is 5-methylcytosine (m5C). In RNA, there are many modified bases, including those contained in the nucleosides pseudouridine (Ψ), dihydrouridine (D), inosine (I), and 7-methylguanosine (m7G).BIOL2060: Translation"Role of 5' mRNA and 5' U snRNA cap structures in regulation of gene expression" - Research - Retrieved 13 December 2010.
Hypoxanthine and xanthine are two of the many bases created through mutagen presence, both of them through deamination (replacement of the amine-group with a carbonyl-group). Hypoxanthine is produced from adenine, xanthine from guanine.T Nguyen, D Brunson, C L Crespi, B W Penman, J S Wishnok, and S R Tannenbaum, DNA damage and mutation in human cells exposed to nitric oxide in vitro, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 April 1; 89(7): 3030–3034 In similar manner, deamination of cytosine results in uracil.
In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting nucleobases (such as adenine, guanine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, purine, 2,6-diaminopurine, and 6,8-diaminopurine) may have been formed in outer space.[tpl]cite web |last1=Callahan |last2=Smith |first2=K.E. |last3=Cleaves |first3=H.J. |last4=Ruzica |first4=J. |last5=Stern |first5=J.C. |last6=Glavin |first6=D.P. |last7=House |first7=C.H. |last8=Dworkin |first8=J.P. |date=11 August 2011 |title=Carbonaceous meteorites contain a wide range of extraterrestrial nucleobases |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/08/10/1106493108 |publisher=PNAS |doi=10.1073/pnas.1106493108 |accessdate=2011-08-15 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Steigerwald |first=John |title=NASA Researchers: DNA Building Blocks Can Be Made in Space |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/dna-meteorites.html |publisher=NASA |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-10 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=ScienceDaily Staff |title=DNA Building Blocks Can Be Made in Space, NASA Evidence Suggests |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110808220659.htm |date=9 August 2011 |publisher=ScienceDaily |accessdate=2011-08-09[/tpl]

[[Splash damage]]
CATEGORIES: Competitive video gaming, Video game gameplay, Video game terminology

Splash damage, also known as radius damage, is a term used in several types of video games, most notably in first-person shooter and real-time strategy video games, to refer to damage taken by players or objects in the area surrounding a point of weapon impact. Splash damage is most commonly dealt by explosive weapons such as grenades or rockets, or magic damage from the casting of spells in fantasy games.
Splash damage weapons are effective against a group of enemies: dealing splash damage is easier than damaging all of them directly. They are also useful against moving targets at medium range—experienced players often fire at the ground near the opponent's feet, ensuring that the target is hurt even if the munition does not score a direct hit. A player using splash-damage weapons up close may take damage from his or her own shots (depending on the game being played). Damage usually decreases based on distance from the point of impact, and splash damage attacks generally do less direct damage than direct attacks.
In strategy games, a melee splash damage attack means that units around the target will also be damaged (this is known often as trample damage as it is often used by quadrupeds); while a ranged splash damage attack implies the attack will deal damage over an area surrounding the point of impact. This will or will not damage allied units, depending on the game played. The term is also used in table-top role-playing games and wargames.
Splash damage is distinguished from area of effect damage in that typically splash damage deals increased damage to the target at the center of impact and decreased damage (splash damage) to all players/units caught in the radius of the blast whereas AoE damage is usually distributed equally across the area of effect. In addition, in many RPGs and MMORPGs, spells dealing splash damage must be centered around a target, whereas area of effect spells may be used anywhere. These distinctions are not universal, though in most MMORPGs, the term area of effect (AoE or AE) is far more commonly used.

[[Acetal]]
CATEGORIES: Acetals, Functional groups, Protecting groups

An acetal is a functional group with the following connectivity R2C(OR')2, where both R' groups are organic fragments.  The central carbon atom has four bonds to it, and is therefore saturated and has tetrahedral geometry. The two R'O groups may be equivalent to each other or not. The two R groups can be equivalent to each other (a "symmetric acetal") or not (a "mixed acetal"), and one or both can even be hydrogen atoms rather than organic fragments. Acetals are formed from and convertible to carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones R2C=O). The term ketal is sometimes used to identify structures associated with ketones rather than aldehydes, and historically, the term acetal was used specifically for the aldehyde cases.[tpl]GoldBookRef|title=ketals|file=K03376[/tpl] Cellulose is a ubiquitous example of an acetal.
Formation of an acetal occurs when the hydroxyl group of a hemiacetal becomes protonated and is lost as water. The carbocation ion that is produced is then rapidly attacked by a molecule of alcohol. Loss of the proton from the attached alcohol gives the acetal.
Acetals are stable compared to hemiacetals but their formation is a reversible equilibrium as with esters. As a reaction to create an acetal proceeds, water must be removed from the reaction mixture, for example, with a Dean-Stark apparatus, lest it will hydrolyse the product back to the hemiacetal. The formation of acetals reduces the total number of molecules present and therefore is not favourable with regards to entropy. A way to improve this is to use an orthoester as a source of alcohol. Aldehydes and ketones undergo a process called acetal exchange with orthoesters to give acetals. Water produced along with the acetal product is used up in hydrolysing the orthoester and producing more alcohol to be used in the reaction.
Most glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates and other polysaccharides are acetal linkages.[tpl]GoldBookRef|title=glycosides|file=G02661[/tpl] Acetaldehyde diethyl acetal is an important flavouring compound in distilled beverages.Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages, ISBN 0-8247-8390-5, http://books.google.com/books?id=_OvXjhLUz-oC, p.554
The plastic known as acetal is a polyacetal of formaldehyde.
Acetals are used as protecting groups for carbonyl groups in organic synthesis as they are stable with respect to hydrolysis by bases and with respect to many oxidizing and reducing agents. They can either protect the carbonyl in a molecule (by temporarily reacting it with an alcohol) or a diol (by temporarily reacting it with a carbonyl). That is, either the carbonyl, or the alcohols, or both could be part of the molecule whose reactivity is to be controlled.
Various specific carbonyl compounds have special names for their acetal forms. For example, an acetal formed from formaldehyde is sometimes called a "formal"Morrison. Robert. T, and Boyd. Robert. N, "Organic Chemistry (6th ed)". p683. Prentice-Hall Inc (1992). or the methylenedioxy group. The acetal formed from acetone is sometimes called an acetonide.

Nucleosides are glycosylamines that can be thought of as nucleotides without a phosphate group. A nucleotide is composed of a nucleobase (also termed a nitrogenous base), a five-carbon sugar (either ribose or deoxyribose), and one or more phosphate groups while a nucleoside consists simply of a nucleobase and a 5-carbon sugar. In a nucleoside, the base is bound to either ribose or deoxyribose via a beta-glycosidic linkage. Examples of nucleosides include cytidine, uridine, adenosine, guanosine, thymidine and inosine.

A jurist by background, he was notable as one of the most enterprising governors in the War of 1812. To help organize the state militia, he often invested his own capital when the legislature would not approve the necessary funds. After the war, he failed to recover these massive loans, despite endless litigation, which took a toll on his health, and induced the alcoholism that affected his performance as Vice President.

Paris–Brest–Paris (PBP) was originally a 1200km bicycle race from Paris to Brest and back to Paris. It is one of the oldest bicycling events still regularly run (the oldest being the Catford CC Hill Climb). The last time it was run as a race was 1951.
In 1931 amateur cyclists were separated from professionals. There are two independent long distance bicycle tours. One is the brevet (also called randonnée), in which cyclists ride individually. The goal is to make it within 90 hours, but with no competition. This is held every four years. The other is an audax where cyclists ride in a group, held every five years. So in 1931 there were three independent cycling events, sharing the same route.
The audax is organised by the Union des Audax Françaises, while the brevet is organised by the Audax Club Parisien.

It is built alongside the Nervion River, which runs through the city of Bilbao to the Cantabrian Sea. The Guggenheim is one of several museums belonging to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. The museum features permanent and visiting exhibits of works by Spanish and international artists.
One of the most admired works of contemporary architecture, the building has been hailed as a "signal moment in the architectural culture", because it represents "one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were all completely united about something."[tpl]cite news|last=Tyrnauer|first=Matt|title=Architecture in the Age of Gehry|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-201008?currentPage=all|accessdate=22 July 2010|newspaper=Vanity Fair (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Vanity Fair|date=30 June 2010[/tpl] The museum was the building most frequently named as one of the  most important works completed since 1980 in the 2010 World Architecture Survey among architecture experts.

Adenosine (ADO) is a purine nucleoside comprising a molecule of adenine attached to a ribose sugar molecule (ribofuranose) moiety via a β-N9-glycosidic bond.
Adenosine plays an important role in biochemical processes, such as energy transfer — as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) — as well as in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter, believed to play a role in promoting sleep and suppressing arousal.
Adenosine also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sato|first=A|author8=Sakuma, I|author9= Gutterman, DD|title=Mechanism of vasodilation to adenosine in coronary arterioles from patients with heart disease|journal=American journal of physiology.

Deoxyadenosine is a deoxyribonucleoside. It is a derivative of the nucleoside adenosine, differing from the latter by the replacement of a hydroxyl group (-OH) by hydrogen (-H) at the 2' position of its ribose sugar moiety. Deoxyadenosine is the DNA nucleoside A, which pairs with deoxythymidine (T) in double-stranded DNA. In absence of adenosine deaminase (ADA) it 
accumulates in T lymphocytes and kills these cells resulting in a genetic disorder known as adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency disease(ADA-SCID).1

Richard Mentor Johnson (October 17, 1780 or 1781[tpl]ref|bdate|a[/tpl] – November 19, 1850) was the ninth Vice President of the United States, serving in the administration of Martin Van Buren (1837–1841). He is the only vice president ever elected by the United States Senate under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment. Johnson also represented Kentucky in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate; he began and ended his political career in the Kentucky House of Representatives.
Johnson was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1806. He became allied with fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay as a member of the War Hawks faction that favored war with Britain in 1812. At the outset of the War of 1812, Johnson was commissioned a colonel in the army. He and his brother James served under William Henry Harrison in Upper Canada. Johnson participated in the Battle of the Thames. Some reported that he personally killed the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, which he later used to his political advantage.
Following the war, Johnson returned to the House of Representatives. The legislature appointed him to the Senate in 1819 to fill the seat vacated by John J. Crittenden. As his prominence grew, his interracial relationship with Julia Chinn, an octoroon slave, was more widely criticized. It worked against his political ambitions. Unlike other upper class leaders who had African American mistresses but never mentioned them, Johnson openly treated Chinn as his common law wife. He acknowledged their two daughters as his children, giving them his surname, much to the consternation of some of his constituents. The relationship is believed to have led to the loss of his Senate seat in 1829, but his Congressional district returned him to the House the following year.
In 1836, Johnson was the Democratic nominee for vice-president on a ticket with Martin Van Buren. Campaigning with the slogan "Rumpsey Dumpsey, Rumpsey Dumpsey, Colonel Johnson killed Tecumseh", Johnson fell just short of the electoral votes needed to secure his election. Virginia's delegation to the Electoral College went against the state's popular vote and refused to endorse Johnson. However, he was elected to the office by the Senate, which was dominated by Democrats.
Johnson proved such a liability for the Democrats in the 1836 election that they refused to renominate him for vice-president in 1840. Van Buren campaigned without a running mate. He lost to William Henry Harrison, a Whig. Johnson tried to return to public office but was defeated. He finally was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1850, but he died on November 19, 1850, just two weeks into his term.

[[Inosine]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleosides, Purines, Antivirals

Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N9-glycosidic bond.
Inosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs.
Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism.  Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including Wegener's granulomatosis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from IMD inhibition.

[[Hypoxanthine]]

CATEGORIES: Purines

Hypoxanthine is a naturally occurring purine derivative. It is occasionally found as a constituent of nucleic acids, where it is present in the anticodon of tRNA in the form of its nucleoside inosine. It has a tautomer known as 6-hydroxypurine. Hypoxanthine is a necessary additive in certain cell, bacteria, and parasite cultures as a substrate and nitrogen source. For example,[tpl]cite web |title=3H-hypoxanthine uptake inhibition assay for drug susceptibility |url=http://www.wwarn.org/learning/procedures/INV07 |publisher=WWARN |accessdate=2012-03-01[/tpl] it is commonly a required reagent in malaria parasite cultures, since Plasmodium falciparum requires a source of hypoxanthine for nucleic acid synthesis and energy metabolism.

Citation on 54.) are songs and compositions by musicians who are not part of the commercial music industry who write music that ignores standard musical or lyrical conventions, either because they have no formal training or because they disagree with conventional rules. This type of music, which often lacks typical structure and is emotionally stark, has few outlets; performers or recordings are often promoted by word of mouth or through fan chat sites, usually among communities of music collectors and music connoisseurs. Outsider musicians usually have much "greater individual control over the final creative" product either because of a low budget or because of their "inability or unwillingness to cooperate" with modifications by a record label or producer."Time and Curiosity: Journey to the Outside"
Very few outsider musicians ever attain anything resembling mainstream popularity; the few that do generally are considered novelty acts. This notwithstanding, there is a niche market for outsider music, and such musicians often maintain a cult following.

Queen Of the Highway is an audio portrait of punk photographer Mark Morrisroe whom Morel befriended.  The autobiographical and introspective lyrics helped to earn the album its critical praise.  Included on the record are some of his past club hits: "True (The Faggot Is You)," "Funny Car (Love Is Dead)" and "Cabaret."  Technically, the album is released by a band also called Morel, fronted by Richard.
Also in 2002, he began running a monthly dance event in Washington, DC with friend and veteran punk/alternative/indie icon Bob Mould, titled Blowoff.  The Blowoff dance event was so popular that it spurred Blowoff events in other cities such as New York City, Chicago, and San Diego. Blowoff is also the name of an electronic duo that Morel and Mould have been recording an album under.
After several more club hits and remixes, Morel returned with a second album, Lucky Strike, in 2004.  Again praised by critics, the follow-up was an extension of sounds and lyrical content of his first.  Included here are his club hits "If You Love Me," "Under a Disco" and "Escape (Driving To Heaven)," a collaboration with producer 16B.
In 2005, Morel became part of Bob Mould's new touring unit (along with another notable DC musician, Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty), formed to support the release of Mould's Body of Song album.   Morel also contributed remixes of the track "(Shine Your) Light Love Hope" to the bonus disc included in the limited edition version of the album.
Morel co-produced and co-wrote several songs with Cyndi Lauper for her 2008 album Bring Ya to the Brink including the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play No. 1 single "Same Ol' Story".
In 2010, Richard Morel produced Amanda Lear's new EP I'm Coming Up.

Ultima Online (UO) is a graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), released on 24 September 1997, by Origin Systems. It was instrumental to the development of the genre, and is still running today. The game is played online, in a fantasy setting similar to that of the other Ultima games that preceded it.
The success of Ultima Online opened the door for the creation of many new massively multiplayer games. Ultima Online is a fantasy role-playing game set in the Ultima universe. It is online-only and played by thousands of simultaneous users (who pay a monthly fee) on various game servers, also known as shards. It is known for its extensive player versus player combat system. To maintain order in the online community, there are Game Masters who resolve player disputes, police the shard for terms of service violations, and correct glitches in the game.
Since its release, it has added eight expansion packs, a booster pack, and dozens of free content updates. The release of Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn in 2007 brought a new game engine with a newer visual experience.
Ultima Online was "The first MMORPG to reach the 100,000 subscriber base, far exceeding that of any game that went before it".[tpl]cite web |title=EA Announces Ultima Online(TM): Kingdom Reborn (Working Title); The Game That Firmly Established the MMORPG Genre Receives a Massive Visual Overhaul and New Content in 2007 |url=http://investor.ea.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=314331 |publisher=Electronic Arts |accessdate=3 May 2011 |date=24 August 2006[/tpl] Since Ultima Online[tpl]-'[/tpl]s prime in 2003, the overall subscriber base has seen a steady decline.

As of April 2008, Ultima Online held a market share below 0.6% of the massively multiplayer online game subscriptions.
It was announced on 6 February 2014 that development of the game would be transferred from Mythic to a newly made studio (Broadsword) which will take over all future development of the game.http://www.uo.com/article/Producer-Letter-0

CATEGORIES: Sexual orientation and society, LGBT culture, Types of communities

The LGBT community or GLBT community, commonly referred to as the gay community, is a loosely defined grouping of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) and LGBT-supportive people, organizations, and subcultures, united by a common culture and civil rights movements. These communities generally celebrate pride, diversity, individuality, and sexuality. LGBT activists and sociologists see LGBT community-building as an antidote to heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, sexualism, and conformist pressures thought to exist in the larger society.  The term gay pride is used to express the LGBT community's identity and collective strength; gay pride parades provide both a prime example of the use and a demonstration of the general meaning of the term. The LGBT community is diverse in political affiliation.  Not all LGBT individuals consider themselves part of an LGBT community.
Groups that may be considered part of the LGBT community include gay villages, LGBT rights organizations, LGBT employee groups at companies, LGBT student groups in schools and universities, and LGBT-affirming religious groups.
LGBT communities may organize themselves into, or support, civil rights movements promoting LGBT rights in various places around the world.

William Rufus DeVane King (April 7, 1786 – April 18, 1853) was an American politician and diplomat.  He was the 13th Vice President of the United States for almost four weeks in 1853 before his death.  Earlier he had been elected as a U.S. Representative from North Carolina and a Senator from Alabama. He also served as Minister to France.
A Democrat, he was a Unionist and his contemporaries considered him to be a moderate on the issues of sectionalism, slavery, and westward expansion that contributed to the American Civil War. He helped draft the Compromise of 1850.[tpl]cite journal |year=2003 |author=Daniel Fate Brooks |title=The Faces of William R.

King died of tuberculosis after 25 days in office. With the exceptions of John Tyler and Andrew Johnson—both of whom succeeded to the Presidency—he is the shortest-serving Vice President.
King was the only Vice President from Alabama and, as such, held the highest political office of any Alabamian in American history. He was the third vice-president to die in office, and actually inaugurated on March 24, 1853, due to contracting tuberculosis a while before his election as vice-president. Though no proof can be provided, there are rumors that King had a homosexual relationship with James Buchanan, who became president almost four years after his death.

John Cabell Breckinridge (January 16, 1821 – May 17, 1875) was a lawyer and politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky. He represented the state in both houses of Congress and in 1857, became the 14th and youngest-ever Vice President of the United States (1857–1861). Serving in the U.S. Senate at the outbreak of the Civil War, he was expelled after joining the Confederate Army. He remains the only Senator of the United States convicted of treason against the United States of America by the Senate. He was appointed Confederate Secretary of War late in the war. A member of the Breckinridge family, he was the grandson of U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge, son of Kentucky Secretary of State Cabell Breckinridge, and father of Arkansas Congressman Clifton R. Breckinridge.
After non-combat service in the Mexican–American War, Breckinridge was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1849 where he took a states' rights position against legal interference with slavery. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1851. he allied with Stephen A. Douglas in support of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. After reapportionment in 1854 made his re-election unlikely, he declined to run for another term. He was nominated for vice-president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention to balance a ticket headed by Pennsylvanian James Buchanan. The Democrats won the election, but Breckinridge had little influence with Buchanan and, as presiding officer of the Senate, could not express his opinions in that body's debates. In 1859, he was elected to succeed U.S. Senator John J. Crittenden at the end of Crittenden's term in 1861.
After Southern Democrats walked out of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party's northern and southern factions held rival conventions in Baltimore, Maryland that nominated Stephen Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. Breckinridge carried most of the southern states but no northern states and lost the election. Taking his seat in the Senate, he urged compromise to preserve the Union although seven states had already seceded. Unionists took control of the state legislature when Kentucky's neutrality was breached, but Breckinridge fled behind Confederate battle lines where he was commissioned a brigadier general; he was then expelled from the Senate. After the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh, he was promoted to major general, and in October he was assigned to the command of Braxton Bragg. After Bragg charged that Breckinridge's drunkenness had contributed to Confederate defeats at Stone River and Missionary Ridge, he was transferred to the Trans-Allegheny Department, where he won his most significant victory at the Battle of New Market. After participating in Jubal Early's 1864 campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley, he was charged with defending Confederate supplies in Tennessee and Virginia. In February 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him Secretary of War. Concluding that the war was hopeless, he urged Davis to arrange a national surrender. After the fall of the Confederate capital at Richmond, he ensured the preservation of Confederate military and governmental records. He then fled to Cuba, Great Britain, and finally, to Canada. In exile, he toured Europe from August 1866 to June 1868. When President Andrew Johnson extended amnesty to all former Confederates in late 1868, he returned to Kentucky, but resisted all encouragement to resume his political career. Issues from war injuries sapped his health, and after two operations, he died on May 17, 1875.

[[Methylation]]
CATEGORIES: Epigenetics, Organic reactions, Posttranslational modification, Methylation

In the chemical sciences, methylation denotes the addition of a methyl group to a substrate or the substitution of an atom or group by a methyl group. Methylation is a form of alkylation with a methyl group, rather than a larger carbon chain, replacing a hydrogen atom. These terms are commonly used in chemistry, biochemistry, soil science, and the biological sciences.
In biological systems, methylation is catalyzed by enzymes; such methylation can be involved in modification of heavy metals, regulation of gene expression, regulation of protein function, and  RNA processing. Methylation of heavy metals can also occur outside of biological systems. Chemical methylation of tissue samples is also one method for reducing certain histological staining artifacts.

Acetaldehyde (systematic name ethanal) is an organic chemical compound with the formula CH3CHO, sometimes abbreviated by chemists as MeCHO (Me = methyl). It is one of the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants. It is also produced by the partial oxidation of ethanol and may be a contributing factor to hangovers from alcohol consumption, produced in the liver by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. Pathways of exposure include air, water, land, or groundwater, as well as drink and smoke.CHEMICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT: ACETALDEHYDE (CAS NO. 75-07-0) Consumption of disulfiram inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby causing it to build up in the body.

Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) ([tpl]EC number|1.1.1.1[/tpl]) are a group of dehydrogenase enzymes that occur in many organisms and facilitate the interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones with the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ to NADH). In humans and many other animals, they serve to break down alcohols that otherwise are toxic, and they also participate in generation of useful aldehyde, ketone, or alcohol groups during biosynthesis of various metabolites. In yeast, plants, and many bacteria, some alcohol dehydrogenases catalyze the opposite reaction as part of fermentation to ensure a constant supply of NAD+.

[[Quilt]]
CATEGORIES: Quilting, Blankets, Folk art

A quilt is a type of blanket, traditionally composed of three layers of fiber: a woven cloth top, a layer of batting or wadding, and a woven back, combined using the technique of quilting. A quilt is distinguishable from other types of blanket because it is pieced together with several pieces of cloth.  “Quilting” refers to the technique of joining at least two fabric layers by stitches or ties.  In most cases, two fabric layers surround a middle layer of batting (cotton, polyester, silk, wool or combinations of fibers) which is a lighter, insulating layer.  Batting is often referred to as “wadding” in Britain.  Some modern quilts are made with an upper fabric layer, quilted to a layer of microfleece, perhaps without a fabric backing.  The most decorative fabric surface is called the “top”, and is the design focus.  A single piece of fabric (a “wholecloth quilt”) may be used as the top, or the top may be “pieced” from smaller fabric pieces.  Sewing together smaller pieces of fabric into a larger patchwork "block" of fabric creates the basic unit.  The “patchwork” of the top is typically made of a series of blocks (all identical, or of diverse design), which are made sequentially and then assembled.  The blocks may be separated by plain fabric strips, called “sashing”.  The central design space may be small (a “medallion”) or dominate the top of the quilt.  Many tops have decorative "borders", of plainer design, surrounding the central panel of the top and enlarging the quilt.  The "binding" is the final edge of fabric that covers the entire edge, and seals the batting.  Most modern quilts are made of 100% cotton fabric in a light weight. Early quilts were often made of "calico", which is a cotton fabric in a small, repeating print.  “Muslin” is a similar fabric (the name derived from Mosul, where quality cotton fabrics were produced in the Middle Ages), of lower quality on average.  Silk and lightweight wool are also used, but less commonly than in the past.

Adenosine diphosphate, abbreviated ADP, is an important organic compound in metabolism and is essential to the flow of energy in living cells. A molecule of ADP consists of three important structural components: a sugar backbone attached to a molecule of adenine and two phosphate groups bonded to the 5' carbon atom of ribose. The carbon molecules that make up the ring structure of a sugar can be named in a way that more specifically designates the location of the phosphate and adenosine attachments: The sugar backbone of ADP is known as a pentose sugar and consists of five carbon molecules. The two phosphate groups of ADP are added in series to the 5’ carbon of the sugar backbone, while the adenosine molecule attaches to the 1’ carbon.[tpl]cite book |author=Cox, Michael; Nelson, David R.; Lehninger, Albert L |title=Lehninger principles of biochemistry |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7167-7108-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] 
The two phosphates in ADP can be correlated with ATP and AMP. ATP consists of three phosphate groups attached in series to the 5’ carbon location, whereas ADP contains two phosphate groups attached to the 5’ position, and AMP contains only one phosphate group attached at the 5’ position. Energy transfer used by all living things is a result of dephosphorylation of ATP by enzymes known as ATPases. The cleavage of a phosphate group from ATP results in the coupling of energy to metabolic reactions and a by-product, a molecule of ADP.  Being the "molecular unit of currency", ATP is continually being formed from lower-energy molecules of ADP and AMP. The biosynthesis of ATP is achieved throughout processes such as substrate level phosphorylation, oxidative phosphorylation, and photophosphorylation, all of which facilitating the addition of a phosphate group to an ADP molecule.

[[Deamination]]

CATEGORIES: Metabolism, Substitution reactions

Deamination is the removal of an amine group from a molecule. Enzymes that catalyse this reaction are called deaminases.
In the human body, deamination takes place primarily in the liver, however glutamate is also deaminated in the kidneys.  Deamination is the process by which amino acids are broken down if there is an excess of protein intake.  The amino group is removed from the amino acid and converted to ammonia.  The rest of the amino acid is made up of mostly carbon and hydrogen, and is recycled or oxidized for energy.  Ammonia is toxic to the human system, and enzymes convert it to urea or uric acid by addition of carbon dioxide molecules (which is not considered a deamination process) in the urea cycle, which also takes place in the liver.  Urea and uric acid can safely diffuse into the blood and then be excreted in urine.

[[5-Methylcytosine]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleobases, Pyrimidones

5-Methylcytosine is a methylated form of the DNA base cytosine that may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription. When cytosine is methylated, the DNA maintains the same sequence, but the expression of methylated genes can be altered (the study of this is part of the field of epigenetics). 5-Methylcytosine is incorporated in the nucleoside 5-methylcytidine.
In 5-methylcytosine, a methyl group, is attached to the 5th atom in the 6-atom ring (counting counterclockwise from the NH nitrogen at the six o'clock position, not the 2 o'clock). This methyl group distinguishes 5-methylcytosine from cytosine.

[[Gene knockout]]

CATEGORIES: Genetically modified organisms, Molecular biology techniques, Genetics, Molecular genetics, Laboratory techniques, Gene expression, Biotechnology

A gene knockout (abbreviation: KO) is a genetic technique in which one of an organism's genes are made inoperative ("knocked out" of the organism). Also known as knockout organisms or simply knockouts, they are used in learning about a gene that has been sequenced, but which has an unknown or incompletely known function. Researchers draw inferences from the difference between the knockout organism and normal individuals.
The term also refers to the process of creating such an organism, as in "knocking out" a gene. The technique is essentially the opposite of a gene knockin. Knocking out two genes simultaneously in an organism is known as a double knockout (DKO). Similarly the terms triple knockout (TKO) and quadruple knockouts (QKO) are used to describe three or four knocked out genes, respectively.

Upskirt refers to the practice of making unauthorized photographs under a woman's skirt, capturing an image of her crotch area and underwear.

The term is also sometimes used to refer generically to any voyeur photography – i.e. catching an image of somebody unaware in a private moment.
The practice is regarded as a form of sexual fetishism or voyeurism and is similar in nature to downblouse. The ethical and legal issue relating to upskirt and downblouse photography is one of a reasonable expectation of privacy, even in a public place. The victims of the practice are almost exclusively females, including teenage girls. Women feel harassed or humiliated when they realise that they have been a victim of the practice. This is especially the case when such images have already been disseminated on the Internet and they are identifiable.

[[Sophie Germain prime]]

CATEGORIES: Classes of prime numbers

In number theory, a prime number p is a Sophie Germain prime if 2p + 1 is also prime. The number 2p + 1 associated with a Sophie Germain prime is called a safe prime. For example, 29 is a Sophie Germain prime and 2 × 29 + 1 = 59 is its associated safe prime. Sophie Germain primes are named after French mathematician Sophie Germain, who used them in her investigations of Fermat's Last Theorem.Specifically, Germain proved that the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem, in which the exponent divides one of the bases, is true for every Sophie Germain prime, and she used similar arguments to prove the same for all other primes up to 100.

[[Curve]]
CATEGORIES: Curves, Metric geometry, Topology, General topology

In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a line but which is not required to be straight. This entails that a line is a special case of curve, namely a curve with null curvature.[ref]
In current language, a line is typically required to be straight. Historically, however, lines could be "curved" or "straight".
[/ref]
Often curves in two-dimensional (plane curves) or three-dimensional (space curves) Euclidean space are of interest.
Various disciplines within mathematics have given the term different meanings depending on the area of study, so the precise meaning depends on context. However many of these meanings are special instances of the definition which follows. A curve is a topological space which is locally homeomorphic to a line. In everyday language, this means that a curve is a set of points which, near each of its points, looks like a line, up to a deformation.  A simple example of a curve is the parabola, shown to the right. A large number of other curves have been studied in multiple mathematical fields.
The term curve has several meanings in non-mathematical language as well. For example, it can be almost synonymous with mathematical function (as in learning curve), or graph of a function (as in Phillips curve).
An arc or segment of a curve is a part of a curve that is bounded by two distinct end points and contains every point on the curve between its end points.  Depending on how the arc is defined, either of the two end points may or may not be part of it. When the arc is straight, it is typically called a line segment.

[[Greedy algorithm]]

A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage[tpl]cite web|last=Black|first=Paul E.|title=greedy algorithm|url=http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads//HTML/greedyalgo.html|work=Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures|publisher=U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) |accessdate=17 August 2012|date=2 February 2005[/tpl] with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.
For example, a greedy strategy for the traveling salesman problem (which is of a high computational complexity) is the following heuristic: "At each stage visit an unvisited city nearest to the current city". This heuristic need not find a best solution but terminates in a reasonable number of steps; finding an optimal solution typically requires unreasonably many steps. In mathematical optimization, greedy algorithms solve combinatorial problems  having the properties of matroids.

Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy.

CATEGORIES: Agama (genus), Reptiles of Africa

An agama is any one of the various small, long-tailed, insect-eating lizards of the genus Agama. The agamid genus is composed of at least 37 species across Africa, where they are the most common lizard.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] They can be found in many sizes, from 12.5 to 30 cm (5 in. to 1 ft.) in length and a wide variety of colours. One of the best known species is the Agama agama, widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. For Eurasian agamas, see the genus Laudakia.
Agamas originally lived in forest and bush across Africa, but have since adapted to live in villages and compounds where their habitat has been cleared. They live inside the thatch of huts and other small spaces, emerging only to feed. If caught out in the open, agamas are able to run quickly on their hind legs to reach shelter. The desert agama can still be found in the dry areas of North Africa. Despite their name, they avoid bare sand.[tpl]cite book|title=The Funk & Wagnalls Wildlife Encyclopedia|author=Burton, Maurice and Burton, Robert|year=1974|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|volume=1|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=20316938[/tpl]
Agamas are active during the day and are often found scampering around to snatch up their favorite foods. They can tolerate greater temperatures than most reptiles, but in the afternoon when temperatures reach around 38°C (100°F) they will settle into the shade and wait for it to cool. Frequent fighting breaks out between males; such fighting involves a lot of bobbing and weaving in an attempt to scare the opponent. If it comes to blows, they lash out with their tails and threaten each other with open jaws. Many older males have broken tails as a result of such fights. Females may sometimes chase and fight one another, while hatchlings mimic the adults in preparation for their future.
Agamas are mainly insectivores. Their incisor-like front teeth are designed for quick cutting and chewing of their prey. They may also eat grass, berries, seeds and even the eggs of smaller lizards.
Most agamas are polygamous. Males may hold six or more females in their territory for breeding. During courtship, the male bobs his head to impress the female. Occasionally, females initiate courtship by offering their hindquarters to the male and then running until he is able to catch up. The breeding season is typically March–May with eggs being laid in June–September during the season after the rains. Eggs are laid in clutches of up to 12.

The 777 ranks as one of Boeing's best-selling models. Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300, upcoming Airbus A350 XWB, and the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The 787 Dreamliner, which entered service in 2011, shares design features with the 777. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8X and 777-9X models, collectively named 777X, featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787.

[[Gravis PC GamePad]]

CATEGORIES: Video game controllers

The Gravis PC GamePad is a game port game controller produced by Advanced Gravis Computer Technology. It was the first gamepad for the IBM PC compatible in a market then dominated by joysticks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] Included with the gamepad was a shareware Commander Keen game, episode 1, Marooned on Mars, which was later replaced with the shareware episode 4, Secret of the Oracle which supported all 4 buttons. The gamepad is no longer manufactured, as the Gravis company has ceased to exist.
The gamepad's design is similar to that of the stock SNES controller (more so the Japanese and European version with colored buttons), although it lacks the Start, Select and shoulder buttons, and the shape of the controller's chassis differs slightly, with an inverted curve on the left side. As originally found in some versions of the Sega Master System controller, the center of the Gravis GamePad's d-pad allows a small joystick to be inserted. The resulting lever action provides increased directional sensitivity, desirable in fighting games for example.
Both at the top and bottom of the gamepad are switches. One of them removes the normal functionality from 2 of the buttons, and turns them into autofire variants of the first 2. This gave all four buttons functionality even in PC games that only supported two buttons on joysticks or for scenarios when two gamepads are connected with a Y-splitter. The other allows for left-handed operation by turning the workings of the D-pad and buttons upside down. Both switches can be used at the same time.

Sprinting is the act of running over a short distance at (or near) top speed. It is used in many sports that incorporate running, typically as a way of quickly reaching a target or goal, or avoiding or catching an opponent. Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than 30–35 seconds due to the accumulation of lactic acid in muscles.
In athletics and track and field, sprints (or dashes) are races over short distances. They are among the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event—the stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other.Instone, Stephen (15 November 2009). The Olympics: Ancient versus Modern. BBC. Retrieved on 23 March 2010. There are three sprinting events which are currently held at the Summer Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements which were later altered to metric: the 100 m evolved from the 100 yard dash,100 m – Introduction. IAAF.

Retrieved on 26 March 2010. and the 400 m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.
At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. The set position differs depending on the start. Body alignment is of key importance in producing the optimal amount of force. Ideally the athlete should begin in a 4-point stance and push off using both legs for maximum force production.100 m – For the Expert. IAAF. Retrieved on 26 March 2010.

[tpl]nihongo|Sashiko|刺し子||literally "little stabs"[/tpl] is a form of decorative reinforcement stitching (or functional embroidery) from Japan.  Traditionally used to reinforce points of wear, or to repair worn places or tears with patches, this running stitch technique is often used for purely decorative purposes in quilting and embroidery.  The white cotton thread on the traditional indigo blue cloth gives sashiko its distinctive appearance, though decorative items sometimes use red thread. 
Many Sashiko patterns were derived from Chinese designs, but just as many were developed by the Japanese themselves.   The artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849) published the book New Forms for Design in 1824, and these designs have inspired many Sashiko patterns.

[[Long-distance running]]
CATEGORIES: Long-distance running, Running, Events in athletics (track and field)

Long-distance running, or endurance running, is a form of continuous running over distances of at least five kilometres (3.1 miles). Physiologically, it is largely aerobic in nature and requires stamina.Grine, Frederick E. et al  (October 2006). The First Humans - Origin and Early Evolution of the Genus Homo. Stonybrook University. Retrieved on 2013-04-11.
Among mammals, humans are well adapted for running significant distances, and particularly so among primates. The endurance running hypothesis suggests that running endurance in the Homo genus arose because travelling over large areas improved scavenging opportunities and allowed persistence hunting.Humans hot, sweaty, natural-born runners. Phys.org/Harvard University (2007-04-16). Retrieved on 2013-04-11. The capacity for endurance running is also found in migratory ungulates and a limited number of terrestrial carnivores, such as dogs, wolves and hyenas.ANTHROPOLOGY: ENDURANCE RUNNING AND HUMAN EVOLUTION. Science Week (2004/2005). Retrieved on 2013-04-11.
In modern human society, long-distance running has multiple purposes: people may engage in it for physical exercise, for recreation, as a means of travel, for economic reasons, or for cultural reasons. Long distance running can also be used as a means to improve cardiovascular health.http://www.runnersgoal.com/what-are-the-health-benefits-of-running-half-marathons/ Running improves your aerobic fitness by increasing the activity of enzymes and hormones that stimulate the muscles and the heart to work more efficiently.http://www.medicinenet.com/running/page3.htm#what_are_the_fitness_benefits_of_running Endurance running is often a component of physical military training and has been so historically. Professional running is most commonly found in the field of sports, although in pre-industrial times foot messengers would run to deliver information to distant locations. Long-distance running as a form of tradition or ceremony is known among the Hopi and Tarahumara people, among others.Running in Hopi History and Culture.

In the sport of athletics, long-distance events are defined as races covering three kilometres (1.86 miles) and above. The three most common types are track running, road running and cross country running, all of which are defined by their terrain – all-weather tracks, roads and natural terrain, respectively. Typical long-distance track races range from 3000 metres to 10,000 metres (6.21 miles), cross country races usually cover 5 to 12 km (3.1 to 7.45 miles), while road races can be significantly longer, reaching 100 kilometres (62.14 miles) and beyond. In college cross country races, in the United States, males run an 8000 meter race whereas the women run a 6000 meter race. The Summer Olympics features three long-distance running events: the 5000 metres, 10,000 m and marathon (42.195 kilometres, or 26 miles and 385 yards).

The Château de Brissac is a French château in the commune of Brissac-Quincé, located in the département of Maine-et-Loire, France. The property is owned by the Cossé-Brissac family, whose head bears the French noble title of Duke of Brissac. The château is listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.Ministry of Culture database entry for Château de Brissac
The château was originally built as a castle by the Counts of Anjou in the 11th century. After the victory over the English by King Philip II of France, he gave the property to Guillaume des Roches. In the 15th century, the structure was rebuilt by Pierre de Brézé, a wealthy chief minister to King Charles VII of France. During the reign (1515–47) of King Francis I, the property was acquired by René de Cossé, who was named by the King as governor of Anjou and Maine.Châteaux of the Loire Valley
During the French Wars of Religion, the château was made a possession in 1589 by the Protestant leader, Henry of Navarre. Severely damaged, the fortress was scheduled to be demolished. However, Charles II de Cossé sided with Henry of Navarre, who soon was crowned King of France. In gratitude, King Henry gave him the property, the title Duke of Brissac and the money to rebuild the château in 1611. 
Its construction made it the tallest château in France,Château de Brissac website and its façade reflects the influences of the 17th century’s Baroque architecture. Through marriage, the Cossé-Brissac family also acquired the Château Montreuil-Bellay, but later sold it.
In August of 1620, King Louis XIII and his mother, Marie de Medici, met to discuss their differences in the "neutral" territory of the Château de Brissac.Château de Brissac website A temporary truce between the two was reached, but it did not last long, and the Queen Mother was eventually banished.
The descendants of the first Duke of Brissac maintained the château until 1792, when the property was ransacked during the French Revolution. It lay in waste until a restoration program began in 1844 and was carried on by subsequent Dukes of Brissac.
Today, the Château de Brissac is still owned by the Cossé-Brissac family. The property is currently managed by Charles-André de Cossé-Brissac, Marquis of Brissac (b. 1962), who is the eldest son of François de Cossé-Brissac, the current Duke of Brissac (b. 1929).Châteaux of the Loire Valley
The château has seven storeys altogether, making it the tallest château in the Loire Valley.Château de Brissac website The château is open to the public for tours and overnight stays in its guest rooms, and the luxurious gilded theater hosts the annual Val de Loire festival. It was also used until recently as a location for Brazilian celebrity magazine "Caras".
During the mid 1990s, the château was prominently featured as the temporary stadium for the Iron Chef French Battles, of the original Japanese Iron Chef television show. Two battles were staged at the Château de Brissac and aired in Japan on April 12, 1996. The first battle, with theme ingredient salmon, was between Bernard Leprince and Iron Chef Japanese Koumei Nakamura, and it was won by Leprince. At the time, Leprince was the chef at La Tour d'Argent in Paris. The second battle was between Pierre Gagnaire and Iron Chef French Hiroyuki Sakai, with theme ingredient lobster, and it was won by Gagnaire.

Yes Minister is a satirical British sitcom written by Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn that was first transmitted by BBC Television between 1980 and 1984, split over three seven-episode series. The sequel, Yes, Prime Minister, ran from 1986 to 1988. In total there were 38 episodes, of which all but one lasted half an hour. Several episodes were adapted for BBC Radio, and a stage play was produced in 2010, the latter leading to a new television series on UKTV Gold in 2013.
Set principally in the private office of a British Cabinet minister in the (fictional) Department of Administrative Affairs in Whitehall, Yes Minister follows the ministerial career of The Rt Hon Jim Hacker MP, played by Paul Eddington. His various struggles to formulate and enact legislation or effect departmental changes are opposed by the British Civil Service, in particular his Permanent Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, played by Nigel Hawthorne. His Principal Private Secretary Bernard Woolley, played by Derek Fowlds, is usually caught between the two. The sequel, Yes, Prime Minister, continued with the same cast and followed the events of the premiership of Jim Hacker after his unexpected elevation to Number 10 upon the resignation of the previous PM.
A huge critical and popular success, the series received a number of awards, including several BAFTAs and in 2004 was voted sixth in the Britain's Best Sitcom poll. It was the favourite television programme of the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher.[tpl]Cite book|last=Cockerell |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Cockerell |title= Live From Number 10: The Inside Story of Prime Ministers and Television |year=1988 |publisher= Faber and Faber|location= London|isbn= 0-571-14757-7|page=288[/tpl]

Lace-making is an ancient craft. True lace was not made until the late 15th and early 16th centuries. A true lace is created when a thread is looped, twisted or braided to other threads independently from a backing fabric.
Originally linen, silk, gold, or silver threads were used. Now lace is often made with cotton thread, although linen and silk threads are still available. Manufactured lace may be made of synthetic fiber. A few modern artists make lace with a fine copper or silver wire instead of thread.

Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? is a British sitcom which was broadcast between 9 January 1973 and 9 April 1974 on BBC1. It was the colour sequel to the mid-1960s hit The Likely Lads. It was created and written, as was its predecessor, by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. There were 26 television episodes over two series; and a subsequent 45-minute Christmas special was aired on 24 December 1974.
The cast were reunited in 1975 for a BBC radio adaptation of series 1, transmitted on Radio 4 from July to October that year. In 1976, a feature film spin-off was made. Around the time of its release, however, Rodney Bewes and James Bolam fell out over a misunderstanding involving the press and have not spoken since. This long-suspected situation was finally confirmed by Bewes while promoting his autobiography in 2005. Unlike Bewes, Bolam is consistently reluctant to talk about the show, and has vetoed any attempt to revive his character.[tpl]cite news |first=Andy |last=McSmith |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/look-back-in-anger-whatever-happened-to-the-likely-lads-399297.html |title=Look back in anger: Whatever happened to The Likely Lads? |newspaper=The Independent |date=7 November 2007 |accessdate=18 April 2013 |quote=For years afterwards, it was assumed that Bolam and Bewes were on friends off screen as well as on, a pretence they kept up because their public expected it. It was finally blown in 2005, when the ageing Bewes published his memoirs, in which he revealed that they had comprehensively fallen out 30 years earlier and had not spoken since. He blamed Bolam's fear of having his privacy invaded and of being eternally typecast. The final breach, as Bewes told it, occurred after Bolam's wife, Sue, announced to her husband, while he was driving, that she was pregnant. He almost crashed the car. Bewes repeated this story in a newspaper interview, thinking that it was already public knowledge, then got a frosty reaction when he rang Bolam to forewarn him. "There was this dreadful silence. He put the phone down. I called him back, He didn't answer. He hasn't spoken to me since", Bewes claimed. [/tpl]

[[Piano quintet]]

CATEGORIES: Chamber music, Musical groups by numbers, Piano, Types of musical groups

In classical music, a piano quintet is a work of chamber music written for piano and four other instruments. The genre particularly flourished in the nineteenth century.
Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the instrumentation most frequently consisted of piano, violin, viola, cello, and double bass. Following the phenomenal success of Robert Schumann's Piano Quintet in E-flat major, Op. 44 in 1842, which paired the piano with a string quartet (i.e., two violins, viola, and cello), composers began to adopt Schumann's instrumentation. Among the most frequently performed piano quintets, aside from Schumann's, are those by Franz Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Dmitri Shostakovich.Stowell, Robin.

A cooperative ("coop") or co-operative ("co-op") is an autonomous association of persons who voluntarily cooperate for their mutual social, economic, and cultural benefit.Statement on the Cooperative Identity. International Cooperative Alliance. Cooperatives include non-profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use its services (a consumer cooperative) or by the people who work there (a worker cooperative) or by the people who live there (a housing cooperative), hybrids such as worker cooperatives that are also consumer cooperatives or credit unions, multi-stakeholder cooperatives such as those that bring together civil society and local actors to deliver community needs, and second and third tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives.
The International Co-operative Alliance was the first international association formed by the movement.  It includes the World Council of Credit Unions.  A second organization was formed later in Germany, the International Raiffeisen Union.  In the United States, the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) serves as the sector's oldest national membership association. It is dedicated to ensuring that cooperative businesses have the same opportunities as other businesses operating in the country and that consumers have access to cooperatives in the marketplace.  A U.S. National Cooperative Bank was formed in the 1970s.  By 2004, a new association focused on worker co-ops was founded, the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives.

[[Wiping]]

CATEGORIES: Television terminology, Data management, Television preservation

Wiping, also known as junking is a colloquial term for action taken by radio and television production and broadcasting companies, in which old audiotapes, videotapes, and telerecordings (kinescopes), are erased, reused, or destroyed. Although the practice was once very common, especially in the 60's and 70's, wiping is now practiced much less frequently since associated storage costs have decreased, and especially since the advent of domestic audiovisual playback technology (e.g. videocassette and DVD), with broadcasters and production houses realizing both the economic and cultural value of keeping archived material for both rebroadcast and potential profits through release on home video. In addition to cost, film reels took up much more space than digital video or audio files, making them harder to store, thus increasing the idea of wiping film reels to create more space.

[[Banner]]
CATEGORIES: Flags, Signage

A banner is a flag or other piece of cloth bearing a symbol, logo, slogan or other message. A flag whose design is the same as the shield in a coat of arms (but usually in a square or rectangular shape) is called a banner of arms.
Banner-making is an ancient craft. Church banners commonly portray the saint to whom the church is dedicated.
The word derives from French word "bannière" and late Latin bandum, a cloth out of which a flag is made ([tpl]lang-la|banderia[/tpl], [tpl]lang-it|bandiera[/tpl], [tpl]lang-pt|bandeira[/tpl], [tpl]lang-es|bandera[/tpl]). The German language developed the word to mean an official edict or proclamation and since such written orders often prohibited some form of human activity, bandum assumed the meaning of a ban, control, interdict or excommunication. Banns has the same origin meaning an official proclamation, and abandon means to change loyalty or disobey orders, semantically "to leave the cloth or flag".

Carl Michael Bellman ([tpl]Audio|sv-Carl_Mikael_Bellman.ogg|listen[/tpl]; 4 February 1740 – 11 February 1795) was a Swedish poet, songwriter, composer and performer. Bellman is a central figure in the Swedish song tradition and remains a powerful influence in Swedish music, as well as in Scandinavian literature, to this day.
Bellman is best known for two collections of poems set to music, Fredman's songs (Fredmans sånger) and  Fredman's epistles (Fredmans epistlar). Each consists of about 70 songs. The general theme is drinking, but the songs wonderfully combine words and music to express feelings and moods ranging from humorous to elegiac, romantic to satirical.
Bellman's patrons included the King, Gustav III of Sweden, who called him the master improviser. Bellman has been compared to  Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Hogarth, but his gift, using elegantly baroque classical references in comic contrast to sordid drinking and prostitution, which are at once regretted and celebrated, is unique.
Bellman's songs continue to be performed and recorded by musicians from Scandinavia and in other languages including Italian, French, Russian and English.

The Château de Montreuil-Bellay is a historical building in the town of Montreuil-Bellay, département of Maine-et-Loire, France,  first built on the site of a Gallo-Roman village high on a hill on the banks of the Thouet River. It is listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.annuaire-mairie.fr/monument-historique-montreuil-bellay.html |title=Monuments Historiques et Immeubles protégés sur Montreuil-Bellay |publisher=www.annuaire-mairie.fr |language=French |accessdate=2012-04-23[/tpl]
During the medieval period the property, consisting of more than [tpl]convert|1,000|acre|km2[/tpl], was part of a group of 32 villages near-by that created the then known as "L'Anjou". The Mountreil-Bellay fief, first belonged to Gelduin le Danois afterward by regal hereditry passed to Berlay le Vieux who became the first Sir of Bellay, in 1025 the castle was seized by Foulque Nerra a Plantagenet making Giraud Berlay his vassal during the second half of the 12th century. After the defeat of the English by Philip II, the fief returned to a descendant of the Berlay le Vieux family Sir of Bellay, Guillaume de Melun, during this period the fief went under a big renovation by the creation of high massive walls construction including 13 interlocking towers, with entry only via a fortified gateway and the name was anglicized from Barley to Balley.
During the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598) the town of Montreuil-Bellay was ransacked and burned but the sturdy fortress suffered little damage. Ownership of the castle changed several times including, through marriage, to the Cossé-Brissac family.  During the French Revolution the castle was seized by the revolutionary government and used as a prison for women suspected of being royalists.
In 1822 the property was acquired by Saumur businessman Adrien Niveleau, who divided the huge property into rental units. In 1860 Niveleau's daughter undertook occupancy and a major restoration campaign, redoing some of the rooms in the Troubadour style. Descendants of her husband’s nephew are the current owners of the property.
Nowadays, Château de Montreuil-Bellay is also the name of a premium wine made on the property.

Nemesis is a hypothetical red dwarf star or brown dwarf, originally postulated in 1984 to be orbiting the Sun at a distance of about 95,000 AU (1.5 light-years), somewhat beyond the Oort cloud, to explain a perceived cycle of mass extinctions in the geological record, which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], over 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified and none of them are inside the Solar System. There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought. Rather than one star for every brown dwarf, there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf.
More recent theories suggest that other forces, like close passings of other stars, or the angular effect of the galactic gravity plane working against the outer solar orbital plane, may be the cause of orbital perturbations of some outer Solar System objects. In 2011, Coryn Bailer-Jones did an analysis of craters on the surface of the Earth and reached the conclusion that the earlier findings of simple periodic patterns (implying periodic comet showers dislodged by a hypothetical Nemesis star) to be statistical artifacts, and found that the crater record shows no evidence for Nemesis. However, in 2010, A.L. Melott and R.K. Bambach found evidence in the fossil record confirming the extinction event periodicity originally claimed by Raup & Sepkoski in 1984, but at a higher confidence level and over a time period nearly twice as long. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) failed to discover Nemesis in the 1980s. The 2MASS astronomical survey, which ran from 1997 to 2001, failed to detect an additional star or brown dwarf in the Solar System.
Using newer and more powerful infrared telescope technology, able to detect brown dwarfs as cool as 150 kelvins out to a distance of 10 light-years from the Sun, results from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE survey) have not detected Nemesis. In 2011, David Morrison, a senior scientist at NASA known for his work in risk assessment of near Earth objects, has written that there is no confidence in the existence of an object like Nemesis, since it should have been detected in infrared sky surveys.

The flag has horizontal bands of red (on the top) and blue (on the bottom), of equal width, separated by a central green band which splits into a horizontal "Y" shape, the arms of which end at the corners of the hoist side (and follow the flag's diagonals). The Y embraces a black isosceles triangle from which the arms are separated by narrow yellow bands; the red and blue bands are separated from the green band and its arms by narrow white stripes. The stripes at the fly end are in the 5:1:3:1:5 ratio.
Three of the colours – black, green and yellow – are found in the banner of the African National Congress. The other three – red, white and blue – are displayed on the old Transvaal vierkleur (which also includes green), the Dutch tricolour and the modern flag of the United Kingdom.

A major figure in 20th century music, Feldman was a pioneer of indeterminate music, a development associated with the experimental New York School of composers also including John Cage, Christian Wolff, and Earle Brown. Feldman's works are characterized by notational innovations that he developed to create his characteristic sound: rhythms that seem to be free and floating; pitch shadings that seem softly unfocused; a generally quiet and slowly evolving music; recurring asymmetric patterns. His later works, after 1977, also begin to explore extremes of duration.

Howard Waldrop (born September 15, 1946, in Houston, Mississippi) is a science fiction author who works primarily in short fiction. 
Waldrop's stories combine elements such as alternate history, American popular culture, the American South, old movies (and character actors), classical mythology, and rock 'n' roll music. His style is sometimes obscure or elliptical: Night of the Cooters is a pastiche of H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds told from the perspective of a small town Texas sheriff (a homage to Slim Pickens) who finds an off-course Martian cylinder crashing down near his town; "Heirs of the Perisphere" involves robotic Disney characters waking up in the far future; "Fin de Cyclé" describes the Dreyfus affair from the perspective of bicycle enthusiasts.
Waldrop's work is frequently out-of-print, though still available for sale on-line; several of his books have been reprinted in omnibus editions. 
Several of his stories have been nominated for the genre's awards; "The Ugly Chickens" — about the extinction of the dodo — won a Nebula Award for best novelette in 1980, and also a World Fantasy Award for Short Fiction in 1981; this is perhaps his best known work.
Though born in Mississippi, Waldrop has spent most of his life in Texas. He moved to Washington state for several years, but has since returned to Austin. He is an avid fly fisherman. He is a member of the Turkey City Writer's Workshop, has attended the Rio Hondo Writing Workshop, and has taught at the Clarion Workshop.[tpl]cite web|title=Clarion Workshop Writers 2003|url=http://www.msu.edu/~clarion/writerinfo/03writerinfo.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030817213822/http://www.msu.edu/~clarion/writerinfo/03writerinfo.html|archivedate=August 17, 2003[/tpl]  In 2004 he started writing movie reviews with Lawrence Person for Locus Online.
He is a frequent attendee of ArmadilloCon, the local science fiction convention held annually in Austin. He was the Toastmaster at the very first ArmadilloCon (1979) and again at #29 in 2007; he was Guest of Honor at ArmadilloCon 5 (1983).

) is a type of digital logic which is implemented by Boolean circuits, where the output is a pure function of the present input only. This is in contrast to sequential logic, in which the output depends not only on the present input but also on the history of the input. In other words, sequential logic has memory while combinational logic does not.
Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. Practical computer circuits normally contain a mixture of combinational and sequential logic. For example, the part of an arithmetic logic unit, or ALU, that does mathematical calculations is constructed using combinational logic. Other circuits used in computers, such as half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders are also made by using combinational logic.
An alternate term is combinatorial logic,Clive Maxfield. "FPGAs: World Class Designs". p. 70. 2009. ISBN 1856176215 though this usage may be considered controversial.Cliff Cummings. "Common Mistakes In Technical Texts". 2009.

[[Sequential logic]]

CATEGORIES: Digital electronics, Automata theory, Logic in computer science

In digital circuit theory, sequential logic is a type of logic circuit whose output depends not only on the present value of its input signals but on the past history of its inputs.  This is in contrast to combinational logic, whose output is a function of only the present input.  That is, sequential logic has state (memory) while combinational logic does not. Or, in other words, sequential logic is combinational logic with memory.
Sequential logic is used to construct finite state machines, a basic building block in all digital circuitry, as well as memory circuits and other devices.   Virtually all circuits in practical digital devices are a mixture of combinational and sequential logic.
Digital sequential logic circuits are divided into synchronous and asynchronous types.  In synchronous sequential circuits, the state of the device changes only at discrete times in response to a clock signal.  In asynchronous circuits the state of the device can change at any time in response to changing inputs.

A Bridge Too Far is a 1977 epic war film based on the 1974 book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan, adapted by William Goldman. It was produced by Joseph E. Levine and Richard P. Levine and directed by Richard Attenborough.[tpl]harvnb|Goldman|1977[/tpl]
The film tells the story of the failure of Operation Market Garden during World War II, the Allied attempt to break through German lines and seize several bridges in the occupied Netherlands, including one at Arnhem, with the main objective of outflanking German defences.
The name for the film comes from an unconfirmed comment attributed to British Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning, deputy commander of the First Allied Airborne Army, who told Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, the operation's architect, before the operation: "I think we may be going a bridge too far."[tpl]harvnb|Ryan|1974|p=67[/tpl]
The ensemble cast includes Dirk Bogarde, Ryan O'Neal, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Elliott Gould, Anthony Hopkins, Gene Hackman, Hardy Krüger, Laurence Olivier, Robert Redford, Maximilian Schell and Liv Ullmann.

CATEGORIES: Polyhedra, Prismatoid polyhedra

In geometry, a frustumThe term comes from Latin frustum meaning "piece" or "crumb". The English word is often misspelled as [tpl]sic|hide=y|frus|trum[/tpl], probably because of a similarity with the common words "frustrate" and "frustration", also of Latin origin, or "fulcrum" (plural: frusta or frustums) is the portion of a solid (normally a cone or pyramid) that lies between two parallel planes cutting it.
The term is commonly used in computer graphics to describe the three-dimensional region which is visible on the screen, the "viewing frustum", which is formed by a clipped pyramid; in particular, frustum culling is a method of hidden surface determination.
In the aerospace industry, frustum is the common term for the fairing between two stages of a multistage rocket (such as the Saturn V), which is shaped like a truncated cone.

[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]
CATEGORIES: Voting systems, Voting theory, Economics theorems, Economics paradoxes, Theorems in discrete mathematics, Paradoxes, Social choice theory

In social choice theory, Arrow’s impossibility theorem, the General Possibility Theorem, or Arrow’s paradox, states that, when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options),  no rank order voting system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specific set of criteria. These criteria are called unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives. The theorem is often cited in discussions of election theory as it is further interpreted by the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem.
The theorem is named after economist Kenneth Arrow, who demonstrated the theorem in his Ph.D. thesis and popularized it in his 1951 book Social Choice and Individual Values.  The original paper was titled "A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare".Arrow, K.J., "A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare", Journal of Political Economy 58(4) (August, 1950), pp. 328–346.
In short, the theorem states that no rank-order voting system can be designed that satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:
Voting systems that use cardinal utility (which conveys more information than rank orders; see the subsection discussing the cardinal utility approach to overcoming the negative conclusion) are not covered by the theorem.Interview with Dr. Kenneth Arrow: "CES: Now, you mention that your theorem applies to preferential systems or ranking systems. Dr. Arrow: Yes CES: But the system that you’re just referring to, Approval Voting, falls within a class called cardinal systems. So not within ranking systems. Dr. Arrow: And as I said, that in effect implies more information.  The theorem can also be sidestepped by weakening the notion of independence. Arrow rejected cardinal utility as a meaningful tool for expressing social welfare,"Modern economic theory has insisted on the ordinal concept of utility; that is, only orderings can be observed, and therefore no measurement of utility independent of these orderings has any significance. In the field of consumer's demand theory the ordinalist position turned out to create no problems; cardinal utility had no explanatory power above and beyond ordinal. Leibniz' Principle of the Identity of the Indiscernables demanded then the excision of cardinal utility from our thought patterns." Arrow (1967), as quoted on p. 33 by [tpl]citation|title=The Active Consumer: Novelty and Surprise in Consumer Choice|volume=20|series=Routledge Frontiers of Political Economy|editor-first=Marina|editor-last=Bianchi|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|contribution=Choice without utility? Some reflections on the loose foundations of standard consumer theory|pages=21–45|first=Fabio|last=Racnchetti[/tpl]. and so focused his theorem on preference rankings.
The axiomatic approach Arrow adopted can treat all conceivable rules (that are based on preferences) within one unified framework. In that sense, the approach is qualitatively different from the earlier one in voting theory, in which rules were investigated one by one. One can therefore say that the contemporary paradigm of social choice theory started from this theorem.[tpl]#tag:ref | Suzumura, 2002,[tpl]Cite book | author=Suzumura, Kōtarō; Arrow, Kenneth Joseph; Sen, Amartya Kumar | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Handbook of social choice and welfare, vol 1 | year=2002 | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam, Netherlands  | isbn=978-0-444-82914-6 | pages=[/tpl] Introduction, page 10.[/tpl]

He has been called "the first truly modern writer" (Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve) and "the first critical and philosophical historian since classical times" (Oxford Companion to English Literature). Neither a chronicler nor a historian in the usual sense of the word, his analyses of the contemporary political scene are what made him virtually unique in his own time.

[[House of Lancaster]]

The House of Lancaster was a cadet branch of the royal House of Plantagenet. Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancaster{–}from which the house was named{–}for his second son Edmund Crouchback in 1267. Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, after de Montfort's death and attainder at the end of the Second Barons' War.[tpl]harvnb|Weir|2008|p=75[/tpl] When Edmund's son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, inherited his father-in-law's estates and title of Earl of Lincoln he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels.[tpl]harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=371[/tpl] This brought him{–}and Henry, his younger brother{–}into conflict with their cousin Edward II of England, leading to Thomas's execution. Henry inherited Thomas's titles and he and his son, who was also called Henry, gave loyal service to Edward's son{–}Edward III of England.
Edward III married all his sons to wealthy English heiresses rather than following his predecessors' practice of finding continental political marriages for royal princes. Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, had no male heir so Edward married his son John to Henry's heiress daughter and John's third cousin Blanche of Lancaster. This gave John the vast wealth of the House of Lancaster. Their son Henry usurped the throne in 1399, creating one of the factions in the Wars of the Roses. There was an intermittent dynastic struggle between the descendants of Edward III. In these wars, the term Lancastrian became a reference to members of the family and their supporters. The family provided England with three kings: Henry IV, who ruled from 1399 to 1413, Henry V (1413–1422), and Henry VI (1422–1461 and 1470–1471).
The House became extinct in the male line upon the murder in the Tower of London of Henry VI, following the battlefield execution of his son Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, by supporters of the House of York in 1471. Lancastrian cognatic descent{–}from John of Gaunt and Blanche of Lancaster's daughter Phillipa{–}continued in the royal houses of Spain and Portugal while the Lancastrian political cause was maintained by Henry Tudor{–}a relatively unknown scion of the Beauforts{–}eventually leading to the establishment of the House of Tudor. The Lancastrians left a legacy through the patronage of the arts{–} most notably in founding Eton College and King's College, Cambridge{–} but to historians’ chagrin their propaganda, and that of their Tudor successors, means that it is Shakespeare’s{–} dramatized, imperfect, part fictional{–}history plays rather medievalist scholarly research that has the greater influence on modern perceptions of the dynasty.[tpl]harvnb|Galbraith|1982|pp=223-239[/tpl]

Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band from Buffalo, New York. Formed in 1988, the band has released twelve studio albums, two box sets, four video albums and one live album. The band has had little radio or television exposure throughout its career, although a cult following began to build behind the release of their 1991 album Butchered at Birth, and 1992 album Tomb of the Mutilated. Both albums achieved worldwide sales of one million copies by 2003, including 558,929 in the United States, making them the all-time top-selling death metal band in the country.
The members of Cannibal Corpse were originally inspired by thrash metal bands like Slayer and Kreator, as well as other death metal bands such as Morbid Angel, Autopsy and Death. The band's album art (most often by Vincent Locke) and lyrics, drawing heavily on horror fiction and horror films, are highly controversial. At different times, several countries have banned Cannibal Corpse from performing within their borders, or have banned the sale and display of original Cannibal Corpse album covers.

CATEGORIES: 1964 musicals, Broadway musicals, West End musicals, Musicals based on short fiction, Yiddish culture, Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients, Jewish theatre, Musicals directed by Jerome Robbins, Tony Award for Best Musical

Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and book by Joseph Stein, set in Tsarist Russia in 1905. It is based on Tevye and his Daughters (or Tevye the Dairyman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. The story centers on Tevye, the father of five daughters, and his attempts to maintain his family and Jewish religious traditions while outside influences encroach upon their lives. He must cope both with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters—each one's choice of husband moves further away from the customs of his faith—and with the edict of the Tsar that evicts the Jews from their village.
The original Broadway production of the show, which opened in 1964, had the first musical theatre run in history to surpass 3,000 performances. Fiddler held the record for the longest-running Broadway musical for almost 10 years until Grease surpassed its run. It remains Broadway's sixteenth longest-running show in history. The production was extraordinarily profitable and highly acclaimed. It was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning nine, including Best Musical, score, book, direction and choreography. It spawned four Broadway revivals, a successful 1971 film adaptation, and the show has enjoyed enduring international popularity. It is also a very popular choice for school and community productions.TIME magazine reported in its May 26, 2008, issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the seventh most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.

Practical Magic is a 1998 American romantic comedy film based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Alice Hoffman. The film was directed by Griffin Dunne and stars Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Stockard Channing, Dianne Wiest, Aidan Quinn and Goran Visnjic. The film score was composed by Alan Silvestri.
Bullock and Kidman play sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, who have always known they were different from each other. Raised by their aunts after their parents' death, the sisters grew up in a household that was anything but typical--their aunts fed them chocolate cake for breakfast and taught them the uses of practical magic. But the invocation of the Owens' sorcery also carries a price--some call it a curse: the men they fall in love with are doomed to an untimely death. Now adult women with very different personalities, the quiet Sally and the fiery Gillian must use all of their powers to fight the family curse and a swarm of supernatural forces that could take away all the Owen's lives.

Bethune came to international prominence first for his service as a frontline surgeon supporting the democratically-elected Republican government during the Spanish Civil War. But it was his service with the Communist Eighth Route Army (Ba Lu Jun) during the Second Sino-Japanese War that would earn him enduring acclaim. Dr. Bethune effectively brought modern medicine to rural China and frequently treated sick villagers inasmuch as wounded soldiers.

The Broads are a network of mostly navigable rivers and lakes in the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.  The Broads, and some surrounding land, were constituted as a special area with a level of protection similar to a National Park by The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act of 1988. The Broads Authority, a Special Statutory Authority responsible for managing the area, became operational in 1989.The Broads Authority. The Broads Act. Retrieved 23 January 2006.
The total area is [tpl]convert|303|km2[/tpl],  most of which is in Norfolk, with over [tpl]convert|200|km[/tpl] of navigable waterways.  There are seven rivers and 63 broads, mostly less than [tpl]convert|4|m[/tpl] deep.  Thirteen broads are generally open to navigation, with a further three having navigable channels.  Some broads have navigation restrictions imposed on them in autumn and winter.Living Lakes Partnership (1998–2005). The Broads, England. Retrieved 23 January 2006.
Although the terms Norfolk Broads and Suffolk Broads are used to identify specific areas within the two counties respectively, the whole area is frequently mistakenly referred to as the "Norfolk Broads".  The Broads has the same status as the national parks in England and Wales;  the Broads Authority has powers and duties almost identical to the national parks, but is also the third-largest inland navigation authority. Because of its navigation role the Broads Authority was established under its own legislation on 1 April 1989. More recently the Authority wanted to change the name of the area to The Broads National Park in recognition of the fact that the status of the area is equivalent to the rest of the national park family, but was unable to get agreement from all the different parties. The Broads Authority Act 2009, which was promoted through Parliament by the Authority, improves public safety on the water.

[[Seven twenty-seven]]

CATEGORIES: Stud poker, Blackjack

Seven Twenty-Seven is a vying game similar in some respects
to poker, and often played as a "dealer's choice" variant at
home poker games.
It uses the same equipment and betting system, but the value of
hands does not use traditional poker hand rankings, either high or low.
Rather, only the sum of the cards is used to calculate the worth of a hand.
The game is something of a cross between blackjack hands and poker bluffing.
The game play proceeds like this:
Numbered cards are scored at face value; face cards count for one-half
a point.
Aces count for one and eleven, so a hand with a five and two aces
scores 7 and 27 at the same time.
On showdown, the pot is split in half, with the hand(s) valued closest
to 7 and the hand(s) valued closest to 27 each winning one half of the pot.
If there is a tie where two players are off by the same amount, but in different directions (6 to 8), the lower hand wins. 
If there is an exact tie, that half-pot is split again among the tied players.
Ties are common.
The same player may contest for both high and low, usually because of aces.  A player with a five and two aces can win the whole pot.
There are a few variations in rules that complicate things somewhat:
first, the rule about ties in different directions varies; also, some
players play with a declaration, while others
play cards speak. Still others require players to not go over 7 or 27 to win the respective halves of the pot; in this variant, if everyone is over 7, the player closest to 27 without going over wins the whole pot. Still other players play with other pairs of target numbers (usually 20 points apart, such as 13 and 33, or 16 and 36).

[[Flywheel]]
CATEGORIES: Energy storage, Engine technology, Rotating machines, Articles containing video clips

A flywheel is a rotating mechanical device that is used to store rotational energy. Flywheels have a significant moment of inertia and thus resist changes in rotational speed. The amount of energy stored in a flywheel is proportional to the square of its rotational speed. Energy is transferred to a flywheel by applying torque to it, thereby increasing its rotational speed, and hence its stored energy. Conversely, a flywheel releases stored energy by applying torque to a mechanical load, thereby decreasing its rotational speed.
Common uses of a flywheel include:
Flywheels are typically made of steel and rotate on conventional bearings; these are generally limited to a revolution rate of a few thousand RPM.http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120629-reinventing-the-wheel; "Flywheels move from steam age technology to Formula 1"; Jon Stewart | 1 July 2012, retrieved 2012-07-03  Some modern flywheels are made of carbon fiber materials and employ magnetic bearings, enabling them to revolve at speeds up to 60,000 RPM.http://www.ricardo.com/en-GB/News--Media/Press-releases/News-releases1/2011/Breakthrough-in-Ricardo-Kinergy-second-generation-high-speed-flywheel-technology/, "Breakthrough in Ricardo Kinergy ‘second generation’ high-speed flywheel technology"; Press release date: 22 August 2011. retrieved 2012-07-03
Carbon-composite flywheel batteries have recently been manufactured and are proving to be viable in real-world tests on mainstream cars.

Interstate 81 (abbreviated I-81) is an Interstate Highway in the eastern part of the United States. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 40 in Dandridge, Tennessee; its northern terminus is on Wellesley Island (near Fishers Landing, New York) at the Canadian border, where the Thousand Islands Bridge connects it to Highway 401, the main Ontario freeway connecting Detroit via Toronto to Montreal.
I-81 is the longest odd-numbered (and therefore the longest north-south) Interstate highway in which the number does not end with a 5, and the third longest Interstate highway in which the number does not end with a 0 or 5 after I-94 and I-64.  Interstate 81 largely traces the paths created down the length of the Appalachian Mountains by migrating animals, American Indians, and early settlers. It also follows a major corridor for troop movements during the Civil War. These trails and roadways gradually evolved into U.S. Route 11. Interstate 81 parallels much of the older Route 11.Perrier, Dianne. (2010)  Interstate 81: Great Warriors Trace. University Press of Florida. Being mostly rural, it is heavily used as a trucking corridor, often as a bypass of the busier Interstate 95 to the east.
The Interstate 81 Corridor Coalition, a six-state coalition, was organized to handle issues along Interstate 81, such as truck traffic and air pollution.  As of October 15, 2008, this commission has met twice.I-81 Safety ConferenceI-81 Corridor group

[[Reaction wheel]]

CATEGORIES: Spacecraft attitude control, Spacecraft propulsion, Gyroscopes

A reaction wheel (RW) is a type of flywheel used primarily by spacecraft for attitude control without using fuel for rockets or other reaction devices. They are particularly useful when the spacecraft must be rotated by very small amounts, such as keeping a telescope pointed at a star.  They may also reduce the mass fraction needed for fuel. This is accomplished by equipping the spacecraft with an electric motor attached to a flywheel which, when its rotation speed is changed, causes the spacecraft to begin to counter-rotate proportionately through conservation of angular momentum. Reaction wheels can only rotate a spacecraft around its center of mass (see torque); they are not capable of moving the spacecraft from one place to another (see translational force). Reaction wheels work around a nominal zero rotation speed. However, external torques on the spacecraft may  require a gradual buildup of reaction wheel rotation speed to maintain the spacecraft in a fixed orientation.
A reaction wheel is sometimes operated as (and referred to as) a momentum wheel, by operating it at a constant (or near-constant) rotation speed, in order to imbue a satellite with a large amount of stored angular momentum. Doing so alters the spacecraft's rotational dynamics so that disturbance torques perpendicular to one axis of the satellite (the axis parallel to the wheel's spin axis) do not result directly in spacecraft angular motion about the same axis as the disturbance torque; instead, they result in (generally smaller) angular motion (precession) of that spacecraft axis about a perpendicular axis. This has the effect of tending to stabilize that spacecraft axis to point in a nearly-fixed direction, allowing for a less-complicated attitude control system. Satellites using this "momentum-bias" stabilization approach include SCISAT-1; by orienting the momentum wheel's axis to be parallel to the orbit-normal vector, this satellite is in a "pitch momentum bias" configuration.
A control moment gyro (CMG) is a related but different type of attitude actuator, generally consisting of a momentum wheel mounted in a one-axis or two-axis gimbal. When mounted to a rigid spacecraft, applying a constant torque to the wheel using one of the gimbal motors causes the spacecraft to develop a constant angular velocity about a perpendicular axis, thus allowing control of the spacecraft's pointing direction. CMGs are generally able to produce larger sustained torques than RWs with less motor heating, and are preferentially used in larger and/or more-agile spacecraft, including Skylab and the  International Space Station.

[[Inequality (mathematics)]]

CATEGORIES: Inequalities, Elementary algebra

In mathematics, an inequality is a relation that holds between two values when they are different (see also: equality).
It does not say that one is greater than the other, or even that they can be compared in size.
If the values in question are elements of an ordered set, such as the integers or the real numbers, they can be compared in size.
In either case, a is not equal to b. These relations are known as strict inequalities. The notation a In contrast to strict inequalities, there are two types of inequality relations that are not strict:
An additional use of the notation is to show that one quantity is much greater than another, normally by several orders of magnitude.

Prince Valiant in the Days of King Arthur, or simply Prince Valiant, is a long-running comic strip created by Hal Foster in 1937. It is an epic adventure that has told a continuous story during its entire history, and the full stretch of that story now totals more than 4000 Sunday strips. Currently, the strip appears weekly in more than 300 American newspapers, according to its distributor, King Features Syndicate.
Edward, the Duke of Windsor, called Prince Valiant the "greatest contribution to English literature in the past hundred years."Syracuse University: Hal Foster Papers. Generally regarded by comics historians as one of the most impressive visual creations ever syndicated[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl], the strip is noted[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl] for its realistically rendered panoramas and the intelligent, sometimes humorous, narrative. The format does not employ word balloons. Instead, the story is narrated in captions positioned at the bottom or sides of panels. Events depicted are taken from various time periods, from the late Roman Empire to the High Middle Ages, with a few brief scenes from modern times (commenting on the "manuscript").Goldberg, Todd and Carl Horak, edited by Don Markstein and Rick Norwood. A Prince Valiant Companion. Manuscript Press. ISBN 0-936414-07-3
While drawing the Tarzan comic strip, Foster wanted to do his own original newspaper feature, and he began work on a strip he called Derek, Son of Thane, later changing the title to Prince Arn. King Features manager Joseph Connelly eventually renamed it Prince Valiant. In 1936, after extensive research, Foster pitched his concept to William Randolph Hearst, who had long wanted to distribute a strip by Foster. Hearst was so impressed that he gave Foster ownership of the strip.
Prince Valiant began in full-color tabloid sections on Saturday February 13, 1937. The first full page was strip #16, which appeared in the Sunday New Orleans Times Picayune. The internal dating changed from Saturday to Sunday with strip #66 (May 15, 1938). The full-page strip continued until 1971 when strip #1788 was not offered in full-page format—it was the last strip Foster drew. The strip continues today by other artists in a half page format.

After being chartered in 1789, the university first began enrolling students in 1795, which allows it to be one of three schools to claim the title of the oldest public university in the United States.
The first public institution of higher education in North Carolina, the school opened its doors to students on February 12, 1795. The university offers degrees in over 70 courses of study through fourteen colleges and the College of Arts and Sciences. All undergraduates receive a liberal arts education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university or within the College of Arts and Sciences from the time they obtain junior status. Under the leadership of President Kemp Plummer Battle, in 1877 North Carolina became coeducational and began the process of desegregation in 1951 when African-American graduate students were admitted under Chancellor Robert Burton House.[tpl]cite web|url=http://womenscenter.unc.edu/about/womens-history-unc/ |title=UNC Women's History | Carolina Women's Center |publisher=Womenscenter.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-12-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/unc/uncdesegregation.html |title=North Carolina Collection-UNC Desegregation |publisher=Lib.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-12-21[/tpl] In 1952, North Carolina opened its own hospital, UNC Health Care, for research and treatment, and has since specialized in cancer care.

Molecular biologists use several shorthand terms when referring to nucleic acid molecules, such as DNA and RNA, collectively referred to as nucleic acid nomenclature.
The most common is the representation of the base pairs as letters—an adenine nucleotide is abbreviated as A, guanine as G, cytosine as C, thymine as T, and in RNA, uracil as U.
Additionally, the positions of the carbons in the ribose sugar that forms the backbone of the nucleic acid chain are numbered, and are used to indicate the direction of nucleic acids (5'->3' versus 3'->5'). This is referred to as directionality.

In ancient Latvia, Lieldienas ("Easter") was the celebration of Vernal Equinox on March 23.  The celebration usually lasted three or four days; each day was devoted to a specific deity, though no source gives the names of the respective deity.  At least one day is probably dedicated to Māra.
Lieldienas was a celebration of dancing, singing and gaiety.  On the first day, the Latvians arose early and rinsed their faces in running water.[tpl]Citation |last= Mellēna|first= Māra|year=2000 |title= Latvian Seasonal Holidays|publisher= The Latvian Institute|publication-place= |page= |url= http://www.rsu.lv/eng/images/Documents/Publications/Latvian_Seasonal_Holidays.pd|accessdate=October 4, 2013 [/tpl]  Symbolically scattering evil, adults scared birds away from the homes and surroundings.
Eggs were associated with Lieldienas.  One who steals an egg will be poor.  One who eats a hard-boiled egg without salt is a liar.  A girl who gives a boy two eggs doesn't like him; three eggs mean there is a chance she likes; four eggs means she doesn't like him but will be with him because he is richer; five eggs means she loves him.

In principle, a sheriff is a legal official with responsibility for a county or parish. In practice, the specific combination of legal, political and ceremonial duties of a sheriff varies greatly from country to country.
The word "sheriff"[tpl]anchor|shire reeve[/tpl] is a contraction of the term "shire reeve". The term, from the Old English scīrgerefa, designated a royal official responsible for keeping the peace (a "reeve") throughout a shire or county or parish on behalf of the king.Online Etymology Dictionary:sheriff, Online Etymology Dictionary:reeve The term was preserved in England notwithstanding the Norman Conquest. From the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, the term spread to several other regions, at an early point to Scotland, latterly to Ireland and to the United States.
Sheriffs exist in various countries:
In British English, the political or legal office of a sheriff is called a shrievalty.

[[Enigma Variations]]
CATEGORIES: Compositions by Edward Elgar, Variations, Music for orchestra and organ, 1899 compositions

Edward Elgar composed his Variations on an Original Theme for Orchestra ("Enigma"), Op. 36, commonly referred to as the Enigma Variations, in 1898–99. It is a set of fourteen variations on a hidden "theme" that is, in Elgar's words, "not played". It is Elgar's best-known large-scale composition, for both the music itself and the enigma behind it.
Elgar dedicated the piece to "my friends pictured within", each variation being an affectionate portrayal of one of his circle of close acquaintances. See Musical cryptogram. The people portrayed in the variations include Elgar's wife Alice, Augustus J. Jaeger and Elgar himself. The enigma is the hidden theme, which has been the subject of much speculation. Various musicians have proposed theories for what melody it could be, although Elgar did not say that that his "theme" was a melody. The enigma could be something else, such as a symbol or a literary theme. Elgar accepted none of the solutions proposed in his lifetime, and took the secret with him to the grave.
After its 1899 London premiere, the piece achieved popularity and was performed internationally. It has been recorded over 60 times.

[[Allegory of the Cave]]
CATEGORIES: Allegory, Analogy, Concepts in epistemology, Platonism, Philosophy of education

The Allegory of the Cave, also entitled Analogy of the Cave, Plato's Cave or Parable of the Cave is presented by the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in the Republic to compare "...the effect of education (παιδεία) and the lack of it on our nature". It is written as a dialogue between Plato's brother Glaucon and his mentor Socrates, narrated by the latter. The Allegory of the Cave is presented after the Analogy of the Sun and the Analogy of the Divided Line. All three are characterized in relation to dialectic (διάλεκτος) at the end of books VII and VIII.
Plato has Socrates describe a gathering of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them, and begin to designate names to these shadows. The shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality. He then explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall do not make up reality at all, as he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners.
The Allegory may be related to Plato's Theory of Forms, according to which the "Forms" (or "Ideas"/"Archetypes"), and not the material world of change known to us through sensation, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality. Only knowledge of the Forms constitutes real knowledge.[tpl]Citation | first=Stephen | last=Watt | contribution=Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5–7) | title=Plato: Republic | year=1997 | pages=pages xiv–xvi | place=London | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | isbn=1-85326-483-0[/tpl] Socrates informs Glaucon that the most excellent must learn the greatest of all studies, which is to behold the Good. Those who have ascended to this highest level, however, must not remain there but must return to the cave and dwell with the prisoners, sharing in their labors and honors.
Plato's Phaedo contains similar imagery to that of the Allegory of the Cave; a philosopher recognizes that before philosophy, his soul was "a veritable prisoner fast bound within his body... and that instead of investigating reality by itself and in itself it is compelled to peer through the bars of its prison."[tpl]cite journal|last=Elliott|first=R.

Harold Pinter, CH, CBE (10 October 1930 – 24 December 2008) was a Nobel Prize-winning English playwright, screenwriter, director and actor. One of the most influential modern British dramatists, his writing career spanned more than 50 years. His best-known plays include The Birthday Party (1957), The Homecoming (1964), and Betrayal (1978), each of which he adapted for the screen. His screenplay adaptations of others' works include The Servant (1963), The Go-Between (1970), The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981), The Trial (1993), and Sleuth (2007). He also directed or acted in radio, stage, television, and film productions of his own and others' works.
Pinter was born and raised in Hackney, east London, and educated at Hackney Downs School. He was a sprinter and a keen cricket player, acting in school plays and writing poetry. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but did not complete the course. He was fined for refusing National Service as a conscientious objector. Subsequently, he continued training at the Central School of Speech and Drama and worked in repertory theatre in Ireland and England. In 1956 he married actress Vivien Merchant and had a son, Daniel born in 1958. He left Merchant in 1975 and married author Lady Antonia Fraser in 1980.
Pinter's career as a playwright began with a production of The Room in 1957. His second play, The Birthday Party, closed after eight performances, but was enthusiastically reviewed by critic Harold Hobson. His early works were described by critics as "comedy of menace". Later plays such as No Man's Land (1975) and Betrayal (1978) became known as "memory plays". He appeared as an actor in productions of his own work on radio and film. He also undertook a number of roles in works by other writers. He directed nearly 50 productions for stage, theatre and screen. Pinter received over 50 awards, prizes, and other honours, including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005 and the French Légion d'honneur in 2007.
Despite frail health after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in December 2001, Pinter continued to act on stage and screen, last performing the title role of Samuel Beckett's one-act monologue Krapp's Last Tape, for the 50th anniversary season of the Royal Court Theatre, in October 2006.  He died from liver cancer on 24 December 2008.

[[Identity (philosophy)]]

CATEGORIES: Identity, Philosophical logic, Concepts in metaphysics, Concepts in logic

In philosophy, identity, from [tpl]Lang-la|identitas[/tpl] ("sameness"), is the relation each thing bears just to itself.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Identity, First published Wed Dec 15, 2004; substantive revision Sun Oct 1, 2006.The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd Edition, CUP: 1995 The notion of identity gives rise to many philosophical problems, including the identity of indiscernibles (if x and y share all their properties, are they one and the same thing?), and questions about change and personal identity over time (what has to be the case for a person x at one time and a person y at a later time to be one and the same person?).
It is important to distinguish the philosophical concept of identity from the more well-known notion of identity in use in psychology and the social sciences. The philosophical concept concerns a relation, specifically, a relation that x and y stand in if, and only if they are one and the same thing, or identical to each other (i.e. if, and only if x = y).  The sociological notion of identity, by contrast, has to do with a person's self-conception, social presentation, and more generally, the aspects of a person that make them unique, or qualitatively different from others (e.g. cultural identity, gender identity, national Identity, online identity and processes of identity formation).

Interstate 35 (IH-35 or I-35) is a north–south Interstate Highway in the central United States. I-35 stretches from Laredo, Texas, on the American-Mexican border to Duluth, Minnesota, at Minnesota Highway 61 (London Road) and 26th Avenue East.[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=3966640746460723679,27.524700,-99.502890%3B9356109620576285556,46.801921,-92.071031&saddr=I-35+N+%4027.524700,+-99.502890&daddr=46.808637,-92.06131&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=13&sll=46.798649,-92.0644&sspn=0.053116,0.115356&ie=UTF8&ll=40.713956,-97.382812&spn=30.012924,59.0625&z=4 |title=overview map of I-35 |accessdate= February 15, 2008[/tpl] Many Interstate Highways formerly had splits or spurs indicated with suffixed letters (N/S/E/W), and I-35 was the only one that still had such divisions, before the recent opening of I-69C and I-69E in the Rio Grande Valley. In two stretches, both through twin cities, the highway splits into Interstate 35E—at Dallas and at Saint Paul, Minnesota—and Interstate 35W—at Fort Worth, Texas, and at Minneapolis.
At [tpl]convert|1568|mi|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl], Interstate 35 is the ninth-longest Interstate Highway following Interstate 94, and it is the third-longest north-south Interstate Highway, following Interstate 75 and Interstate 95. Even though the route is generally considered to be a border to border highway, this highway does not directly connect to either international border. I-35's southern terminus is a traffic signal in Laredo, Texas, just short of the Mexican-American border. Travelers going south can take one of two toll bridges across the Rio Grande and the Mexican border, either straight ahead into the Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge, or via Interstate 35 Business through downtown Laredo into the Gateway to the Americas International Bridge.
To the north, I-35 terminates in Duluth, Minnesota, with connections to Canada from the interstate's terminus via Minnesota Highway 61 to Grand Portage, or north to the border at International Falls, Minnesota via U.S. Route 53 in Duluth, but that route is more typically accessed from the south by Minnesota Highway 33 at Cloquet, Minnesota.

Interstate 37 (I-37) is a [tpl]convert|143.0|mi|km|1|sing=on[/tpl] intrastate Interstate Highway located within the U.S. state of Texas.  The highway was first designated in 1959 as a route between Corpus Christi and San Antonio.  Construction in the urban areas of Corpus Christi and San Antonio began in the 1960s and the segments of the Interstate Highway in rural areas were completed by the 1980s.  Prior to I-37, the route between Corpus Christi and San Antonio was served by a combination of State Highway 9 (SH 9) from Corpus Christi to Three Rivers and U.S. Route 281 (US 281) from Three Rivers to San Antonio.  As a result of the construction of I-37, SH 9 was removed from the State Highway System.
The highway begins in Corpus Christi at US 181 and SH 35 and heads north to San Antonio, where it ends at I-35.  Beyond I-35, the freeway continues as US 281 to northern San Antonio as a major freeway.  In Corpus Christi, the highway provides access to the downtown area, the Port of Corpus Christi, and the Corpus Christi International Airport.  In San Antonio, it provides access to Downtown, Brooks City-Base, the Alamodome, the Tower of the Americas, the River Walk, the Alamo, and by extension via US 281, the San Antonio International Airport.  The route provides an important connection between I-35 and the Texas Gulf Coast as well as one of the few limited-access hurricane evacuation routes away from the southern Texas coast.

Some teen idols began their careers as child actors. The idol's popularity may be limited to teens, or may extend to all age groups. Many teen idols are targeted for adults for nostalgia purposes.
There were teen idols before there were teen magazines, but idols have always been a permanent feature in magazines such as 16 magazine, Tiger Beat and Right On! in the United States, and in similar magazines elsewhere. With the advent of television, teen idols were also promoted through programs such as American Bandstand, The Ed Sullivan Show, Soul Train and in the UK Top of the Pops. Today's teen idols have spawned an entire industry of gossip magazines, television shows, You Tube, and whole television channels such as E!.
Many American teen idols achieve "cross-over" success internationally, however this list is not limited to American artists alone with some people like German popstar Bill Kaulitz of the pop-rock band Tokio Hotel. In Asia, idols range from Japanese pop megastars Ayumi Hamasaki and Namie Amuro as well as Kana Nishino and Japanese music groups such as Momoiro Clover Z, Morning Musume, AKB48, and Perfume and Johnny & Associates boy bands Arashi, NEWS, KAT-TUN, and Hey!

In Spain, Miguel Bose, Mecano and Hombres G all enjoyed teen-idol status. Even in the classical music field, a British-Chinese violinist Vanessa-Mae became the first "teen idol" in that category.

[[Water vapor]]
CATEGORIES: Greenhouse gases, Atmospheric thermodynamics, Forms of water, Water in gas, Psychrometrics

Water vapor or water vapour or aqueous vapor is the gas phase of water. It is one state of water within the hydrosphere. Water vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice. Unlike other forms of water, water vapor is invisible.[tpl]cite web|title=What is Water Vapor?|url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_is_water_vapor.htm|accessdate=2012-08-28[/tpl] Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation. It is lighter than air and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds.
Water vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, present even in the Solar atmosphere as well as every planet in the Solar System and many astronomical objects including natural satellites, comets and even large asteroids. Likewise the detection of extrasolar water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems. Water vapor is significant in that it can be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects. 
Being a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in Earth's atmosphere where it is also a potent greenhouse gas along with other gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Use of water vapor, as steam, has been important to humans for cooking and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the industrial revolution.

[[Gong]]
CATEGORIES: Orchestral percussion, Gongs, Marching percussion, Idiophones, Malay words and phrases

A gong (Chinese: 鑼; pinyin: luó; Indonesian or Javanese: gong; Malay: gong ) is an African, East and South East Asian musical percussion instrument that takes the form of a flat, circular metal disc which is hit with a mallet.
It originated in China and later spread to Southeast Asia, and it may also be used in the percussion section of Western symphony orchestra.
Gongs are broadly of three types. Suspended gongs are more or less flat, circular discs of metal suspended vertically by means of a cord passed through holes near to the top rim. Bossed or nipple gongs have a raised centre boss and are often suspended and played horizontally. Bowl gongs are bowl-shaped, and rest on cushions and belong more to bells than gongs. Gongs are made mainly from bronze or brass but there are many other alloys in use.
Gongs produce two distinct types of sound. A gong with a substantially flat surface vibrates in multiple modes, giving a "crash" rather than a tuned note. This category of gong is sometimes called a tam-tam to distinguish it from the bossed gongs that give a tuned note. In Indonesian gamelan ensembles, some bossed gongs are deliberately made to generate in addition a beat note in the range from about 1 to 5 Hz. The use of the term "gong" for both these types of instrument is common.

Interstate 68 (I-68) is a [tpl]convert|112.9|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] Interstate highway in the U.S. states of West Virginia and Maryland, connecting [tpl]nowrap|Interstate 79[/tpl] in Morgantown to [tpl]nowrap|Interstate 70[/tpl] in Hancock. [tpl]nowrap|I-68[/tpl] is also Corridor E of the Appalachian Development Highway System. From 1965 until the freeway's construction was completed in 1991, it was designated as [tpl]nowrap|U.S. Route 48[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|(US 48)[/tpl]. In Maryland, the highway is known as the National Freeway, an homage to the historic National Road, which [tpl]nowrap|I-68[/tpl] parallels between Keysers Ridge and Hancock. The freeway mainly spans rural areas and crosses numerous mountain ridges along its route. A road cut at Sideling Hill exposed geological features of the mountain and has become a tourist attraction.
The construction of [tpl]nowrap|I-68[/tpl] began in 1965 and continued for over 25 years, with completion on August 2, 1991. While the road was under construction, it was predicted that economic conditions would improve along the corridor for the four counties connected by I-68: Allegany and Garrett in Maryland, and Preston and Monongalia in West Virginia. The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown, West Virginia and Cumberland, Maryland, both with permanent populations of fewer than 30,000 people. Despite the fact that the freeway serves no major metropolitan areas, [tpl]nowrap|I-68[/tpl] provides a major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides an alternative to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for westbound traffic from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.
U.S. Route 219 and U.S. Route 220 overlap with [tpl]nowrap|I-68[/tpl] in Garrett County, Maryland and Cumberland, Maryland, respectively, and U.S. Route 40 overlaps with the freeway from Keysers Ridge to the eastern end of the freeway at Hancock.

In ancient Latvia, Ziemassvētki (Winter holiday) was a festival, celebrated on 22 December, which was one of the two most important holidays, the other being Jāņi. Ziemassvētki celebrated the Winter Solstice.[tpl]Citation |last= Mellēna|first= Māra|year=2000 |title= Latvian Seasonal Holidays|publisher= The Latvian Institute|publication-place= |page= |url= http://www.rsu.lv/eng/images/Documents/Publications/Latvian_Seasonal_Holidays.pd|accessdate=October 4, 2013 [/tpl] The two weeks before Ziemassvetki are called Veļu laiks, the "season of ghosts." Three postage stamps were issued on 3 December 2005 to commemorate this festival.
During the festival, candles are lit for Dieviņš and a fire is kept burning until the end, when its extinguishing signals an end to the unhappiness of the previous year.  During the ensuing feast, a space at the table is reserved for Ghosts, who was said to arrive on a sleigh.  During the feast, certain foods are always eaten: bread, beans, peas, pork and pig snout and feet.  Carolers (Budeļi) go door to door singing songs and eating from many different houses.  Celebrants believe that during the feast ghosts arrive on a sleigh.

Jāņi (pronounced [tpl]IPA-lv|jaːɲi|[/tpl]) is a Latvian festival held in the night from 23 June to 24 June to celebrate the summer solstice (Midsummer), the shortest night and longest day of the year.[tpl]Citation |last= Mellēna|first= Māra|year=2000 |title= Latvian Seasonal Holidays|publisher= The Latvian Institute|publication-place= |page= |url= http://www.rsu.lv/eng/images/Documents/Publications/Latvian_Seasonal_Holidays.pd|accessdate=October 4, 2013 [/tpl] The day of Līgo ([tpl]IPA|liːɡu͡o[/tpl]) (23 June) and the day of Jāņi (24 June) are public holidays, and people usually spend them in the countryside. The festival's eve Jāņu vakars ([tpl]IPA|vakars[/tpl]) is held in the evening of 23 June and goes on all through the night Jāņu nakts ([tpl]IPA|nakts[/tpl]), where people Līgo (sway) into the following day.
Jānis is traditionally the most common male name.  Everybody of the name Jānis holds a special honor on this day (Jāņi is a plural form of Jānis) and wears an oak wreath.
Besides John, the name of Jānis is also etymologically linked with other names of various nations, such as Aeneas, Dionysus, Jonash, Jan, Jean, Johan, João, Ian, Ivan, Huan, and Han.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl][/ref]
Jāņi was an ancient festival originally celebrated in honour of a Latvian pagan deity Jānis, who is mentioned in Latvian folksongs of antiquity. The festival's current date has shifted a few days from 21 June/22 June when the summer solstice actually takes place, due to the Christianisation of the holiday, which led to the day's christening as Saint John the Baptist's feast day, which falls on 24 June. Today, Jāņi incorporates some of the former folk traditions with Christian elements.Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, published by Lonely Planet, 2009. pg. 182 ISBN 1741047706
Jāņi is thought to be the time when the forces of nature are at their most powerful, and the boundaries between the physical and spiritual worlds are thinnest. In the past, evil witches were believed to be riding around, so people decorated their houses and lands with rowan branches and thorns in order to protect themselves from evil. In modern days other traditional decorations are more popular, including birch or sometimes oak branches and flowers as well as leaves, especially ferns. Women wear wreaths made from flowers; in rural areas livestock is also decorated.
Jāņi also is thought to be the perfect time to gather herbs, because it is believed that they then have magical powers on this day. Other practices of magic in Jāņi vary from fortune-telling to ensuring productivity of crops, as well as livestock fertility. A well-known part of this celebration is searching for the mythical fern flower, though some suggest that the fern flower is a symbol of secret knowledge; today it is almost always synonymous with having sexual relationships. Young couples traditionally search for the flower and many believe there is an increase in births nine months later. (In the past, this timing was ideal for farmers.)
Another important detail is fire: A festival fire must be kept from sunset till sunrise, and various kinds of flaming light sources are used; usually these are bonfires, which traditionally people jump over to ensure prosperity and fertility. Traditional food during Jāņi is a special type of cheese with caraway seeds, made out of curd, and the traditional drink is beer. Many people make the cheese of Jāņi themselves; a few also make their own beer.
Representatives of Latvian emergency services often warn that Jāņi can be harmful to health because of the amounts of food and alcoholic beverages consumed, as well as maltreated fires. Additionally, incidents of drinking and driving are higher on this day than of any other in the year.

[[Māras]]

CATEGORIES: Christianity in Latvia, Public holidays in Latvia

In ancient Latvia, Māras or Māras diena (also Lielās Māras diena or Mātes diena) was a festival, celebrated on August 15, held in honor of Māra, the Latvian goddess.  It marked the midpoint between Jāņi (the summer solstice in June) and Miķeļi (end of harvest season). The exact date was probably already a result of Christian influence and identification of Māra with Mary, whose main festival (Assumption) falls on the same date since antiquity.

French and Saunders is a British sketch comedy television series written by and starring comic duo Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders. It is also the name by which the performers are known on the occasions when they appear elsewhere as a double act.
Widely popular in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the show was given one of the highest budgets in BBC history to create detailed spoofs and satires of popular culture, movies, celebrities and art. The duo continue to film holiday specials for the BBC, and both have been successful starring in their own shows. Saunders won a BAFTA, an Emmy Award and international acclaim for writing and playing the lead role of Edina Monsoon in Absolutely Fabulous, which led to her minor, cameo roles in the American sitcoms Roseanne and Friends. She won an American People's Choice Award for voicing the wicked Fairy Godmother in the DreamWorks animated film Shrek 2, but more recently she has written and starred in another two BBC sitcoms, Jam and Jerusalem and The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle.

She had a voice over role as Mrs. Beaver in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but more recently she has starred in Jam and Jerusalem, written by Saunders, and Lark Rise to Candleford, of which the fourth series has just been commissioned. For many years she became popular for her appearances in the Terry's Chocolate Orange adverts saying the famous line "It's not Terry's, it's mine!" and is currently the voice of W H Smith and Tesco adverts. She recently released her autobiography Dear Fatty, referring to Saunders, to whom she gave the nickname "Fatty".
In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, the duo were voted among the top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. Their last special, 2005's French and Saunders Christmas Celebrity Special, aired on 27 December 2005 on BBC One. In 2006, both Saunders and French announced that their sketch show was now dead, and that they had moved on to more age appropriate material.

His parentage is given as Poseidon by the nymph Melia, and he had a brother named Amycus, also a Bebrycian king.

Murder Most Horrid is a British dark comedy anthology series starring Dawn French. It was broadcast on BBC Two for four series runs, in 1991, 1994, 1996 and 1999.
Created by Paul Smith, who also co-created Colin's Sandwich (with Terry Kyan, as noted below) and has written for The Brittas Empire, among other programmes, the series starred French as a different character in each episode. Many episodes were directed by the noted director Bob Spiers, who also worked with French on The Comic Strip Presents... and French and Saunders.
Most episodes parodied the thriller and murder mystery genres with one notable episode lampooning the trials and tribulations of being a children's presenter in general, and Blue Peter in particular. In 1998, this episode ("Murder at Tea-Time") was repeated to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Blue Peter, as part of a section entitled "Spoof Peter", which also featured (among others) the Python skit "How to Do It".Here's one the BBC made 40 years earlier: Blue Peter Celebration. Retrieved 11 January 2008
Each episode was standalone, and the episodes were written by different writers or writing teams with several contributing multiple episodes across the four series. Among these writers, the pairing of series-creator Paul Smith with Terry Kyan (who had previously collaborated on Not the Nine O'Clock News and Alas Smith and Jones) is particularly notable.

Episodes in series 1 mostly opened with French selecting and reading from a book, usually a quotation actually or allegedly from Shakespeare; series 2 onward dropped this opening. The series' theme song, which featured at the end of the episode, was sung by Ruby Turner. The lyrics changed between episodes, the penultimate line always a word rhyming with "horrid", sometimes humorously forced. The murders ranged from the straightforward to the bizarre, with the murder weapon shown on a pedestal during the end credits.

The USA is the most successful team in international competition, winning medals in all seventeen Olympic tournaments it has entered, coming away with fourteen golds. Two of its gold medal-winning squads were inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as teams in August 2010—the 1960 team, which featured six Hall of Famers (4 players, 2 coaches), and the 1992 "Dream Team", featuring 14 Hall of Famers (11 players, 3 coaches).[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.hoophall.com/news/2010/4/5/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-class-of.html |title=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Announces Class of 2010 |publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |date=2010-04-05 |accessdate=2010-04-05[/tpl] The United States is currently ranked first in the FIBA World Rankings.
Traditionally composed of amateur players, a 1989 rule change by FIBA allowed USA Basketball to field teams with professional players. The first such team, known as the "Dream Team", won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, playing in the final against Croatia.The Oakland Press: Sports Columnists: The Dream Team is over and what's left is a nightmare[tpl]dead link|date=August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/sports/features/030128-globalnba.shtml |title=PopMatters Sports Feature | The Globalized Association |publisher=Popmatters.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27[/tpl]Dreaming about the Dream Team • vabulous69's Blog – FOX Sports Blogs
With the introduction of professionals, the team was able to spark a second run of dominance after capturing only a bronze medal in 1988. A team of professional players competed at the 1994 FIBA World Championship, finishing first. In 1996, 2000, 2008, and 2012 the USA again captured gold medals.
Facing increased competition, the USA failed to win a medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship, finishing sixth. The 2004 Summer Olympic team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal, a record that represented more losses in a single year than the country's Olympic teams had suffered in all previous Olympiads combined.
Determined to put an end to these failures, USA Basketball initiated a long-term project aimed at creating better, more cohesive teams. The USA won its first seven games at the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan before losing against Greece in the semi-finals, ending the competition with the bronze medal. The USA won gold two years later, though, at the 2008 Summer Olympics with a dominant performance. This success was followed up at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, where despite fielding a roster featuring no players from the 2008 Olympic team, the USA did not lose a single game en route to defeating host Turkey for the gold medal.  The USA continued this streak of dominance by going undefeated and capturing gold once more at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

In ancient Latvia, Meteņi was a festival celebrated on February 23.  The primary attraction was a feast which included all the parts of a pig, bread, barley and beer.  The people also went sledding.  The degree to which one celebrated Meteņi was believed to be proportional to the success of one's crops.  Thus, farmers and their families danced vigorously to ensure a good harvest.  The festival was sacred to Metenis, who was said to arrive on a sleigh on this holiday.

[[Jurģi]]

CATEGORIES: Public holidays in Latvia

In ancient Latvia, Jurģi was a festival held on April 23 (May 9 in the Gregorian calendar).  It was the beginning of summer, and the first day of outdoor farmwork and shepherding.  It was sacred to the god Usins.
Livestock were allowed to graze outside after this day.  In the morning, their stalls were locked, with a riding crop and a knife hanging above them because Ragana and other evil spirits were on the hunt the night before.  A black rooster was sacrificed to Usins, and then eaten by the man.  The blood of the rooster was sprinkled around the barns and the ground bones were scattered among the rushes.
The horses were bathed and brushed, but nothing else, in order to bring good luck.  They were not fed before the sunrise.  
The farmers gathered under an oak and then let out the livestock, sprinkled with ashes so that bees would not sting them.  Three pitchforks-full of manure were removed from the stones.  Some of the men were given eggs, boiled with hot stones, and these were thrown in shrubs or a knothole in an oak tree.  The horses drank the water left over from the baking to help them grow strong.
Cows' snouts were washed in milk, bringing an increased milk production.  A heavy dew on this day also increased milk production.
Wolves were warded away by tying a special knot with a sheep's tether and repeating magical words, and by refraining from chopping wood on this day.
If possible, washing in the morning snow was good luck.  Fires were not lit, warding away fires for the rest of the summer.  Washing one's face on this day would cause fires and all washing was done in a river.  Beer, bread and mead were laid out for the spirits.
Jurgi was often used for moving, preferably on a Saturday.  The movers brought the rushes, salt, bread, eggs (thrown onto the house, then sprinkled on the pigs), and wisps of hair from the animals from their old house.  Milk and brooms were not brought from the old house.  On the way to the new house, salt was sprinkled on the ground, preventing forgetfulness.  The new house was entered with the sun at the back and a book or bottle was left in one corner of the house, which was thoroughly swept, to ward off evil spirits.
At night, there was a feast, supposedly joined by Usins himself.  Chicken, eggs and beer were consumed.  Usins was offered soil, bread and bacon.

[[Warhammer 40,000]]

CATEGORIES: Warhammer 40,000, Miniatures games, Origins Award winners

Warhammer 40,000 (informally known as Warhammer 40K, WH40K or simply 40K) is a tabletop miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop, set in a dystopian science-fantasy "grimdark" universe. Warhammer 40,000 was created by Rick Priestley in 1987 as the futuristic companion to Warhammer Fantasy Battle, sharing many game mechanics. Expansions for Warhammer 40,000 are released periodically which give rules for urban, planetary siege and large-scale combat. The game is in its sixth edition, which was published at the end of June 2012.
Players can assemble and paint individual, 28 millimetre (approximately 1 inch) scale miniature figures that represent futuristic soldiers, creatures and vehicles of war. These figurines are collected to compose squads in armies that can be pitted against those of other players. Each player brings a roughly equal complement of units to a tabletop battlefield with handmade or purchased terrain. The players then decide upon a scenario, ranging from simple skirmishes to complex battles involving defended objectives and reinforcements. The models are physically moved around the table and the actual distance between models plays a role in the outcome of combat. Play is turn-based, with various outcomes determined by tables and the roll of dice. Battles may last anywhere from a half-hour to a whole weekend, and battles may be strung together to form campaigns. Many game and hobby stores host games, and official tournaments are held on a regular basis, such as the Throne of Skulls.
Warhammer 40,000's space-fantasy setting spans a vast fictional universe set in the far future of the forty-first millennium. Its various factions and races include the Imperium of Man, a decentralized yet totalitarian interstellar empire that has ruled the vast majority of humanity for millennia, the Orks (similar to Warhammer Fantasy Orcs), the Eldar (similar to Elves in Warhammer Fantasy Battle), and Daemons (very similar in both universes, although the precise natures of their creation and existence vary slightly), among others. The background and playing rules of each faction are covered in the game's rule books and supplemental army 'codex', along with articles in the Games Workshop magazines, White Dwarf and Imperial Armour. The game's miniatures are produced by Citadel Miniatures and Forge World.
The Warhammer 40,000 setting is used for several tabletop games, video games, and works of fiction, including licensed works published by Black Library, a subsidiary of Games Workshop. The events and characters are described below using in-universe tone.

In the study of language and literary style, a vulgarism is an expression or usage considered non-standard or characteristic of uneducated speech or writing. In colloquial or lexical English, "vulgarism" or "vulgarity" may be synonymous with profanity or obscenity, but a linguistic or literary vulgarism encompasses a broader category of perceived fault not confined to scatological or sexual offensiveness.

[[Trailer park]]

CATEGORIES: Neighborhoods, Urban geography, American society

A trailer park is a semi-permanent or permanent area for mobile homes or travel trailers.  Advantages include lower cost compared to other housing, and the ability to move to a new area more quickly and easily, for example when changing jobs to a distant place while keeping the same home.  The mobile home industry led by Warren Buffett has resisted the application of building codes to mobile homes, an exemption that has allowed the industry to reap record [tpl]CN|date=April 2014[/tpl] windfall profits for decades.
Trailer parks, especially in American culture, are stereotypically viewed as lower income housing whose occupants live at or below the poverty line, have low social status and lead a desultory and deleterious lifestyle. Despite the advances in trailer home technology, the trailer park image survives, as evoked by a statement from Presidential adviser James Carville who, in the course of one of the Bill Clinton White House political scandals, suggested "Drag $100 bills through trailer parks, there's no telling what you'll find"," in reference to Paula Jones. It is also seen in the Canadian mockumentary Trailer Park Boys.
Tornadoes and hurricanes often inflict serious damage on trailer parks, usually because the structures are not secured to the ground and their construction is significantly less able to withstand high wind forces than regular houses. However, most modern manufactured homes are built to withstand high winds as well[tpl]cn|date=September 2013[/tpl] as a mainstream home[tpl]what|date=September 2013[/tpl], using hurricane straps and proper foundations.

William Manuel "Bill" Johnson (August 10, 1872 – December 3, 1972), was an American jazz musician, considered the father of the "slap" style of string bass playing.
Johnson claimed to have started "slapping" the strings of his bass (a more vigorous technique than the classical pizzicato) after he accidentally broke his bow on the road with his band in northern Louisiana in the early 1910s. Other New Orleans string bass players picked up this style, and spread it across the country with the spread of New Orleans Jazz.
Johnson was founder and manager of the first jazz band to leave New Orleans and tour widely in the 1910s, The Original Creole Orchestra.
In Chicago in the early 1920s he assembled King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, considered perhaps the best of the early ensemble style jazz bands. He taught younger Chicago musicians (including Milt Hinton) his "slap" style of string bass playing. He made many fine recordings in Chicago in the late 1920s. 
Johnson continued to play with various jazz bands and orchestras into the early 1950s, sometimes working under other names. He was also involved in the import/export business along the USA-Mexico border.
Johnson's brother Ollie "Dink" Johnson was also a noted musician and his sister Anita Gonzales was common-law wife or perhaps married to Ferdinand "Jelly Roll" Morton during his stays in California.
Bill Johnson died in New Braunfels, Texas, at the age of 100.

[[Blackface]]

Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used by performers to represent a black person. It is often considered offensive, because it can imply stereotyped caricature of black people as in minstrel shows, and later vaudeville. The practice gained popularity during the 19th century and contributed to the proliferation of stereotypes such as the "happy-go-lucky darky on the plantation" or the "dandified coon".For the "darky"/"coon" distinction see, for example, note 34 on p. 167 of Edward Marx and Laura E. Franey's annotated edition of Yone Noguchi, The American Diary of a Japanese Girl, Temple University Press, 2007, ISBN 1-59213-555-2. See also Lewis A. Erenberg (1984), Steppin' Out: New York Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture, 1890–1930, University of Chicago Press, p. 73, ISBN 0-226-21515-6. For more on the "darky" stereotype, see J. Ronald Green (2000), Straight Lick: The Cinema of Oscar Micheaux, Indiana University Press, pp. 134, 206, ISBN 0-253-33753-4; p. 151 of the same work also alludes to the specific "coon" archetype. In 1848, blackface minstrel shows were an American national art of the time, translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience.William J. Mahar, Behind the Burnt Cork Mask: Early Blackface Minstrelsy and Antebellum American Popular Culture, University of Illinois Press (1998), p. 9, ISBN 0-252-06696-0. Early in the 20th century, blackface branched off from the minstrel show and became a form in its own right, until it ended in the United States with the U.S. Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.Frank W. Sweet, A History of the Minstrel Show, Backintyme (2000), p. 25, ISBN 0-939479-21-4
Blackface was an important performance tradition in the American theater for roughly 100 years beginning around 1830. It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the US, occurring on primetime TV as late as 1978 (The Black and White Minstrel Show)[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=62[/tpl] and 1981.[tpl]cite episode |title=Roots? |episodelink= |series=Are You Being Served? |serieslink=Are You Being Served? |credits= |network=BBC1 |station= |airdate=1981-12-24 |season= |seriesno=8 |number=8 |minutes= [/tpl] In both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. White blackface performers in the past used burnt cork and later greasepaint or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, black artists also performed in blackface.
Stereotypes embodied in the stock characters of blackface minstrels not only played a significant role in cementing and proliferating racist images, attitudes, and perceptions worldwide, but also in popularizing black culture.Lott, Eric. "Blackface and Blackness: The Minstrel Show in American Culture", in Annemarie Bean, James V. Hatch, and Brooks McNamara (eds), Inside the minstrel mask: readings in nineteenth-century blackface minstrelsy, pp. 5-6. In some quarters, the caricatures that were the legacy of blackface persist to the present day and are a cause of ongoing controversy. Another view is that "blackface is a form of cross-dressing in which one puts on the insignias of a sex, class, or race that stands in binary opposition to one's own."Rogin, Michael (University of California Press 1998) Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot (p. 30)
By the mid-20th century, changing attitudes about race and racism effectively ended the prominence of blackface makeup used in performance in the U.S. and elsewhere. It remains in relatively limited use as a theatrical device and is more commonly used today as social commentary or satire. Perhaps the most enduring effect of blackface is the precedent it established in the introduction of African-American culture to an international audience, albeit through a distorted lens.[tpl]Harvnb|Lott|1993|pp=17–18[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Watkins|1999|p=82[/tpl] Blackface's groundbreaking appropriation,Inside the minstrel mask: Readings in nineteenth-century blackface minstrelsy by Bean, Annemarie, James V.
