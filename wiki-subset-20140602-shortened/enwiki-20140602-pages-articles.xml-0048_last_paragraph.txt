[[North American Industry Classification System]]
CATEGORIES: Industrial classifications, Industry, Trilateral relations of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, Statistics Canada, United States Office of Management and Budget

The North American Industry Classification System or NAICS (pronounced "nakes"http://www.virtualpet.com/industry/naics/naics.htm) is used by business and government to classify business establishments according to type of economic activity (process of production) in Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America.  It has largely replaced the older Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system; however, certain government departments and agencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), still use the SIC codes.
An establishment is typically a single physical location, though administratively distinct operations at a single location may be treated as distinct establishments.  Each establishment is classified to an industry according to the primary business activity taking place there.  NAICS does not offer guidance on the classification of enterprises (companies) which are composed of multiple establishments.

CATEGORIES: Peptidase, EC 3.4, Posttranslational modification

A protease (also termed peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis, that is, begins protein catabolism by hydrolysis of the peptide bonds that link amino acids together in the polypeptide chain forming the protein. Proteases have evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms. Proteases can be found in animals, plants, bacteria, archea and viruses.

Prince Rogers Nelson (born June 7, 1958), known by his mononym Prince, is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and actor. He has produced ten platinum albums and thirty Top 40 singles during his career.[tpl]cite book|author=Tom Larson|title=History of Rock and Roll|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vGJ7XmA8rjIC&pg=PA243|accessdate=July 25, 2013|date=February 1, 2004|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7872-9969-9|page=243[/tpl] He has written several hundred songs[tpl]cite web| last = Henderson| first = Alex | title = Prince biography|work=Allmusic| url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5182|pure_url=yes[/tpl][/tpl] and produces and records his own music for his own music label. In addition, he has promoted the careers of Sheila E., Carmen Electra, the Time and Vanity 6, and his songs have been recorded by these artists and others, including Chaka Khan, The Bangles, Sinéad O'Connor, and Kim Basinger.
Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music at an early age, writing his first song at age seven. After recording songs with his cousin's band 94 East, seventeen-year-old Prince recorded several unsuccessful demo tapes before releasing his debut album, For You, in 1978. His 1979 album, Prince, went platinum due to the success of the singles "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?" and "I Wanna Be Your Lover". His next three records, Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982) continued his success, showcasing Prince's trademark of prominently sexual lyrics and incorporation of elements of funk, dance and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as the Revolution and released the album Purple Rain, which served as the soundtrack to his film debut of the same name.
After releasing the albums Around the World in a Day (1985) and Parade (1986), The Revolution disbanded and Prince released the critically acclaimed double album Sign "O" the Times (1987) as a solo artist. He released three more solo albums before debuting the New Power Generation band in 1991. After changing his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol (13px), also known as the "Love Symbol", in 1993, he began releasing new albums at a faster pace to remove himself from contractual obligations to Warner Bros; he released five records between 1994 and 1996 before signing to Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as "Prince" once again. He has released thirteen albums since then, including his latest, 20Ten, released in 2010.
Prince has a wide vocal range and is known for his flamboyant stage presence and costumes. He has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2011/apr/12/prince-brings-early-valentines-day-gift-to-nyc/|title=Prince brings early Valentine's Day gift to NYC|first=New York Amsterdam News|last=Misani|publisher=New York Amsterdam News|date=2011-04-12|accessdate=2012-06-19[/tpl] He has won seven Grammy Awards,[tpl]cite web| title = Grammy search database|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences | url = http://www2.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/| accessdate =February 27, 2010[/tpl] a Golden Globe,[tpl]cite web| title = Golden Globe Awards| work=goldenglobes.org| url = http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/film/26062| accessdate =February 27, 2010[/tpl] and an Academy Award.[tpl]cite web| title = Nominees & Winners for the 57th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences| url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1980-1989/57nominees.html| accessdate =February 27, 2010[/tpl] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the first year he was eligible.[tpl]cite web| title = Tavis Smiley| work=pbs.org| date = April 27, 2009| url = http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200904/20090427.html[/tpl] Rolling Stone has ranked Prince No. 27 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[tpl]cite web| last = Thompson | first = Ahmir | title = 100 Greatest Artists |work=Rolling Stone| date = March 24, 2004| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/prince-20110419[/tpl] Prince's music has been influenced by rock, R&B, soul, funk, hip hop, blues, new wave, electronica, disco, psychedelia, folk, jazz, and pop.

[[Geranium]]
CATEGORIES: Flowers, Geranium, Garden plants

Geranium is a genus of 422 species of flowering annual, biennial, and perennial plants that are commonly known as the cranesbills. They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, but mostly in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region. The long, palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.
The genus name is derived from the Greek [tpl]lang|gr|γέρανος[/tpl] (géranos) or [tpl]lang|gr|γερανός[/tpl] (geranós) ‘crane’. The English name ‘cranesbill’ derives from the appearance of the fruit capsule of some of the species.  Species in the Geranium genus have a distinctive mechanism for seed dispersal. This consists of a beak-like column which springs open when ripe and casts the seeds some distance. The fruit capsule consists of five cells, each containing one seed, joined to a column produced from the centre of the old flower. The common name ‘cranesbill’ comes from the shape of the unsprung column, which in some species is long and looks like the bill of a crane. However, many species in this genus do not have a long beak-like column.
Geraniums are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail and mouse moth.
 
The species Geranium viscosissimum (sticky geranium) is considered to be protocarnivorous.

[[De Moivre's formula]]

CATEGORIES: Theorems in complex analysis, Articles containing proofs

In mathematics, de Moivre's formula  (a.k.a. De Moivre's theorem and De Moivre's identity), named after Abraham de Moivre, states that for any complex number (and, in particular, for any real number) x and integer n it holds that
While the formula was named after de Moivre, he never explicitly stated it in his works.[tpl]cite book |first1=Margaret L. |last1=Lial, |first2=John |last2=Hornsby |first3=David I. |last3=Schneider |first4=Daniels |last4=Callie J. |title=College Algebra and Trigonometry|edition=4th |year=2008|location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Addison Wesley|isbn=9780321497444|accessdate=18 August 2012|page=792[/tpl]
The formula is important because it connects complex numbers (i stands for the imaginary unit (i2 = −1)) and trigonometry. The expression cos x + i sin x is sometimes abbreviated to cis x.
By expanding the left hand side and then comparing the real and imaginary parts under the assumption that x is real, it is possible to derive useful expressions for cos(nx) and sin(nx) in terms of cos x and sin x. Furthermore, one can use a generalization of this formula to find explicit expressions for the nth roots of unity, that is, complex numbers z such that zn = 1.

Abraham de Moivre (26 May 1667 in Vitry-le-François, Champagne, France — 27 November 1754 in London, England; [tpl]IPA-fr|abʁaam də mwavʁ[/tpl]) was a French mathematician known for de Moivre's formula, one of those that link complex numbers and trigonometry, and for his work on the normal distribution and probability theory. He was a friend of Isaac Newton, Edmund Halley, and James Stirling. Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux.
De Moivre wrote a book on probability theory, The Doctrine of Chances, said to have been prized by gamblers. De Moivre first discovered Binet's formula, the closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers linking the nth power of the golden ratio φ to the nth Fibonacci number.

the Roman dictator Julius Caesar, his assassination and the defeat of the conspirators at the Battle of Philippi. It is one of several plays written by Shakespeare based on true events from Roman history, which also include Coriolanus and Antony and Cleopatra.
Although the title is Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar is not the most visible character in its action; he appears in only five scenes. Marcus Brutus speaks more than four times as many lines and the central psychological drama is his struggle between the conflicting demands of honour, patriotism and friendship.

[[Circulatory system]]

CATEGORIES: Circulatory system, Exercise physiology

The circulatory system is an organ system that permits blood and lymph circulation to transport nutrients (such as amino acids and electrolytes), oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, blood cells, etc. to and from cells in the body to nourish it and help to fight diseases, stabilize body temperature and pH, and to maintain homeostasis.
This system is often seen as strictly as a blood distribution network, but some consider the circulatory system to be composed collectively of the cardiovascular system, which distributes blood, and the lymphatic system, which circulates lymph.[tpl]DorlandsDict|nine/000951445|circulatory system[/tpl] Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system, carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body tissues. Lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been filtered from the interstitial fluid (between cells) and returned to the lymphatic system.  The cardiovascular (from Latin words meaning 'heart'-'vessel') system comprises the blood, heart, and blood vessels.[tpl]DorlandsDict|eight/000105264|cardiovascular system[/tpl] The lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system, which returns filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid (between cells) as lymph.
While humans, as well as other vertebrates, have a closed cardiovascular system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system. The lymphatic system, on the other hand, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to get returned to the blood.[tpl]cite book|author=Sherwood, Lauralee |title=Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I9qH3eZ1pP0C&pg=PT401 |year=2011 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-1-133-10893-1 |pages=401–[/tpl] The more primitive, diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems.

[[Microwave auditory effect]]

CATEGORIES: Espionage, Human physiology, Non-lethal weapons, Cognitive neuroscience, Hearing, Mind control, Radio spectrum

The microwave auditory effect, also known as the microwave hearing effect or the Frey effect, consists of audible clicks (or, with modulation, whole words) induced by pulsed/modulated  microwave frequencies. The clicks are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II. These induced sounds are not audible to other people nearby. The microwave auditory effect was later discovered to be inducible with shorter-wavelength portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. During the Cold War era, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish[tpl]cite journal| url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/17/4/689.abstract?sid=7c073ad2-6324-4b47-94e1-124dc0a5f154 | journal=Journal of Applied Physiology| volume=17 |pages=689–692 |year=1962| title=Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy |author=Allan H.

Pulsed microwave radiation can be heard by some workers; the irradiated personnel perceive auditory sensations of clicking or buzzing. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of auditory apparatus.[tpl]cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Barry S.|last2=Wagner|first2=Gregory R.|last3=Rest|first3=Kathleen M.|title=Preventing occupational disease and injury|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pM7DNkbVyQgC&pg=PA428&dq=microwave+injury&cd=26#v=onepage&q=microwave%20injury&f=false|year=2005|publisher=American Public Health Association|isbn=978-0-87553-043-7|page=428[/tpl] The auditory system response occurs at least from 200 MHz to at least 3 GHz. In the tests, repetition rate of 50 Hz was used, with pulse width between 10–70 microseconds. The perceived loudness was found to be linked to the peak power density instead of average power density.  At 1.245 GHz, the peak power density for perception was below 80 mW/cm2.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] However, competing theories explain the results of interferometric holography tests differently. http://www.sciencemag.org/content/209/4461/1144.extract?sid=f514230e-1373-4da5-ad36-3689f428e21b

In 2008, Sierra Nevada Corporation, a contractor that worked on the Navy's MEDUSA research, announced that they were seeking funding from the US Department of Defense to build demonstration and transportable versions of the system.

Emma, by Jane Austen, is a novel about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance. The novel was first published in December 1815. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian-Regency England; she also creates a lively comedy of manners among her characters.
Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, "I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like."Austen-Leigh, James Edward. A Memoir of Jane Austen. 1926. Ed. R. W. Chapman. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967. p. 157 In the very first sentence she introduces the title character as "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich." Emma, however, is also rather spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.

Established in 1973, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is an organization of 15 Caribbean nations and dependencies. CARICOM's main purposes are to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and to coordinate foreign policy.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-15757--63-63--.html |title=CARICOM countries will speak with one voice in meetings with US and Canadian leaders |accessdate=2009-04-16 |first=Oscar |last=Ramjeet |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-04-16 |work=Caribbean Net News |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market); and handling regional trade disputes. The secretariat headquarters is based in Georgetown, Guyana.
Since the establishment of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) by the mainly English-speaking parts of the Caribbean region, CARICOM has become multilingual in practice with the addition of Dutch speaking-Suriname on 4 July 1995 and French- (and Haitian Kreyòl-) speaking Haiti on 2 July 2002. Furthermore, it was suggested that Spanish should also become a working language.http://www.caricom.org/jsp/speeches/awardceremony_outstandingstudents_applewhaite.jsp?null&prnf=1 In July 2012, CARICOM announced that they were considering making French and Dutch official languages.COMMUNIQUÉ ISSUED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE THIRTY-THIRD REGULAR MEETING OF THE CONFERENCE OF HEADS OF GOVERNMENT OF THE CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY, 4-6 JULY 2012, GROS ISLET, SAINT LUCIA "OFFICIAL LANGUAGE - Heads of Government recognized that, although English was the official language of the Community, the facility to communicate in their languages could enhance the participation of Haiti and Suriname in the integration process. They therefore requested the conduct of a study to examine the possibilities and implications, including costs, of introducing French and Dutch."
In 2001, the heads of government signed a Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas thus clearing the way for the transformation of the idea for a Common Market aspect of CARICOM into instead a Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty among member states includes the establishment and implementation of the Caribbean Court of Justice.  Since 2013 the CARICOM-bloc along with the Dominican Republic is tied to the European Commission via an Economic Partnership Agreements known as CARIFORUM signed in 2008.Caribbean moves afoot to restructure CARIFORUM,  Peter Richards, Tuesday April 12th 2011  The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment.

The city of Panama was founded on August 15, 1519, by Spanish conquistador Pedro Arias Dávila. The city was the starting point for expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the history of the American continent, leading to the fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo City, through which passed most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas.
On January 28, 1671, the city was destroyed by a fire when pirate Henry Morgan sacked and set fire to it. The city was formally reestablished two years later on January 21, 1673, in a peninsula located [tpl]convert|8|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] from the original settlement. The site of the previously devastated city is still in ruins and is now a popular tourist attraction known as Panama Viejo.

Sisal ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|s|ə|l[/tpl]An Anglo-Latin pronunciation. OED: "Sisal".), with the botanical name Agave sisalana, is a species of Agave native to southern Mexico but widely cultivated and naturalized in many other countries. It yields a stiff fibre used in making various products. The term sisal may refer either to the plant's common name or the fibre, depending on the context. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "sisal hemp", because for centuries hemp was a major source for fibre, and others were named after it.
The sisal fibre is traditionally used for rope and twine, and has many other uses, including: paper, cloth, wall coverings, carpets, and dartboards.

The rambutan ([tpl]IPAc-en|r|æ|m|ˈ|b|uː|t|ən[/tpl]; taxonomic name: Nephelium lappaceum) is a medium-sized tropical tree in the family Sapindaceae. The fruit produced by the tree is also known as rambutan.
According to popular belief and the origin of its name, rambutan is native to Indonesia and Malaysia. The earliest record of rambutan trees show that they were cultivated by the Malayan jungle tribes around their temporary settlements, a practice followed to date.[tpl]cite web |url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_208_2004-12-16.html |title=Rambutan |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Singapore Infopedia |accessdate=27 June 2012[/tpl] Rambutan trees grow naturally in Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, although its precise natural distribution is unknown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rambutan.com | title=The Rambutan Information Website | publisher=Panoramic Fruit Farm, Puerto Rico | accessdate=25 June 2011[/tpl] It is closely related to several other edible tropical fruits including the lychee, longan, and mamoncillo. It is native to the Indonesian Archipelago,[tpl]cite web|url=http://importfood.com/inforambutan.html |title=Rambutan fruit, recipes, Thai tropical fruit information |publisher=Importfood.com |date= |accessdate=16 August 2010[/tpl] from where it spread westwards to Thailand, Burma, Sri Lanka and India; northwards to Vietnam, and the Philippines.
A species regularly sold in Costa Rican markets may be known as "wild" rambutan. Yellow in color, it is smaller than the usual red variety. The flesh exposed when the outer skin is peeled off is sweet and sour, slightly grape-like and gummy to the taste. In Panama and Costa Rican Spanish, it is known as mamón chino ("Chinese Sucker") due to its Asian origin and the likeness of the edible part with Melicoccus bijugatus. The fruit has been successfully transplanted by grafting in Puerto Rico.
Rambutans are a non-climacteric fruit—that is, they ripen only on the tree.

[[Evolutionary developmental biology]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology, Developmental biology

Evolutionary developmental biology (evolution of development or informally, evo-devo) is a field of biology that compares the developmental processes of different organisms to determine the ancestral relationship between them, and to discover how developmental processes evolved.  It addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic development; how modifications of development and developmental processes lead to the production of novel features, such as the evolution of feathers; the role of developmental plasticity in evolution; how ecology impacts development and evolutionary change; and the developmental basis of homoplasy and homology.[tpl]cite journal | last=Hall |first=Brian K. | title=Evo-devo or devo-evo—does it matter | journal=Evolution & Development | year=2000 | pages=177–178 | issue=4 | volume=2 | doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00003e.x | pmid=11252559 | ref=harv[/tpl]
Although interest in the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny extends back to the nineteenth century, the contemporary field of evo-devo has gained impetus from the discovery of genes regulating embryonic development in model organisms.  General hypotheses remain hard to test because organisms differ so much in shape and form.
Nevertheless, it now appears that just as evolution tends to create new genes from parts of old genes (molecular economy), evo-devo demonstrates that evolution alters developmental processes to create new and novel structures from the old gene networks (such as bone structures of the jaw deviating to the ossicles of the middle ear) or will conserve (molecular economy) a similar program in a host of organisms such as eye development genes in molluscs, insects, and vertebrates.
 Initially the major interest has been in the evidence of homology in the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate body plan and organ development. However subsequent approaches include developmental changes associated with speciation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pennisi, E | title = EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY:Evo-Devo Enthusiasts Get Down to Details| journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5595 | pages=953–955. | year =2002  | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5595.953 | pmid = 12411686 | ref = harv[/tpl]

At one time extinct in the wild (in Mongolia, the last wild Przewalski's horses had been seen in 1966), it has been reintroduced to its native habitat in Mongolia at the Khustain Nuruu National Park, Takhin Tal Nature Reserve, and Khomiin Tal. The taxonomic position is still debated, and some taxonomists treat Przewalski's horse as a species, Equus przewalskii.
Common names for this equine include Asian wild horse, Przewalski's wild horse, Mongolian wild horse, and tahki. Historical but obsolete names include true tarpan and Mongolian tarpan. The horse is named after the Russian geographer and explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky.
Most "wild" horses today, such as the American Mustang or the Australian Brumby, are actually feral horses descended from domesticated animals that escaped and adapted to life in the wild. In contrast, Przewalski's horse has never been domesticated and remains a truly wild animal today. Przewalski's horse is one of three known subspecies of Equus ferus, the others being the domesticated horse, Equus ferus caballus and the extinct tarpan (Equus ferus ferus). The Przewalski's horse is considered the only remaining truly wild horse in the world.  There are still a number of other wild equines, including three species of zebra and various subspecies of the African wild ass, onager (including the Mongolian wild ass), and kiang.

[[Drupe]]
CATEGORIES: Fruit morphology, Edible nuts and seeds, Plants with indehiscent fruit

In botany, a drupe is an indehiscent fruit in which an outer fleshy part (exocarp, or skin; and mesocarp, or flesh) surrounds a shell (the pit, stone, or pyrene) of hardened endocarp with a seed (kernel) inside. These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, lignified stone (or pit) is derived from the ovary wall of the flower. In an aggregate fruit composed of small, individual drupes, each individual is termed a drupelet. 
Other fleshy fruits may have a stony enclosure that comes from the seed coat surrounding the seed, but such fruits are not drupes.
Some flowering plants that produce drupes are coffee, jujube, mango, olive, most palms (including date, coconut and oil palms), pistachio, white sapote, and all members of the genus Prunus, including the almond (in which the mesocarp is somewhat leathery), apricot, cherry, damson, nectarine, peach, and plum.

[[Tapioca]]

Tapioca ([tpl]IPA-pt|tɐpiˈɔkɐ[/tpl]) is a starch extracted from Manioc (Manihot esculenta). This species is native to Northern Brazil but spread throughout the South American continent. The plant was carried by Portuguese and Spanish explorers to most of the West Indies, and continents of Africa and Asia, including the Philippines and Taiwan; it is cultivated worldwide.
In Brazil, the plant (cassava) is named mandioca, while its starch is called tapioca. The name tapioca is derived from the word tipi'óka, its name in the Tupí language, which was spoken by the natives when the Portuguese first arrived in the Northeast of Brazil. This Tupí word refers to the process by which the cassava starch is made edible. As the food and word were taken to other areas, "tapioca" was also applied to similar preparations made with other esculents.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
In the Philippines, tapioca is often confused with sago, as the sap of the sago palm is often part of its preparation. A coarsely granular substance obtained by heating, and thus partly changing, the moistened starch obtained from the roots of the cassava. It is much used in puddings and as a thickening for soups. In India, the term "tapioca-root" is used to represent the root of the plant (cassava), rather than the starch. It is widely named as  "കപ്പ" (kappa) in Malayalam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kissankerala.net/kissan/kissancontents/tapioca.htm|title=Tuber Information|publisher=Kissan Kerala[/tpl] In Vietnam, it is called bột năng. In the past, the starch was extracted from Maranta arundinacea (Mì tinh, hoàng tinh). In Indonesia, it is called singkong. In Malaysia, it is called Ubi Kayu.
Tapioca is a staple food in some regions, and it is used worldwide as a thickening agent in various foods. It is a gluten-free food.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=T.|last2=Dennis|first2=M.|last3=Higgins|first3=L. A.|last4=Lee|first4=A. R.|last5=Sharrett|first5=M.

Aaron Burr, Jr. (February 6, 1756 – September 14, 1836) was the third Vice President of the United States (1801–1805); he served during President Thomas Jefferson's first term.
After serving as a Continental Army officer in the Revolutionary War, Burr became a successful lawyer and politician. He was elected twice to the New York State Assembly (1784–1785, 1798–1799),[tpl]Cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B001133 |title=Burr, Aaron |work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress |accessdate=2009-11-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091202121217/http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B001133| archivedate= 2 December 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] was appointed New York State Attorney General (1789–1791), was chosen as a United States Senator (1791–1797) from the state of New York, and reached the apex of his career as Vice President.
The highlight of Burr's tenure as President of the Senate (one of his few official duties as Vice President) was the Senate's first impeachment trial, of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. In 1804, the last full year of his single term as Vice President, Burr killed his political rival Alexander Hamilton in a famous duel. Burr was never tried for the illegal duel, and all charges against him were eventually dropped. Hamilton's death ended Burr's political career.
After leaving Washington, Burr traveled west seeking new opportunities, both economic and political. His activities eventually led to his arrest on charges of treason in 1807. Although the subsequent trial resulted in acquittal, Burr's western schemes left him with large debts and few influential friends. In a final quest for grand opportunities, he left the United States for Europe. He remained overseas until 1812, when he returned to the United States to practice law in New York City. There he spent the remainder of his long life in relative obscurity.

[[Sago]]

CATEGORIES: Tropical agriculture, Staple foods, Food ingredients, Edible thickening agents, Oceanian cuisine, Papua New Guinean cuisine, Indian cuisine

Sago [tpl]IPAc-en|'|s|eI|g|oU[/tpl] is a starch extracted in the spongy centre, or pith, of various tropical palm stems, especially Metroxylon sagu. It is a major staple food for the lowland peoples of New Guinea and the Moluccas, where it is called saksak, rabia and sagu. A type of flour, called sago flour, is made from sago. The largest supply of sago comes from the East Indies. Large quantities of sago are sent to Europe and North America for cooking purposes. It is traditionally cooked and eaten in various forms, such as rolled into balls, mixed with boiling water to form a paste, or as a pancake. Sago is often produced commercially in the form of "pearls". Sago pearls can be boiled with water or milk and sugar to make a sweet sago pudding.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mycookinghut.com/2010/05/23/sago-pudding-with-palm-sugar-sago-gula-melaka/ |title=Sago Pudding with Palm Sugar (Sago Gula Melaka) |publisher=mycookinghut.com |accessdate=9 March 2011[/tpl] Sago pearls are similar in appearance to tapioca pearls and the two may be used interchangeably in some dishes.
The name sago is also sometimes used for starch extracted from other sources, especially the sago cycad, Cycas revoluta. The sago cycad is also commonly known (confusingly) as the sago palm, although this is a misnomer as cycads are not palms. Extracting edible starch from the sago cycad requires special care due to the poisonous nature of cycads. Cycad sago is used for many of the same purposes as palm sago. In Sri Lanka it is known as sawu or sau (Sinhalese: සව්) and is used to prepare a congee named sawu kenda (Sinhalese: සව් කැඳ). In India, it is manufactured from extract of 'cassava' i.e. tapioca-root, and popularly known as Tapioca Sago - Sabudana (Urdu: سابودانا;Hindi: साबुदाना; Gujarati: સાબુદાણા; Telugu: సగ్గు బియ్యం).
The fruit of palm trees from which the sago is produced is not allowed to ripen fully. The full ripening completes the life cycle of the tree and exhausts the starch centre to produce the seeds. It leaves a hollow shell and causes the tree to die. The palms are cut down when they are about 15 years old, just before they are ready to flower. The stems, which grow to 30 feet (9 metres high), are split out. The starch pith is taken from the stems and ground to powder. A single palm yields about 800 pounds (360 kilograms) of starch. The powder is kneaded in water over a cloth or sieve. It passes into a trough where it settles. After a few washings, the flour is ready to be used in cooking.

Vitales is sister to the clade of all that must be included in the rosids and its inclusion is optional. In APG III, it was included.
There is considerable overlap between the two definitions. Some apparent differences are the result of more broadly drawn orders in the second. Apiales, Cornales, Proteales and Santalales, and parts of Rafflesiales (sensu Cronquist) are excluded from the second, and many groups from Cronquist's Hamamelidae and Dillenidae are included.
In both senses, the term "rosid" applies, as an adjective and noun, to members of the group. In the APG III system, which eschewed formal botanical names between the ranks of class and order, the term "rosids" is used to define an informal clade corresponding to Rosidae as defined in the Phylocode.

Banco Ambrosiano was an Italian bank that collapsed in 1982. At the centre of the bank's failure was its chairman, Roberto Calvi and his membership in the illegal Masonic Lodge Propaganda Due (aka P2). Vatican Bank was Banco Ambrosiano's main shareholder, and the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978 is rumored to be linked to the Ambrosiano scandal. Vatican Bank was also accused of funneling covert United States funds to Solidarity and the Contras through Banco Ambrosiano.

A sidereal year is the time taken by the Earth to orbit the Sun once with respect to the fixed stars. Hence it is also the time taken for the Sun to return to the same position with respect to the fixed stars after apparently travelling once around the ecliptic.  This differs from the solar or  tropical year which has length equal to the time interval between vernal equinoxes in successive years. It was equal to [tpl]nowrap|365.256363004 SI daysIERS EOP PC Useful constants Each of these days contains 86400 SI seconds.[/tpl] at noon 1 January 2000 (J2000.0).

The Situationist International (SI) was an international organization of social revolutionaries, the exclusive membership of which was made up of avant-garde artists, intellectuals, and political theorists, active from its formation in 1957 to its dissolution in 1972.[tpl]cite book | last=Plant | first=Sadie | title=The Most Radical Gesture | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-415-06222-0[/tpl]
The intellectual foundations of the Situationist International were derived primarily from anti-authoritarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century, particularly Dada and Surrealism. Overall, situationist theory represented an attempt to synthesize this diverse field of theoretical disciplines into a modern and comprehensive critique of mid-20th century advanced capitalism. The situationists recognized that capitalism had changed since Marx's formative writings, but maintained that his analysis of the capitalist mode of production remained fundamentally correct; they rearticulated and expanded upon several classical Marxist concepts, such as his theory of alienation. In their expanded interpretation of Marxist theory, the situationists asserted that the misery of social alienation and commodity fetishism were no longer limited to the fundamental components of capitalist society, but had now in advanced capitalism spread themselves to every aspect of life and culture. They resolutely rejected the idea that advanced capitalism's apparent successes—such as technological advancement, increased income, and increased leisure—could ever outweigh the social dysfunction and degradation of everyday life that it simultaneously inflicted.
Essential to situationist theory was the concept of the spectacle, a unified critique of advanced capitalism of which a primary concern was the progressively increasing tendency towards the expression and mediation of social relations through objects. The situationists believed that the shift from individual expression through directly lived experiences, or the first-hand fulfillment of authentic desires, to individual expression by proxy through the exchange or consumption of commodities, or passive second-hand alienation, inflicted significant and far-reaching damage to the quality of human life for both individuals and society. Another important concept of situationist theory was the primary means of counteracting the spectacle; the construction of situations, moments of life deliberately constructed for the purpose of reawakening and pursuing authentic desires, experiencing the feeling of life and adventure, and the liberation of everyday life.Guy Debord (1958) Definitions. Internationale Situationniste #1 (Paris, June 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.
When the Situationist International was first formed, it had a predominantly artistic focus; emphasis was placed on concepts like unitary urbanism and psychogeography. Gradually, however, that focus shifted more towards revolutionary and political theory. The Situationist International reached the apex of its creative output and influence in 1967 and 1968, with the former marking the publication of the two most significant texts of the situationist movement, The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord and The Revolution of Everyday Life by Raoul Vaneigem. The expressed writing and political theory of the two aforementioned texts, along with other situationist publications, proved greatly influential in shaping the ideas behind the May 1968 insurrections in France; quotes, phrases, and slogans from situationist texts and publications were ubiquitous on posters and graffiti throughout France during the uprisings.

[[Einkorn wheat]]

CATEGORIES: Wheat, Plants described in 1753

Einkorn wheat (from German Einkorn, literally "single grain") can refer either to the wild species of wheat, Triticum boeoticum, or to the domesticated form, Triticum monococcum. The wild and domesticated forms are either considered separate species, as here, or as subspecies of T. monococcum. Einkorn is a diploid species of hulled wheat, with tough glumes ('husks') that tightly enclose the grains. The cultivated form is similar to the wild, except that the ear stays intact when ripe and the seeds are larger.

[[Péclet number]]
CATEGORIES: Convection, Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics, Dimensionless numbers of thermodynamics, Fluid dynamics, Heat conduction

The Péclet number (Pe) is a dimensionless number relevant in the study of transport phenomena in fluid flows. It is named after the French physicist Jean Claude Eugène Péclet. It is defined to be the ratio of the rate of advection of a physical quantity by the flow to the rate of diffusion of the same quantity driven by an appropriate gradient. In the context of the transport of heat, the Peclet number is equivalent to the product of the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number. In the context of species or mass transfer, the Péclet number is the product of the Reynolds number and the Schmidt number.
The Péclet number is defined as:
For diffusion of matter (mass diffusion), it is defined as:
For diffusion of heat (thermal diffusion), the Péclet number is defined as:
where L is the characteristic length, U the velocity, D the mass diffusion coefficient, and α the thermal diffusivity,
where k is the thermal conductivity, ρ the density, and cp the heat capacity.
In engineering applications the Péclet number is often very large. In such situations, the dependency of the flow upon downstream locations is diminished, and variables in the flow tend to become 'one-way' properties. Thus, when modelling certain situations with high Péclet numbers, simpler computational models can be adopted.[tpl]cite book |last=Patankar |first=Suhas V. |year=1980 |title=Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-89116-522-3 |page=102 [/tpl] 
A flow will often have different Péclet numbers for heat and mass. This can lead to the phenomenon of double diffusive convection.
In the context of particulate motion the Péclet numbers have also been called Brenner numbers, with symbol Br, in honour of Howard Brenner.Promoted by S. G. Mason in publications from circa 1977 onward, and adopted by a number of others.

Jean Claude Eugène Péclet (10 February 1793 - 6 December 1857) was a French physicist. 
He was born in Besançon, France.  
Péclet became, in 1812, one of the first students of the École Normale in Paris with Gay-Lussac and Dulong being his professors. In 1816, he was elected professor at the Collège de Marseille and taught physical sciences there until 1827. Being nominated maître de conférences at the École Normale, he returned to Paris. In 1829, he became a professor of physics at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures that was being founded by the businessman  Alphonse Lavallée, by Péclet, and by three other scientists, Philippe Benoît, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Théodore Olivier. 
His salary was then 3000 Francs per year, plus a share of the profits of this private engineering school. 
In 1840, Péclet became inspecteur général de l'instruction publique. 
The Péclet number is named after him. He was Coriolis's brother-in-law.
He died in Paris.

Ulysses is a decommissioned robotic space probe whose primary mission was to orbit the Sun and study it at all latitudes. It was launched in 1990, studied the Sun in 1994/1995 and then once more in 2000/2001. In addition several comets were studied by the probe. The space probe was a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). The last day for mission operations on Ulysses was June 30, 2009.The odyssey concludes ...
To study the Sun at all latitudes the probe needed to change its orbital inclination and leave the plane of the Solar System – to change the orbital inclination of a spacecraft a large increase in velocity is needed. However the necessary amount of velocity change to achieve a high inclination orbit of about 80°  exceeded the capabilities of the designated launch vehicle, the Space Shuttle plus an Inertial Upper Stage (at that time it was desired to launch all space probes with the Shuttle). Therefore to reach the desired orbit around the Sun a gravity assist manoeuvre around Jupiter was chosen, but this Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells – the probe instead was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG).
The spacecraft was originally named Odysseus, because of its lengthy and indirect trajectory to near Solar distance. It was renamed Ulysses, the Latin translation of "Odysseus" at ESA's request in honour not only of Homer's mythological hero but also with reference to Dante's description in Dante's Inferno."Inferno  of Ulysses' urge to explore an uninhabited world behind the Sun. In Jane's Spaceflight Directory 1988, ISBN 0-7106-0860-8 Ulysses was originally scheduled for launch in May 1986 aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger on STS-61-F.

Yerkes was a pioneer in the study both of human and primate intelligence and of the social behavior of gorillas and chimpanzees.  Along with John D. Dodson, Yerkes developed the Yerkes-Dodson law relating arousal to performance.
As time went on, however, Yerkes began to propagate his support for eugenics in the 1910s and 1920s.

Caenorhabditis elegans [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|s|eɪ|n|ɵ|r|æ|b|ˈ|d|ɪ|t|ɪ|s|_|ˈ|ɛ|l|ɛ|ɡ|æ|n|z[/tpl] is a free-living (non-parasitic), transparent nematode (roundworm), about 1 mm in length, that lives in temperate soil environments. The name is a blend of Greek (caeno- - recent, rhabditis - rod-like)καινός (caenos) = new, recent; ῥάβδος (rhabdos) = rod, wand. and Latin (elegans - elegant). In 1900, Maupas initially named it Rhabditides elegans, Osche placed it in the subgenus Caenorhabditis in 1952, and in 1955, Dougherty raised it to the status of genus.
C. elegans is an unsegmented pseudocoelomate, and lacks a respiratory and a circulatory system. The majority of these nematodes are female hermaphrodites. Males have specialised tails for mating that include spicules. They possess gut granules which emit a brilliant blue fluorescence and a wave of this is seen at death in a death fluorescence.
In 1974, Sydney Brenner began research into the molecular and developmental biology of C. elegans, which has since been extensively used as a model organism.
C. elegans was the first multicellular organism to have its whole genome sequenced.  And as of 2012, this worm was the only organism to have its connectome (neuronal "wiring diagram") completed.

Mission San Xavier del Bac is a historic Spanish Catholic mission located about 10 miles (16 km) south of downtown Tucson, Arizona, on the Tohono O’odham San Xavier Indian Reservation. The mission was named in 1692 by Padre Eusebio Kino for a pioneering Christian missionary and co-founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuit Order), Francis Xavier. The mission is also known as the “place where the water appears”, as there were once natural springs in the area.(Nentvig, J. 1980.  Rudo Ensayo: A Description of Sonora and Arizona in 1764.  University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ)  The Santa Cruz River, which now runs only part of the year, is also nearby. The mission is situated in the center of a centuries-old Indian settlement of the Tohono O’odham (formerly known as Papago), located along the banks of the Santa Cruz River.
The mission is a pilgrimage site with thousands of pilgrims who visit the church each year, many of them walking Fontana, Bernard L. & photos by McCain,Edward, "A Gift of Angels: The Art of Mission San Xavier del Bac", p. 41, The University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 2010, ISBN 978-0-8165-2840-0 or riding on horseback cabalgatas.

Charles Edward Louis John Casimir Sylvester Severino Maria Stuart (31 December 1720 – 31 January 1788), commonly known in Britain during his lifetime as The Young Pretender, and often referred to in retrospective accounts as Bonnie Prince Charlie, was the second Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. This claim was as the eldest son of James Francis Edward Stuart, himself the son of James II of England. Charles is perhaps best known as the instigator of the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1745, in which he led an insurrection to restore his family to the throne of the Kingdom of Great Britain, which ended in defeat at the Battle of Culloden that effectively ended the Jacobite cause. Charles's flight from Scotland after the uprising has rendered him a romantic figure of heroic failure in some later representations.Charles Edward Stuart: a tragedy in many acts by Frank McLynn In 1759 he was involved in a French plan to invade Britain which was abandoned following British naval victories.McLynn Charles Edward Stuart p.449-454

[[Third Punic War]]

CATEGORIES: Third Punic War, Military history of Tunisia

The Third Punic War (Latin: Tertium Bellum Punicum) (149–146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage and the Roman Republic. The Punic Wars were named because of the Roman name for Carthaginians: Punici, or Poenici.[ref]
</ref>
The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars and focused on Tunisia, mainly on the Siege of Carthage, which resulted in the complete destruction of the city, the annexation of all remaining Carthaginian territory by Rome, and the death or enslavement of the entire Carthaginian population. The Third Punic War ended Carthage's independent existence.

In 2012, the city's estimated population was 67,468. The combined metropolitan area of Flagstaff has an estimated population 134,421. It is the county seat of Coconino County.[tpl]GR|6[/tpl] The city is named after a Ponderosa Pine flagpole made by a scouting party from Boston (known as the "Second Boston Party") to celebrate the United States Centennial on July 4, 1876.http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=33365
Flagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau, along the western side of the largest contiguous Ponderosa Pine forest in the continental United States."Biotic Communities of the Colorado Plateau." Northern Arizona University. Retrieved on March 2, 2007. Flagstaff is located adjacent to Mount Elden, just south of the San Francisco Peaks, the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona. Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona at [tpl]convert|12633|ft[/tpl], is located about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] north of Flagstaff in Kachina Peaks Wilderness.
Flagstaff's early economy was based on the lumber, railroad, and ranching industries. Today, the city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as Nestlé Purina PetCare and Walgreens, and is home to Lowell Observatory, The U.S. Naval Observatory, the United States Geological Survey Flagstaff Station, and Northern Arizona University. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to Grand Canyon National Park, Oak Creek Canyon, the Arizona Snowbowl, Meteor Crater, and historic Route 66. The city is also a center for medical device manufacturing, since Flagstaff is home to W. L. Gore and Associates.

[[Acid dissociation constant]]

CATEGORIES: Equilibrium chemistry, Acids, Bases, Analytical chemistry, Physical chemistry

An acid dissociation constant, Ka, (also known as acidity constant, or acid-ionization constant) is a quantitative measure of the strength of an acid in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction known as dissociation in the context of acid-base reactions. The larger the Ka value, the more dissociation of the molecules in solution and thus the stronger the acid.
The equilibrium of acid dissociation can be written symbolically as:
where HA is a generic acid that dissociates by splitting into A−, known as the conjugate base of the acid, and the hydrogen ion or proton, H+, which, in the case of aqueous solutions, exists as the hydronium ion—in other words, a solvated proton. In the example shown in the figure, HA represents acetic acid, and A− represents the acetate ion, the conjugate base. The chemical species HA, A− and H+ are said to be in equilibrium when their concentrations do not change with the passing of time. The dissociation constant is usually written as a quotient of the equilibrium concentrations (in mol/L), denoted by HA, A− and H+:
Due to the many orders of magnitude spanned by Ka values, a logarithmic measure of the acid dissociation constant is more commonly used in practice. The logarithmic constant, pKa, which is equal to −log10 Ka, is sometimes also (but incorrectly) referred to as an acid dissociation constant:
The larger the value of pKa, the smaller the extent of dissociation at any given pH (see Henderson–Hasselbalch equation)—that is, the weaker the acid. A weak acid has a pKa value in the approximate range −2 to 12 in water. Acids with a pKa value of less than about −2 are said to be strong acids; a strong acid is almost completely dissociated in aqueous solution, to the extent that the concentration of the undissociated acid becomes undetectable. pKa values for strong acids can, however, be estimated by theoretical means or by extrapolating from measurements in non-aqueous solvents in which the dissociation constant is smaller, such as acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide.

[[Predation]]
CATEGORIES: Predation, Biological pest control

In ecology, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked).Begon, M., Townsend, C., Harper, J. (1996). Ecology: Individuals, populations and communities (Third edition). Blackwell Science, London. ISBN 0-86542-845-X, ISBN 0-632-03801-2, ISBN 0-632-04393-8. Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of its prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption.Encyclopædia Britannica: "predation" Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), mycophagy (eating parts of fungi) and detritivory, the consumption of dead organic material (detritus). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems.Getz, W. (2011). Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer–resource modelling. Ecology Letters, [tpl]doi|10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x[/tpl].  It can often be difficult to separate various types of  feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the "donor" organism(s).
Selective pressures imposed on one another often leads to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in various antipredator adaptations. Ways of classifying predation surveyed here include grouping by trophic level or diet, by specialization, and by the nature of the predator's interaction with prey.

[[Diastase]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrolases

A diastase ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aɪ|ə|s|t|eɪ|z[/tpl]; from [[Greek 
language|Greek]] διαστασις, "separation") is any one of a group of 
into maltose. Alpha amylase degrades starch to a mixture of the 
disaccharide maltose, the trisaccharide maltotriose, which contains 
three α (1-4)-linked glucose residues, and oligosaccharides known as 
dextrins that contain the α (1-6)-linked glucose 
branches. Diastase was the first 
enzyme discovered.[ref]See:

Anselme Payen and Jean-François Persoz, chemists at a French 
sugar factory.[ref]Payen & Persoz (1833), page 77.  Payen and 
Persoz found diastase in the seeds of barley, oats, and wheat, as well 
as in potatoes (Payen & Persoz (1833), page 76).[/ref] The 
name "diastase" comes from the Greek word διάστασις (diastasis) (a 
parting, a separation) because when beer mash is heated, the enzyme causes the starch in the barley seed to transform quickly into soluble sugars and hence the husk to separate from the rest of the 
seed.[ref]Payen & Persoz (1833), pages 
75-76.[/ref]Etymology of "diastase" Today, diastase means any α-, β-, 
or γ-amylase (all of them hydrolases) that can break down 
carbohydrates.
The commonly used -ase suffix for naming enzymes was derived from 
the name diastase.[ref]The naming of enzymes using the suffix 
"-ase" has been traced to French scientist Émile Duclaux 
(1840-1904), who intended to honor the discoverers of diastase by 
introducing the practice in his book 
Traité de Microbiologie, vol. 2 (Paris, France:  Masson and Co., 
1899), Chapter 1, especially page 9.[/ref]
When used as a pharmaceutical drug, diastase has the ATC code 
[tpl]ATC|A09|AA01[/tpl].
These days, diastase can be taken out from the barley seed even after 
all the beer ingredients were mixed and heated. This beneficial enzyme 
can also be extracted from various other sources. These include plants, 
saliva and milk. However, for obtaining a natural diastase numerous 
natural sources can be used.

[[Golden goal]]
CATEGORIES: Laws of association football, Association football terminology, 1992 introductions

The golden goal or golden point is a rule used in association football, bandy, field hockey, ice hockey and korfball to decide the winner of a match (typically a knock-out match) in which scores are equal at the end of normal time. It is a type of sudden death. Under this rule, the team that scores the first goal or point during extra time is the winner. The game ends when a golden goal is scored. Introduced formally in 1992, though with some history before that, the rule ceased to apply to most FIFA authorized football games in 2004. The similar silver goal[tpl]clarify|date=December 2012[/tpl] supplemented the golden goal between 2002 and 2004.
The golden goal is still used in the Beach Soccer World Cup, in NCAA matches and in FIH sanctioned field hockey games. A related concept is used in National Rugby League games. A similar golden goal rule is also used in all National Hockey League (NHL) overtime games (followed by a shootout if needed, in the regular season and preseason), however the term "golden goal" is not used. A rule similar to the golden goal also applies in the National Football League (only if a touchdown or safety is scored first on the first possession), although again the term itself is not used.

The Cure are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex, in 1976. The band has experienced several line-up changes, with vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter Robert Smith being the only constant member. The Cure first began releasing music in the late 1970s with its debut album Three Imaginary Boys. Their second single, "Boys Don't Cry", became a hit; this, along with several early singles, placed the band as part of the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the wake of the punk rock revolution in the United Kingdom. During the early 1980s, the band's increasingly dark and tormented music helped form the gothic rock genre.
After the release of 1982's Pornography, the band's future was uncertain and Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired. With the single "Let's Go to Bed" released the same year, Smith began to place a pop sensibility into the band's music (as well as a unique stage look). The Cure's popularity increased as the decade wore on, especially in the United States where the songs "Just Like Heaven", "Lovesong" and "Friday I'm in Love" entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart. By the start of the 1990s, the Cure were one of the most popular alternative rock bands in the world. The band is estimated to have sold 27 million albums as of 2004. The Cure have released thirteen studio albums, ten EPs and over thirty singles during their career.

[[Cake]]

CATEGORIES: Cakes , Cakes, World cuisine, European cuisine

Cake is a form of bread or bread-like food. In its modern forms, it is typically a sweet baked dessert. In its oldest forms, cakes were normally fried breads or cheesecakes, and normally had a disk shape.  Determining whether a given food should be classified as bread, cake, or pastry can be difficult.
Modern cake, especially layer cakes, normally contain a combination of flour, sugar, eggs, and butter or oil, with some varieties also requiring liquid (typically milk or water) and leavening agents (such as yeast or baking powder). Flavorful ingredients like fruit purées, nuts, dried or candied fruit, or extracts are often added, and numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients are possible. Cakes are often filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders or candied fruit.Cake finishes. Youtube.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-23.
Cake is often the dessert of choice for meals at ceremonial occasions, particularly weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake.

The Port of Limassol is one of the busiest ports in the Mediterranean transit trade and the largest port in Cyprus. It has also become one of the most important tourism, trade, and service-providing centres in the area. Limassol is renowned for its extensive cultural traditions, and is home to the Cyprus University of Technology. A wide spectrum of activities and a number of museums and archaeological sites are available to the interested visitor. Consequently, Limassol attracts a wide range of tourists mostly during an extended summer season to be accommodated in a wide range of hotels and apartments. A large marina is currently being constructed near the old town.
Limassol was built between two ancient cities, Amathus and Kourion, and during Byzantine rule it was known as Neapolis (new town). Limassol's historical centre is located around its medieval Limassol Castle and the Old Port. Today the city spreads along the Mediterranean coast and has extended much farther than the castle and port, with its suburbs stretching along the coast to Amathus. To the west of the city is the Akrotiri and Dhekelia, the British Overseas Territory.

Casablanca is a 1942 American romantic drama film directed by Michael Curtiz and based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison's un-produced stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's. The film stars Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid; and features Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson. Set during World War II, it focuses on a man torn between, in the words of one character, "love and virtue". He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her Czech Resistance leader husband escape the Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis.
Story editor Irene Diamond convinced producer Hal Wallis to purchase the film rights to the play in January 1942. Brothers Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein were initially assigned to write the script. However, despite studio resistance, they left after the attack on Pearl Harbor to work on Frank Capra's Why We Fight series. Howard Koch was assigned to the screenplay until the Epsteins returned. Casey Robinson assisted with three weeks of rewrites, but his work would later go uncredited. Wallis chose Curtiz to direct the film after his first choice, William Wyler, became unavailable. Filming began on May 25, 1942, and ended on August 3, and was shot entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, with the exception of one sequence at Van Nuys Airport in Van Nuys.
Although Casablanca was an A-list film with established stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it to be anything out of the ordinary.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960915/REVIEWS08/401010308/1023|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Casablanca (1942)|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=September 15, 1996|accessdate=2010-03-18[/tpl] It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca had its world premiere on November 26, 1942 in New York City, and was released on January 23, 1943, in the United States. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run, rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vincasa.com/indexkoch.html |title=Howard Koch, Julius Epstein, Frank Miller Interview |first=Eliot |last=Stein |website=Vincent's Casablanca |date=May 1995 |accessdate=2008-06-11[/tpl] Frank Miller: "There was a scene planned, after the ending, that would have shown Rick and Renault on an Allied ship just prior to the landing at Casablanca, but plans to shoot it were scrapped when the marketing department realized they had to get the film out fast to capitalize on the liberation of North Africa."

The Football War (Spanish: La guerra del fútbol), also known as the Soccer War or 100 Hour War, was a brief war fought by El Salvador and Honduras in 1969. The cause of the war was economic in nature, namely issues concerning immigration from El Salvador to Honduras.Uppsala Conflict Data Program Conflict Encyclopedia, El Salvador, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=51&regionSelect=4-Central_Americas, viewed on 24 May 2013 These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with rioting during the second North American qualifying round of the 1970 FIFA World Cup. The war began on 14 July 1969, when the Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The Organization of American States negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence "100-hour War"), which took full effect on 20 July. Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August.
Eleven years later the two nations signed a peace treaty on 30 October 1980[tpl]cite web|url=http://content.glin.gov/summary/13963 |title=GLIN network is unavailable (Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19[/tpl] and agreed to resolve the border dispute over the Gulf of Fonseca and five sections of land boundary through the International Court of Justice. In 1992, the Court awarded most of the disputed territory to Honduras, and in 1998, Honduras and El Salvador signed a border demarcation treaty to implement the terms of the ICJ decree.

[tpl]nihongo|Pachinko|パチンコ[/tpl] is a mechanical game originating in Japan and is used as both a form of recreational arcade game and much more frequently as a gambling device, filling a Japanese gambling niche comparable to that of the slot machine in Western gaming.  A pachinko machine resembles a vertical pinball machine, but has no flippers and uses a large number of small balls. The player fires balls into the machine, which then cascade down through a dense forest of pins. If the balls go into certain locations, they may be captured and sequences of events may be triggered that result in more balls being released.[tpl]cite web|url=http://faculty.ccp.edu/faculty/dreed/Campingart/pachinko/game.htm |title=How the Game Works |last=Reed |first=Daniel J. |publisher=self-published |year=2010 |work=Dan's Pachinko Data Page |accessdate=9 November 2009[/tpl] The object of the game is to capture as many balls as possible. These balls can then be exchanged for prizes. Pachinko machines were originally strictly mechanical, but modern ones have incorporated extensive electronics, becoming similar to video slot machines.
Pachinko parlors are widespread in Japan, and they usually also feature a number of slot machines (called [tpl]lang|jp|pachislo[/tpl] or pachislots); hence, these venues operate and look similar to casinos.
Modern pachinko machines are highly customizable, keeping enthusiasts continuously entertained.
Gambling for cash is illegal in Japan. Balls won cannot be exchanged directly for money in the parlor. The balls are exchanged for tokens or prizes, which are then taken outside and exchanged for cash at a place nominally separate from the parlor.

[[Brisbane River]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Brisbane, Rivers of Queensland, Brisbane River, History of Brisbane

The Brisbane River is the longest river in south east Queensland, Australia, and flows through the city of Brisbane, before emptying into Moreton Bay. John Oxley was the first European to explore the river who named it after the Governor of New South Wales, Thomas Brisbane in 1823. The penal colony of Moreton Bay later adopted the same name.
Early travellers along the waterway admired the natural beauty, abundant fish and rich vegetation along its banks. From 1862 the Brisbane River has been dredged for navigation purposes. The river served as an important carriageway between Brisbane and Ipswich before a railway linking the towns was built in 1875. By the late 1920s, water quality in the river had significantly deteriorated. The river contains excess nutrients, hydrocarbons, pesticides, bacteria and is murky.
The river travels [tpl]convert|344|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from Mount Stanley.  The river is dammed by the Wivenhoe Dam, forming Lake Wivenhoe, the main water supply for Brisbane. The waterway is a habitat for the rare Queensland lungfish, Brisbane River cod and bull sharks. The largest ship built on the river was the Robert Miller. The 66,000 tonne vessel became un-moored in the 1974 Brisbane flood. While not the highest experienced along the river since European settlement, this flood was the most damaging. Major floods also occurred in January 2011 and multiple times during 1893.
Extensive port facilities have been constructed on the Fisherman Islands, now known as the Port of Brisbane. There are 16 major bridges that cross the river. The Clem Jones Tunnel, opened in 2010, is the river's first underground crossing for road transport. The CityCat ferry service collects and delivers passengers along the inner-city reaches of the river.

[[Geography of Norway]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of Norway

 
Norway is a country located in Northern Europe on the western and northern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, bordering the North Sea in southwest and the Skagerrak inlet to the south, the North Atlantic Ocean (Norwegian Sea) in the west and the Barents Sea to the northeast. Norway has a long land border with Sweden to the east, a shorter one with Finland in the northeast and a still shorter border with Russia in the far northeast. 
Norway has a very elongated shape, one of the longest and most rugged coastlines in the world, and some 50,000 islands off the extremely indented coastline. The mainland covers 13° latitude, from 58°N to more than 71°N, (Svalbard north to 81°N), and covers the longitude from 5°E in Solund to 31°E in Vardø (Jan Mayen to 9°W, Kvitøya to 33°E). 
Norway is one of the world's most northerly countries, and one of Europe's most mountainous countries with large areas dominated by the Scandinavian Mountains; average elevation is 460 m and 32% of the mainland is located above the tree line. 
The country-length chain of peaks is geologically continuous with the mountains of Scotland, Ireland and, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the Appalachian Mountains of North America.  Geologists hold that all these formed a single range prior to the breakup of the ancient supercontinent Pangaea. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Virtually the entire country was covered with a thick ice sheet during the last ice age, as well as in many earlier ice ages. The movement of the ice carved out deep valleys, and when the ice melted, the sea filled many of these valleys, creating Norway's famous fjords.[tpl]cite web|year = 2005|month = July|url = http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/westnor.html|title =Protected Areas and World Heritage - Norway| publisher = United Nations Environment Programme[/tpl]
The land is still rebounding from the enormous weight of the ice (isostatic rebound), "growing out of the sea" with several mm a year, especially the eastern part of the country and the inner part of the long fjords, where the ice cover was thickest. This is a slow process, and for thousands of years following the end of the ice age, the sea covered substantial areas of what is today dry land. The sea reached what is today an elevation of 221 m in Oslo (Aker), 25 m in Stavanger, 5 m near Stad, 180 m in Trondheim, 50 m in Tromsø and 75 m in Kirkenes. This old seabed is now among the best agricultural land in the country.
The glaciers in the higher mountain areas today are not remnants of the large ice sheet of the ice age, their origins are more recent.Bjerknes centre for climate research:Norways glaciers The regional climate was up to 1-3 °C warmer in 7000 B.C. to 3000 B.C. in the Holocene climatic optimum, (relative to the 1961-90 period), melting the remaining glaciers in the mountains almost completely during that period.
As a result of the ice carving, Sognefjorden is the world's second deepest fjord and Hornindalsvatnet is the deepest lake in Europe.

[[Economy of Norway]]

The economy of Norway is a developed mixed economy with state-ownership in strategic areas of the economy. Although sensitive to global business cycles, the economy of Norway has shown robust growth since the start of the industrial era.  Shipping has long been a support of Norway's export sector, but much of Norway's economic growth has been fueled by an abundance of natural resources, including petroleum exploration and production, hydroelectric power, and fisheries.  Agriculture and traditional heavy manufacturing have suffered relative decline compared to services and oil-related industries, and the public sector is among the largest in the world as a percentage of the overall gross domestic product. The country has a very high standard of living compared with other European countries, and a strongly integrated welfare system. Norway's modern manufacturing and welfare system rely on a financial reserve produced by exploitation of natural resources, particularly North Sea oil.http://home.bi.no/a0310125/Bjornland_SJPE_1998.pdfhttp://www.offshorecenter.dk/filer/files/Project/Internationalisering/OCD%20report%20(Norway).pdfhttp://www.sv.uio.no/tik/forskning/publikasjoner/tik-artikkelserie/Ryggvik.pdfhttp://books.google.com.tw/books?id=jZIOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=north+sea+oil+supports+norway+welfare&source=bl&ots=usTy9E4R8J&sig=6cdM3-tZTYAzS-C9vRVaSEQ2jWg&hl=zh-TW&sa=X&ei=YVbdULqbHuiOmQXvo4CIBw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=north%20sea%20oil%20supports%20norway%20welfare&f=false[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570842-oil-makes-norway-different-rest-region-only-up-point-rich | title= The rich cousin |author= |date= 1 February 2013|work= |publisher= The Economist |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]

[[Norwegian literature]]

CATEGORIES: European literature, Norwegian culture, Norwegian literature, Nordic literature

Norwegian literature is literature composed in Norway or by Norwegian people. The history of Norwegian literature starts with the pagan Eddaic poems and skaldic verse of the 9th and 10th centuries with poets such as Bragi Boddason and Eyvindr Skáldaspillir. The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European medieval learning, hagiography and history writing. Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence this was to flower into an active period of literature production in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Major works of that period include Historia Norwegie, Thidreks saga and Konungs skuggsjá.
The period from the 14th century up to the 19th is considered a dark age in the nation's literature though Norwegian-born writers such as Peder Claussøn Friis and Ludvig Holberg contributed to the common literature of Denmark-Norway. With the advent of nationalism and the struggle for independence in the early 19th century a new period of national literature emerged. The dramatist Henrik Wergeland was the most influential author of the period while the later works of Henrik Ibsen were to earn Norway a place in Western European literature. In the 20th century notable Norwegian writers include the two Nobel Prize winning authors Knut Hamsun and Sigrid Undset.

[[Transport in Norway]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in Norway

Transport in Norway is highly influenced by Norway's low population density, narrow shape and long coastline. Norway has old water transport traditions, but road, rail and air transport have increased in importance during the 20th century. Due to the low population density, public transport is somewhat less built out in rural areas of Norway, however public transport in, and around cities is well developed.
The main governing body is the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, which performs operations through numerous subsidiaries.Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communication, 2003: 3 Tasks related to public transport and some roads have been delegated to the counties and municipalities. Most infrastructure is publicly owned, while most operations are performed by private companies; public transport is subsidized.
In average each Norwegian transported themselves for 70 minutes each day. 8% of passenger transport was made by public transport; road transport is the dominant mode of transport.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/10/12/transport_en/ |title=Transport |author=Statistics Norway |accessdate=2008-07-15 |authorlink=Statistics Norway [/tpl] The transport sector was responsible for 4.1% of the gross national product and 6.6% of employment in 2006.

[[Dragonfly]]

CATEGORIES: Odonata, Dragonflies, Living fossils, Biological pest control agents

A dragonfly is an insect belonging to the order Odonata, the suborder Epiprocta or, in the strict sense, the infraorder Anisoptera (from Greek ανισος anisos, "uneven" + πτερος pteros, "wings", because the hindwing is broader than the forewing).Odonata at  Tree of Life web project. Retrieved 2011-09-18. It is characterized by large multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong transparent wings, and an elongated body. Dragonflies can sometimes be mistaken for damselflies, which are morphologically similar; however, adults can be differentiated by the fact that the wings of most dragonflies are held away from, and perpendicular to, the body when at rest. Dragonflies possess six legs (like any other insect), but most of them cannot walk well. Dragonflies are among the fastest flying insects in the world.
Dragonflies are important predators that eat mosquitoes, and other small insects like flies, bees, ants, wasps, and very rarely butterflies. They are usually found around marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, and wetlands because their larvae, known as "nymphs", are aquatic. About 5,900 different species of dragonflies (Odonata) are known in the world today of which about 3000 belong to the Anisoptera.[tpl]cite journal| author=Zhang, Z.-Q.| title=Phylum Arthropoda von Siebold, 1848 In: Zhang, Z.-Q.

The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is an annual plant grown as a crop for its edible oil and edible fruits (commonly called "sunflower seeds"). Sunflower is also used as bird food, as livestock forage (as a meal or a silage plant) and in some industrial applications. The plant was first domesticated in the Americas. Wild Helianthus annuus is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads. The domestic sunflower, however, possesses a single large inflorescence (flowering head) atop an unbranched stem. The name sunflower derives from the flower head's shape, which resembles the Sun. 
Sunflower seeds were brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, where, along with sunflower oil, they became a widespread cooking ingredient.

Common Criteria is a framework in which computer system users can specify their security functional and assurance requirements (SFRs and SARs respectively) through the use of Protection Profiles (PPs), vendors can then implement  and/or make claims about the security attributes of their products, and testing laboratories can evaluate the products to determine if they actually meet the claims. In other words, Common Criteria provides assurance that the process of specification, implementation and evaluation of a computer security product has been conducted in a rigorous and standard and repeatable manner at a level that is commensurate with the target environment for use.
Common Criteria is used as the basis for a Government driven certification scheme and typically evaluations are conducted for the use of Federal Government agencies and critical infrastructure.

[[Multiple chemical sensitivity]]

CATEGORIES: Ailments of unknown etiology, Building biology, Sensitivities

Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a chronic medical condition characterized by symptoms that the affected person attributes to low-level chemical exposure. Commonly accused substances include smoke, pesticides, plastics, synthetic fabrics, scented products, petroleum products, and paint fumes. Symptoms are often vague and non-specific, such as nausea, fatigue, dizziness and headaches, but also commonly include inflammation of skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract and airways.
MCS is not recognized as an organic, chemical-caused illness by the American Medical Association and some other US based organisations. Blinded clinical trials have shown MCS patients react as often and as strongly to placebos, including clean air, as they do to the chemicals they say harm them. This has led some in the healthcare profession to believe MCS symptoms are due to odor hypersensitivity or are mainly psychological.

Guatemala is mountainous, except for the south coastal area and the vast northern lowlands of Petén department. Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing the country into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains; and the Petén region, north of the mountains. These areas vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot and humid tropical lowlands and highland peaks and valleys.

[[History of Namibia]]
CATEGORIES: History of Namibia

The history of Namibia has passed through several distinct stages from being colonised in the late nineteenth century to Namibia's independence on 21 March 1990.
From 1884, Namibia was a German colony: German South-West Africa. After the First World War, the League of Nations mandated South Africa to administer the territory. Following World War II, the League of Nations was dissolved in April 1946 and its successor, the United Nations, instituted a Trusteeship system to bring all of the former German colonies in Africa under UN control. South Africa objected arguing that a majority of the territory's people were content with South African rule.
Legal argument ensued over the course of the next twenty years until, in October 1966, the UN General Assembly decided to end the mandate, declaring that South Africa had no other right to administer the territory and that henceforth South-West Africa was to come under the direct responsibility of the UN (Resolution 2145 XXI of 27 October 1966).

[[Jacobson radical]]

CATEGORIES: Ideals, Ring theory

In mathematics, more specifically ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, the Jacobson radical of a ring R is the ideal consisting of those elements in R that annihilate all simple right R-modules. It happens that substituting "left" in place of "right" in the definition yields the same ideal, and so the notion is left-right symmetric. The Jacobson radical of a ring is frequently denoted by J(R) or rad(R); however to avoid confusion with other radicals of rings, the former notation will be preferred in this article. The Jacobson radical is named after Nathan Jacobson, who was the first to study it for arbitrary rings in [tpl]harv|Jacobson|1945[/tpl].
The Jacobson radical of a ring has numerous internal characterizations, including a few definitions that successfully extend the notion to rings without unity.  The radical of a module extends the definition of the Jacobson radical to include modules.  The Jacobson radical plays a prominent role in many ring and module theoretic results, such as Nakayama's lemma.

Thimphu, as the political and economic center of Bhutan, has a dominant agricultural and livestock base, which contributes to 45% of the country's GNP.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/economy|title=Economy|publisher=Tourism Government of Bhutan[/tpl] Tourism, though a contributor to the economy, is strictly regulated, maintaining a balance between the traditional, development and modernization. Thimphu contains most of the important political buildings in Bhutan, including the National Assembly of the newly formed parliamentary democracy and Dechencholing Palace, the official residence of the King, located to the north of the city. As a metropolis and capital city, Thimphu is coordinated by the "Thimphu Structure Plan", an Urban Development Plan which evolved in 1998 with the objective of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley. This development is ongoing with financial assistance  from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
The culture of Bhutan is fully reflected in Thimphu in respect of literature, religion, customs, and national dress code, the monastic practices of the monasteries, music, dance, literature and in the media. Tsechu festival is an important festival when mask dances, popularly known as Cham dances, are performed in the courtyards of the Tashichhoe Dzong in Thimphu. It is a four-day festival held every year during Autumn (September/October), on dates corresponding to the Bhutanese calendar.

thumb|Tunis as viewed from space
Tunis ([tpl]lang-ar|تونس[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA-LC|Tūnis[/tpl]; Amazigh: Tunes, ⵜⵓⵏⴻⵙ) is the capital of Tunisia. It is Tunisia's largest city, with a population of 651,183 as of 2013. The greater metropolitan area holds some 2,300,000 inhabitants.
Situated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (Halq al Wadi), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At the centre of more modern development (from the colonial era and later) lies the old medina. Beyond this district lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said.
The medina is found at the centre of the city: a dense agglomeration of alleys and covered passages, full of intense scents and colours, boisterous and active trade, and a surfeit of goods on offer ranging from leather to plastic, tin to the finest filigree, tourist souvenirs to the works of tiny crafts shops.
Just through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bahr and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, transversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as "the Tunisian Champs-Élysées"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. As the capital city of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life; it is also the centre of the country's commercial activity. The expansion of the Tunisian economy in recent decades is reflected in the booming development of the outer city where one can see clearly the social challenges brought about by rapid modernization in Tunisia.

Valletta contains buildings from the 16th century onwards, built during the rule of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, also known as Knights Hospitaller. The city is essentially Baroque in character, with elements of Mannerist, Neo-Classical and Modern architecture in selected areas, though World War II left major scars on the city. The City of Valletta was officially recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980.- Valletta  profile at UNESCO World Heritage Centre website
The city was named after Jean Parisot de Valette, who succeeded in defending the island from an Ottoman invasion in 1565. The official name given by the Order of Saint John was Humilissima Civitas Valletta — The Most Humble City of Valletta, or Città Umilissima in Italian. The bastions, curtains and ravelins along with the beauty of its Baroque palaces, gardens and churches, led the ruling houses of Europe to give the city its nickname Superbissima — Most Proud.

The population of Windhoek in 2012 was 322,500 and grows continually due to an influx from all over Namibia.
The town developed at the site of a permanent spring known to the indigenous pastoral communities. It developed rapidly after Jonker Afrikaner, Captain of the Orlam settled here in 1840 and built a stone church for his community. However, in the decades thereafter multiple wars and hostilities led to the neglect and destruction of the new settlement such that Windhoek was founded a second time in 1890 by Imperial German army Major Curt von François.
Windhoek is the social, economic, and cultural centre of the country. Nearly every Namibian national enterprise, governmental body, educational and cultural institution is headquartered there.

After nearly 20 years in the company, he left Square Enix in 2004 to found his own company called Smile Please, and the music production company Dog Ear Records. He has since composed music as a freelancer for video games primarily developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi's development studio Mistwalker.
Soundtracks and arranged albums of Uematsu's game scores have been released. Pieces from his video game works have been performed in Final Fantasy concerts. He has worked with Grammy Award-winning conductor Arnie Roth on several of these concerts. From 2002 to 2010, he was in a rock band with colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito called The Black Mages, in which he played electronic organ and other keyboards.

[[Music history]]

CATEGORIES: Music history, Musicology

Music history, sometimes called historical musicology, is the highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of musicology that studies music from a historical viewpoint.
In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e.g., the history of Indian music or the history of rock). In practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of ethnomusicology or cultural studies, whether or not they are ethnographically based. The terms "music history" and "historical musicology" usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called "art music" (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).
The methods of music history include source studies (esp. manuscript studies), paleography, philology (especially textual criticism), style criticism, historiography (the choice of historical method), musical analysis, and iconography. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of music theory. (For a more detailed discussion of the methods see the section on "Research in Music History" below) Some of the intellectual products of music historians include editions of musical works, biography of composers and other musicians, studies of the relationship between words and music, and the reflections upon the place of music in society.

Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by excessive feelings of anxiety and fear,[tpl]cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersAmerican Psychiatric Associati.|year=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington|isbn=978-0890425558|pages=189–195|edition=5th ed.[/tpl] where anxiety is worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms such as a racing heart and shakiness. There are various forms of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, phobic disorder, and panic disorder. While each has its own characteristics and symptoms, they all include symptoms of anxiety.
Anxiety disorders are partly genetic but may also be due to drug use including alcohol and caffeine. They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, certain personality disorders, and eating disorders. The term anxiety covers four aspects of experiences that an individual may have: mental apprehension, physical tension, physical symptoms and dissociative anxiety.David Healy, Drugs Explained, Section 5: Management of Anxiety, Elsevier Health Sciences, 2008, pp. 136–137 The emotions present in anxiety disorders range from simple nervousness to bouts of terror. There are other psychiatric and medical problems that may mimic the symptoms of an anxiety disorder, such as hyperthyroidism.
Common treatment options include lifestyle changes, therapy, and medications. Medications are typically recommended only if other measures are not effective. Anxiety disorders occur about twice as often in females as males, and generally begin during childhood. As many as 18% of Americans and 14% of Europeans may be affected by one or more anxiety disorders.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Merikangas KR, Walters EE |title=Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of 12-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication |journal=Arch.

Springfield is the capital of the US state of Illinois and the county seat of Sangamon County with a population of 116,250  (U.S. Bureau of the Census,  2010), making it the sixth most populated city in the state.[tpl]cite web |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/ |title=2010 Census Data - 2010 Census |publisher=2010.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl] It is the largest city in central Illinois. Just over 208,000 residents live in the Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Sangamon County and adjacent Menard County. Present-day Springfield was first settled by European Americans in the late 1810s, around the time Illinois became a state. The most famous past resident is Abraham Lincoln, who lived in Springfield from 1837 until 1861, when he went to the White House as President. Major tourist attractions include a multitude of historic sites connected with Lincoln.
The city lies on a mostly flat plain that encompasses much of the surrounding countryside. Hilly terrain lies near the Sangamon River. Lake Springfield, a large artificial lake owned by City Water, Light & Power company called CWLP, supplies the city with recreation and drinking water. Weather is fairly typical for middle latitude locations, with hot summers and cold winters. Spring and summer weather is like that of most midwestern cities; severe thunderstorms are common. Tornadoes hit Springfield in 1957 and 2006.
The city is governed by a mayor-council form of government. The city proper is also the "Capital Township" governmental entity. In addition, the government of the state of Illinois is also based in Springfield. State government entities located in the city include the Illinois General Assembly, the Illinois Supreme Court and the Office of the Governor of Illinois. There are three public and two private high schools in Springfield. Public schools in Springfield are operated by District No. 186. The economy of Springfield is marked by government jobs, which account for a large percentage of the city's workforce.

[[Direct memory access]]
CATEGORIES: Computer memory, Motherboard, Computer storage buses

Direct memory access (DMA) is a feature of modern computers that allows certain hardware subsystems within the computer to access system memory independently of the central processing unit (CPU).
Without DMA, when the CPU is using programmed input/output, it is typically fully occupied for the entire duration of the read or write operation, and is thus unavailable to perform other work. With DMA, the CPU initiates the transfer, does other operations while the transfer is in progress, and receives an interrupt from the DMA controller when the operation is done. This feature is useful any time the CPU cannot keep up with the rate of data transfer, or where the CPU needs to perform useful work while waiting for a relatively slow I/O data transfer. Many hardware systems use DMA, including disk drive controllers, graphics cards, network cards and sound cards. DMA is also used for intra-chip data transfer in multi-core processors. Computers that have DMA channels can transfer data to and from devices with much less CPU overhead than computers without DMA channels. Similarly, a processing element inside a multi-core processor can transfer data to and from its local memory without occupying its processor time, allowing computation and data transfer to proceed in parallel.
DMA can also be used for "memory to memory" copying or moving of data within memory. DMA can offload expensive memory operations, such as large copies or scatter-gather operations, from the CPU to a dedicated DMA engine. An implementation example is the I/O Acceleration Technology.

A Locost is a home-built clone of the Lotus Seven. The car features a space frame chassis usually welded together from mild steel [tpl]convert|1|x|1|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] square tubing. Front suspension is usually double wishbone with coil spring struts. The rear is traditionally live axle, but has many variants including independent rear suspension or De Dion tube. Body panels are usually fiberglass nose and wings and aluminium side panels. Each car is highly individualized according to the resources, needs and desires of each respective builder.
The original design was intended to be built from scratch. However, the design has become so popular that several fabricators have begun producing the chassis in kit car form. Additionally, fiberglass body components, suspension pieces and other Locost-specific components can be sourced from various suppliers.

The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) is a women's professional basketball league in the United States. It currently is composed of twelve teams. The league was founded on April 24, 1996, as the women's counterpart to the National Basketball Association (NBA). League play started in 1997; the regular season is currently played from June to September with the finals in October.
Many WNBA teams have direct NBA counterparts and play in the same arena. The Connecticut Sun, Seattle Storm, Tulsa Shock, and Chicago Sky are the only teams that do not share an arena with a direct NBA counterpart, although three of the four, the Sun, the Shock, and the Sky, share a market with a NBA counterpart. The four aforementioned franchises, along with the Atlanta Dream and the Los Angeles Sparks, are all independently owned.  This independent ownership is important to the WNBA's growth; at one time, all teams in the league were owned by the NBA.

[[Agoraphobia]]
CATEGORIES: Phobias, Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders

Agoraphobia (from Greek ἀγορά, "open space" and -φοβία, -phobia) is an anxiety disorder characterized by anxiety in situations where the sufferer perceives certain environments as dangerous or uncomfortable, often due to the environment's vast openness or crowdedness. These situations include wide-open spaces, as well as uncontrollable social situations such as the possibility of being met in shopping malls, airports, and on bridges.  Agoraphobia is defined within the DSM-IV TR as a subset of panic disorder, involving the fear of incurring a panic attack in those environments.Behavenet.  DSM-IV & DSM-IV TR: Agorophobia.  http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/agoraphobia.htm In the DSM-5, however, agoraphobia is classified as being separate to panic disorder.[ref]http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf
(PDF). American Psychiatric Association. May 17, 2013. Retrieved May 23, 2013.[/ref] The sufferer may go to great lengths to avoid those situations, in severe cases becoming unable to leave their home or safe haven.
Although mostly thought to be a fear of public places, it is now believed that agoraphobia develops as a complication of panic attacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://helpguide.org/mental/panic_disorder_anxiety_attack_symptom_treatment.htm |title=Panic Attacks and Panic Disorder: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment |publisher=Helpguide.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08[/tpl] However, there is evidence that the implied one-way causal relationship between spontaneous panic attacks and agoraphobia in DSM-IV may be incorrect.Br J Psychiatry. 2006 May;188:432-8.

In response to a traumatic event, anxiety may interrupt the formation of memories and disrupt the learning processes, resulting in dissociation. Depersonalization (a feeling of disconnection from one’s self) and derealisation (a feeling of disconnection from one's surroundings) are other dissociative methods of withdrawing from anxiety.Nettina, M,S. 2006.

Leopold II ([tpl]lang-fr|Léopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor[/tpl], [tpl]lang-nl|Leopold Lodewijk Filips Maria Victor[/tpl]; 9 April 1835 – 17 December 1909) was the second King of the Belgians, and is chiefly remembered for the founding and exploitation of the Congo Free State. Born in Brussels the second (but eldest surviving) son of Leopold I and [tpl]lang|fr|Louise of Orléans[/tpl], he succeeded his father to the throne on 17 December 1865, reigning for 44 years until his death, the longest of any Belgian monarch. 
Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State, a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885, the colonial nations of Europe committed the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. From the beginning, however, Leopold essentially ignored these conditions and ran the Congo using a mercenary force for his personal gain. Some of the money from this exploitation was used for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period.
Leopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of ivory, and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forcing the population to collect sap from rubber plants. Villages were required to meet quotas on rubber collections, and individuals' hands were cut off if they did not meet the requirements. His regime was responsible for the death of an estimated 2 to 15 million Congolese. This became one of the most infamous international scandals of the early 20th century, and Leopold was ultimately forced to relinquish control of it to the Belgian government.

[[Slavko Avsenik]]
CATEGORIES: 1929 births, Living people, Slovenian composers, Slovenian accordionists, Polka musicians, Schlager

Slavko Avsenik (born November 26, 1929 in Begunje near Bled, Slovenia) is a Slovenian composer and musician. His career accomplishments place him at the worldwide pinnacle of success among ethnic popular musicians. Over forty years, the Avsenik Ensamble's original "Oberkrainer" sound became the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression for Slovenia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, northern Italy and the Benelux countries, spawning hundreds of Alpine orchestras in the process.
The Ensamble, known as "Ansambel bratov Avsenik" or "Slavko Avsenik und seine Original Oberkrainer" has performed before millions, including heads of state, on radio and television, and in thousands of concerts. Selling over 30 million records, Avsenik has earned thirty-one Gold, two Diamond, and one Platinum record. The "Johann Strauss of the twentieth century," Avsenik collaborated with his brother, Vilko, to produce nearly 1000 original compositions and an integral part of the Cleveland-Style legacy. The Avsenik saga began in 1953 with a band formed in Slovenia, broadcast on the Slovenian Hour from Austria, and dubbed the "Musicians of the Oberkrain" by a Vienna disc jockey. Growing in popularity, they soon began appearing in broadcasts, movies, and concerts in West Germany.
Landing a recording contract with Telefunken-Decca in 1960, the Ensemble rose to meteoric heights throughout Europe. It appeared regularly on network television, toured relentlessly (logging over 400,000 miles in 1967 alone), and recorded prolifically. Milestones include a 1961 performance before over 80,000 in Berlin Stadium, tours of the U.S. and Canada in 1970 and 1985, and a one-hour German television network special in 1980.
As Slovenia's most popular music band, the group has won countless awards including eight consecutive television competitions, twelve from German network television, eighteen as Germany's most popular band, the recording industry's "European Oscar" in 1975, the Golden Rose Award (most requested on Austrian radio) in 1979, the Linhart plaque (Slovenia), and the "Hermann Löns" award from the German Minister of Culture.
Avsenik's influence over Cleveland-Style music began in 1958 when Johnny Pecon's English lyrics transformed Slavko's "Tam kjer murke cveto" into a Greatest All-Time Cleveland-Style Hit, "Little Fella". Since then, Cleveland-Style orchestras have recorded well over 200 Avsenik songs including nearly sixty by the Hank Haller Ensemble and as many more by Fred Ziwich, Fred Kuhar, the Fairport Ensemble, Al Markic, Roger Bright, Al Tercek, and Cilka Dolgan. Avsenik tribute bands in North America include Duke Marsic and his Happy Slovenians (Cleveland, 1964 to 1990), the Alpine Sextet (Cleveland, 1976 to 1996 and 2010 to present), Ansambel Veseli Godci / Veseli Farani (Cleveland, 1996 to present), Marjan Kramer, and Iskre (Canada). Many Slovenian polka/oberkrainer style bands in Europe are also in tribute of Avsenik's music, including Slovenia's Hišni ansambel Avsenik and Gašperji/Die Jungen Oberkrainer. In sheer volume, Avsenik's compositions rank him with Slovenian folk music, Matt Hoyer, and Dr. William J. "Doc" Lausche as the major tributaries feeding the Cleveland-Style repertoire. But the breathtaking beauty pervading his waltzes... "Pastirček/Hirtenlied", "Slovenia/Slovenija, odkod lepote tvoje", "Veter nosi pesem mojo/The wind song", "Čakala bom" ("I shall wait"), "European Waltz", "Na svidenje" ("So long"), "On the Bridge", and "Argentina", to name just a golden few... best characterize the profound nature of his impact.
The most popular song of Avsenik's band is the polka titled "Na Golici" in Slovenian, or "Trompetenecho" in German, "Trumpet Echoes" in English, which is the most played instrumental song in the world[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl], being an early trademark and success of the Avsenik Brothers.

It borders the countries Liberia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ghana; its southern boundary is along the Gulf of Guinea. 
Prior to its colonization by Europeans, Ivory Coast was home to several states, including Gyaaman, the Kong Empire, and Baoulé. There were two Anyi kingdoms, Indénié and Sanwi, which attempted to retain their separate identity through the French colonial period and after independence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ci0013) |title=Library of Congress Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=11 April 2009|date=November 1988[/tpl] An 1843–1844 treaty made Ivory Coast a protectorate of France and in 1893, it became a French colony as part of the European scramble for Africa. Ivory Coast became independent on 7 August 1960. From 1960 to 1993, the country was led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny. It maintained close political and economic association with its West African neighbours, while at the same time maintaining close ties to the West, especially to France. Since the end of Houphouët-Boigny's rule, Ivory Coast has experienced one coup d’état, in 1999, and a civil war, which broke out in 2002.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal|title=Loi n° 2000-513 du 1er août 2000 portant Constitution de la République de Côte d’Ivoire|url=http://www.jfaconseil.com/jorci/2000/RCI%20JO%202000-30.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090325153412/http://www.jfaconseil.com/jorci/2000/RCI%20JO%202000-30.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009|journal=Journal Officiel de la République de Côte d’Ivoire|volume=42|pages=529–538|date=3 August 2000|accessdate=7 August 2008|issue=30[/tpl] A political agreement between the government and the rebels brought a return to peace.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=Accord politique de Ouagadougou|url=http://www.cotedivoire-pr.ci/?action=show_page&id_page=570|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080506202335/http://www.cotedivoire-pr.ci/?action=show_page&id_page=570|archivedate=6 May 2008|publisher=Presidency of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire|date=4 March 2007|accessdate=7 August 2008[/tpl]
Ivory Coast is a republic with a strong executive power invested in the President of Ivory Coast. Its de jure capital is Yamoussoukro and the biggest city is the port city of Abidjan. The country is divided into 19 regions and 81 departments. It is a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, African Union, La Francophonie, Latin Union, Economic Community of West African States and South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone. Through production of coffee and cocoa, the country was an economic powerhouse during the 1960s and 1970s in West Africa. However, Ivory Coast went through an economic crisis in the 1980s, leading to the country's period of political and social turmoil. The 21st century Ivoirian economy is largely market-based and relies heavily on agriculture, with smallholder cash crop production being dominant.
The official language is French, although many of the local languages are widely used, including Baoulé, Dioula, Dan, Anyin and Cebaara Senufo. The main religions are Islam, Christianity (primarily Roman Catholic) and various indigenous religions.

The Hayman fire was a forest fire that started [tpl]convert|95|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of Denver, Colorado and [tpl]convert|35|mi|km[/tpl] northwest of Colorado Springs on June 8, 2002, and became the largest of the Colorado wildfires in the state's recorded history. Hundreds of firefighters fought the fast-moving fire, which caused nearly $40 million in firefighting costs, burned 133 homes, 138,114 acres, and forced the evacuation of 5,340 people. Smoke could be seen and smelled across the state from Vail, [tpl]convert|108|mi|km[/tpl] northwest, to Burlington, [tpl]convert|188|mi|km[/tpl] east, and from Broomfield, [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] north, to Walsenburg, [tpl]convert|130|mi|km[/tpl] south.  The fire wasn't contained until July 2, 2002 and was finally brought under control on July 18, 2002.   The cause of the wildfire was found to be arson.
When then-Governor Bill Owens responded to a reporter’s question following an aerial tour of the fires ("What does it look like up there?"), Owens said "It looks as if all of Colorado is burning today." Many western slope residents blamed Owens for driving away tourists with the press's truncated version of the quote ("All of Colorado is burning.")

[[Biophoton]]

CATEGORIES: Bioluminescence, Photons, Pseudoscience

A biophoton (from the Greek βίος meaning "life" and φῶς meaning "light") is a photon of non-thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum  emitted from a biological system. Emission of biophotons is technically a type of bioluminescence, but the latter term is  generally reserved for higher luminance luciferin/luciferase systems. The term biophoton used in this narrow sense should not be confused with the broader field of biophotonics, which studies the general interaction of light with biological systems.
The typical observed radiant emittance of biological tissues in the visible and ultraviolet frequencies ranges from 10−19 to 10−16 W/cm2 (approx 1-1000 photons/cm2/second). This light intensity is much weaker than that seen in the perceptually visible and well-researched phenomenon of normal bioluminescence but is detectable above the background of thermal radiation emitted by tissues at their normal temperature.
While detection of biophotons has been reported by several groups,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03325.x |title=Biophoton detection as a novel technique for cancer imaging |year=2004 |last1=Takeda |first1=Motohiro |last2=Kobayashi |first2=Masaki |last3=Takayama |first3=Mariko |last4=Suzuki |first4=Satoshi |last5=Ishida |first5=Takanori |last6=Ohnuki |first6=Kohji |last7=Moriya |first7=Takuya |last8=Ohuchi |first8=Noriaki |journal=Cancer Science |volume=95 |issue=8 |pages=656–61 |pmid=15298728[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0846.2010.00442.x |title=Ultra-weak photon emission as a non-invasive tool for monitoring of oxidative processes in the epidermal cells of human skin: Comparative study on the dorsal and the palm side of the hand |year=2010 |last1=Rastogi |first1=Anshu |last2=Pospíšil |first2=Pavel |journal=Skin Research and Technology |pmid=20637006 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=365–70[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/1011-1344(93)80076-L |title=Artificial sunlight irradiation induces ultraweak photon emission in human skin fibroblasts |year=1993 |last1=Niggli |first1=Hugo J. |journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology |volume=18 |issue=2–3 |pages=281–5 |pmid=8350193[/tpl] hypotheses that such biophotons indicate the state of biological tissues and facilitate a form of cellular communication are controversial.

A psychiatric medication is a licensed psychoactive drug taken to exert an effect on the chemical makeup of the brain and nervous system. Thus, these medications are used to treat mental disorders. Usually prescribed in psychiatric settings, these medications are typically made of synthetic chemical compounds, although some are naturally occurring, or at least naturally derived. Since the mid-20th century, such medications have been leading treatments for a broad range of mental disorders and have decreased the need for long-term hospitalization therefore lowering the cost of mental health care.T.L.

[[Middle English creole hypothesis]]

CATEGORIES: Middle English language, Language contact

The Middle English creole hypothesis is the concept that the English language is a creole, i.e., a language that developed from a pidgin. The vast differences between Old and Middle English have led some historical linguists to claim that the language underwent creolisation at the time of Norman conquest.
The theory was first proposed in 1977 by C. Bailey and K. Maroldt and has since found both supporters and detractors in the academic world.[ref]This judgement is found in both of these books:
The argument in favour of calling Middle English a creole comes from the extreme reduction in inflected forms from Old English to Middle English. The system of declension of nouns was radically simplified and analogized. The verb system also lost many old patterns of conjugation. Many strong verbs were reanalysed as weak verbs. The subjunctive mood became much less distinct. Syntax was also simplified somewhat, with word order patterns becoming more rigid.
These grammatical simplifications resemble those observed in pidgins, creoles and other contact languages, which arise when speakers of different languages need to communicate. Such contact languages usually lack the inflections of either parent language, or drastically simplify them.
However, many say that English is probably not a creole because it retains a high number (283) of irregular verbs.The morphology and syntax of present-day English: an introduction, S. H. Olu Tomori
It is certain that Old English underwent grammatical changes, e.g., the collapse of all cases into genitive and common. However, the reduction of unstressed vowels to schwa, due to a fixed stress location, contributed to this process, a pattern which is common to many Germanic languages (although a few, such as dialects of Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese, have not undergone this reduction of vowel sounds). The process of case collapse was also already underway in Old English, e.g. in strong masculine nouns, where the nominative and accusative cases had become identical. Thus the simplification of noun declension from Old English to Middle English may have had causes unrelated to creolization, although creolization may have caused the grammatical changes to occur more rapidly.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]

The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous military campaignBlair 1996, p xiiiWoodman 2004, p 1 in World War II, running from 1939 to the defeat of Germany in 1945. At its core was the Allied naval blockade of Germany, announced the day after the declaration of war, and Germany's subsequent counter-blockade. It was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943. The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) and aircraft of the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) against the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Navy, and Allied merchant shipping. The convoys, coming mainly from North America and predominantly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces. These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States from September 13, 1941.Carney, Robert B., Admiral, USN. "Comment and Discussion" United States Naval Institute Proceedings January 1976, p.74. Admiral Carney was assistant chief of staff and operations officer to Admiral Arthur L. Bristol, commander of the support force of United States ships and planes providing North Atlantic trade convoy escort services. This support force was designated Task Force 24 after the declaration of war. The Germans were joined by submarines of the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on June 10, 1940.
As an island nation, the United Kingdom was highly dependent on imported goods. Britain required more than a million tons of imported material per week in order to be able to survive and fight. In essence, the Battle of the Atlantic was a tonnage war: the Allied struggle to supply Britain and the Axis attempt to stem the flow of merchant shipping that enabled Britain to keep fighting. From 1942 onwards, the Germans also sought to prevent the build-up of Allied supplies and equipment in the British Isles in preparation for the invasion of occupied Europe. The defeat of the U-boat threat was a pre-requisite for pushing back the Germans, Winston Churchill was later to state:Costello & Hughes, p.210.
 The Battle of the Atlantic was the dominating factor all through the war. Never for one moment could we forget that everything happening elsewhere, on land, at sea or in the air depended ultimately on its outcome. 
The outcome of the battle was a strategic victory for the Allies—the German blockade failed—but at great cost: 3,500 merchant ships and 175 warships were sunk for the loss of 783 U-boats.
The name "Battle of the Atlantic" was coined by Winston Churchill in February 1941.Keegan, John, "Churchill Strategy", Churchill. Edited by William Roger Louis. Oxford University Press, 1996. p. 341. It has been called the "longest, largest, and most complex" naval battle in history.David Syrett, The defeat of the German U-boats: The Battle of the Atlantic (1994). The campaign started immediately after the European war began, and lasted six years. It involved thousands of ships in more than 100 convoy battles and perhaps 1,000 single-ship encounters, in a theatre covering thousands of square miles of ocean. The situation changed constantly, with one side or the other gaining advantage, as new weapons, tactics, counter-measures, and equipment were developed by both sides. The Allies gradually gained the upper hand, overcoming German surface raiders by the end of 1942 and defeating the U-boats by mid-1943, though losses to U-boats continued to war's end.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 1964 children's book by British author Roald Dahl. The story features the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was first published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in 1964 and in the United Kingdom by George Allen & Unwin in 1967. The book was adapted into two major motion pictures: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory in 1971, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 2005. The book's sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, was written by Roald Dahl in 1972. Dahl had also planned to write a third book in the series but never finished it.Martin Chilton (18 November 2010) The 25 best children's books The Daily Telegraph
The story was originally inspired by Roald Dahl's experience of chocolate companies during his schooldays. Cadbury would often send test packages to the schoolchildren in exchange for their opinions on the new products. At that time (around the 1920s), Cadbury and Rowntree's were England's two largest chocolate makers and they each often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies, posing as employees, into the other's factory. Because of this, both companies became highly protective of their chocolate-making processes. It was a combination of this secrecy and the elaborate, often gigantic, machines in the factory that inspired Dahl to write the story.Bathroom Readers' Institute. "You're My Inspiration."

[[Fractal antenna]]
CATEGORIES: Radio frequency antenna types, Fractals

A fractal antenna is an antenna that uses a fractal, self-similar design to maximize the length, or increase the perimeter (on inside sections or the outer structure), of material that can receive or transmit electromagnetic radiation within a given total surface area or volume.
Such fractal antennas are also referred to as multilevel and space filling curves, but the key aspect lies in their repetition of a motif over two or more scale sizes,Nathan Cohen (2002) "Fractal antennas and fractal resonators" [tpl]US Patent|6452553[/tpl] or "iterations". For this reason, fractal antennas are very compact, multiband or wideband, and have useful applications in cellular telephone and microwave communications.
A good example of a fractal antenna as a spacefilling curve is in the form of a shrunken fractal helix.http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/Panorama/ManuFractals/FractalAntennas/FracTenna4.gif Here, each line of copper is just a small fraction of a wavelength.
A fractal antenna's response differs markedly from traditional antenna designs, in that it is capable of operating with good-to-excellent performance at many different frequencies simultaneously.  Normally standard antennas have to be "cut" for the frequency for which they are to be used—and thus the standard antennas only work well at that frequency.
This makes the fractal antenna an excellent design for wideband and multiband applications. In addition the fractal nature of the antenna shrinks its size, without the use of any components, such as inductors or capacitors.

Georgetown is the capital and chief settlement of Ascension Island, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, situated on the west coast of the island.
The town is centred around St Mary's Church, part of the Diocese of St Helena and the former Exiles Club, which is on the site of the original Royal Marines barracks from the times of Napoleon's exile to Saint Helena in the early 19th century. The town is named for King George III, who reigned at the time the island was claimed for Britain and garrisoned by the Admiralty in 1815. As well as the church, there is a pier, an athletics track, a small supermarket, Royal Mail post office, snackbar, hotel, police station, hospital, dental surgery and a library. There is no school however and pupils travel to Two Boats village, 3 miles inland.
The hill overlooking the town is called Cross Hill. On it is Fort Thornton, with some Victorian cannons and a pair of BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval guns that were originally fitted to [tpl]HMS|Hood|51|6[/tpl]. These guns were used to repel a German attack by U-124 on 9 December 1941 during World War II with surprisingly great success as the Germans did not approach the island again.  There is another old fort on the other side of the town, Fort Hayes, which houses the museum of the Ascension Island Heritage Society.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.obsidian.co.ac/ascension.html|title=Ascension Island Information|publisher=Obsidian Group Ltd|accessdate=2013-03-28[/tpl]
The town is a centre of culture on Ascension.  It usually hosts local athletics events as well as being the start of the annual dew pond race from sea level to the highest point on the island on Green Mountain. Ascension Day activities (to celebrate the discovery of Ascension) are either hosted here or in nearby Two Boats village. [tpl]As of|2008[/tpl] the population was about 450.

Stephen Crane (November 1, 1871 – June 5, 1900) was an American author.  Prolific throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the Realist tradition as well as early examples of American Naturalism and Impressionism.  He is recognized by modern critics as one of the most innovative writers of his generation.
The eighth surviving child of Methodist Protestant parents, Crane began writing at the age of four and had published several articles by the age of 16.  Having little interest in university studies, he left school in 1891 to work as a reporter and writer.  Crane's first novel was the 1893 Bowery tale Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, generally considered by critics to be the first work of American literary Naturalism.  He won international acclaim in 1895 for his Civil War novel The Red Badge of Courage, which he wrote without any battle experience.
In 1896, Crane endured a highly publicized scandal after appearing as a witness in the trial of a suspected prostitute, an acquaintance named Dora Clark.  Late that year he accepted an offer to travel to Cuba as a war correspondent.  As he waited in Jacksonville, Florida, for passage, he met Cora Taylor, the madam of a brothel, with whom he began a lasting relationship.  En route to Cuba, Crane's ship sank off the coast of Florida, leaving him and others adrift for several days in a dinghy.  Crane described the ordeal in "The Open Boat".  During the final years of his life, he covered conflicts in Greece and lived in England with Cora, where he befriended writers such as Joseph Conrad and H. G. Wells.  Plagued by financial difficulties and ill health, Crane died of tuberculosis in a Black Forest sanatorium at the age of 28.
At the time of his death, Crane was considered an important figure in American literature.  After he was nearly forgotten for two decades, critics revived interest in his life and work. Crane's writing is characterized by vivid intensity, distinctive dialects, and irony.  Common themes involve fear, spiritual crises and social isolation.  Although recognized primarily for The Red Badge of Courage, which has become an American classic, Crane is also known for his poetry, journalism, and short stories such as "The Open Boat", "The Blue Hotel", "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky", and The Monster.  His writing made a deep impression on 20th-century writers, most prominent among them Ernest Hemingway, and is thought to have inspired the Modernists and the Imagists.

Newcastle United Football Club (often abbreviated to NUFC) is an English professional association football club based in Newcastle upon Tyne. The club was founded in 1892, by the merger of Newcastle East End and Newcastle West End, and has played at its current home ground, St James' Park, since. The ground was developed into an all-seater stadium in the mid-1990s and now has a capacity of 52,405. The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but two years of the competition's history, and has never dropped below English football's second tier since joining the Football League in 1893. In 2007, long term chairman and owner Sir John Hall sold his share in the club to Mike Ashley.
They have won four League Championship titles and six FA Cups, as well as the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Newcastle United has the ninth highest total of major honours won by an English club. The club's most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their First Division titles. The club is the twentieth richest club in the world in terms of annual revenue, generating €115.3m in 2012. Historically, Newcastle’s highest placing was fifth in the world.[tpl]cite news| title = Man Utd 'Richest club in the world'| quote = The next British side on the list, at fifth, is Newcastle United... | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 1999-12-01 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/543805.stm | accessdate = 2013-09-11  | archiveurl =  | archivedate = [/tpl]
They have a fierce local rivalry with Sunderland, and the two clubs have engaged in the Tyne–Wear derby since 1898. The club's traditional kit colours are black and white striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Their traditional crest takes elements of the city coat of arms, which features two seahorses.

California Birth Index, 1905-1995. Sacramento, CA, USA: State of California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics. (born June 17, 1925) is an American medicinal chemist, biochemist,  pharmacologist,    psychopharmacologist, and author. Shulgin is credited with introducing MDMA ("ecstasy") to psychologists in the late 1970s for psychopharmaceutical use. He discovered, synthesized, and personally bioassayed over 230 psychoactive compounds, and evaluated them for their psychedelic and/or entactogenic potential. 
In 1991 and 1997, he and his wife Ann Shulgin authored the books PIHKAL and TIHKAL (standing for Phenethylamines and Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved), which extensively described their work and personal experiences with these two classes of psychoactive drugs. Shulgin performed seminal work into the descriptive synthesis of many of these compounds. Some of Shulgin's noteworthy discoveries include compounds of the 2C* family (such as 2C-B) and compounds of the DOx family (such as DOM). 
Due in part to Shulgin's extensive work in the field of psychedelic research and the rational drug design of psychedelic drugs, he has since been dubbed the "godfather of psychedelics".http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA8ddx_iC_g "DIRTY PICTURES" - Alexander Shulgin documentary movie trailer, SXSW 2010

Neutral Moresnet"The Moresnet Republic; Belgium Expects the District to Revert to Her" New York Times 20 September 1903, p. 5. was a small Belgian-Prussian condominium that existed from 1816 to 1920 between present-day Belgium and Germany. Its northernmost border point at the Vaalserberg connected it to a quadripoint shared additionally with the Dutch Province of Limburg, which today is known as the "Three Country Point".  Prior to Belgian independence in 1830, the territory was a Dutch-Prussian condominium. During the First World War, the territory was annexed into Germany, although the allies did not recognise the annexation.
The former territory is now in the Belgian city of Kelmis.  Today, it is especially of interest to Esperantists because of initiatives to found an Esperanto-speaking state on the territory in the early 20th century.

Raleigh is home to North Carolina State University and is part of the Research Triangle area, together with Durham (home of Duke University) and Chapel Hill (home of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The "Triangle" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham County partway between the three cities and their universities. The Research Triangle region encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2013/index|title=Population Estimates 2013 Combined Statistical Areas: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|date=|accessdate=2014-03-27[/tpl] The Raleigh Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.

Raleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city, chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. In the United States Civil War the city was spared from any significant battle, only falling in the closing days of the war, though it did not escape the economic hardships that plagued the rest of the American South during the Reconstruction Era. The twentieth century saw the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, and with the jobs it created the region and city saw a large influx of population, making it one of the fastest growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.
Raleigh is home to numerous cultural, educational, and historic sites. The Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts in Downtown Raleigh features three theater venues and serves as the home for the North Carolina Symphony. Walnut Creek Amphitheatre is a large music amphitheater located in Southeast Raleigh. Museums in Raleigh include the North Carolina Museum of Art in West Raleigh, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History and North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences located next to each other near the State Capitol in Downtown Raleigh. Several major universities and colleges call Raleigh home, including North Carolina State University, the largest public university in the state, and Shaw University, the first historically black university in the American South and site of the foundation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, an important civil rights organization of the 1960s.

Harrisburg played a notable role in American history during the Westward Migration, the American Civil War, and the Industrial Revolution. During part of the 19th century, the building of the Pennsylvania Canal and later the Pennsylvania Railroad allowed Harrisburg to become one of the most industrialized cities in the Northeastern United States. The U.S. Navy ship USS Harrisburg, which served from 1918 to 1919 at the end of World War I, was named in honor of the city.
In the mid-to-late 20th century, the city's economic fortunes fluctuated with its major industries consisting of government, heavy manufacturing including the production of steel, agriculture (the greater Harrisburg area is at the heart of the fertile Pennsylvania Dutch Country), and food services (nearby Hershey is home of the chocolate maker, located just [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] east of Harrisburg). In 1981, following contractions in the steel and dairy industries, Harrisburg was declared the second most distressed city in the nation.Case Number 23, Harrisburg, PA Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.

[[Fifth Beatle]]
CATEGORIES: The Beatles members

The Fifth Beatle is an informal title that various commentators in the press and entertainment industry have applied to persons who were at one point a member of the Beatles, or who had a strong association with the "Fab Four" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr) during the group's existence. The "Fifth Beatle" claims started appearing in the press immediately upon the band's sensational rise to global fame in 1963–64 as the most famous quartet in pop culture.
At the Beatles' 1988 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Harrison at one point stated that there were only two "fifth Beatles": Derek Taylor and Neil Aspinall (referring to the Beatles' public relations manager and road manager-turned-business-executive, respectively).[tpl]cite book|last=Du Noyer|first=Paul|title=Liverpool - Wondrous Place: From the Cavern to the Capital of Culture|year=2012|publisher=Virgin Digital|isbn=0753512696|page=43[/tpl]  In a 1997 BBC interview, McCartney stated: "If anyone was the fifth Beatle, it was manager Brian Epstein."brianepstein.com: McCartney's comments about the fifth Beatle. Retrieved 12 March 2007 Lennon was critical of individuals who claimed credit for the Beatles success, including the individual Beatles themselves, saying in his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, "I’m not the Beatles. I’m me. Paul isn’t the Beatles. Brian Epstein wasn’t the Beatles, neither is Dick James.

The term is not used to indicate the chronology of band members joining the group. Pete Best joined Lennon, McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison on the eve of their Hamburg sojourn, the five using the monikers, "The Silver Beetles" and "The Silver Beatles" (they would experiment with "The Beat Brothers" and ultimately "The Beatles" while in Hamburg with Best).

In chemistry, soap is a salt of a fatty acid.IUPAC. "IUPAC Gold Book – soap" Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997). XML on-line corrected version: created by M. Nic, J. Jirat, B. Kosata; updates compiled by A. Jenkins. ISBN 0-9678550-9-8. [tpl]doi|10.1351/goldbook[/tpl]. Accessed 2010-08-09 Soaps are mainly used as surfactants for washing, bathing, and cleaning, but they are also used in textile spinning and are important components of lubricants.
Soaps for cleansing are obtained by treating vegetable or animal oils and fats with a strongly alkaline solution. Fats and oils are composed of triglycerides; three molecules of fatty acids are attached to a single molecule of glycerol.Cavitch, Susan Miller. The Natural Soap Book. Storey Publishing, 1994 ISBN 0-88266-888-9. The alkaline solution, which is often called lye (although the term "lye soap" refers almost exclusively to soaps made with sodium hydroxide), brings about a chemical reaction known as saponification. In this reaction, the triglyceride fats are first hydrolyzed into free fatty acids, and then these combine with the alkali to form crude soap, an amalgam of various soap salts, excess fat or alkali, water, and liberated glycerol (glycerin). The glycerin is a useful by-product, which can be left in the soap product as a softening agent, or isolated for other uses.
Soaps are key components of most lubricating greases, which are usually emulsions of calcium soap or lithium soaps and mineral oil. These calcium- and lithium-based greases are widely used. Many other metallic soaps are also useful, including those of aluminium, sodium, and mixtures of them. Such soaps are also used as thickeners to increase the viscosity of oils. In ancient times, lubricating greases were made by the addition of lime to olive oil.Thorsten Bartels et al.

Henry IV (13 December 1553 – 14 May 1610), Henri-Quatre ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁiˈkatʁ[/tpl]), also known by the epithet "Good King Henry", was King of Navarre (as Henry III) from 1572 to 1610 and King of France from 1589 to 1610. He was the first French monarch of the House of Bourbon.
Baptised as a Catholic but raised in the Protestant faith by his mother Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre, he inherited the throne of Navarre in 1572 on the death of his mother. As a Huguenot, Henry was involved in the French Wars of Religion, he barely escaped assassination at the time of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, and he later led Protestant forces against the royal army.
As a French "prince of the blood" by reason of his descent from King Louis IX, he ascended the throne of France upon the death of his childless brother-in--law Henry III in 1589. In accepting the throne, he found it prudent to abjure his Calvinist faith. Regardless, his coronation was followed by a four-year war against the Catholic League to establish his legitimacy. As a pragmatic politician (in the parlance of the time, a politique), he displayed an unusual religious tolerance for the time. Notably, 
he promulgated the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which guaranteed religious liberties to Protestants, thereby effectively ending the Wars of Religion. He was assassinated by François Ravaillac, a fanatical Catholic, and was succeeded by his son Louis XIII.Baird, Henry M., The Huguenots and Henry of Navarre, Vol. 2, (Charles Scribner's Sons:New York, 1886), 486.
Considered as an usurper by Catholics and as a traitor by Protestants, Henry was hardly accepted by the population and escaped at least 12 assassination attempts.Pierre Miquel, Les Guerres de religion, Paris, Club France Loisirs, 1980 (ISBN 2-7242-0785-8) p. 399. An unpopular king during his reign, Henry's popularity greatly improved posthumously.Le Figaro, "Henri IV, Dès sa mort, il entre dans la légende", 1/8/2009 [http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2009/08/01/01006-20090801ARTFIG00046--henri-iv-des-sa-mort-il-entre-dans-la-legende-.php The "Good King Henry" (le bon roi Henri) was remembered for his geniality and his great concern about the welfare of his subjects. He was celebrated in the popular song Vive le roi Henri and in Voltaire's Henriade.

''In vitro'' fertilisation (IVF) is a process by which an egg is fertilised by sperm outside the body: in vitro. IVF is a major treatment for infertility when other methods of assisted reproductive technology have failed. The process involves monitoring and stimulating a woman's ovulatory process, removing ovum or ova (egg or eggs) from the woman's ovaries and letting sperm fertilise them in a fluid medium in a laboratory. The fertilised egg (zygote) is cultured for 2–6 days in a growth medium and is then transferred to the mother's uterus with the intention of establishing a successful pregnancy. The first successful birth of a "test tube baby", Louise Brown, occurred in 1978. Louise Brown was born as a result of natural cycle IVF where no stimulation was made. Robert G. Edwards, the physiologist who developed the treatment, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010.
The term in vitro, from the Latin meaning in glass, is used, because early biological experiments involving cultivation of tissues outside the living organism from which they came, were carried out in glass containers such as beakers, test tubes, or petri dishes. Today, the term in vitro is used to refer to any biological procedure that is performed outside the organism it would normally be occurring in, to distinguish it from an in vivo procedure, where the tissue remains inside the living organism within which it is normally found. A colloquial term for babies conceived as the result of IVF, "test tube babies", refers to the tube-shaped containers of glass or plastic resin, called test tubes, that are commonly used in chemistry labs and biology labs. However, in vitro fertilisation is usually performed in the shallower containers called Petri dishes. One IVF method, autologous endometrial coculture, is actually performed on organic material, but is still considered in vitro.

[[Tap dance]]
CATEGORIES: Tap dance, African-American dance

Tap dance is a form of dance characterized by using the sound of one's tap shoes hitting the floor (or other surfaces) as a percussive instrument. As such, it is also commonly considered to be a form of music. Two major variations on tap dance exist: rhythm (Jazz) tap and Broadway tap. Broadway tap focuses more on the dance. It is widely performed as a part of musical theater. Rhythm tap focuses more on musicality, and practitioners consider themselves to be a part of the Jazz tradition.
The sound is made by shoes with a metal "tap" on the heel and toe. Tap shoes can be bought at most dance shops. There are different brands of shoes which sometimes differ in the way they sound.
"Soft-Shoe" is a rhythm form of tap dancing that does not require special shoes, and while rhythm is generated by tapping of the feet, it also uses sliding of the feet (even sometimes using scattered sand on the stage to enhance the sound of the performer's sliding feet) more often than modern rhythm tap. It preceded what is currently considered to be modern tap, but has since declined in popularity.

[[Soil retrogression and degradation]]

CATEGORIES: Environmental soil science

Soil retrogression and degradation  are two regressive evolution processes associated with the loss of equilibrium of a stable soil. Retrogression is primarily due to erosion and corresponds to a phenomenon where succession reverts to pioneer conditions (such as bare ground).  Degradation is an evolution, different from natural evolution, related to the local climate and vegetation. It is due to the replacement of primary plant communities(known as climax) by the secondary communities. This replacement modifies the humus composition and amount, and affects the formation of the soil. It is directly related to human activity. Soil degradation may also be viewed as any change or disturbance to the soil perceived to be deleterious or undesirable.Johnson, D.L., S.H. Ambrose, T.J. Bassett, M.L. Bowen, D.E. Crummey, J.S. Isaacson, D.N. Johnson, P. Lamb, M. Saul, and A.E. Winter-Nelson.  1997.  Meanings of environmental terms.  Journal of Environmental Quality 26: 581-589.
At the beginning of soil formation, the bare rock out crops is gradually colonized by pioneer species (lichens and mosses). They are succeeded by herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and finally forest. In parallel, the first humus-bearing horizon is formed (the A horizon), followed by some mineral horizons (B horizons). Each successive stage is characterized by a certain association of soil/vegetation and environment, which defines an ecosystem.
After a certain time of parallel evolution between the ground and the vegetation, a state of steady balance is reached. This stage of development is called climax by some ecologists and "natural potential" by others. Succession is the evolution towards climax. Regardless of its name, the equilibrium stage of primary succession is the highest natural form of development that the environmental factors are capable of producing.
The cycles of evolution of soils have very variable durations, between tens, hundreds, or thousands of years for quickly evolving soils (A horizon only) to more than a million years for slowly developing soils. The same soil may achieve several successive steady state conditions during its existence, as exhibited by the Pygmy forest sequence in Mendocino County, California.  Soils naturally reach a state of high productivity, from which they naturally degrade as mineral nutrients are removed from the soil system.  Thus older soils are more vulnerable to the effects of induced retrogression and degradation.

is a genus of about 850 species of woody trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in the family Moraceae. Collectively known as fig trees or figs, they are native throughout the tropics with a few species extending into the semi-warm temperate zone. The Common Fig (F. carica) is a temperate species native to southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region (from Afghanistan  to Portugal), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its fruit, also referred to as figs. The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as bushfood. However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of considerable cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

CATEGORIES: 1265 in England, Military history of Worcestershire, Battles of the Barons' Wars, Registered historic battlefields in England, Conflicts in 1265, Evesham

The Battle of Evesham was one of the two main battles of 13th century England's Second Barons' War. It marked the defeat of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and the rebellious barons by Prince Edward – later King Edward I – who led the forces of his father, King Henry III. It took place on 4 August 1265, near the town of Evesham, Worcestershire.
With the Battle of Lewes Montfort had won control of royal government, but after the defection of several close allies and the escape from captivity of Prince Edward, he found himself on the defensive. Forced to engage the royalists at Evesham, he faced an army twice the size of his own. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and his body mutilated. Though the battle effectively restored royal authority, scattered resistance remained until the Dictum of Kenilworth was signed in 1267.

Brest ([tpl]IPA-fr|bʁɛst[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-br|brest|Breton:[/tpl]) is a city in the Finistère département in Brittany in northwestern France. Located in a sheltered position not far from the western tip of the Breton peninsula, and the western extremity of metropolitan France, Brest is an important harbour and the second French military port after Toulon. The city is located on the western edge of continental Europe. With 142,722 inhabitants in a 2007 census, Brest is at the centre of Western Brittany's largest metropolitan area (with a population of 300,300 in total), ranking third behind only Nantes and Rennes in the whole of historic Brittany, and the 22nd most populous city in France; moreover, Brest provides services to the one million inhabitants of Western Brittany.Brest.fr – Brest perspectives  Although Brest is by far the largest city in Finistère, the préfecture (regional capital) of the department is the much smaller  Quimper.
During the Middle Ages, the history of Brest was the history of its castle. Then Richelieu made it a military harbour. Brest grew around its arsenal, until the second part of the 20th century. Heavily damaged by the Allies' bombing raids during World War II, the city centre was completely rebuilt after the war. At the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, the deindustrialization of the city was followed by the development of the service sector. Nowadays, Brest is an important university town with 23,000 students.[tpl]cite web|author=Gaële MALGORN |url=http://www.participation-brest.net/article1533.html |title=Brest accueille ses 23 000 étudiants |publisher=Participation Brest |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=6 April 2011[/tpl] Besides a multidisciplinary university, the University of Western Brittany, Brest and its surrounding area possess several prestigious French elite schools such as École Navale (the French Naval Academy), Télécom Bretagne and the Superior National School of Advanced Techniques of Brittany (ENSTA Bretagne, formerly ENSIETA). Brest is also an important research centre, mainly focused on the sea, with among others the largest Ifremer (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) centre, le Cedre (Centre of Documentation, Research and Experimentation on Accidental Water Pollution) and the French Polar Institute.
Brest’s history has always been linked to the sea: the Académie de Marine (Naval Academy) was founded in 1752 in this city as well as the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle was built there. Every four years, Brest hosts the international festival of the sea, boats and sailors: it is a meeting of old riggings from around the world.

The Verkhoyansk Range ([tpl]lang-ru|Верхоянский хребет[/tpl]) is a mountain range of eastern Siberia, spanning roughly 1000 km (600 m.), across the Sakha Republic. It forms a vast arc between the Lena and Aldan rivers to the west and the Yana River to the east. It rises to ca. 2,480 m (8,150 ft) in the south. There are coal, silver, lead, and zinc deposits. It lies just west of the boundary of the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates.News Archive - The Earth Institute at Columbia University
The world's lowest temperatures for inhabited places have been recorded in this region, and there is quite deep snow cover for most of the year. During the Last Glacial Maximum the range contained extensive glaciers, and the scenery in the summer is typical of "alpine" mountains.

CATEGORIES: Glands, Endocrine system, Human head and neck, Neuroendocrinology

In vertebrate anatomy, the pituitary gland, or hypophysis, is an endocrine gland about the size of a pea and weighing [tpl]convert|0.5|g|oz[/tpl] in humans. It is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, and rests in a small, bony cavity (sella turcica) covered by a dural fold  (diaphragma sellae). The posterior pituitary (or neurohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence via a small tube called the pituitary stalk (also called the infundibular stalk or the infundibulum). The anterior pituitary (or adenohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that regulates several physiological processes (including stress, growth, reproduction, and lactation). The pituitary gland sits in the hypophysial fossa, situated in the sphenoid bone in the middle cranial fossa at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland secretes nine hormones that regulate homeostasis.[tpl]cn|date=September 2013[/tpl]

Vitus Jonassen Bering (baptised 5 August 1681 in Horsens, Denmark – 8 December 1741 on Bering Island, Russia,[tpl]harvnb|Frost|2003|pp=xx–xxi[/tpl]All dates are here given in the Julian calendar, which was in use throughout Russia at the time. also known as Ivan Ivanovich Bering[tpl]harvnb|Armstrong|1982|p=161[/tpl]) was an explorer and officer in the Russian Navy. He is known for his two explorations of the north-eastern coast of the Asian continent and from there the western coast on the North American continent. The Bering Strait, the Bering Sea, Bering Island, the Bering Glacier and the Bering Land Bridge have since all been (posthumously) named in his honour.
Taking to the seas at the age of 18, Bering travelled extensively over the next eight years, as well as taking naval training at Amsterdam. In 1704, he enrolled with the rapidly expanding Russian navy of Peter the Great. After serving with the navy in significant but non-combat roles during the Great Northern War, Bering resigned in 1724 to avoid the continuing embarrassment of his low rank to Anna, his wife of eleven years. Having obtained a promotion on his retirement to the level of first captain, Bering kept this rank when he decided to rejoin the Russian navy later the same year. He was selected by Peter to captain the first Kamchatka expedition, an expedition set to sail north from Russian outposts on the Kamchatka peninsula, probably with the greatest emphasis on mapping the new areas visited (and particularly establishing Asia and America shared a land border). Bering departed St. Petersburg in February 1725 at the head of a 34-man expedition, aided by the expertise of lieutenants Martin Spangberg and Aleksei Chirikov. The party took on men as it headed towards Okhotsk, encountering many difficulties (most notably a lack of food) before they arrived in the settlement. From there, they sailed to the Kamchatka peninsula, preparing new ships there and sailing north (repeating a little documented journey of Semyon Dezhnyov eighty years previously). In August 1728, Bering decided that they had sufficient evidence that there was clear sea between Asia and America, which he did not sight during the trip. For the  first expedition, Bering was rewarded with money, prestige, and a promotion to the noble rank of Captain Commander. He immediately started preparations for a second trip.
Having returned to Okhotsk with a much larger, better prepared, and much more ambitious expedition, Bering set off for an expedition towards North America in 1741. While doing so, the expedition spotted Mount Saint Elias, and sailed past Kodiak Island. A storm separated the ships, but Bering sighted the southern coast of Alaska, and a landing was made at Kayak Island or in the vicinity. Adverse conditions forced Bering to return, and he discovered some of the Aleutian Islands on his way back. One of the sailors died and was buried on one of these islands, and the group was named after him (as the Shumagin Islands). Bering himself became too ill to command his ship, which was at last driven to seek refuge on an uninhabited island in the Commander Islands group (Komandorskiye Ostrova) in the southwest Bering Sea.  On 19 December 1741 Vitus Bering died on the island, which was given the name Bering Island after him, near the Kamchatka Peninsula, reportedly from scurvy (although this has been contestedThe 1991 Russian-Danish expedition that exhumed Bering's remains also analyzed teeth and bones and concluded that he did not die from scurvy. Based on analyses made in Moscow and on Steller's original report, heart failure was the likely cause of death [tpl]harv|Frost|2003[/tpl].), along with 28 men of his company.

The Battle of Culloden ([tpl]lang-gd|Blàr Chùil Lodair[/tpl]) was the final confrontation of the 1745 Jacobite Rising. On 16 April 1746, the Jacobite forces of Charles Edward Stuart fought loyalist troops commanded by William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. The Hanoverian victory at Culloden decisively halted the Jacobite intent to overthrow the House of Hanover and restore the House of Stuart to the British throne; Charles Stuart never mounted any further attempts to challenge Hanoverian power in Great Britain. The conflict was the last pitched battle fought on British soil.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/trails_union_culloden.shtml|title=The Making of the Union|accessdate=14 June 2009[/tpl]
Charles Stuart's Jacobite army consisted largely of Scottish Highlanders, as well as a number of Lowland Scots and a small detachment of Englishmen from the Manchester Regiment. The Jacobites were supported and supplied by the Kingdom of France from Irish and Scots units in the French service. A composite battalion of infantry ("Irish Picquets") comprising detachments from each of the regiments of the Irish Brigade plus one squadron of Irish cavalry in the French army served at the battle alongside the regiment of Royal Scots (Royal Ecossais) raised the previous year to support the Stuart claim.McGarry,Stephen, Irish Brigades Abroad Dublin 2013. The British Government (Hanoverian loyalist) forces were mostly English, along with a significant number of Scottish Lowlanders and Highlanders, a battalion of Ulstermen and some Hessians from Germany[tpl]Cite book|title=Culloden Moor and story of the battle|location=Oxford|first=Peter|last=Anderson|publisher=E. Mackay|year=1920|page=16[/tpl] and Austrians.Pollard, Tony. Culloden: The History and Archaeology of the last Clan Battle. Published 2009. ISBN 1-84884-020-9. The battle on Culloden Moor was both quick and bloody, taking place within an hour. Following an unsuccessful Highland charge against the government lines, the Jacobites were routed and driven from the field.
Between 1,500 and 2,000 Jacobites were killed or wounded in the brief battle, while government losses were lighter with 50 dead and 259 wounded, although recent geophysical studies on the government burial pit suggest the figure to be nearer 300.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] The battle and its aftermath continue to arouse strong feelings: the University of Glasgow awarded Cumberland an honorary doctorate, but many modern commentators allege that the aftermath of the battle and subsequent crackdown on Jacobitism were brutal, and earned Cumberland the sobriquet "Butcher". Efforts were subsequently taken to further integrate the comparatively wild Highlands into the Kingdom of Great Britain; civil penalties were introduced to weaken Gaelic culture and attack the Scottish clan system.

[[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]]
CATEGORIES: Nehwon, Nehwon characters, Fantasy books by series, Fictional mercenaries, Fictional swordsmen, Picaresque novels

Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are two  sword-and-sorcery heroes appearing in stories written by American author Fritz Leiber. They are the protagonists of what are probably Leiber's best-known stories. One of his motives in writing them was to have a couple of fantasy heroes closer to true human nature than the likes of Howard's Conan the Barbarian or Burroughs's Tarzan."Author's Foreword," Ill-Met in Lankhmar, 1995, White Wolf Publishing
Fafhrd is a tall (seven feet) northern barbarian, very strong and usually wielding a two-hand sword, which he can hold even one-handed; Mouser is a small (not much more than five feet) mercurial thief, truly gifted and deadly at fencing and dueling, using his sword in one hand and a long dagger in the other; once known as Mouse and a former wizard's apprentice. Fafhrd talks like a romantic, but his strong practicality usually wins through, while the cynical-sounding Mouser is prone to showing strains of sentiment at unexpected times. Both are rogues, existing within a decadent world where to be so is a requirement of survival. They spend a lot of time drinking, feasting, wenching, brawling, stealing, and gambling, and are seldom fussy about who hires their swords. But they are humane and—most of all—relish true adventure.
The characters were loosely modeled upon Leiber himself and his friend Harry Otto Fischer. Fischer initially created them in a letter to Leiber in September 1934, naming at the same time their home city of Lankhmar. In 1936, Leiber finished the first Fafhrd and Gray Mouser novella, Adept's Gambit, and began work on a second, The Tale of the Grain Ships. At the same time, Fischer was writing the beginning of The Lords of Quarmall. Adept's Gambit would not see publication until 1947, while The Lords of Quarmall would be finished by Leiber and published in 1964 and The Tale of the Grain Ships would become the prototype for "Scylla's Daughter" (1961) and, later, the novel The Swords of Lankhmar (1968).
The stories of the two were only loosely connected until the 1960s, when Leiber organized them chronologically and added additional material in preparation for paperback publication. Starting as young men, the two separately meet their female lovers, meet each other, and lose both their lovers in the same night, which explains both their friendship and the arrested adolescence of their lifestyles. However, in later stories, the two mature, learn leadership, and eventually settle down with new female partners on the Iceland-like Rime Isle. Leiber contemplated continuing the series beyond this point, but died prior to doing so.

Koryaks (or Koriak) are an indigenous people of Kamchatka Krai in the Russian Far East, who inhabit the coastlands of the Bering Sea to the south of the Anadyr basin and the country to the immediate north of the Kamchatka Peninsula, the southernmost limit of their range being Tigilsk, Russia. They are akin to the Chukchis, whom they closely resemble in culture and physique. They are more distantly related to the Kamchadal (Itelmens) on the Kamchatka Peninsula.
The Koryaks' neighbors are the Evens to the west of Koryak lands, the Alutor to the south on the isthmus of Kamchatka Peninsula, the Kerek to the east, and the Chukchi to the northeast.
The Koryak are typically split into two groups:  the coastal people Nemelan (or Nymylan) meaning 'village dwellers,' due to their living in villages. Their sedentary lifestyle is based on local fishing. The inland Koryak, reindeer herders, are called Chaucu (or Chauchuven), meaning 'rich in reindeer.' They are more nomadic, following the herds as they graze with the seasons.
The Koryak language and its relative, Alutor, are linguistically very close to Chukchi. They are members of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family.

CATEGORIES: 1780 deaths, Grammarians of English, Year of birth unknown

The Reverend Mr. Thomas Dilworth (died 1780) was an English cleric and author of a widely used schoolbook, both in Great Britain and America, A New Guide to the English Tongue.  Noah Webster as a boy studied Dilworth's book, and was inspired partly by it to create his own spelling book on completely different principles, using pictures and stories of interest to children. By some accounts Dilworth was one of the few schoolbooks used by Abraham Lincoln. Published in 1761, by 1773, it was in its thirty-sixth edition. The last American edition was published in 1827 in New Haven, Connecticut. The full-page frontispiece portrait of the author was well-known to generations of doodling school children and is mentioned in Dickens; in Sketches by Boz. Chapter X there is a humorous description of rowers'  togs on the Thames:
The other front matter provides an extensive preface, a dedication to the Anglican schools of Great Britain and Ireland, recommendations from educators and a full-page poetic encomium to Dilworth by J. Duick:
 What thanks, my friend, should to thy care be given
 Which makes the paths to science smooth and even. 
 Henceforth our youth who tread thy flowery way,
 Shall ne'er from rules of proper diction stray;
 No more their speech with barbarous terms be filled
 No more their pens a crop of nonsense yield.
Dilworth's book  plays the part of a paragon in the poem "The Rising Village" by Oliver Goldsmith about the influences of  improper education in a Nova Scotia community.
Dilworth also wrote other schoolbooks on arithmetic and bookkeeping.

The Hawker Hurricane is a British single-seat fighter aircraft that was designed and predominantly built by Hawker Aircraft Ltd for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Although largely overshadowed by the Supermarine Spitfire, the aircraft became renowned during the Battle of Britain, accounting for 60% of the RAF's air victories in the battle, and served in all the major theatres of the Second World War.
The 1930s design evolved through several versions and adaptations, resulting in a series of aircraft which acted as interceptor-fighters, fighter-bombers (also called "Hurribombers"), and ground support aircraft. Further versions known as the Sea Hurricane had modifications which enabled operation from ships. Some were converted as catapult-launched convoy escorts, known as "Hurricats".  More than 14,583 Hurricanes were built by the end of 1944 (including at least 800 converted to Sea HurricanesThetford 1994, p. 232. and some 1,400 built in Canada by Canadian Car and Foundry).

The Battle of Britain  (German: Luftschlacht um England, literally "Air battle for England") is the name given to the Second World War air campaign waged by the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) against the United Kingdom during the summer and autumn of 1940. The name is derived from a famous speech delivered by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the House of Commons: "... the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin.""Audio Clip of Churchill's speech." UK: BBC. Retrieved 28 June 2010.
The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces,"92 Squadron – Geoffrey Wellum." Battle of Britain Memorial Flight via raf.mod.uk.. Retrieved 17 November 2010. and was also the largest and most sustained aerial bombing campaign to that date. The German objective was to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF), especially Fighter Command.  From July 1940, coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres, such as Portsmouth, were the main targets; one month later, the Luftwaffe shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure. As the battle progressed, the Luftwaffe also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure. Eventually the Luftwaffe resorted to attacking areas of political significance and using terror bombing strategy.[tpl]#tag:ref|The strategic bombing commenced after the Germans bombed London on 14 September 1940, followed by the RAF bombing Berlin and German air force bases in France.

By preventing Germany from gaining air superiority, the battle ended the threat that Hitler would launch Operation Sea Lion, an amphibious and airborne invasion of Britain. However, Germany continued bombing operations on Britain, known as The Blitz. The failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defences, or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or an outright surrender, is considered its first major defeat and a crucial turning point in the Second World War.Bungay 2000, p. 388.

It should not be confused with Eusko Gudariak ("Basque Soldiers"), the anthem of the Eusko Gudarostea (the Basque Army during the Spanish Civil War) or with the Gernikako Arbola ("The tree of Guernica"), a popular Basque song.
It is sung to a traditional Basque tune. One of the most prominent Basque nationalists,  Sabino Arana, wrote the lyrics. It was used by his party (PNV) and in the 1930s adopted by the first Basque government.
Its re-proclamation by the Basque Parliament on 14 April 1983 was opposed by several parties that deemed it still to be bound to the PNV rather than to the rest of the Basques.
The law makes official the music with no lyrics, since opposition parties felt the Arana text too religious and linked to PNV.
It is a testament to the word usage of Sabino Arana that the three words of the title are neologisms he created himself.

Disarmament is the act of reducing, limiting, or abolishing weapons. Disarmament generally refers to a country's military or specific type of weaponry. Disarmament is often taken to mean total elimination of weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear arms. General and Complete Disarmament was defined by the United Nations General Assembly as the elimination of all WMD, coupled with the “balanced reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, based on the principle of undiminished security of the parties with a view to promoting or enhancing stability at a lower military level, taking into account the need of all States to protect their security.”.[ref] UN General Assembly, Final Document of the First Special Session on Disarmament, para. 22.

[[Shortwave radio]]

CATEGORIES: International broadcasting, Radio terminology, Guglielmo Marconi, Radio spectrum

Shortwave radio (as the name implies) refers to radio transmissions using shortwave frequencies. The widest popular definition of the shortwave frequency interval is the ITU Region 1 (EU+Africa+Russia...) definition, and is the span 1.6–30 MHz. ca. 1.6 MHz is just above medium wave.
There are also other definitions of the shortwave frequency interval:
Shortwave radio received its name because the wavelengths in this band are shorter than 200 m (1500 kHz) which marked the original upper limit of the medium frequency band first used for radio communications. The  broadcast medium wave band now extends above the 200 m/1500 kHz limit, and the amateur radio 1.8 MHz – 2.0 MHz band (known as the "top band") is the lowest-frequency band considered to be 'shortwave'.
Initially thought to be useless, shortwave radio is used for long distance communication by means of skywave or skip propagation, in which the radio waves are reflected back to Earth from the ionosphere, allowing communication around the curve of the Earth.  Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music, and long-distance communication to ships and aircraft, or to remote areas out of reach of wired communication or other radio services. Additionally, it is used for two-way international communication by amateur radio enthusiasts for hobby, educational and emergency purposes.

For centuries, datura has been used as a herbal medicine to relieve asthma symptoms and as an analgesic during surgery or bonesetting. It is also a powerful hallucinogen and deliriant, which is used spiritually for the intense visions it produces. However, the tropane alkaloids which are responsible for both the medicinal and hallucinogenic properties are fatally toxic in only slightly higher amounts than the medicinal dosage, and careless use often results in hospitalizations and deaths.

Ian Lancaster Fleming (28 May 1908 – 12 August 1964) was an English author, journalist and naval intelligence officer, best known for his James Bond series of spy novels. Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co., and his father was the Member of Parliament for Henley from 1910 until his death on the Western Front in 1917. Educated at Eton, Sandhurst and the universities of Munich and Geneva, Fleming moved through a number of jobs before he started writing.
While working for Britain's Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, Fleming was involved in planning Operation Goldeneye and in the planning and oversight of two intelligence units, 30 Assault Unit and T-Force. His wartime service and his career as a journalist provided much of the background, detail and depth of the James Bond novels.
Fleming wrote his first Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1952.  It was a success, with three print runs being commissioned to cope with the demand.  Eleven Bond novels and two short-story collections followed between 1953 and 1966. The novels revolved around James Bond, an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Reserve.  The Bond stories rank among the best-selling series of fictional books of all time, having sold over 100 million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the children's story Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang and two works of non-fiction. In 2008, The Times ranked Fleming fourteenth on its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".
He was married to Ann Charteris, who was divorced from the second Viscount Rothermere as a result of her affair with Fleming. Fleming and Charteris had a son, Caspar. Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker who suffered from heart disease; he died in 1964, aged 56, from a heart attack. Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously, and others have since produced Bond novels. Fleming's creation has appeared in film twenty-five times, portrayed by seven actors.

[[Gladius]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman legionary equipment, Blade weapons, Roman swords

Gladius ([tpl]lang-la|glădĭus[/tpl]) was one Latin word for sword and is used to represent the primary sword of Ancient Roman foot soldiers. Early ancient Roman swords were similar to those used by the Greeks. From the 3rd century BC, the Romans adopted swords similar to those used by the Celtiberians and others during the early part of the conquest of Hispania. This sword was known as the Gladius Hispaniensis, or "Spanish Sword".[tpl]cite book |first=Jane |last=Penrose |year=2008 |title=Rome and Her Enemies: An Empire Created and Destroyed by War |publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=121–122 |isbn=1-84603-336-5[/tpl]
A fully equipped Roman legionary was armed with a shield (scutum), one or two javelins (pila), a sword (gladius), often a dagger (pugio), and perhaps, in the later Empire period, darts (plumbatae). Conventionally, the javelins would be thrown to disable the shields and disrupt the formation of the enemy before engaging in close combat, for which the gladius would be drawn. The soldier generally led with his shield and thrust with his sword. All types of gladius appear to have also been suitable for cutting and chopping motions as well as for thrusting.Vegetius De Re Militari 2.15

The weapon combined the weight and power of an axe with the versatility of a sword. Falchions are found in different forms from around the 11th century up to and including the sixteenth century. In some versions the falchion looks rather like the scramasax and later the sabre, and in some versions the form is irregular or like a machete with a crossguard.

Monocoque ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|n|ɵ|k|ɒ|k[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|n|ɵ|k|oʊ|k[/tpl]) is a structural approach that supports loads through an object's external skin, similar to an egg shell. The term is also used to indicate a structure in which the skin provides the main structural support, although this is rare and is usually confused with either semi-monocoque or a unibody. The word monocoque comes from the Greek for single (mono) and French for shell (coque).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monocoque |title=Monococque definition |date=26 September 2011 |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica[/tpl] The technique may also be called structural skin. The term is often misused for sub-components that are superficially monocoques, but which are used as a part of a larger frame structure.
Alternatives to monocoque include trusses, unibodies, inflatable shells and semi-monocoque or stressed skin. The semi-monocoque is a hybrid combining a tensile shell and compressive structure made up of longerons and ribs or frames.[tpl]cite book |title=Airframe and Powerplant Mechanics Airframe Handbook (Publication AC65-15A) |year=1976 |publisher=US Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration Standards Division |location=Washington, DC |page=4 |ISBN=0-16-036209-1[/tpl]

In the wake of Aristotle's Poetics (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make genre distinctions, whether at the scale of poetry in general (where the tragic divides against epic and lyric) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to comedy). In the modern era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, melodrama, the tragicomic, and epic theatre.[tpl]Sfn | Carlson | 1993[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Pfister | 1977[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Elam | 1980[/tpl]  Drama, in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-generic deterritorialization from the mid-19th century onwards.

An epiphyte is a plant that grows non-parasitically upon another plant (such as a tree), and derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and sometimes from debris accumulating around it instead of the structure it is fastened to. An epiphytic organism that is not a plant is not called an epiphyte.[tpl]cite book|author=Hickey, M.; King, C.|year=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press[/tpl] Epiphytes are usually found in the temperate zone (e.g., many mosses, liverworts, lichens, and algae) or in the tropics (e.g., many ferns, cacti, orchids, and bromeliads).Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged.

Epiphyte is one of the subdivisions of the Raunkiær system.
The term epiphytic derives from the Greek epi- (meaning 'upon') and phyton (meaning 'plant'). Epiphytic plants are sometimes called "air plants" because they do not root in soil. However, there are many aquatic species of algae, including seaweeds, that are epiphytes on other aquatic plants (seaweeds or aquatic angiosperms).
The best-known epiphytic plants include mosses, orchids, and bromeliads such as Spanish moss (of the genus Tillandsia), but epiphytes may be found in every major group of the plant kingdom. 89% of epiphyte species (about 24,000) are flowering plants.  The second largest group are the leptosporangiate ferns, with about 2800 species (10% of epiphytes). In fact, about one third of all ferns are epiphytes.Hogan, C Michael, 2010. Fern.

[[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]]

CATEGORIES: Anterior pituitary hormones, Peptide hormones

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), also known as corticotropin, is a polypeptide tropic hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. It is an important component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and is often produced in response to biological stress (along with its precursor corticotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus). Its principal effects are increased production and release of corticosteroids. Primary adrenal insufficiency, also called Addison's disease, occurs when adrenal gland production of cortisol is chronically deficient, resulting in chronically elevated ACTH levels; when a pituitary tumor is the cause of elevated ACTH (from the anterior pituitary) this is known as Cushing's Disease and the constellation of signs and symptoms of the excess cortisol (hypercortisolism) is known as  Cushing's syndrome. A deficiency of ACTH is a cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency. ACTH is also related to the circadian rhythm in many organisms.[tpl]Cite journal|last1= Dibner|first1= Charna|last2= Schibler|first2= Ueli|last3= Albrecht|first3= Urs|title= The Mammalian Circadian Timing System: Organization and Coordination of Central and Peripheral Clocks| journal= Annual Review of Physiology|volume= 72|year= 2010|pages= 517–549|doi= 10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135821|pmid=20148687|postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]

The Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was a major German offensive campaign launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in Belgium, France and Luxembourg on the Western Front toward the end of World War II in Europe. The surprise attack caught the Allied forces completely off guard and became the costliest battle in terms of casualties for the United States, whose forces bore the brunt of the attack. It also severely depleted Germany's war-making resources.
The battle was known by different names. The Germans referred to it as Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein ("Operation Watch on the Rhine"), while the French named it the Bataille des Ardennes ("Battle of the Ardennes"). The Allies called it the Ardennes Counteroffensive.  The phrase "Battle of the Bulge" was coined by contemporary press to describe the way the Allied front line bulged inward on wartime news maps[tpl]sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=4[/tpl][tpl]efn|[tpl]harvnb|Eggenberger|1985[/tpl] cites the official name as Ardennes-Alsace campaign; David Eggenberger describes this battle as the Second Battle of the Ardennes.[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Stanton|2006|p= [/tpl] and became the best known name for the battle.
The German offensive was supported by several subordinate operations known as Unternehmen Bodenplatte, Greif, and Währung. Germany's goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capture Antwerp, and then proceed to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis Powers' favour. Once that was accomplished, Hitler could fully concentrate on the eastern theatre of war.
The offensive was planned with the utmost secrecy, minimizing radio traffic and moving troops and equipment under cover of darkness. The Third U.S. Army's intelligence staff predicted a major German offensive, and Ultra indicated that a "substantial and offensive" operation was expected or "in the wind", although a precise date or point of attack could not be given. Aircraft movement from the Russian Front and transport of forces by rail, both to the Ardennes, was noticed but not acted upon, according to a report later written by Peter Calvocoressi and F. L. Lucas at the codebreaking centre Bletchley Park.Top Secret Ultra by Peter Calvocoressi (1980, Cassell, London) p. 48 ISBN 0-304-30546-4Secret Days: Code-breaking in Bletchley Park by Asa Briggs (2011, Frontline Books, London) pp. 122-3 ISBN 978-1-84832-615-6
Near-complete surprise was achieved by a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions, which grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive around Elsenborn Ridge and in the south around Bastogne blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success; columns that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads. This and terrain that favoured the defenders threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops. Improved weather conditions permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment, as survivors retreated to the defenses of the Siegfried Line.

It is a perennial plant, growing to 2 cm tall and 10 cm or more wide. The leaves are evergreen, 2-3.5 cm long, in a basal rosette, forming clumps. The trumpet-shaped terminal flowers are blue with olive-green spotted longitudinal throats. They grow on a very short peduncle, 3–6 cm long. The flower stem is often without leaves, or has 1 or 2 pairs of leaves. It likes full sun, is fully hardy and flowers in late spring and summer.
This plant, like others of its genus, is valued in cultivation for the unusually pure intense blue of its blooms. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[tpl]cite web|title=Gentiana acaulis AGM|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=852|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl]

[[Airship]]

CATEGORIES: Airships, Hydrogen technologies, Edwardian era, Victorian era, Aeronautics, Gases

An airship or dirigible is a type of aerostat or lighter-than-air aircraft that is propelled through the air by engine power. An aerostat stays aloft by having a large "envelope" filled with a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air. In early dirigibles, the lifting gas used was hydrogen, due to its high lifting capacity.
Helium gas has almost the same lifting capacity and is also nonflammable, but is rare and relatively expensive. Significant amounts were first discovered in the United States and, for a while, helium was rarely used for airships outside the United States.[tpl]cite web | title = Discovery of Helium in Natural Gas at the University of Kansas | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/heliumnaturalgas.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 [/tpl] Most airships built since the 1960s have used helium, though some have used hot air.A few airships after World War II still used hydrogen. The first British airship to use helium was the Chitty Bang Bang of 1967.
Besides the main envelope, an airship also has engines and crew accommodation, typically in a gondola hung beneath the envelope.
The main types of airship are non-rigid, semi-rigid, and rigid. Non-rigid airships, often called "blimps",  rely on internal pressure to maintain the shape of the airship. Semi-rigid airships maintain the envelope shape by internal pressure, but have some form of supporting structure, such as a fixed keel, attached to it. Rigid airships have an outer structural framework which maintains the shape and carries all structural loads, while the lifting gas is contained in one or more internal gas bags or cells.Mowthorpe, C. E. S. Battlebags, British Airships of the First World War, Phoenix Mill, United Kingdom.  Alan Sutton Publishing, 1995, p. xx. ISBN 0-7509-0989-7 Rigid airships were first flown by Count Zeppelin and the vast majority of rigid airships built were manufactured by the firm he founded. As a result, all rigid airships are sometimes called zeppelins.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014|reason=where are the RS for this exact usage? What about semi-rigids, can they be reliably ruled out?[/tpl]
Airships were the first aircraft capable of controlled powered flight, and were most commonly used before the 1940s, but their use decreased over time as their capabilities were surpassed by those of aeroplanes. Their decline was accelerated by a series of high-profile accidents, including the 1930 crash and burning of British R101 in France, the 1933 storm-related crash of the [tpl]USS|Akron|ZRS-4|6[/tpl] and the 1937 burning of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg. From the 1960s, helium airships have been used in applications where the ability to hover in one place for an extended period outweighs the need for speed and manoeuvrability such as advertising, tourism, camera platforms, geological surveys, and aerial observation.
A total of 4,700 airships now exist across the world.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014|reason=really? Does that include radio-control toys?[/tpl]

The similarity of the words "Natter" and "adder" and the fact that the only widespread snake species in Britain is a viper/adder may have caused the frequent confusion.) was a World War II German point-defence rocket-powered interceptor, which was to be used in a very similar way to a manned surface-to-air missile. After a vertical take-off, which eliminated the need for airfields, the majority of the flight to the Allied bombers was to be controlled by an autopilot. The primary mission of the relatively untrained pilot, was to aim the aircraft at its target bomber and fire its armament of rockets. The pilot and the fuselage containing the rocket motor would then land under separate parachutes, while the nose section was disposable. The only manned vertical take-off flight on 1 March 1945 ended in the death of the test pilot, Lothar Sieber.

Good Friday is a religious holiday, observed primarily by Christians, commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary. The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover. It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Black Friday,[ref]

Mohave or Mojave (Mojave: 'Aha Makhav) are a Native American people indigenous to the Colorado River in the Mojave Desert. The Fort Mojave Indian Reservation includes parts of California, Arizona, and Nevada. The Colorado River Indian Reservation includes parts of California and Arizona and is shared by members of the Chemehuevi, Hopi, and Navajo peoples.
The original Colorado River and Fort Mojave reservations were established in 1865 and 1870, respectively. Both reservations include substantial senior water rights in the Colorado River, which are used for irrigated farming. Though the four combined tribes sharing the Colorado River Indian Reservation function today as one geo-political unit, the federally recognized Colorado River Indian Tribes, each continues to maintain and observe its individual traditions, distinct religions, and culturally unique identities.
The tribal headquarters, library and museum are in Parker, Arizona, about 40 miles (64 km) north of I-10.

[[Microwave oven]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking appliances, Microwave technology, American inventions, 1945 introductions

A microwave oven, often colloquially shortened to microwave, is a kitchen appliance that heats food by bombarding it with electromagnetic radiation in the microwave spectrum causing polarized molecules in the food to rotate and build up thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer [tpl]nowrap|25–38 mm[/tpl] of a dense (high water content) food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in thick, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques.
Percy Spencer invented the first microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed during the war. Named the "Radarange", it was first sold in 1947. Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was first introduced by Tappan in 1955, but these units were still too large and expensive for general home use. The countertop microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation, which was acquired in 1965 by Raytheon.
Microwave ovens are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking vegetables. They are also useful for rapid heating of otherwise slowly prepared cooking items, such as hot butter, fats, and chocolate. Unlike conventional ovens, microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they rarely attain the necessary temperatures to produce Maillard reactions. Exceptions occur in rare cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other very oily items (such as bacon), which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water. The boiling-range temperatures produced in high-water-content foods give microwave ovens a limited role in professional cooking,Hervé This, Révélations gastronomiques, Éditions Belin. ISBN 2-7011-1756-9 since it usually makes them unsuitable for achievement of culinary effects where the flavors produced by the higher temperatures of frying, browning, or baking are needed. However, additional heat sources can be added to microwave ovens, or into combination microwave ovens, to produce these other heating effects, and microwave heating may cut the overall time needed to prepare such dishes. Some modern microwave ovens may be part of an over-the-range unit with built-in extractor hoods.

Tora! Tora! Tora! ([tpl]lang-ja|トラ・トラ・トラ[/tpl]) is a 1970 American-Japanese war film that dramatizes the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The film was directed by Richard Fleischer and stars an ensemble cast, including Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, Sō Yamamura, E. G. Marshall, James Whitmore and Jason Robards.
The title is the Japanese code-word used to indicate that complete surprise had been achieved. Tora (虎, [tpl]IPA-ja|tòɽá|pron[/tpl])) literally means "tiger", but in this case was an acronym for ''totsugeki raigeki''　(突撃雷撃, "lightning attack").

[[Harvard architecture]]

CATEGORIES: Computer architecture, Classes of computers

The Harvard architecture is a computer architecture with physically separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data. The term originated from the Harvard Mark I relay-based computer, which stored instructions on punched tape (24 bits wide) and data in electro-mechanical counters. These early machines had data storage entirely contained within the central processing unit, and provided no access to the instruction storage as data. Programs needed to be loaded by an operator; the processor could not boot itself.
Today, most processors implement such separate signal pathways for performance reasons but actually implement a modified Harvard architecture, so they can support tasks such as loading a program from disk storage as data and then executing it.

Bourgeoisie (Eng.: [tpl]IPAc-en|b|ʊər|ʒ|w|ɑː|ˈ|z|iː[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-fr|buʁʒwazi[/tpl]) is a word from the French language, used in the fields of political economy, political philosophy, sociology, and history, which originally denoted the wealthy stratum of the middle class that originated during the latter part of the Middle Ages (AD 500–1500).Bourgeoisie, “burguesía” in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Española (1994)Webster’s New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language — Unabridged (1951) p. 205. The utilization and specific application of the word is from the realm of the social sciences.
In sociology and in political science, the noun bourgeoisie and the adjective bourgeois are terms that describe a historical range of socio-economic classes. As such, in the Western world, since the late 18th century, the bourgeoisie describes a social class "characterized by their ownership of capital, and their related culture"; hence, the personal terms bourgeois (masculine) and bourgeoise (feminine) culturally identify the man or woman who is a member of the wealthiest social class of a given society, and their materialistic worldview (Weltanschauung).
In Marxist philosophy, the term bourgeoisie denotes the social class who owns the means of production and whose societal concerns are the value of property and the preservation of capital, in order to ensure the perpetuation of their economic supremacy in society.Bourgeois Society Joseph Schumpeter instead saw the creation of new bourgeoisie as the driving force behind the capitalist engine, particularly entrepreneurs who took risks in order to bring innovation to industries and the economy through the process of creative destruction.Joseph A.

Plant systematics a phylogenetic approach. 3rd ed. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, Inc., 2007. These inferior ovaries characterize the Bromelioideae, a subfamily of the Bromeliaceae.Sajo, M. G. "Floral anatomy of Bromeliaceae, with particular reference to the epigyny and septal nectaries in commelinid monocots." Plant Systematics and Evolution 247 (2004): 215-31. The family includes both epiphytes, such as Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), and terrestrial species, such as the pineapple (Ananas comosus). Many bromeliads are able to store water in a structure formed by their tightly-overlapping leaf bases. However, the family is diverse enough to include the tank bromeliads, grey-leaved epiphyte Tillandsia species that gather water only from leaf structures called trichomes, and a large number of desert-dwelling succulents.
The largest bromeliad is Puya raimondii, which reaches 3–4 m tall in vegetative growth with a flower spike 9–10 m tall, and the smallest is Spanish moss.

[[LL parser]]

CATEGORIES: Parsing algorithms, Articles with example C++ code

In computer science, an LL parser is a top-down parser for a subset of the context-free grammars. It parses the input from Left to right, and constructs a Leftmost derivation of the sentence (hence LL, compared with LR parser that constructs a rightmost derivation in reverse). The class of grammars which are parsable in this way is known as the LL grammars.
An LL parser is called an LL(k) parser if it uses k tokens of lookahead when parsing a sentence. If such a parser exists for a certain grammar and it can parse sentences of this grammar without backtracking then it is called an LL(k) grammar. A language that has an LL(k) grammar is known as an LL(k) language. There are LL(k+n) languages that are not LL(k) languages.http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=805431 A corollary of this is that not all context-free languages are LL(k) languages. An LL parser is called an LL(*) parser if it is not restricted to a finite k tokens of lookahead, but can make parsing decisions by recognizing whether the following tokens belong to a regular language (for example by means of a Deterministic Finite Automaton).
LL grammars, particularly LL(1) grammars, are of great practical interest, as parsers for these grammars are easy to construct, and many computer languages are designed to be LL(1) for this reason. LL parsers are table-based parsers, similar to LR parsers. LL grammars can alternatively be characterized as precisely those that can be parsed by a predictive parser – a recursive descent parser without backtracking – and these can be readily written by hand. This article is about the table-based parsers themselves; for formal properties of the grammar, see LL grammar, while for alternative parsing, see predictive parser.

Handy remains among the most influential of American songwriters. Though he was one of many musicians who played the distinctively American form of music known as the blues, he is credited with giving it its contemporary form. While Handy was not the first to publish music in the blues form, he took the blues from a regional music style with a limited audience to one of the dominant national forces in American music.
Handy was an educated musician who used folk material in his compositions.  He was scrupulous in documenting the sources of his works, which frequently combined stylistic influences from several performers.

Only ten are traditionally listed, hence the era's name, "Ten Kingdoms"; some historians, such as Bo Yang, count eleven, including Yan and Qi but not Northern Han, viewing it as simply a continuation of Later Han.

Vladimir Vasilyevich Atlasov or Otlasov ([tpl]Lang-ru|Влади́мир Васи́льевич Атла́сов[/tpl] or Отла́сов) (born in Veliky Ustyug between 1661 and 1664—died in 1711) was a Siberian Cossack who was the first Russian to explore the Kamchatka Peninsula. Atlasov Island, an uninhabited volcanic island off the southern tip of Kamchatka, is named after him.
He is first heard of around 1682 collecting Yasak on the Aldan River and one of the Uda Rivers. In 1695 the voyevoda of Yakutsk appointed him prikazshchik of Anadyrsk. The Russians here had heard reports of a 'Kamchatka River' to the south and were already collecting yasak on the headwaters of the rivers that flow south toward Kamchatka. At least one of them had followed the Penzhina River to the Sea of Okhotsk. In 1696 he sent Luka Morozko south to explore. Morozko got as far south as the Tegil River on the west side of the peninsula and returned with some 'mysterious writings', apparently from a wrecked Japanese ship. In 1697 Atlasov set off south with 65 serving-men and 60 Yukaghirs. Travelling on reindeer, they reached the mouth of the Penzhina River. He went down the west coast for two weeks and then crossed to the east coast. (Lantzeff has this as February 1697 on the Olyutorsky Gulf, but the Russian wiki has him leaving in the spring of 1697 and the Olyutorsky Gulf is rather far to the northeast). He left Morzoko to explore the east side and returned to the west side, but Morozko had to be recalled to deal with a Yukaghir mutiny (at the Palana River). Going south to the Tegil River, he heard reports of the Kamchatka River and recrossed the Central Range to the Kamchatka where he met the Itelmens for the first time. He made an alliance with one clan and went downriver and burned a village of their enemies. Returning, he learned that some Koryaks had stolen his reindeer. He chased them, killed about 150 and retrieved his reindeer. Continuing down the west side he reached the Icha River where he rescued or captured a Japanese sailor who had been shipwrecked. Further south he reached the Golygina River area, from which he was able to see Atlasov Island. Here he met the first Ainu and managed to kill fifty of them.  Returning north to the Icha, he sent a party of men over the mountains to build an ostrog at Verkhnekamchatsk on the upper Kamchatka. Here he decided to return to Anadyrsk, either under pressure of his men or because he was running short of gunpowder and lead.
He reached Anadyrsk in July 1699 and wrote a report. He was in Yakutsk in June 1700 and in February 1701 he reached Moscow where he presented his report. He was promoted to Golova and sent back to administer Kamchatka. On the Angara River in 1701 he met and plundered a merchant's boat loaded with Chinese goods. For this he and his men were thrown in jail. Kamchatka became increasingly disorderly and in 1707 Atlasov was released and sent to Kamchatka to restore order. On the journey his methods were so rough that most of his men sent a letter of protest to Yakutsk. He pacified the natives to some degree, but in December 1707 his own cossacks revolted and imprisoned him. He escaped (from Verkhnekamchatsk) and went downriver to Nizhnekamchatsk, but the local commander refused to step aside and give him command. What he did for the next four years is uncertain. In January 1711 he was murdered in his sleep by another band of mutineers.

Sakhalin ([tpl]lang-ru|Сахалин[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ru|səxɐˈlʲin|pron[/tpl]) is a large Russian island in the North Pacific Ocean, lying between 45°50' and 54°24' N. It is Russia's largest island, and is administered as part of Sakhalin Oblast. Sakhalin, which is about one fifth the size of Japan, is just off the east coast of Russia, and just north of Japan.
The indigenous peoples of the island are the Ainu, Oroks and Nivkhs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://museum.sakh.com/eng/10.shtml |title=The Sakhalin Regional Museum: The Indigenous Peoples |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Sakh.com |accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Sakhalin has been claimed by both Russia and Japan over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. This has led to bitter disputes between the two countries over control of the island. Russia seized the island from the Japanese near the end of World War II.

Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990 its legal name has been Channel 3, to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time, namely BBC 1, BBC 2 and Channel 4. In part, the number 3 was assigned as television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button, with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name.
ITV is a network of television channels that operate regional television services as well as sharing programmes between each other to be displayed on the entire network. In recent years, several of these companies have merged so currently the fifteen franchises are in the hands of three companies.
The ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc, the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England, Wales, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Similarly the ITV brand is the brand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas. Of the companies external to ITV plc, STV and UTV use their own brands in their own respective areas (northern and central Scotland and Northern Ireland).

The strait is [tpl]convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|20|to|40|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] deep. A small rocky island, appropriately named Kamen Opasnosti (Russian for "Rock of Danger") is located in the Russian waters in the northeastern part of the strait.

The strait is named after Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, who explored the channel in 1787.THE 17TH AND 18TH CENTURIES 
Japan's territorial waters extend to three nautical miles into La Pérouse Strait instead of the usual twelve, reportedly to allow nuclear-armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan's prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory.Kyodo News, "Japan left key straits open for U.S. nukes", Japan Times, June 22, 2009.

Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose (born 21 September 1963) is a former cricketer from Antigua who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height—he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall—allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. He was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1992; after he retired he was entered into the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame and selected as one of West Indies all-time XI by a panel of experts.
Born in Swetes, Antigua, Ambrose came to cricket at a relatively late age, having preferred basketball in his youth, but quickly made an impression as a fast bowler. Progressing through regional and national teams, he was first chosen for the West Indies in 1988. He was almost immediately successful and remained in the team until his retirement in 2000. On many occasions, his bowling was responsible for the West Indies winning matches which seemed lost, particularly in association with Courtney Walsh. Against Australia in 1993, he took seven wickets while conceding a single run; in 1994 he was largely responsible for bowling England out for 46 runs, taking six for 24 (six wickets for 24 runs).
Ambrose's bowling method relied on accuracy and conceding few runs; several of his best performances came when he took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. He was particularly successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed that he was no longer effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less effective in the early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both men often bowled with little support from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band. He was knighted by the Antiguan government in 2014.

The county was created on September 10, 1784, out of land originally part of Philadelphia County. The first courthouse was housed in the Barley Sheaf Inn.  It is believed to have been named either for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City, Canada, or for the Welsh county of Montgomeryshire (which was named after one of William the Conqueror's main counselors, Roger de Montgomerie), as it was part of the Welsh Tract, an area of Pennsylvania settled by Quakers from Wales. Early histories of the county indicate the origin of the county's name as uncertain.

right|thumb|Numeral 70 identifying Boyle, diamond bars for IrelandA cancellation (or cancel for short; French: "oblitération") is a postal marking applied on a postage stamp or postal stationery to deface the stamp and prevent its re-use. Cancellations come in a huge variety of designs, shapes, sizes and colors. Modern United States cancellations commonly include the date and post office location where the stamps were mailed, in addition to lines or bars designed to cover the stamp itself.  The term "postal marking" sometimes is used to refer specifically to the part that contains the date and posting location, although the term often is used interchangeably with "cancellation."L.N. Williams, Fundamentals of Philately (American Philatelic Society, State College, PA rev. ed. 1990) p. 20.  The portion of a cancellation that is designed to deface the stamp and does not contain writing is also called the "obliteration"Scott US p. 30A.  or killer. Some stamps are issued  pre-cancelled with a printed or stamped cancellation and do not need to have a cancellation added.  Cancellations can affect the value of stamps to collectors, positively or negatively. The cancellations of some countries have been extensively studied by philatelists and many stamp collectors and postal history collectors collect cancellations in addition to the stamps themselves.

Cossacks ([tpl]lang-ua|козаки́, koza'ky|links=no[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ru|казаки́ kəzɐ'kʲi or каза́ки kɐ'zakʲi, kazaki|links=no[/tpl]), are a group of predominantly East Slavic people who became known as members of democratic, semi-military communities,Cossacks lived along major rivers — Dnieper, Don, Volga, Terek, Ural, Amur — and had excellent naval capabilities and skills — they were excellent fishermen and sea merchants in peaceful times and executed expert naval service in war times. Cossacks combined features of US cowboys, US cavalry, and the US Navy. predominantly located in Ukraine and in Southern Russia. They inhabited sparsely populated areas and islands in the lower Dnieper,R.P. Magocsi, A History of Ukraine, pp. 179–181 Don, Terek, and Ural river basins and played an important role in the historical and cultural development of both Russia and Ukraine.A noted author Count Leo Tolstoy wrote "... that all of of the Russian history has been made by Cossacks. No wonder Europeans call all of us that... Our people as a whole wish to be Cossacks." (L. Tosltoy, A Complete Collection of Works, v. 48, page 123, Moscow, 1952; Полн. собр. соч. в 90 т. М., 1952 г., т.48, стр. 123)"
The origins of the first Cossacks are disputed, though the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk claimed Khazar origin.In the 19th century, Peter V. Golubovsky of Kiev University explained that the Severians made up a significant part of early medieval Russians and Khazars. He described the Khazar state as the "Slavic stronghold in the East". Many Khazars, like Cossacks, as described in The Cossacks (novel) by Leo Tolstoy, could be Slavic-Turkic bilinguals. *[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Golubovsky Peter V. (1884) Pechenegs, Torks and Cumans before the invasion of the Tatars. History of the South Russian steppes in the 9th-13th Centuries (Печенеги, Торки и Половцы до нашествия татар. История южно-русских степей IX—XIII вв.); available at Runivers.ru in DjVu format. Later Mikhail Artamonov and his school confirmed many of Golubovsky's conclusions.The connection is in part supported by old Cossack ethonyms such as kazara ([tpl]lang-ru|казара[/tpl]), kazarla ([tpl]lang-ru|казарла[/tpl]), kozarlyhi([tpl]lang-ua|козарлюги[/tpl]), kazare ([tpl]lang-ru|казарре[/tpl]); cf. N. D. Gostev, "About the use of "Kazarа" and other derivative words," Kazarla ethnic magazine, 2010, №1. (link) The name of Khazars in Old Russian chronicles is kozare ([tpl]lang-ua|козаре[/tpl]). The traditional post-imperial historiography dates the emergence of Cossacks to the 14th or 15th centuries, when two connected groups emerged, the Zaporozhian Sich of the Dnieper and the Don Cossack Host.The Don Host and the Sich region had close ties, and both Hosts participated in numerous joint war expeditions. The best known is Azov Sitting, when Don and Zaporozhian Cossacks took over the Azov fortress and defended it with the aid of volunteers for 5 years against Turkish armed forces. A permanent exchange of Cossacks took place between the Zaporozhie region and the Don region; Dinskoy (Don) Kuren (division) was one of the Kurens that made up the Sich. The historical relation between the groups is reflected in similar names among major towns in the Don and Dniepr regions, for example, Novocherkassk city and Starocherkasskaya stanitsa in the Don region, and Cherkasy city in Ukraine. Moscovite chronicles use the exonym Cherkasy to refer to both enemy Cossacks (from Polish, Turk, and Tatar armies) and Dnieper Cossacks, even when the latter were allied with Moscow. The Lower Dnieper (Zaporozhian) Cossacks often referred to Higher Dnieper (Malorussian) Cossacks as Cherkasy as well.
The Zaporizhian Sich were a vassal people of Poland–Lithuania during feudal times. Under increasing social and religious pressure from the Commonwealth, in the mid-17th century the Sich declared an independent Cossack Hetmanate, initiated by a rebellion under Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Afterwards, the Treaty of Pereyaslav brought most of the Ukrainian Cossack state under Russian rule.From Tak to Yes: Understanding the East Europeans, Yale Richmond, Intercultural Press, 1995, p. 294
The Sich with its lands became an autonomous region under the Russian-Polish protectorate.Андрусовский мир 1667 http://historydoc.edu.ru/catalog.asp?cat_ob_no=15249&ob_no=16146
The Don Cossack Host, which had been established by the 16th century,"Don River – History and economy", Encyclopædia Britannica allied with the Tsardom of Russia. Together they began a systematic conquest and colonisation of lands in order to secure the borders on the Volga, the whole of Siberia (see Yermak Timofeyevich), and the Yaik and the Terek Rivers. Cossack communities had developed along the latter two rivers well before the arrival of the Don Cossacks.Andrew Gordeyev. The History of Cossacks, Moscow, 1992
By the 18th century, Cossack hosts in the Russian Empire occupied effective buffer zones on its borders. The expansionist ambitions of the Empire relied on ensuring the loyalty of Cossacks, which caused tension given their traditional exercise of freedom, democratic self-rule, and independence. Cossacks, such as Stenka Razin, Kondraty Bulavin, Ivan Mazepa, and Yemelyan Pugachev, led major anti-imperial wars and revolutions in the Empire in order to abolish slavery and odious bureaucracy and to maintain independence. The Empire responded by ruthless executions and tortures, the destruction of the western part of the Don Cossack Host during the Bulavin Rebellion in 1707–1708, the destruction of Baturyn after Mazepa's rebellion in 1708,See, for example, Executions of Cossacks in Lebedin. and the formal dissolution of the Lower Dnieper Zaporozhian Host in 1775, after Pugachev's Rebellion.After the Pugachev rebellion, the Empire renamed the Yaik Host, its capital, Yaik Cossaks, and Zimoveyskaya Cossack town in the Don region, to try to encourage the Cossacks to forget the men and their rebellions. At the same time the Empire formally dissolved the Lower Dnieper Zaporozhian Cossack Host and destroyed their fortress (the Sich per se) on Dnieper, perhaps in part due to the participation of some Zaporozhians and other Ukrainian exiles in Pugachev's rebellion. During his campaign, Pugachev issued manifests to restore all borders and freedoms of both the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Lower Dnieper (Nizovy in Russian) Cossack Host under the joint protectorate of Russia and the Commonwealth.
By the end of the 18th century, Cossack nations had been transformed into a special military estate (Sosloviye), "a military class".The Malorussian Cossacks (the former "Registered Cossacks" ("Town Zaporozhian Host" in Russia)) were excluded from this transformation, but were promoted to members of various civil estates or classes (often Russian nobility), including the newly created civil estate of Cossacks. Similar to the knights of medieval Europe in feudal times, the Cossacks came to military service having to obtain charger horses, arms, and supplies at their own expense. The government provided only firearms and supplies for them.Lacking horses, the poor served in Cossack infantry and in Cossack artillery. The Russian Navy had no Cossack ships and units. This is why Cossacks served with other people in the Navy only. Cossack service was considered the most rigorous one.
Because of their military tradition, Cossack forces played an important role in Russia's wars of the 18th–20th centuries such as the Great Northern War, the Seven Years' War, the Crimean War, Napoleonic Wars, Caucasus War, numerous Russo-Turkish Wars, and the First World War. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Tsarist regime used Cossacks extensively to perform police service (for example, both to prevent pogroms and to suppress the revolutionary movement, especially in 1905–7).Their use to suppress pogroms is reflected in a story by a prominent Jewish writer Sholom Aleichem, titled "A Wedding Without Musicians", which describes how a Jewish shtetl in Ukraine is aided by a Cossack unit that disperses a pogrom by the local mob. See Шолом Алейхем, "Быть бы свадьбе, да музыки не нашлось", Гослитиздат, Moscow, 1961.http://www.litmir.net/bd/?b=168140. They also served as border guards on national and internal ethnic borders (as was the case in the Caucasus War).
During the Russian Civil War, Don and Kuban Cossacks were the first nations to declare open war against the Bolsheviks. By 1918, Cossacks declared the complete independence of their nations and formed the independent states, the Ukrainian State, the Don Republic, and the Kuban People's Republic. The Cossack troops formed the effective core of the anti-Bolshevik White Army, and Cossack republics became centers for the Anti-Bolshevik White movement. With the victory of the Red Army, the Cossack lands were subjected to Decossackization and the man-made famine of 1932–33 (Holodomor). After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Cossacks made a systematic return to Russia. Many took an active part in Post-Soviet conflicts and Yugoslav Wars. In Russia's 2010 Population Census, Cossacks have been recognized as an ethnicity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rg.ru/2011/12/16/stat.html |title=РГ + Россия 24: Росстат об итогах Всероссийской переписи населения 2010 года — "Вот какие мы - россияне" — Российская газета — Росстат об итогах Всероссийской переписи населения 2010 года |publisher=Rg.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl]  There are Cossack organizations in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Poland, and the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kazaksusa.com |title=Конгресс Казаков в Америке | Рассеяны но не расторгнуты |publisher=Kazaksusa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kazarla.ru |title=Этническое казачье объединение Казарла |publisher=Kazarla.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fstanitsa.ru |title=Вольная Станица |publisher=Fstanitsa.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl]

[[Dust devil]]

CATEGORIES: Storm, Wind, Mars, Vortices

A dust devil is a strong, well-formed, and relatively long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a meter wide and a few meters tall) to large (more than 10 meters wide and more than 1000 meters tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property.[tpl]cite book |title= Glossary of Meteorology |publisher= American Meteorological Society |year= 2000 |url= http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dust-devil1 |isbn= 978-1-878220-34-9 |author=  [/tpl]
They are comparable to tornadoes in that both are a weather phenomenon of a vertically oriented rotating column of air. Most tornadoes are associated with a larger parent circulation, the mesocyclone on the back of a supercell thunderstorm. Dust devils form as a swirling updraft under sunny conditions during fair weather, rarely coming close to the intensity of a tornado.

[[Allies]]

CATEGORIES: Diplomacy, Military alliances

In everyday English usage, allies are people, groups, or states that have joined in an association for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out between them. When the term is used in the context of war or armed struggle, such associations may also be called allied powers, especially when discussing World War I or World War II.
A formal military alliance is not required for being perceived as an ally—co-belligerence, fighting alongside someone, is enough. According to this usage, allies become so not when concluding an alliance treaty but when struck by war.
When spelled with a capital "A", the word "Allies" usually denotes the countries who fought together against the Central Powers in World War I (the Allies of World War I), or those who fought against the Axis Powers in World War II (the Allies of World War II). The term has also been used by the United States Army to describe the countries that gave assistance to the South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.[tpl]cite book |last1=Larsen |first1=Stanley|authorlink=|last2=Collins|first2=James |title=Allied Participation in Vietnam |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/allied/ |accessdate=January 15, 2013|series=Vietnam Studies |year=1975 |publisher=Department of the Army |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1119579|page= |pages=[/tpl] 
More recently, the term "Allied forces" has also been used to describe the coalition of the Gulf War, as opposed to forces the Multi-National Forces in Iraq which are commonly referred to as "Coalition forces" or, as by the George W. Bush administration, "the coalition of the willing".
The Allies in World War I (also known as the Entente Powers) were initially the United Kingdom,  Australia, New Zealand, France, the Russian Empire, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro and Japan, joined later by Italy, Portugal, Romania, the United States, Greece and Brazil. Some, such as the Russian Empire, withdrew from the war before the armistice due to revolution or defeat by the Central Powers.

[[Drag queen]]

CATEGORIES: Drag queens, Transgender identities, Cross-dressing

A drag queen is a man who dresses, and often acts, with exaggerated femininity. There are many different possible purposes to drag, personal reasons for doing drag will differ for individual drag queens. It is often done for the purpose of self-expression, performing and entertaining, and can also be mainly important as a creative outlet, a means of self-exploration or a way to make cultural statements. There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly in dedication, from professionals who have starred in films to people who just try it once. Drag queens also vary by class and culture and can vary even within the same cities.
While drag is very much associated with gay men and gay culture, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who do drag for various reasons or purposes. Generally drag queens are males who dress and act in a female gender role, often exaggerating certain characteristics (such as make-up and eyelashes) for comic, dramatic or satirical effect. Other drag performers include drag kings, who are women who perform in male roles, faux queens, who are women who dress in an exaggerated style to emulate drag queens, and faux kings, who are men who dress to impersonate drag kings.
The term drag queen usually refers to people who dress in drag for the purpose of performing, whether singing or lip-synching, dancing, participating in events such as gay pride parades, drag pageants, or at venues such as cabarets and discotheques. In the United Kingdom, alongside traditional drag work such as shows and performances, many drag queens engage in "mix-and-mingle" or hosting work at night clubs or at private parties and events. Drag is a part of Western gay culture.
Famous drag queens include RuPaul, Bianca Del Rio, Jackie Beat, Sharon Needles, Lady Bunny, Willam Belli, Chad Michaels and Adore Delano.

Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin ([tpl]lang-rus|Михаил Александрович Бакунин|p=mʲɪxɐˈil ˌbaˈkunʲin[/tpl]; [tpl]OldStyleDate|30 May|1814|18 May[/tpl] – 1 July 1876) was a Russian revolutionary anarchist, and founder of collectivist anarchism. He is considered among the most influential figures of anarchism, and one of the principal founders of the "social anarchist" tradition.[tpl]citation|last=Masters |first=Anthony|authorlink=|year=1974|title=Bakunin, the Father of Anarchism|publisher=Saturday Review Press|location=|isbn=0-8415-0295-1[/tpl] Bakunin's enormous prestige as an activist made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, and he gained substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.
Bakunin grew up in Pryamukhino, a family estate in Tver Governorate, where he moved to study philosophy and began to read the French encyclopédistes, leading to enthusiasm for the philosophy of Fichte. From Fichte, Bakunin went on to immerse himself in the works of Hegel, the most influential thinker among German intellectuals at the time. That led to his embrace of Hegelianism, bedazzled by Hegel's famous maxim, "Everything that exists is rational." In 1840, Bakunin traveled to St. Petersburg and Berlin with the intention of preparing himself for a professorship in philosophy or history at the University of Moscow. Bakunin then moved from Berlin, in 1842, to Dresden. Eventually he arrived in Paris, where he met Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Karl Marx. Bakunin's increasing radicalism – including staunch opposition to imperialism in east and central Europe by Russia and other powers – changed his life, putting an end to hopes of a professorial career. He was eventually deported from France for speaking against Russia's oppression of Poland.
In 1849, Bakunin was apprehended in Dresden for his participation in the Czech rebellion of 1848, and turned over to Russia where he was imprisoned in the Peter-Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg. He remained there until 1857, when he was exiled to a work camp in Siberia. Escaping to Japan, the US and finally ending up in London for a short time, he worked with Herzen on the journal Kolokol (The Bell). In 1863, he left to join the insurrection in Poland, but he failed to reach his destination and spent some time in Switzerland and Italy.
In 1868, Bakunin joined the socialist International Working Men's Association, a federation of trade unions and workers' organizations, which had sections in many European countries, as well as in Latin America and (after 1872) in North Africa and the Middle East. The "Bakuninist" or anarcho-socialist trend rapidly expanded in influence, and included the largest section of the International: Spain. A showdown loomed with Marx, who was a key figure in the General Council of the International. The 1872 Hague Congress was dominated by a struggle between Marx and his followers, who argued for the use of the state to bring about socialism, and the Bakunin/anarchist faction, which argued instead for the replacement of the state by federations of self-governing workplaces and communes. Bakunin could not attend the congress, as he could not reach the Netherlands. Bakunin's faction present at the conference lost, and Bakunin was (in Marx's view) expelled for supposedly maintaining a secret organisation within the international.
However, the anarchists insisted the congress was unrepresentative and exceeded its powers, and held a rival conference of the International at Saint-Imier in Switzerland in 1872. This repudiated the Hague meeting, including Bakunin's supposed expulsion. The great majority of sections of the International affiliated to the St. Imier body, making Marx's victory rather more illusory than pro-Marxist accounts suggest. The far larger Bakuninist international outlasted its small Marxist rival, which was isolated in New York; it also greatly facilitated the global spread of anarcho-socialism. In the International, as well as in his writings, Bakunin articulated the basic ideas of syndicalism and of anarchism, and developed the basic anarchist analysis and strategy. He had by this stage abandoned the anti-imperialist nationalism of his youth. From 1870 to 1876, Bakunin wrote some of his longer works, such as Statism and Anarchy and God and the State. Bakunin remained, however, a direct participant in struggles. In 1870, he was involved in an insurrection in Lyon, France, which foreshadowed the Paris Commune. The Paris Commune closely corresponded to many elements of Bakunin's anarchist programme – self-management, mandates delegates, a militia system with elected officers, and decentralisation. Anarchists like Élisée Reclus, and those in the tradition of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon – who had greatly influenced Bakunin – were key figures in the Commune. Despite declining health, much a result of his years of imprisonment, Bakunin also sought to take part in a communal insurrection involving anarchists in Bologna, Italy, but was forced to return to Switzerland in disguise, where he settled in Lugano. He remained active in the worker's and peasant's movements of Europe and was also a major influence on movements in Egypt and Latin America.

Balaam (Hebrew: בִּלְעָם, Standard [tpl]unicode|Bilʻam[/tpl] Tiberian [tpl]unicode|Bilʻām[/tpl], English pronunciation /ˈbeɪlæm/[tpl]cite web|last=Mangold|first=Max|title=A Pronouncing and Phonetic Dictionary of Biblical Names|url=http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/cho/Bible/|publisher=University of Tubingen|accessdate=24 October 2012[/tpl]  ) is a diviner in the Torah, his story occurring towards the end of the Book of Numbers (Hebrew: במדבר). The etymology of his name is uncertain, and discussed below. Every ancient reference to Balaam considers him a non-Israelite, a prophet, and the son of Beor, though Beor is not so clearly identified. Though other sources describe the apparently positive blessings he delivers upon the Israelites, he is reviled as a "wicked man"II Peter 2:15, Jude 11, Revelation 2:14 in the major story concerning him. Balaam refused to speak what God didn't speak and would not curse the Israelites, even though King Balak of Moab offered him money to do so. (Numbers 22–24).  But Balaam's error and the source of his wickedness came from sabotaging the Israelites as they entered the Promised Land.  According to Numbers 31:16 and Revelation 2:14, Balaam returned to King Balak and informed the king on how to get the Israelites to curse themselves by enticing them with prostitutes and unclean food sacrificed to idols.  The Israelites fell into transgression due to these traps and God sent a deadly plague to them as a result (Numbers 31:16).

Baal, also rendered Baʿal (Biblical Hebrew [tpl]lang|he|בַּעַל[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-he|ˈbaʕal|pron[/tpl]), is a North-West Semitic title and honorific meaning "master" or "lord"Serge Lancel, Carthage, a History, p. 194. that is used for various gods who were patrons of cities in the Levant and Asia Minor, cognate to Akkadian Bēlu. A Baalist or Baalite means a worshipper of Baal.
"Baal" may refer to any god and even to human officials. In some texts it is used for Hadad, a god of the rain, thunder, fertility and agriculture, and the lord of Heaven. Since only priests were allowed to utter his divine name, Hadad, Ba‛al was commonly used.  Nevertheless, few if any biblical uses of "Baal" refer to Hadad, the lord over the assembly of gods on the holy mount of Heaven; most refer to a variety of local spirit-deities worshipped as cult images, each called baal and regarded in the Hebrew Bible in that context as a "false god".

[[Vector processor]]

CATEGORIES: Parallel computing, Central processing unit

A vector processor, or array processor, is a central processing unit (CPU) that implements an instruction set containing instructions that operate on one-dimensional arrays of data called vectors. This is in contrast to a scalar processor, whose instructions operate on single data items. Vector processors can greatly improve performance on certain workloads, notably numerical simulation and similar tasks. Vector machines appeared in the early 1970s and dominated supercomputer design through the 1970s into the 90s, notably the various Cray platforms. The rapid rise in the price-to-performance ratio of conventional microprocessor designs led to the vector supercomputer's demise in the later 1990s.
Today, most commodity CPUs implement architectures that feature instructions for a form of vector processing on multiple (vectorized) data sets, typically known as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data). Common examples include VIS, MMX, SSE, AltiVec and AVX. Vector processing techniques are also found in video game console hardware and graphics accelerators. In 2000, IBM, Toshiba and Sony collaborated to create the Cell processor, consisting of one scalar processor and eight vector processors, which found use in the Sony PlayStation 3 among other applications.
Other CPU designs may include some multiple instructions for vector processing on multiple (vectorised) data sets, typically known as MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) and realized with VLIW. Such designs are usually dedicated to a particular application and not commonly marketed for general purpose computing. In the Fujitsu FR-V VLIW/vector processor both technologies are combined.

François-Noël Babeuf ([tpl]IPA-fr|babœf|lang[/tpl]; 23 November 1760 – 27 May 1797), known as Gracchus Babeuf (in tribute to the Roman tribunes of the people and reformers, the Gracchi brothers, and used alongside his self-designation as Tribune), was a French political agitator and journalist of the French Revolutionary period. In spite of the efforts of his Jacobin friends to save him, Babeuf was arrested, tried, and convicted for his role in the Conspiracy of the Equals. Although the words "anarchist" and "communist" did not exist in Babeuf's lifetime, they have both been used to describe his ideas, by later scholars.

Churchill Babington (11 March 1821 – 12 January 1889) was an English classical scholar, archaeologist and naturalist, born at Rothley Temple, in Leicestershire.
He was first educated by his father, Matthew Drake Babington, and then studied under Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, the orientalist and archaeologist, entering St John's College, Cambridge in 1839 and graduating in 1843, seventh in the first class of the classical tripos and a senior optime.[tpl]acad|id=BBNN839C|name=Babington, Churchill[/tpl] In 1845 he obtained the Hulsean Prize for his essay The Influence of Christianity in promoting the Abolition of Slavery in Europe. In 1846 he was elected to a fellowship and took orders. He proceeded to the degree of M.A. in 1846 and D.D. in 1879. From 1848 to 1861 he was vicar of Horningsea, near Cambridge, and from 1866 to his death he was vicar of Cockfield in Suffolk. From 1865 to 1880 he held the Disney professorship of archaeology at Cambridge. In his lectures, illustrated from his own collections of coins and vases, he dealt chiefly with Greek and Ancient Roman pottery and numismatics.
Babington wrote on a variety of subjects. His early familiarity with country life gave him a taste for natural history, especially botany and ornithology. He was also an authority on conchology. He was the author of the appendices on botany (in part) and ornithology in Potter's History and Antiquities of Charnwood Forest (1842). In 1853, he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society.
He was the author of Mr Macaulay's Character of the Clergy (1849), a defence of the clergy of the 17th Century, which received the approval of Gladstone. He also brought out the editio princeps of the speeches of Hypereides Against Demosthenes (1850), On Behalf of Lycophron and Euxenippus (1868), and his Funeral Oration (1858). It was by his edition of these speeches from the papyri discovered at Thebes (Egypt) in 1847 and 1856 that Babington's fame as a Greek scholar was made.
In 1855 he published an edition of Benefizio della Morte di Cristo, a remarkable book of the Reformation period, attributed to Paleario, of which nearly all the copies had been destroyed by the Inquisition. Babington's edition was a facsimile of the editio princeps published at Venice in 1543, with an Introduction and French and English versions. He also edited the first two volumes of Higden's Polychronicon (1858) and Bishop Pecock's Represser of Overmuch Blaming of the Clergy (1860); Introductory Lecture on Archaeology (1865); Roman Antiquities found at Rougham (1872); Catalogue of Birds of Suffolk (1884–1886); Flora of Suffolk (with W. M. Hind, 1889), etc.  He catalogued the classical manuscripts in the University Library and the Greek and English coins in the Fitzwilliam Museum.

[[Accountant]]

CATEGORIES: Accountants, Occupations, Accounting qualifications

An accountant is a practitioner of accounting or accountancy, which is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about financial information that helps managers, investors, tax authorities and others make decisions about allocating resources.
In many jurisdictions, professional accounting bodies maintain standards of practice and evaluations for professionals. Accountants who have demonstrated competency through their professional associations' certification exams are certified to use titles such as Chartered Accountant or Certified Public Accountant. Such professionals are granted certain responsibilities by statute, such as the ability to certify an organization's financial statements, and may be held liable for professional misconduct. Non-qualified accountants may be employed by a qualified accountant, or may work independently without statutory privileges and obligations.
The Big Four auditors are the largest employers of accountants worldwide. However, most accountants are employed in commerce, industry and the public sector.For example, in 2009 in Ontario, Canada, national firms employ 4,425 Chartered Accountants, which is less than 50% of the members in public practice. (Chartered Accountants in National Firms in Ontario, Canada) As total membership is 33,146, the national firms employ about 13% of all Chartered Accountants in Ontario. (Ontario Chartered Accountants demographics) Most of the members are employed in industry, with the majority in small and medium sized enterprises.

[[Baby farming]]

CATEGORIES: Child abuse, Obsolete occupations, Infancy, Population, Child care occupations

Baby farming was a term used in late-Victorian Era Britain (and, less commonly, in Australia and the United States) to mean the taking in of an infant or child for payment; if the infant was young, this usually included wet-nursing (breast-feeding by a woman not the mother). Some baby farmers "adopted" children for lump-sum payments, while others cared for infants for periodic payments. Though baby farmers were paid in the understanding that care would be provided, the term "baby farmer" was used as an insult, and improper treatment was usually implied.  Illegitimacy and its attendant stigma were usually the impetus for a mother's decision to put her children "out to nurse" with a baby farmer, but baby farming also encompassed foster care and adoption in the period before they were regulated by British law. 
Richer women would also put their babies out to be cared for in the homes of villagers.  Claire Tomalin gives a detailed account of this in her biography of Jane Austen, who was fostered in this manner, as were all her siblings, from a few months old until they were toddlers.excerpt from Jane Austen: A Biography Tomalin emphasizes the emotional distance this created.
Particularly in the case of lump-sum adoptions, it was more profitable for the baby farmer if the infant or child she adopted died, since the small payment could not cover the care of the child for long. Some baby farmers adopted numerous children and then neglected them or murdered them outright (see infanticide). Several were tried for murder, manslaughter, or criminal neglect and were hanged. Margaret Waters (executed 1870) and Amelia Dyer (executed 1896) were two infamous British baby farmers, as were Amelia Sach and Annie Walters (executed 1903). The last baby farmer to be executed in Britain was Rhoda Willis, who was hanged in Wales in 1907. The only woman to be executed in New Zealand, Minnie Dean, was a baby farmer. In Scandinavia there was an euphemism for this activity: "änglamakerska" (Swedish) and "englemagerske" (Danish), both literally meaning a female "angel maker".
Spurred by a series of articles that appeared in the British Medical Journal in 1867, Parliament began to regulate baby farming in 1872 with the passage of the Infant Life Protection Act. A series of acts passed over the next seventy years, including the Children Act 1908 and the 1939 Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act, gradually placed adoption and foster care under the protection and regulation of the state.
The term has been used to describe the sale of eggs for use in assisted conception, particularly in vitro fertilization.

The Babylonian captivity (or Babylonian exile) is the period in Jewish history during which a number of Jews of the ancient Kingdom of Judah were captives in Babylonia. After the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem, resulting in tribute being paid by King Jehoiakim.[tpl]cite book|last=Coogan|first= Michael|title= A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament|location=Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2009|ref=harv[/tpl] Jehoiakim refused to pay tribute in Nebuchadnezzar's fourth year, which led to another siege in Nebuchadnezzar's seventh year, culminating with the death of Jehoiakim, and the exile of King Jeconiah, his court and many others; Jeconiah's successor Zedekiah and most of the remaining people were exiled in Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year; a later deportation occurred in Nebuchadnezzar's twenty-third year. These deportations are dated to 597 BCE, c. 587 BCE, and c. 582 BCE, respectively.
After the fall of Babylon to the Persian king Cyrus the Great in 538 BCE, exiled Jews began to return to the land of Judah. According to the biblical book of Ezra, construction of a second temple in Jerusalem began at this time. All these events are considered significant in Jewish history and culture, and had a far-reaching impact on the development of Judaism.
Archaeological studies have revealed that only a minority of the population of Judah was deported, and that, although Jerusalem was utterly destroyed, other parts of Judah, centered around Hebron, the birthplace of Judaism, continued to be inhabited during the period of the exile. The return of the exiles was a gradual process rather than a single event, and many of the deportees or their descendants did not return.

[[Babylonian law]]

CATEGORIES: Babylonia, Ancient Near East law

Babylonian law is a subset of cuneiform law that has received particular study, owing to the singular extent of the associated archaeological material that has been found for it. So-called "contracts" exist in the thousands, including a great variety of deeds, conveyances, bonds, receipts, accounts, and most important of all, actual legal decisions given by the judges in the law courts. Historical inscriptions, royal charters and rescripts, dispatches, private letters and the general literature afford welcome supplementary information. Even grammatical and lexicographical texts contain many extracts or short sentences bearing on law and custom. The so-called "Sumerian Family Laws" are preserved in this way.
Other cultures involved with ancient Mesopotamia shared the same common laws and precedents, extending to the form of contacts that Kenneth Kitchen has studied and compared to the form of contracts in the Bible with particular note to the sequence of blessings and curses that bind the deal. The Maxims of Ptahhotep and Sharia Law,Conduct of a Physician, Adab al-Tabib, by Ishāq ibn ʻAlī al-Ruhāwī also include certifications for professionals like doctors, lawyers and skilled craftsmen which prescribe penalties for malpractice very similar to the code of Hammurabi.
The discovery of the now-celebrated Code of Hammurabi (hereinafter simply termed "the Code") has made possible a more systematic study than could have resulted from just the classification and interpretation of other material. Fragments of other Ancient codes exist and have been published, but there still remain many points whereof evidence is still lacking. There survive legal texts from the earliest writings through the Hellenistic period, but evidence on a particular point may be very full for one period and almost entirely lacking for another. The Code forms the backbone of most reconstructions. Fragments of it recovered from Assur-bani-pal's library at Nineveh and later Babylonian copies show that it was studied, divided into chapters, entitled Ninu ilu sirum from its incipit (opening words), and recopied for fifteen hundred years or more.
Much Babylonian legal precedent remained in force, even through the Persian, Greek and Parthian conquests, which had little effect on private life in Babylonia; and it survived to influence Romans. The laws and customs that preceded the Code may be called "early"; that of the Neo-Babylonian empire (as well as the Persian, Greek, etc.), "late". The law of Assyria was derived from the Babylonian, but it conserved early features long after they had disappeared elsewhere.

[[Bacchanalia]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman festivals, March observances, Roman festivals of Dionysus, Drinking culture, Group sex, Mystery religions

The Bacchanalia were Roman mystery cults of the wine god and seer Bacchus, based on various ecstatic elements of the Greek Dionysian mysteries. They seem to have been popular, and well-organised, throughout the central and southern Italian peninsula. They were almost certainly associated with Rome's native cult of Liber, and probably arrived in Rome itself around 200 BC but like all mystery cults of the ancient world, very little is known of their rites. Livy, writing some 200 years after the event, offers a scandalised, extremely colourful account of the Bacchanalia. Modern scholarship takes a skeptical approach to his allegations of frenzied rites, sexually violent initiations of both sexes, all ages and all social classes, and the cult as a murderous instrument of conspiracy against the state. Livy claims that seven thousand cult leaders and followers were arrested, and that most were executed. More certainly, senatorial legislation to reform the Bacchanalia in 186 BC attempted to control their size, organisation, and priesthoods, under threat of the death penalty. This may have been motivated less by the kind of lurid and dramatic rumours that Livy describes than by the senate's determination to assert its civil and religious authority over Rome and her allies, after the prolonged social, political and military crisis of the Second Punic War. The reformed Bacchanalia rites may have been merged with the Liberalia festival. Bacchus, Liber and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable from the late Republican era onward, and their mystery cults persisted well into the Roman Imperial era.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a cabinet department of the United States federal government, created in response to the September 11 attacks, and with the primary responsibilities of protecting the United States and its territories (including protectorates) from and responding to terrorist attacks, man-made accidents, and natural disasters. The Department of Homeland Security, and not the United States Department of the Interior, is equivalent to the Interior ministries of other countries. In fiscal year 2011, DHS was allocated a budget of $98.8 billion and spent, net, $66.4 billion.
Where the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad, the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within, at, and outside its borders. Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] On March 1, 2003, DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Protective Service falls under the National Protection and Programs Directorate.
With more than 200,000 employees, DHS is the third largest Cabinet department, after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.napawash.org/pc_management_studies/dhs.html |title=The National Academy of Public Administration |publisher=Napawash.org |accessdate=November 24, 2011[/tpl] Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.
On December 16, 2013, the U.S. Senate confirmed Jeh Johnson as the next Secretary of Homeland Security.Senate confirms new homeland security secretary
According to the Homeland Security Research Corporation, the combined financial year 2010 state and local homeland security (HLS) markets, which employ more than 2.2 million first responders, totaled $16.5 billion, whereas the DHS HLS market totaled $13 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.homelandsecurityresearch.com/2010/11/us-hls-hld-markets-2011-2014/|title=U.S. HLS-HLD Markets – 2011-2014|publisher=Homeland Security Market Research|date=|accessdate=2013-10-22[/tpl] According to The Washington Post, "DHS has given $31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists, including $3.8 billion in 2010".Priest, Dana and Arkin, William (December 2010) Monitoring America, Washington Post
According to Peter Andreas, a border theorist, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War,[tpl]cite journal|last=Andreas |first=Peter |title=Redrawing the Line: Borders and Security in the Twenty-first Century |journal=International Security |volume=28 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=78–111 |doi=10.1162/016228803322761973 |url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Political_Science/documents/Redrawing_the_Line.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947, which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency. DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization.Perl, Raphael (2004)."The Department of Homeland Security: Background and Challenges", Terrorism—reducing Vulnerabilities and Improving Responses, Committee on Counterterrorism Challenges for Russia and the United States, Office for Central Europe and Eurasia Development, Security, and Cooperation Policy and Global Affairs, in Cooperation with the Russian Academy of Sciences, page 176.

Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (8 March 1714 – 14 December 1788) was a German Classical period musician and composer, the fifth child and second (surviving) son of Johann Sebastian Bach and Maria Barbara Bach. His second name was given in honor of his godfather Georg Philipp Telemann, a friend of Emanuel's father.
Emanuel Bach was an influential composer working at a time of transition between his father's baroque style and the classical and romantic styles that followed it. His personal approach, an expressive and often turbulent one known as empfindsamer Stil or 'sensitive style', applied the principles of rhetoric and drama to musical structures. Bach's dynamism stands in deliberate contrast to the more mannered rococo style also then in vogue.Ratner, Leonard G. 'Classic Music: Expression, Form and Style'. Schirmer, New York. 1980

Yair Chayim Bacharach (1639, Lipník nad Bečvou, Moravia — 1702) was a German rabbi and major 17th century posek, who lived first in Koblenz and then remainder of his life in Worms and Metz. His grandmother Eva Bacharach was a granddaughter of the Maharal of Prague, and his father Moses Samson Bacharach, and grandfather had served as rabbis of Metz.
He was the author of Havvot Yair ("Villages of Yair") a collection of responsa by the title of which is he commonly referred (first published in Frankfurt a Main, 1699); its title is a reference to his grandmother Chava as well as to a place mentioned in Numbers 32:41 and elsewhere in the Jewish Bible. Other work includes his Mekor Chayim, which was intended as a principal commentary to Shulkhan Arukh but was withdrawn by Bacharach when he discovered that other commentaries, notably the Taz and the Magen Avraham, had appeared. It is still regarded a prime source of material concerning minhagim (customs) of the area and epoch.
Besides his Halakhic expertise he had complete mastery of all the sciences, music, history and wrote poetry.  He compiled a 46 volume encyclopedia on many topics.
In 1689 the Worms community was decimated by the French during the Nine Years' War.  Gradually, it was rebuilt. In 1699 he was appointed rabbi of Worms where his father and grandfather had served before him. He served for only three years until his death in 1702.  The inscription on his tombstone begins with the words, “A great and dark horror befalls us from the hiding of the light of Rabbeinu...”
In 1982 his major work, Mekor Chaim, was finally published posthumously by Machon Yerushalayim.

[[Louis Petit de Bachaumont]]

CATEGORIES: 1690 births, 1771 deaths, French untitled nobility

Louis Petit de Bachaumont ([tpl]IPA-fr|lwi p(ə)ti də baʃomɔ̃|pron[/tpl]) (June 2, 1690 – April 29, 1771) was a  French writer, whose historical interest has been connected largely to his alleged role in the gossipy  Mémoires secrets pour servir à l'histoire de la République des Lettres. A modern biographyRobert S. Tate Jr., Petit de Bachaumont: His Circle and the Mémoires Secrets (Geneva: Institut Voltaire, 1968); extended reviews by Basil Guy (The French Review 44.2 1970, pp. 460-461) and  Louis A. Olivier (Modern Language Notes 86.4  1971, pp. 587-589. brought to general attention his other roles, as an arbiter of taste, an influential art critic and an urbaniste
Petit de Bachaumont was of noble family and was brought up at the court of Versailles. He passed his whole life in Paris, however, as the centre of the salon of Mme Doublet de Persan (1677–1771), where criticism of art and literature took the form of malicious gossip. A sort of register of news was kept in a journal of the salon, starting in 1762, which dealt largely in scandals and contained accounts of books suppressed by the censor. Bachaumont's name is commonly connected with the first volumes of this register, which was published anonymously, long after Petit de Bachaumont's death,It was first published in London as a multi-volume set from 1783 to 1789. under the title Mémoires secrets pour servir à l'histoire de la République des Lettres, but his exact share in the authorship of those years before his death in 1771 is a matter of controversy. The register was continued by Pidansat de Mairobert (1707–1779), who may have had a greater hand in it from the start, and by others, until it reached 36 volumes (covering the years 1774-1779). It is of some value as a historical source, especially for prohibited literature, and full of anecdotes, for which it was sieved by the brothers Goncourt, who revived interest in this obscure figure,An incomplete edition of the Mémoires secrets (4 vols.) had been undertaken in 1830 by Ravenal and a volume of extracts was published by P. Lacroix in 1859. whom they presented as the anecdotier parfait, the reputation, as the "perfect recounter of anecdote" to the present time.
Petit de Bachaumont's studied "indolence", remarked upon in his obituary,Mémoires secrets, under 2 May 1771. was a stylish pose. His major published writings are Essai sur la peinture, la sculpture et l'architecture (1751) and his surveys of the Paris salons of 1767 and 1769,They were published in the Mémoires secrets in which aesthetics and cultural politics were inseparably entwined. Less noted is his published call in 1749Premier mémoire sur le Louvre; revised and republished 1749. for the roofing-over of Perrault's classical colonnaded east front of the Palais du Louvre and the clearing away of the ramshackle structures, both those that had been built against it, in order to form a proper Palais du Louvre, and those in the centre of the Cour Carré itselfSee Richard Wittman, Architecture, Print Culture, and the Public Sphere in Eighteenth-Century France (London: Routledge, 2007), p.68-72. The temporary structures in the center of the Cour Carré are clearly visible in Turgot's map of Paris, 1739. Sections of the palace were in danger of collapse, scarcely touched by royal indifference after 1678;"For lack of funds", remarks Marianne Roland Michel, "The Clearance of the Colonnade of the Louvre: A Study Arising from a Painting by de Machy", The Burlington Magazine 120 No. 906 (September 1978, pp. i-vi). p. 1 and passim, detailing the clearance of the Hôtel de Rouillé and other structures. work did begin in 1755 to clear the facade of the Louvre, overseen by the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot and Marigny, supervisor of the Bâtiments du Roi.
As a critic of art, his recommendation of a young artist named François Boucher appeared in a design memorandum Bachaumont presented the duc de Bouillon, who was occupied with renovating interiors at the Château de Navarre in Normandy, in 1730: "he is very quick, works fast and is not expensive".Claire Hornsby, "Boucher and Servandoni: the Château de Navarre in Normandy", Apollo 145 (1997) pp 19-24.

[[Cordite]]
CATEGORIES: British inventions, Cordite, Ammunition, Firearm propellants

Cordite is a family of smokeless propellants developed and produced in the United Kingdom since 1889 to replace gunpowder as a military propellant. Like gunpowder, cordite is classified as a low explosive because of its slow burning rates and consequently low brisance. These produce a subsonic deflagration wave rather than the supersonic detonation wave produced by brisants, or high explosives. The hot gases produced by burning gunpowder or cordite generate sufficient pressure to propel a bullet or shell to its target, but not so quickly as to routinely destroy the barrel of the firearm, or gun.
Cordite was used initially in the .303 British, Mark I and II, standard rifle cartridge between 1891 and 1915; shortages of cordite in World War I led to United States–developed smokeless powders being imported into the UK for use in rifle cartridges. Cordite was also used for large weapons, such as tank guns, artillery and naval guns. It has been used mainly for this purpose since the late 19th century by the UK and British Commonwealth countries. Its use was further developed before World War II, and as [tpl]convert|2|and|3|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter[/tpl] Unrotated Projectiles for launching anti-aircraft weapons.[tpl]Harvnb|Brown|1999|loc=Chapter 17[/tpl] Small cordite rocket charges were also developed for ejector seats made by the Martin-Baker Company. Cordite was also used in the detonation system of the Little Boy atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima in August 1945.
The term cordite generally disappeared from official publications between the wars. During World War II  double based propellants were very widely used and there was some use of triple based propellants by artillery. Triple based propellants were used in post-war ammunition designs and remain in production for UK weapons; most double based propellants left service as World War II stocks were expended after the war. For small arms it has been replaced by other propellants, such as the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of extruded powder or the WC844 ball propellant currently in use in the 5.56×45mm NATO.[tpl]citation| last=Watters| first=Daniel | title=The Great Propellant Controversy| work=The Gun Zone| url=http://www.thegunzone.com/556prop.html|accessdate=2009-11-30[/tpl] Production ceased in the United Kingdom, around the end of the 20th century, with the closure of the last of the World War II cordite factories, ROF Bishopton. Triple base propellant for UK service (for example, the 105 mm L118 Light Gun) is now manufactured in Germany.

[[Ethnic groups in Chinese history]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnic groups in Chinese history, Ancient peoples of China

Ethnic groups in Chinese history refer to various or presumed ethnicities of significance to the history of China, gathered through the study of Classical Chinese literature, Chinese and non-Chinese literary sources and inscriptions, historical linguistics, and archaeological research.
Among the difficulties in the study of ethnic groups in China are the relatively long periods of time involved, together with the large volume of literary and historical records which have accompanied the history of China. Classical Chinese ethnography (like much then-contemporary ethnography) was often sketchy, leaving it unclear as to whether Chinese-depicted names referred to a true ethnic group or a possibly multiethnic political entity. Even then, ethnonyms were sometimes assigned by geographic location or surrounding features, rather than by any features of the people themselves, and often carried little distinction of who the Han Chinese authors considered Chinese and non-Chinese for differences such as lifestyle, language, or governance. Many of the ethnonyms were historically used in such a way as to invite comparison with the word barbarian.

Nitrocellulose (also: cellulose nitrate, flash paper, flash cotton, guncotton, flash string) is a highly flammable compound formed by nitrating cellulose through exposure to nitric acid or another powerful nitrating agent. When used as a propellant or low-order explosive, it was originally known as guncotton.
If the cellulose is not fully nitrated then it has found uses as a plastic film and in inks and wood coatings.http://www.dow.com/dowwolff/en/industrial_solutions/polymers/nitrocellulose/ Nitrocellulose plasticized by camphor was used by Kodak, and other suppliers, from the late 1880s as a film base in photography, X-ray films and motion picture films; and was known as nitrate film. After numerous fires caused by unstable nitrate films, safety film started to be used from the 1930s in the case of X-ray stock and from 1948 for motion picture film.

An earl is a member of the nobility.  The title is Anglo-Saxon, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant "chieftain", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead.  In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced with duke (hertig/hertug). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, jarl could also mean sovereign prince.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had in fact the title of jarl and in many cases of no lesser power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the "Earl/Count" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era.
In modern Britain, an earl is a member of the peerage, ranking below a marquess and above viscount.[tpl]cite book| title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|editor=Stevenson, Angus| url=| edition=6th|volume=1 A-M| year=2007| publisher=Oxford University Press| location= Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-920687-2| pages=|accessdate=[/tpl] There never developed a feminine form of earl; countess is used as the equivalent feminine title.

[[Nickel–metal hydride battery]]

CATEGORIES: NiMH batteries, Rechargeable batteries, Metal hydrides, Nickel

[tpl]Redirect|NiMH||NIMH (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]NIMH[/tpl]

A nickel–metal hydride battery, abbreviated NiMH or Ni–MH, is a type of rechargeable battery. Its chemical reactions are somewhat similar to the largely obsolete nickel–cadmium cell (NiCd). NiMH use positive electrodes of nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), like the NiCd, but the negative electrodes use a hydrogen-absorbing alloy instead of cadmium, being in essence a practical application of nickel–hydrogen battery chemistry. A NiMH battery can have two to three times the capacity of an equivalent size NiCd, and their energy density approaches that of a lithium-ion cell.
The typical specific energy for small NiMH cells is about 100 W·h/kg, and for larger NiMH cells about 75 W·h/kg (270 kJ/kg). This is significantly better than the typical 40–60 W·h/kg for NiCd, and similar to the 100–160 W·h/kg for lithium-ion batteries. NiMH has a volumetric energy density of about 300 W·h/L (1,080 MJ/m3), significantly better than NiCd at 50–150 W·h/L, and about the same as lithium-ion at 250–360 W·h/L.
NiMH batteries have replaced NiCd for many roles, notably small rechargeable batteries. NiMH batteries are very common for AA (penlight-size) batteries, which have nominal charge capacities (C) of 1.1–2.8 A·h at 1.2 V, measured at the rate that discharges the cell in five hours. Useful discharge capacity is a decreasing function of the discharge rate, but up to a rate of around 1×C (full discharge in one hour), it does not differ significantly from the nominal capacity.See graph, p.8 of [tpl]cite web | title = Ni–MH Batteries Technical Bulletin | url = http://208.173.184.182/oem/rechargeable/Nickel/nickel_metal_tech.asp | publisher = Duracell | accessdate = 4 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] NiMH batteries normally operate at 1.2 V per cell, somewhat lower than conventional 1.5 V cells, but will operate most devices designed for that voltage.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
About 22% of portable rechargeable batteries sold in Japan in 2010 were NiMH.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.baj.or.jp/e/statistics/06.html | title = Secondary battery sales statistics by volume | publisher = Battery Association of Japan | accessdate = 10 September 2011[/tpl] In Switzerland in 2009, the equivalent statistic was approximately 60%.[tpl]cite web | url=http://inobat.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf_09/Absatz_Statistik_2008.pdf | title=Batterien-Absatzstatistik 2008 | publisher = INOBAT (the Swiss interest organisation for battery disposal) | accessdate = 10 September 2011 | page=2 | language = German | trans_title = Battery Sales Statistics 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] This percentage has fallen over time due to the increase in manufacture of lithium-ion batteries: in 2000, almost half of all portable rechargeable batteries sold in Japan were NiMH. By 2011, NiMH only represented about 22% of secondary batteries.
The significant disadvantage of NiMH batteries is the high rate of self-discharge; NiMH batteries typically lose 4% of their charge per day of storage. In 2005, a low self-discharge (LSD) variant was developed. LSD NiMH batteries significantly lower self-discharge, but at the cost of lowering capacity by about 20%.

[[Marquess]]
CATEGORIES: Marquessates, Marquesses, Noble titles, Peerage, Counts, Men's social titles

A marquess or marquis ([tpl]IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|m|ɑr|k|w|ɨ|s[/tpl]; French: "marquis", [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɑr|ˈ|k|iː[/tpl]) is a nobleman of hereditary rank in various European peerages and in those of some of their former colonies. The term is also used to translate equivalent oriental styles, as in imperial China, Japan, and Vietnam (Annam). In the United Kingdom the title ranks below a duke and above an earl (see "Marquesses in the United Kingdom").
The theoretical distinction between a marquess and other titles has, since the Middle Ages, faded into obscurity. In times past, the distinction between a count and a marquess was that a marquess's land, called a march, was on the border of the country, while a count's land, called a county, often wasn't. Because of this, a marquess was trusted to defend and fortify against potentially hostile neighbors and was thus more important and ranked higher than a count. The title is ranked below duke, which was often restricted to the royal family and those that were held in high enough esteem to be granted such a title.
They were a relatively late introduction to the British peerage: no marcher lords had the rank of marquess, though some were earls. On the evening of the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne explained to her why (from her journals): 
 "I spoke to Ld M. about the numbers of Peers present at the Coronation, & he said it was quite unprecedented. I observed that there were very few Viscounts, to which he replied "There are very few Viscounts," that they were an old sort of title & not really English; that they came from Vice-Comites; that Dukes & Barons were the only real English titles; — that Marquises were likewise not English, & that people were mere made Marquises, when it was not wished that they should be made Dukes".Queen Victoria's Journals, Thursday 28th June 1838, Buckingham Palace, Princess Beatrice's copies, Volume:4 (1st June 1838-1st October 1838) p. 84, online, accessed May 25, 2013 
The word "marquess" is unusual in English, ending in "-ess" but referring to a male and not a female.  In continental Europe it is usually equivalent where a cognate title exists.[tpl]clarify|reason=What is this saying? What is equivalent to what?|date=March 2013[/tpl]  A woman with the rank of a marquess, or the wife of a marquess, is a marchioness [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɑr|ʃ|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|s[/tpl] in the United Kingdom, or a marquise [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɑr|ˈ|k|iː|z[/tpl] elsewhere in Europe.  The dignity, rank or position of the title is referred to as a marquisate or marquessate.
In the German lands, a Margrave was a ruler of an immediate Imperial territory (examples include the Margrave of Brandenburg, the Margrave of Baden and the Margrave of Bayreuth), not simply a noble like marquesses/marquises in Western and Southern Europe. German rulers did not confer the title of marquis; holders of marquisates in Central Europe were largely associated with the Italian and Spanish crowns.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

[[Peerage]]

CATEGORIES: Peerage

The peerage is a legal system of largely hereditary titles in the United Kingdom, which is constituted by the ranks of British nobility and is part of the British honours system. The term is used both collectively to refer to the entire body of noble titles (or a subdivision thereof), and individually to refer to a specific title (and generally has an initial capital in the former case and not the latter). The holder of a peerage is termed a peer.
In modern practice, only members of the Royal Family are granted new hereditary peerages. Only life peerages which carry the personal right to sit and vote in the House of Lords are generally granted to honour individuals in modern practice; the last non-royal hereditary peerages were created under the Thatcher government. Peerages, like all modern British honours, are created by the British monarch and take effect when letters patent are affixed with the Great Seal of the Realm. Her Majesty's Government advises the Sovereign on a new peerage, under a process which scrutinises appointments to political honours.  Currently a few hereditary peers, elected to represent the others, also retain the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords; [tpl]As of|2011|7|1|lc=on[/tpl], only 90 members sitting by virtue of a hereditary peerage remain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-information-office/hoflbpmembership.pdf |title=House of Lords briefing paper on Membership:Types of Member, Routes to membership, Parties & groups |accessdate=1 July 2011 |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom[/tpl]
The Sovereign is considered the fount of honour and, as "the fountain and source of all dignities cannot hold a dignity from himself",Opinion of the House of Lords in the Buckhurst Peerage Case cannot hold a peerage (although the British Sovereign, whether male or female, uses the style "Duke of Lancaster"). If an individual without a peerage is neither the Sovereign nor other royalty, he or she is a commoner. All members of a peer's family are commoners, too; the British system thus differs fundamentally from continental European ones, where entire families, rather than individuals, were ennobled. Nobility in Britain is based on title and not on bloodline. For example, Peter Phillips, son of HRH The Princess Royal, is a commoner even though his mother is a princess and his grandmother is The Queen. He has no title; therefore, he is a commoner.
Certain personal privileges are afforded to all peers and peeresses, but the main distinction of a peerage nowadays is the style or title and traditional forms of address. The claim to an existing hereditary peerage is regulated by the House of Lords through its Committee for Privileges and Conduct.

[[Duke]]

CATEGORIES: Dukedoms, Noble titles, Peerage, Feudalism, Men's social titles

A duke (male) or duchess (female) can either be a monarch ruling over a duchy or a member of the nobility, historically of highest rank below the monarch. The title comes from French duc, itself from the Latin dux, 'leader', a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province.
During the Middle Ages the title signified first among the Germanic monarchies.  Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later, in the feudal monarchies, the highest-ranking peers of the king. A duke may or may not be, ipso facto, a member of the nation's peerage: in the United Kingdom and Spain all dukes are/were also peers of the realm, in France some were and some were not, while the term is not applicable to dukedoms of other nations, even where an institution similar to the peerage (e.g., Grandeeship, Imperial Diet, Hungarian House of Magnates) existed.
During the 19th century many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled by Dukes or Grand Dukes. But presently, with the exception of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there are no ruling dukes. Duke remains the highest hereditary title (aside from titles borne by the reigning or formerly reigning dynasty) in Portugal (though now a republic), Spain and the United Kingdom. In Sweden, members of the Royal Family are given a personal dukedom at birth. The Pope, as a temporal sovereign, has also, though rarely, granted the title of Duke or Duchess to persons for services to the Holy See. In some realms the relative status of "duke" and "prince", as titles borne by the nobility rather than by members of reigning dynasties, varied, e.g. in Italy and the Netherlands.
A woman who holds in her own right the title to such duchy or dukedom, or is the wife of a duke, is normally styled duchess. Queen Elizabeth II, however, is known by tradition as Duke of Normandy in the Channel Islands and Duke of Lancaster in Lancashire.

[[Wax]]

CATEGORIES: Waxes

Waxes are a class of chemical compounds that are plastic (malleable) near ambient temperatures.  They are also a type of lipid. Characteristically, they melt above 45 °C (113 °F) to give a low viscosity liquid. Waxes are insoluble in water but soluble in organic, nonpolar solvents.  All waxes are organic compounds, both synthetic and naturally occurring.

[[Honeycomb]]
CATEGORIES: Beekeeping, Bees

A honeycomb is a mass of hexagonal wax cells built by honey bees in their nests to contain their larvae and stores of honey and pollen.
Beekeepers may remove the entire honeycomb to harvest honey. Honey bees consume about 8.4 lbs (4 kg) of honey to secrete 1 lb (500 g) of wax,Graham, Joe. The Hive and the Honey Bee. Hamilton/IL: Dadant & Sons; 1992; ISBN. so it makes economic sense to return the wax to the hive after harvesting the honey, commonly called "pulling honey" or "robbing the bees" by beekeepers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] The structure of the comb may be left basically intact when honey is extracted from it by uncapping and spinning in a centrifugal machine—the honey extractor. If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused in a number of ways, including making sheets of comb foundation with hexagonal pattern. Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells.
Fresh, new comb is sometimes sold and used intact as comb honey, especially if the honey is being spread on bread rather than used in cooking or as a sweetener.
Broodcomb becomes dark over time, because of the cocoons embedded in the cells and the tracking of many feet, called travel stain[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] by beekeepers when seen on frames of comb honey. Honeycomb in the "supers" that are not allowed to be used for brood (e.g. by the placement of a queen excluder) stays light coloured.
Numerous wasps, especially Polistinae and Vespinae, construct hexagonal prism-packed combs made of paper instead of wax; and in some species (such as Brachygastra mellifica), honey is stored in the nest, thus technically forming a paper honeycomb.  However, the term "honeycomb" is not often used for such structures.

[[Honey bee]]
CATEGORIES: Apis (genus), Beekeeping, Pollinators, Symbols of Mississippi

Honey bees (or honeybees) are a subset of bees in the genus Apis, primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax. Honey bees are the only extant members of the tribe Apini, all in the genus Apis. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies,[tpl]cite journal |author=Michael S. Engel |year=1999 |title=The taxonomy of recent and fossil honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Apis) |journal=Journal of Hymenoptera Research |volume=8 |pages=165–196 |authorlink=Michael S. Engel[/tpl] though historically, from six to 11 species have been recognised. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, but only members of the genus Apis are true honey bees.
The study of honey bees is known as apiology.

[[Fig wasp]]

CATEGORIES: Chalcidoidea, Agaonidae, Pollinators

Fig wasps are wasps of the superfamily Chalcidoidea which spend their larval stage inside figs. They can be the pollinating fig wasps or parasitic wasps. The parasitic wasps belong to several groups of the superfamily Chalcidoidea. While the pollinating fig wasps are galler, the parasitic fig wasps display a great range of feeding regime from carnivory (parasitoid wasps) or herbivory (making galls as the pollinating wasps).

Sydney is a community in Nova Scotia, Canada.  Situated on Cape Breton Island's east coast, it belongs administratively to the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. Sydney was founded in 1785 by the British, and was incorporated as a city in 1904, and dissolved on 1 August 1995, when it was amalgamated into the regional municipality. It served as the Cape Breton Island colony's capital, until 1820, when the colony merged with Nova Scotia and the capital moved to Halifax. Its rapid population expansion occurred just after the turn of the 20th century, where it was home to one of North America's main steel mills. During both the First and Second World Wars, it was a major staging area for England-bound convoys. The post-war period witnessed a major decline in the number of people employed at the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO) steel mill, and the Nova Scotia and Canadian governments had to nationalize it in 1967 to save the region's biggest employer, forming the new crown corporation called the Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO).[tpl]sfnp|Lebel|1967-10-18|pp=1,2[/tpl] The city's population steadily decreased since the early 1970s due to the plant's fortunes, and SYSCO was finally closed in 2001. Today, the main industries are in customer support call centres and tourism. Together with Sydney Mines, North Sydney, New Waterford and Glace Bay it forms the Industrial Cape Breton region.

There are 67 counties in the state of Florida. It became a territory of the U.S. in 1821 with two counties complementing the provincial divisions retained as a Spanish territory: Escambia to the west and St. Johns to the east, divided by the Suwanee River. All of the other counties were apportioned from these two original counties. Florida became the 27th U.S. state in 1845, and its last county was created in 1925 with the formation of Gilchrist County from a segment of Alachua County.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alachua.fl.us/government/history/?era=2500 |title=A Guide to Alachua County's History |work=Alachua County Florida |accessdate=March 24, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Florida's counties are subdivisions of the state government. In 1968, counties gained the power to develop their own charters.[tpl]cite web|title=About Florida's Counties |url=http://www.fl-counties.com/Pages/About_Floridas_Counties.aspx |publisher=Florida Association of Counties |accessdate=January 20, 2010[/tpl] All but one of Florida's county seats are incorporated municipalities.

The names of Florida's counties reflect its diverse cultural heritage. Some are named for Southern political leaders and Spanish explorers, marking the influence of Spanish sovereignty, while others are named for Spanish saints, Native American placenames used by the Spanish, and political leaders of the United States. Natural features of the region, including rivers, lakes, and flora, are also commonly used for county names. Florida has counties named for participants on both sides of Second Seminole War: Miami-Dade County is partially named for Francis L. Dade, a Major in the U.S. Army at the time; Osceola County is named for a Native American resistance leader during the war.
Population figures are based on the 2010 United States Census. The population of Florida is 18,801,310, an increase of 17.6% from 2000. The average population of Florida's counties is 280,616; Miami-Dade County is the most populous (2,496,435) and Liberty County is the least (8,365). The average land area is 805 sq mi (2,085 km2). The largest county is Palm Beach County (2,034 sq mi, 5,268 km2) and the smallest is Union County (240 sq mi, 622 km2). The total area of the state is 65,795  sq miles; of this, the land area of the state constitutes [tpl]convert|53927|sqmi|km2[/tpl] while the water area constitutes 11,868  sq miles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/maps/florida_map.html|title=Florida QuickFacts|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=April 23, 2008[/tpl] (2008 Census estimates)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/states/states.html |title=Population Estimates |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |date=December 2009 |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100223204727/http://www.census.gov/popest/states/states.html  |archivedate=February 23, 2010[/tpl] (updated 2008 population estimate)
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is used by the U.S. government to uniquely identify counties, and is provided for each entry. These codes link to the United States Census Bureau's "quick facts" for each county. Florida's FIPS code of 12 is used to distinguish from counties in other states. For example, Alachua County's unique nationwide identifier is 12001.

[[List of counties in Idaho]]

CATEGORIES: Idaho counties, Lists of U.S. counties by state, Idaho geography-related lists

This is a list of 44 counties in the U.S. state of Idaho.
Each county in Idaho has a license plate prefix, according to the first letter of the county name.  The first county for a given letter is given #1, the second county #2, etc.  For example, Ada and Adams are the only two counties with the letter 'A'.  Since Ada comes before Adams alphabetically, Ada is '1A' while Adams is '2A.'  There are four counties that start with the letter 'L': Latah, Lemhi, Lewis, and Lincoln; the license plate prefixes for these counties are 1L, 2L, 3L, and 4L, respectively.
Elmore, Idaho, Kootenai, Nez Perce, Shoshone, Valley, and Washington counties are the only ones in the state with those beginning letters.  Therefore, the license plate prefix would be the first letter of the county name, without a number. The letter 'B' has ten counties, 'C' has seven, and 'L' has four; the remaining letters have two or fewer.
When the Idaho Territory was created in March 1863, there were five original counties: Shoshone, Nez Perce, Idaho, Boise, and Missoula. Kootenai, Owyhee, and Oneida were created by 1865, Ada was created in 1866, and when the territory reached Idaho's present day dimensions in 1868, Lemhi was formed. By 1880, 13 counties were created. Ten years later, when Idaho became a state, 18 counties were created. In 1893, Fremont and Bingham counties were created. By 1900, Idaho had 21 counties. Ten years later, only two new counties were created. Between 1910 and 1920, 21 new  counties were created, bringing the number of counties to 44, where it remains today.

[[List of counties in Indiana]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of U.S. counties by state, U.S. county name etymologies, Indiana geography-related lists, Indiana counties

The U.S. state of Indiana has 92 counties. Each county serves as the local level of government within its borders. Although Indiana was organized into the United States since the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, its land was not always available for settlement. Eventually, land was purchased from Native Americans by treaties and Indian removals. The oldest counties are generally in the south near the Ohio River, whereas newer ones were in the north in territory acquired later.  The oldest and newest counties in Indiana are Knox County, created in 1790, and Newton County, created in 1859.
As of the 2000 United States Census, the population of Indiana was 6,045,485, the average population of Indiana's 92 counties is 65,712, with Marion County as the most populous (903,393), and Ohio County (5,623) the least. 54 counties have 30,000 or more people; 16 counties have populations exceeding 100,000, five of which exceed 250,000; and only five counties have fewer than 10,000 people. The average land area is [tpl]convert|396|mi2|km2[/tpl]. The largest county is Allen (657 sq. mi., 1,702 km²) and the smallest is Ohio (87  sq. mi., 225 km²).  According to the Constitution of Indiana, no county may be created of less than [tpl]convert|400|sqmi|km2[/tpl], nor may any county smaller than this be further reduced in size.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/const/art15.html|title=IN Const. art.

County government in Indiana consists of two bodies, the county council and the commissioners. Government of Indiana#County government
Many Indiana counties are named for United States Founding Fathers and personalities of the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and Battle of Tippecanoe; early leaders of Indiana Territory and Indiana, as well as surrounding states like Michigan and Kentucky; plus Native American tribes and geographical features.
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Indiana's code is 18, which when combined with any county code would be written as 18XXX.

[[Prandtl number]]

CATEGORIES: Convection, Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics, Dimensionless numbers of thermodynamics, Fluid dynamics

It is defined as:
where:
Note that whereas the Reynolds number and Grashof number are subscripted with a length scale variable, the Prandtl number contains no such length scale in its definition and is dependent only on the fluid and the fluid state. As such, the Prandtl number is often found in property tables alongside other properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity. 
For mercury, heat conduction is very effective compared to convection: thermal diffusivity is dominant.
For engine oil, convection is very effective in transferring energy from an area, compared to pure conduction: momentum diffusivity is dominant.
In heat transfer problems, the Prandtl number controls the relative thickness of the momentum and thermal boundary layers. When Pr is small, it means that the heat diffuses very quickly compared to the velocity (momentum). This means that for liquid metals the thickness of the thermal boundary layer is much bigger than the velocity boundary layer.
The mass transfer analog of the Prandtl number is the Schmidt number.

[[Nusselt number]]

CATEGORIES: Convection, Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics, Dimensionless numbers of thermodynamics, Fluid dynamics, Heat transfer

In heat transfer at a boundary (surface) within a fluid, the Nusselt number (Nu) is the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer across (normal to) the boundary. In this context, convection includes both advection and diffusion. Named after Wilhelm Nusselt, it is a dimensionless number.  The conductive component is measured under the same conditions as the heat convection but with a (hypothetically) stagnant (or motionless) fluid.
A Nusselt number close to one, namely convection and conduction of similar magnitude, is characteristic of "slug flow" or laminar flow.  A larger Nusselt number corresponds to more active convection, with turbulent flow typically in the 100–1000 range.
The convection and conduction heat flows are parallel to each other and to the surface normal of the boundary surface, and are all perpendicular to the mean fluid flow in the simple case.
where:
Selection of the characteristic length should be in the direction of growth (or thickness) of the boundary layer.  Some examples of characteristic length are: the outer diameter of a cylinder in (external) cross flow (perpendicular to the cylinder axis), the length  of a vertical plate undergoing natural convection, or the diameter of a sphere.  For complex shapes, the length may be defined as the volume of the fluid body divided by the surface area.  The thermal conductivity of the fluid is typically (but not always) evaluated at the film temperature, which for engineering purposes may be calculated as the mean-average of the bulk fluid temperature and wall surface temperature.  For relations defined as a local Nusselt number, one should take the characteristic length to be the distance from the surface boundary  to the local point of interest.  However, to obtain an average Nusselt number, one must integrate said relation over the entire characteristic length.
Typically, for free convection, the average Nusselt number is expressed as a function of the Rayleigh number and the Prandtl number, written as: Nu = f(Ra, Pr).  Else, for forced convection, the Nusselt number is generally a function of the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number, or Nu = f(Re, Pr).  Empirical correlations for a wide variety of geometries are available that express the Nusselt number in the aforementioned forms.
The mass transfer analog of the Nusselt number is the Sherwood number.

The Mashantucket Pequot are a federally recognized Native American nation in the state of Connecticut. They are descended from the Pequot people, one of the Algonquian-languages family. Within their Reservation in Ledyard, New London County, Connecticut, the Mashantucket Pequot operate Foxwoods Resort Casino. It is the world's largest resort casino in terms of gambling space and number of slot machines, and one of the most economically successful.Jessica Durkin, "Mashantucket Election Returns Council Incumbents," Norwich Bulletin, 7 November 2005  
In the course of its successful federal land claims suit against the state, the tribe achieved federal recognition in 1983 by an act of Congress, as part of the settlement of the suit. It was the eighth tribal nation to have gained recognition through the political rather than administrative process. Tribal membership is based on proven descent from tribal members listed in the 1900 Census.Laurence M. Hauptman, "A Review" of Jeff Benedict’s Without Reservation: The Making of America’s Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods, the World’s Largest Casino, Indian Gaming, 17 March 2009 They are one of two federally recognized tribes in Connecticut; the other are the Mohegan Indian Tribe. Both have developed large and successful casino resorts on their reservations. 
In addition, the state recognizes the Schaghticoke tribe, whose reservation dates from 1637; the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, with a reservation from 1683; and the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation,with a reservation from 1736.

Hmong are also one of the sub-groups of the Miao ethnicity (苗族) in southern China. Hmong groups began a gradual southward migration in the 18th century due to political unrest and to find more arable land. 
During the first and second Indochina Wars, France and the United States governments recruited thousands of Hmong people in Laos to fight against invading military forces from North Vietnam and communist Pathet Lao insurgents, known as the Secret War, during the Vietnam War and the Laotian Civil War. Hmong people were singled out for retribution by the Marxist Pathet Lao and Vietnamese Army when they took over the Laotian government in 1975, with the support of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV), and the politburo officials in Hanoi as well as the communist governments of the Soviet Union, North Korea, Cuba and China. Hundreds of thousands of Hmong refugees fled to Thailand seeking political asylum. Thousands of these refugees have resettled in Western countries since the late 1970s, mostly the United States, but also in Australia, France, French Guiana, Canada, and South America. Others have returned to Laos under United Nations-sponsored repatriation programs.

The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California."Events from January 1848 through December 1855 are generally acknowledged as the 'Gold Rush'. After 1855, California gold mining changed and is outside the 'rush' era."[tpl]cite web|title=The Gold Rush of California: A Bibliography of Periodical Articles |publisher=California State University, Stanislaus|year=2002|url=http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/goldrush/GoldTOC.htm |accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] The first to hear confirmed information about gold in California were residents of Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), western Mexico, and Central America. They were the first to go there in late 1848. All told, the news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.[tpl]cite web|title=California Gold Rush, 1848–1864 | url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/archives/|work=California Secretary of State | accessdate=2011-08-22[/tpl] Of the 300,000, approximately half arrived by sea and half came overland from the east, on the California Trail and the Gila River trail.
The gold-seekers, called "forty-niners" (as a reference to 1849), often faced substantial hardships on the trip. While most of the newly arrived were Americans, the Gold Rush attracted tens of thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. At first, the gold nuggets could be picked up off the ground. Later, gold was recovered from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques, such as panning. More sophisticated methods were developed and later adopted elsewhere. At its peak, technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required, increasing the proportion of gold companies to individual miners. Gold worth tens of billions of today's dollars was recovered, which led to great wealth for a few. However, many returned home with little more than what they had started with.
The effects of the Gold Rush were substantial. San Francisco grew from a small settlement of about 200 residents in 1846 to a boomtown of about 36,000 by 1852. Roads and other towns were built throughout California. In 1849 a state constitution was written, and a governor and legislature were chosen. California became a state as part of the Compromise of 1850.
New methods of transportation developed as steamships came into regular service. By 1869 railroads were built across the country from California to the eastern United States. Agriculture and ranching expanded throughout the state to meet the needs of the settlers. At the beginning of the Gold Rush, there was no law regarding property rights in the goldfields and a system of "staking claims" was developed. The Gold Rush also resulted in attacks on Native Americans, who were forcibly removed from their lands. An estimated 100,000 California Indians died between 1848 and 1868, and some 4,500 of them were murdered. Gold mining also caused environmental harm to rivers and lakes.

Opera Australia is the principal opera company in Australia. Based in Sydney, its performance season at the Sydney Opera House runs for approximately eight months of the year, with the remainder of its time spent in the Arts Centre Melbourne (where it is accompanied by Orchestra Victoria). In 2004, the company gave 226 performances in its subscription seasons in Sydney and Melbourne, attended by more than 294,000 people.
Like most opera companies, it is funded by a combination of government money, corporate sponsorship, private philanthropy, and ticket sales. The proportion of its revenue from ticket sales is considerably higher than that of most companies, approximately 75 per cent. The company is perhaps best known internationally for its association with Dame Joan Sutherland, and for Baz Luhrmann's production of Puccini's La bohème in the early 1990s.
By the end of 2004, Opera Australia provided employment to approximately 1,300 Australians. Oz Opera (Opera Australia's education, access and development arm) presented the La bohème production in Victoria, Northern Territory and Western Australia, attended by 13,350 people, while OzOpera's Schools Company performed to over 63,500 primary age children in more than 360 performances in urban and regional New South Wales and Victoria. Many thousands of Australians also experienced the work of their national opera company through television, radio, video, compact disc, DVD, and the annual free performance of opera in the Domain in Sydney.

[[List of counties in Michigan]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of U.S. counties by state, Michigan counties, Michigan geography-related lists

There are 83 counties in the U.S. state of Michigan. The boundaries of these counties have not changed substantially since 1897. However, throughout the 19th century, the state legislature frequently adjusted county boundaries. County creation was intended to fulfill the goal of establishing government over unorganized territory, but a more important goal was encouraging settlement by surveying the land and dividing it into salable sections.
The creation of counties generally occurred in two stages. First the boundaries of a county were declared and given a name. The county appeared on maps, even though this may have been the entire extent of a county's tangible existence for several years. During this period, the as yet unorganized county was attached to another already organized county for administrative purposes. The legislature frequently changed the administrative attachment of these unorganized counties. Residents of such an attached county could petition the legislature for organization, which was the granting of full legal recognition to the county.
There are many cities and villages that span county boundaries in Michigan, including its capital, Lansing. For a few years during the early 1970s, split cities briefly had authority to petition to change the county boundaries to accord with the city boundaries. The only city to take advantage of this brief opportunity was New Baltimore (previously split between Macomb County and St. Clair County; now completely in Macomb). This transfer of territory from St. Clair to Macomb was the only county boundary change in Michigan since the early 20th century.
The state Constitution of 1850 permitted an incorporated city with a population of at least 20,000 to be organized into a separate county of its own.Constitution of the State of Michigan, 1850, Article 10, Section 2 The Constitution of 1908 retained this provision, but raised the population threshold to 100,000.Constitution of the State of Michigan, 1908, Article 8, Section 2 No city was ever organized into an independent county in this fashion and when a new Constitution took effect in 1963, the provision was removed.
Michigan's boundary with Illinois is formed by Lake Michigan, and three counties have water boundaries with Illinois: Berrien County, Van Buren County, and Allegan County. Michigan also has a boundary with Minnesota, which is formed by Lake Superior. The water boundary in this instance is formed by Keweenaw County.

Sucking lice (Anoplura, formerly known as Siphunculata) have around 500 species and represent the smaller of the two traditional suborders of lice. As opposed to the paraphyletic chewing lice, which are now divided among three suborders, the sucking lice are monophyletic.
The Anoplura are all blood-feeding ectoparasites of mammals. They can cause localised skin irritations and are vectors of several blood-borne diseases. Children appear particularly susceptible to attracting lice, possibly due to their fine hair.
At least three species or subspecies of Anoplura are parasites of humans; the human condition of being infested with sucking lice is called pediculosis. Pediculus humanus is divided into two subspecies, Pediculus humanus humanus, or the body louse, sometimes nicknamed "the seam squirrel" for its habit of laying of eggs in the seams of clothing, and Pediculus humanus capitis, or the head louse. Pthirus pubis (the crab louse) is the cause of the condition known as crabs.

The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/codes/nv.html |title=EPA County FIPS Code Listing |accessdate=2007-08-18 |work=US Environmental Protection Agency [/tpl] The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Nye County, Nevada is number 023, Humboldt County, California and Grant County, Oregon also have the number 023. While Humboldt County, Nevada has number 013, Humboldt County, Iowa has number 091. To uniquely identify Nye County, Nevada, you would need to use the state code of 32 plus the county code of 023. Thus, the unique identifier in the entire United States for Humboldt County, Nevada would be 32013, while Nye County, Nevada would be 32023, etc.

[[List of counties in New Hampshire]]

CATEGORIES: New Hampshire counties, Lists of U.S. counties by state, New Hampshire geography-related lists

This is a list of counties in New Hampshire. There are ten  counties in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. Five of the counties were created in 1769, when New Hampshire was still an English colony and not a state, during the first subdivision of the state into counties. The last counties created were Belknap County and Carroll County, in 1840. The majority of New Hampshire's counties were named for prominent British or American people or geographic locations and features. Only one county's name originates in a Native American language; Coos County, named for an Algonquian word meaning small pines. The counties tend to be smaller in land area towards the southern end of the state, where New Hampshire population is concentrated, and larger in land area in the less populous north.[tpl]cite book | last =Stackpole | first =Everett Schermerhorn | title =History of New Hampshire | publisher =The American Historical Society | year =1916[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/ffcounties.html |title=New Hampshire Counties |accessdate=2007-07-24|work=New Hampshire Almanac [/tpl]
The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States.  The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code.  This means that, for example, while Belknap County, New Hampshire is 001, Addison County, Vermont and Alachua County, Florida are also 001.  To uniquely identify Belknap County, New Hampshire, one must use the state code of 33 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Belknap County, New Hampshire is 33001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info page for that county.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/codes/nh.html |title=EPA County FIPS Code Listing |accessdate=2007-07-24 |work=US Environmental Protection Agency [/tpl]

This is a list of the 33 counties in the U.S. state of New Mexico. There were originally nine counties formed in 1852. Santa Ana County, New Mexico Territory, one of the nine original counties, was annexed in 1876 to Bernalillo County, New Mexico.
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip6-4.htm|title= FIPS Publish 6-4|publisher= National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate= 2007-08-06[/tpl] New Mexico's code is 35, which when combined with any county code would be written as 35XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

The following is a list of the 93 counties in the U.S. state of Nebraska, listed by name, FIPS code and license plate prefix.
Nebraska's postal abbreviation is NE and its FIPS state code is 31.
When many counties were formed, the bills establishing them did not state the honoree's full name; thus the namesakes of several counties, including Brown, Deuel, Dixon, and possibly Harlan, are known only by their surnames.

The U.S. state of West Virginia has 55 counties. Fifty of them existed at the time of the Wheeling Convention in 1861, before which West Virginia was part of the state of Virginia. The remaining five (Grant, Mineral, Lincoln, Summers and Mingo) were formed within the state after its admission to the United States on June 20, 1863.[tpl]cite book |title= Commonwealth of Virginia, plaintiff vs. ...

Creation of a new county is prohibited if it would bring another county below these thresholds.[tpl]cite book |title= The Code of West Virginia|last= Warth |first= John |authorlink= |year= 1887|publisher= West Virginia Printing Company, Printers and Binders |location= Wheeling and Charleston WV|pages= 271–273[/tpl]. Other editions available at ISBN 9781231066737 and Google Books. Three counties (Greenbrier, Kanawha and Randolph) have sufficient population and land area to allow a new county to be split off. The remaining counties cannot be split, as either their land area would decrease to under [tpl]convert|400|sqmi|0[/tpl] or their population would decrease to under 6,000. Population figures are based on the 2010 United States Census.
The role of counties in local government had been minimized under the 1863 constitution, which vested most local government authority in a system of townships based on the New England model. The authors of the 1872 constitution chose to return to the system used in Virginia, in which each county was governed by a county court with combined authority for executive, legislative and judicial functions of the county government.Bastress, p. 20 In 1880, West Virginia amended its constitution and replaced the county court system with an arrangement that divides county government powers between seven county offices, each of which is independently elected: the county commission, county clerk, circuit clerk, county sheriff, county assessor, county prosecuting attorney, and county surveyor of lands.[tpl]cite book |title= West Virginia Politics and Government|last= Brisbin |first= Richard |authorlink= |year= 1996|publisher= University of Nebraska Press|location= |pages= 142–146 |isbn=0803212712[/tpl] Counties have only those powers that are expressly granted to them by the state Constitution or by state statute. These powers include, but are not limited to, maintaining the infrastructure of the state, funding libraries, maintaining jails and hospitals, and waste disposal. Reforming public education became a county function in 1933. In May 1933, a county unit plan was adopted. Under this plan, the state's 398 school districts were consolidated into the current 55 county school systems. This enabled public schools to be funded more economically and saved West Virginia millions of dollars.Rice, p. 247
Randolph County is the largest by area at [tpl]convert|1040|sqmi|0[/tpl], and Hancock County is the smallest at [tpl]convert|83|sqmi|0[/tpl]. Kanawha County contributed land to the founding of 12 West Virginia counties and has the largest population (193,063 in 2010). Wirt County has the smallest population (5,717 in 2010). The oldest county is Hampshire, established in 1754, and the newest is Mingo, established in 1895.

Other editions available at ISBN 9781165299102. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes, which are used by the United States government to identify counties uniquely, are five-digit numbers. For West Virginia, they start with 54 and end with the three-digit county code (for example, Barbour County has FIPS code 54001). Each county's code is provided in the table below, linked to census data for that county.

The state of Wisconsin in the United States has 72 counties. The land that eventually became Wisconsin was transferred from British to American control with the 1783 signing of the Treaty of Paris.[tpl]cite book|last=Curtiss-Wedge|first=Franklyn|title=History of Buffalo and Pepin Counties, Wisconsin, Volume 1|year=1919|publisher=Higginson Book Company|pages=3-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SNYqAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA4&dq=wisconsin+counties+lake+michigan&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8FQ1UZLjPMea2AWQz4GQAw&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=wisconsin%20counties%20lake%20michigan&f=false[/tpl] It was an unorganized part of the Northwest Territory until 1802 when all of the land from St. Louis north to the Canadian border was organized as St. Clair County.  When Illinois was admitted to the union in 1818, Wisconsin became part of the Territory of Michigan and divided into two counties: Brown County in the northeast along Lake Michigan and Crawford County in the southwest along the Mississippi River. Iowa County was formed in 1829 from the Crawford County land south of the Wisconsin River. Brown County's southern portion was used to form Milwaukee County in 1834. The state of Wisconsin was created from Wisconsin Territory on May 29, 1848, with 28 counties.
Counties in Wisconsin are governed by county boards, headed by a chairperson. Counties with a population of 500,000 or more must also have a county executive.  Smaller counties may have either a county executive or a county administrator.Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. State of Wisconsin 2011-2012 Blue Book, p. 736. ISBN  978-0-9752820-1-4 As of 2011, 13 counties had elected county executives: Brown, Chippewa, Dane, Fond du Lac, Kenosha, Manitowoc, Milwaukee, Outagamie, Portage, Racine, Sawyer, Waukesha, and Winnebago. 23 had an appointed county administrator, 34 had an appointed administrative coordinator, and 2 had neither an executive nor an administrator. Waukesha County had both an executive and an administrator.Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. State of Wisconsin 2011-2012 Blue Book, p. 732. ISBN  978-0-9752820-1-4
Each county has a county seat, often a populous or centrally located community, where the county's governmental offices are located. Some of the services provided by the county include: law enforcement, circuit courts, social services, vital records and deed registration, road maintenance, and snow removal. County officials include sheriffs, district attorneys, clerks, treasurers, coroners, surveyors, registers of deeds, and clerks of circuit court; these officers are elected for four-year terms. In most counties, elected coroners have been replaced by appointed medical examiners. State law permits counties to appoint a registered land surveyor in place of electing a surveyor.
The most populous county in the state is Milwaukee County at 947,735 people at the 2010 census. Its population is bolstered by the city of Milwaukee's 594,833 people. The county with the least population is Menominee County with 4232 residents; the Menominee Indian Reservation is co-extensive with the county.

[[Haematomyzus]]

CATEGORIES: Lice

The genus Haematomyzus includes three species of lice that differ so markedly from all other lice that they have been placed in a suborder of their own. These unusual lice are ectoparasites of elephants and warthogs. Their mouthparts are elongated to form a drill-like structure that allows them to penetrate the thick skin of their host.

[[Ischnocera]]

CATEGORIES: Lice

The Ischnocera is a large suborder of lice mostly parasitic on birds but including a large family (the Trichodectidae) parasitic on mammals. The genus  Trichophilopterus is also found on mammals (lemurs) but probably belongs to the "avian Ischnocera" and represents a host switch from birds to mammals. It is a chewing louce (Mallophaga), which feeds on the feathers and skin debris of birds. Many of the avian Ischnocera have evolved an elongated body shape. This allows them to conceal themselves between the feather shafts and avoid being dislodged during preening or flight.
The taxonomy of the group is in need of revision. Currently four families are recognised but one of these, the Philopteridae, is almost certainly paraphyletic. The families are:

[[Serial number]]

CATEGORIES: Serial numbers

A serial number (also manufacturer's serial number or MSN) is a unique code assigned for identification of a single unit. Although usually called a number, it may include letters, though ending with digits. Typically serial numbers of a production run are incremented by one, or another fixed difference, from one unit to the next. Units may be marked with several alphanumeric codes, but only one of these will be a serial number; others are sometimes called nominal numbers, and may identify the part, specify installed options, and so on.

[[Potential flow]]

CATEGORIES: Fluid dynamics

In fluid dynamics, potential flow describes the velocity field as the gradient of a scalar function: the velocity potential. As a result, a potential flow is characterized by an irrotational velocity field, which is a valid approximation for several applications. The irrotationality of a potential flow is due to the curl of a gradient always being equal to zero.
In the case of an incompressible flow the velocity potential satisfies Laplace's equation, and potential theory is applicable. However, potential flows also have been used to describe compressible flows. The potential flow approach occurs in the modeling of both stationary as well as nonstationary flows.
Applications of potential flow are for instance: the outer flow field for aerofoils, water waves, electroosmotic flow, and groundwater flow.
For flows (or parts thereof) with strong vorticity effects, the potential flow approximation is not applicable.

CATEGORIES: Psychic powers, Parapsychology, Paranormal terminology, Pseudoscience

A psychic ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|k|ɪ|k[/tpl]; from Ancient Greek ψυχικός psykhikos, "of the mind, mental") is a person who claims to have an ability to perceive information hidden from the normal senses through extrasensory perception (ESP), or who is said by others to have such abilities. The word "psychic" is also used to describe theatrical performers, such as stage magicians, who use techniques such as prestidigitation, cold reading, and hot reading to produce the appearance of such abilities. It can also denote an ability of the mind to influence the world physically using psychokinetic powers such as those formerly claimed by Uri Geller.
Psychics appear regularly in fantasy fiction, such as in the novel The Dead Zone by Stephen King.

Mao (or Mauhttp://projectbigm.wordpress.com/family-tree/) is a card game of the shedding family, in which the aim is to get rid of all of the cards in hand without breaking certain unspoken rules. The game is from a subset of the Stops family, and is similar in structure to the card game Uno or Crazy Eights.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.georges.nu/blog?page_id=5| title=The Game of Mao| date=January 24, 2001| accessdate=2006-03-28| publisher=The George Family Website[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.mu.org/~doug/mao/maorules.html| title=The Rules for Mao| first=Eric| last=Mullins| work=the Unofficial Mao Home Page| accessdate=2006-03-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A638426| title=Mao – The Card Game| publisher=Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy| author= JonBob, GTBacchus, edited by FrankieRoberto| date=29 September 2001| accessdate=2006-03-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~bajuk/mao.html| title=The Mao Home Page[/tpl] (offline, see Internet Archive)
The game forbids its players from explaining the rules, and new players are often told only "the only rule you may be told is this one."[tpl]cite web| url=http://info.ox.ac.uk/~worc0026/mao.html| title=Mao| accessdate=1999-01-19[/tpl] (offline, see Internet Archive) The ultimate goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand. Specifics are discovered through trial and error. A player who breaks a rule is penalized by being given an additional card from the deck. The person giving the penalty must state what the incorrect action was, without explaining the rule that was broken.
There are many variants of Mao in existence.[tpl]cite web| url=http://projectbigm.wordpress.com/| title=Mao "Taxonomy"| accessdate=2008-01-17[/tpl] While beginners sometimes assume that the dealer (sometimes called the "Chairman", the "Mao" or the "Grand Master") and other experienced players are simply making up possibly inconsistent rules (as in the game Mornington Crescent), the rules of Mao are consistent within each game and can be followed correctly.

It was first climbed in 1788 by Daniel Gauss and two other members of the Billings Expedition. No other ascents were recorded until 1931, when several climbers were killed by flying lava on the descent. As similar dangers still exist today, few ascents are made.

Joseph Billings (c. 1758 - 1806) was an English navigator and explorer who spent the most significant part of his life in Russian service.
In 1785, the Russian government of Catherine II commissioned a new expedition in search for the Northeast Passage, led by English officer Joseph Billings, who had previously sailed with Captain Cook, and the Russian officer Gavril Sarychev as his deputy and Carl Heinrich Merck as the expedition's naturalist.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jones|first=Ryan|title=Sea Otters and Savages in the Russian Empire: The Billings Expedition, 1785-1793|journal=Journal for Maritime Research|year=2006|volume=8|issue=1|pages=106–121|accessdate=2013-10-18|doi=10.1080/21533369.2006.9668358[/tpl]  This enterprise operated till 1795.
Though considered a failure by some scholars because the expenditures outweighed the results, it nevertheless had a substantial record of achievement. Accurate maps were made of the Chukchi Peninsula in Eastern Siberia, the west coast of Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands. Members of the expedition landed on Kodiak Island and made an examination of the islands and mainlands of Prince William Sound.  Additionally, the expedition compiled a census of the native population of the Aleutian Islands and reported to the crown stories of abuse by the Russian fur traders (promyshlenniki).[tpl]cite journal|last=Jones|first=Ryan|title=Sea Otters and Savages in the Russian Empire: The Billings Expedition, 1785-1793|journal=Journal for Maritime Research|year=2006|volume=8|issue=1|pages=106–121|accessdate=2013-10-18|doi=10.1080/21533369.2006.9668358[/tpl]
After the Expedition, Joseph Billings remained with the Imperial Russian Navy, before retiring in 1797 and settling in Moscow.
Cape Billings in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug was named after him.

Fan Chuo (Traditional Chinese: 樊綽; Simplified Chinese: 樊绰; pinyin: fán chuò) (??? – late 9th century) was a secretary working under the Jie-du (Traditional Chinese: 節度; Simplified Chinese: 节度; pinyin: jié dù) (similar to the Byzantine thema) with headquarters located at Hanoi.
Since the thema was a front of the Tang Dynasty against Nanzhao, he was able to get his hands on the updated diplomatic and military documents of the two countries. He also lived in Hanoi during his first tenure; therefore he knew some firsthand information of the city, such as trades, deployments, population, etc. As the Nanzhao army sacked the city for the first time, he just escaped from being captured by jumping into the Red River and swimming to the opposite bank. Then he worked under another Jie-du located at Guangzhou where he compiled the first draft of Manshu (Traditional Chinese: 蠻書; Simplified Chinese: 蛮书; pinyin: mánshū; literally means barbarous document; roughly means the book on the southern tribes). He also worked a second tenure in Hanoi where he finished the book in 862 CE. He died in Guangzhou after retirement. His book Manshu is an invaluable source of the Tang-Nanzhao relation and for anthropological research of Hmong and Vietnam during the later years of the Tang Dynasty. For instance, his eyewitness account on the siege of Hanoi was monumental.

Sergei Mironovich Kirov ([tpl]lang-ru|Серге́й Миро́нович Ки́ров[/tpl]; [tpl]OldStyleDate|27 March|1886|15 March[/tpl] – 1 December 1934), born Sergei Mironovich Kostrikov, was a prominent early Bolshevik leader in the Soviet Union. Kirov rose through the Communist Party ranks to become head of the party organization in Leningrad.
On 1 December 1934, Kirov was shot and killed by a gunman at his offices in the Smolny Institute. Some historians place the blame for his assassination at the hands of Stalin and believe the NKVD organised his execution, but any evidence for this claim remains elusive.The Whisperers, Orlando Figes, Allen Lane 2007, note, p. 236 Kirov's death served as one of the pretexts for Stalin's escalation of repression against dissident elements of the Party, culminating in the Great Purge of the late 1930s in which many of the Old Bolsheviks were arrested, expelled from the party, and executed.The Whisperers, Orlando Figes, Allen Lane 2007, ps. 236-237 Complicity in Kirov's assassination was a common charge to which the accused confessed in the show trials of the era.
The cities of Kirov, Kirovohrad, Kirovakan, and Kirovabad, as well as a few Kirovsks, were renamed in Kirov's honor after his assassination. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union Kirovakan and Kirovabad returned to their original names: Vanadzor and Ganja, respectively.

Football is the most popular sport in the Netherlands, with field hockey and volleyball as the second and third most popular team sports. Tennis, gymnastics and golf are the three most widely played individual sports.[tpl]nl[/tpl] sport.nl (Figures are from 2005)=177 [tpl]nl[/tpl] Fitplein] A number of native Dutch sports are also practiced, such as fierljeppen (Polsstokverspringen), beugelen, kaatsen, klootschieten, kolven and korfball.
Organization of sports began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A Dutch National Olympic Committee was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 230 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another 78 medals at the Winter Olympic Games.
An influential figure in Dutch sport was Pim Mulier. In 1879 he founded the first rugby and football club in the Netherlands, he was involved in forming the first tennis club in 1884, established the predecessor of the Royal Dutch Football Association five years later, and introduced field hockey in 1896. He also introduced bandy. His hometown Haarlem and the English Bury Fen Bandy Club played the first international match.

In the United States, Medicare is a national social insurance program, administered by the U.S. federal government since 1966, that guarantees access to health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system, and younger people with disabilities as well as people with end stage renal disease (Medicare.gov, 2012) and persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As a social insurance program, Medicare spreads the financial risk associated with illness across society to protect everyone, and thus has a somewhat different social role from for-profit private insurers, which manage their risk portfolio by adjusting their pricing according to perceived risk.
In 2010, Medicare provided health insurance to 48 million Americans—40 million people age 65 and older and eight million younger people with disabilities.  It was the primary payer for an estimated 15.3 million inpatient stays in 2011, representing 47.2 percent ($182.7 billion) of total aggregate inpatient hospital costs in the United States. Torio CM, Andrews RM. National Inpatient Hospital Costs: The Most Expensive Conditions by Payer, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #160. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. August 2013. http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb160.jsp  Medicare serves a large population of elderly and disabled individuals. On average, Medicare covers about half (48 percent) of health care costs for enrollees.  Medicare enrollees must cover the rest of the cost.  These out-of-pocket costs vary depending on the amount of health care a Medicare enrollee needs.  They might include uncovered services—such as long-term, dental, hearing, and vision care—and supplemental insurance.Kaiser Slides | The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Facts.kff.org.

Medicare ([tpl]lang-fr|assurance-maladie[/tpl]) is the unofficial name for Canada's publicly funded universal health insurance system. The formal terminology for the insurance system is provided by the Canada Health Act and the health insurance legislation of the individual provinces and territories.
Under the terms of the Canada Health Act, all "insured persons" (basically, legal residents of Canada, including permanent residents) are entitled to receive "insured services" without copayment. Such services are defined as medically necessary services if provided in hospital, or by 'practitioners' (usually physicians). Approximately 70% of Canadian health expenditures come from public sources, with the rest paid privately (both through private insurance, and through out-of-pocket payments). The extent of public financing varies considerably across services. For example, approximately 99% of physician services, and 90% of hospital care, are paid by publicly funded sources, whereas almost all dental care is paid for privately.[tpl]cite web |author=Canadian Institute for Health Information | date=September 27, 2005 | title=CIHI exploring the 70-30 split| publisher= | url=http://www.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=AR_1282_E | accessdate=2007-12-21 |postscript= | authorlink= Canadian Institute for Health Information[/tpl] Most physicians are self-employed private entities which enjoy coverage under each province's respective healthcare plans.

[[Image:A group of dissenters in Norfolk during Robert Kett's rebellion of 1549.jpg|thumb|right|An 18th-century depiction of Robert Kett and his followers under the Oak of Reformation on 
Kett's Rebellion was a revolt in Norfolk, England during the reign of Edward VI, largely in response to the enclosure of land. It began at Wymondham on 8 July 1549 with a group of rebels destroying fences that had been put up by wealthy landowners. One of their targets was yeoman farmer Robert "Ben" Kett who, instead of resisting the rebels, agreed to their demands and offered to lead them. Kett and his forces, joined by recruits from Norwich and the surrounding countryside and numbering some 16,000, set up camp on Mousehold Heath to the north-east of the city on 12 July. The rebels stormed Norwich on 21 July and on 1 August defeated a force led by the Marquess of Northampton that had been sent by the government to suppress the uprising. Kett's rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of the Earl of Warwick at the Battle of Dussindale. Kett was captured, held in the Tower of London, tried for treason, and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle on 7 December 1549.

The École Polytechnique Massacre, also known as the Montreal Massacre,  occurred on December 6, 1989 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Twenty-five-year-old Marc Lépine, armed with a legally obtained Mini-14 rifle and a hunting knife, shot twenty-eight people before killing himself. He began his attack by entering a classroom at the university, where he separated the male and female students. After claiming that he was "fighting feminism" and calling the women "a bunch of feminists," he shot all nine women in the room, killing six. He then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, specifically targeting women to shoot. Overall, he killed fourteen women and injured ten other women and four men in just under twenty minutes before turning the gun on himself.Sourour, Teresa K., (1991) Report of Coroner's Investigation (PDF).

Lépine was the son of a French-Canadian mother and an Algerian father, and had been physically abused by his father. His suicide note claimed political motives and blamed feminists for ruining his life. The note included a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine considered to be feminists and apparently wished to kill.[tpl]cite journal| last =Chun| first =Wendy Hui Kyong| title =Unbearable Witness: towards a Politics of Listening | journal =Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies | volume =11| issue =1| pages =112–149| year =1999[/tpl]
Since the attack, Canadians have debated various interpretations of the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives.

[[Fis phenomenon]]

CATEGORIES: Language acquisition

Fis phenomenon is a phenomenon of child language acquisition that demonstrates that perception of phonemes occurs earlier than the ability of the child to produce those phonemes.  It is also illustrative of a larger theme in child language acquisition: that skills in linguistic comprehension generally precede corresponding skills in linguistic production.
The name comes from an incident reported in 1960 by J. Berko and R. Brown.[tpl]cite book | chapter = Psycholinguistic Research Methods | author = J. Berko and R. Brown | title = Handbook of Research methods in Child Development | editor = P. Mussen | location = New York | publisher = John Wiley | year = 1960 | pages = 517–557 [/tpl] A child referred to his inflatable plastic fish as a fis. However, when adults asked him, "Is this your fis?" he rejected the statement. When he was asked, "Is this your fish?" he responded, "Yes, my fis."   This shows that although the child could not produce the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/ʃ/[/tpl], he could perceive it as being different from the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/s/[/tpl]. 
In some cases, the sounds produced by the child are actually acoustically different, but not significantly enough for others to distinguishFromkin, V. (Ed.) (2000).

The program has garnered considerable controversy as a result of its origins in Scientology and its methods. Its drug rehabilitation treatment has been described as "medically unsafe", "quackery" and "medical fraud", while academic and medical experts have dismissed its educational program as containing "factual errors in basic concepts such as physical and mental effects, addiction and even spelling".
In turn, Narconon has claimed that mainstream medicine is "biased" against it, and that "people who endorse so-called controlled drug use cannot be trusted to review a program advocating totally drug-free living."

His books The Myth of Mental Illness (1961) and The Manufacture of Madness (1970) set out some of the arguments with which he is most associated.
Szasz argued that mental illnesses are not real in the sense that cancers are real. Except for a few identifiable brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, there are “neither biological or chemical tests nor biopsy or necropsy findings for verifying or  falsifying DSM diagnoses", i.e. there are no objective methods for detecting the presence or absence of mental illness.[tpl]cite web |title=Psychiatry:The Science of Lies |author= Thomas Szasz |year=2008 |pages=2–5 [/tpl]

In aviation, a planform is the shape and layout of a fixed-wing aircraft's  fuselage and wing. Of all the myriad planforms used, they can typically be grouped into those used for low-speed flight, found on general aviation aircraft, and those used for high-speed flight, found on many military aircraft and airliners.

[[Daminozide]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrazides, 1963 introductions

Daminozide — also known as Alar, Kylar, B-NINE, DMASA, SADH, or B 995 — is a plant growth regulator, a chemical sprayed on fruit to regulate their growth, make their harvest easier, and keep apples from falling off the trees before they are ripe.  This makes sure they are red and firm for storage. Alar was first approved for use in the U.S. in 1963, it was primarily used on apples until 1989 when it was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed banning it based on unacceptably high cancer risks to consumers.
It has been produced in the U.S. by the Uniroyal Chemical Company, Inc, (now integrated into the Chemtura Corporation) which registered daminozide for use on fruits intended for human consumption in 1963. In addition to apples and ornamentals, it was also registered for use on cherries, peaches, pears, Concord grapes, tomato transplants and peanut vines. On fruit trees, daminozide affects flow-bud initiation, fruit-set maturity, fruit firmness and coloring, preharvest drop and market quality of fruit at harvest and during storage.United States Environmental Protection Agency, "Daminozide (Alar) Pesticide Canceled for Food Uses" (press release), 7 November 1989 In 1989, it became illegal to use daminozide on food crops in the US, but it is still allowed for use on non-food crops like ornamentals.http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/0032fact.pdf

[[Chord (aeronautics)]]

CATEGORIES: Aerospace engineering, Aircraft wing design

In aeronautics, chord refers to the imaginary straight line joining the leading and trailing edges of an airfoil.  The chord length is the distance between the trailing edge and the point on the leading edge where the chord intersects the leading edge.Clancy, L.J. (1975), Aerodynamics, Section 5.2, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. ISBN 0-273-01120-0
The point on the leading edge which is used to define the chord can be defined as either the surface point of minimum radius,[tpl]cite book | title=Aerodynamics for Engineering Students | author=Houghton, E. L.; Carpenter, P.W.| edition=5th | year=2003 | editor=Butterworth Heinmann | isbn=0-7506-5111-3[/tpl] p.18 or the surface point which will yield maximum chord length[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl].
The wing, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer and propeller of an aircraft are all based on airfoil sections, and the term chord or chord length is also used to describe their width.  The chord of a wing, stabilizer and propeller is determined by examining the planform and measuring the distance between leading and trailing edges in the direction of the airflow.  (If a wing has a rectangular planform, rather than tapered or swept, then the chord is simply the width of the wing measured in the direction of airflow.)  The term chord is also applied to the width of wing flaps, ailerons and rudder on an aircraft. 
The term is also applied to airfoils in gas turbine engines such as turbojet, turboprop, or turbofan engines for aircraft propulsion.
Most wings do not have a rectangular planform so they have a different chord at different positions along their span.  To give a characteristic figure which can be compared among various wing shapes, the mean aerodynamic chord, or MAC, is used. The MAC is somewhat more complex to calculate, because most wings vary in chord over the span, growing narrower towards the outer tips. This means that more lift is generated on the wider inner portions, and the MAC moves the point to measure the chord to take this into account.

Francis Edward Bache ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|tʃ[/tpl]; 14 September 1833 – 24 August 1858) was an English organist and composer.
Born at Birmingham as the eldest of seven children of Samuel Bache, a well-known Unitarian minister, he studied with James Stimpson, Birmingham City Organist, and with violinist Alfred Mellon while being educated at his father's school. He played the violin in the 1846 Birmingham festival, and in 1849 went to London as a private composition student for three years under William Sterndale BennettTemperley, 1:879.
In October 1850 Bache became organist of All Saints, Gordon Square. While continuing his studies with Sterndale Bennett, Bache composed concertos, overtures, two operettas, a string quartet and a piano trio along with many piano pieces. He made his debut as a concert performer at Keighley, Yorkshire on 21 January 1851. When he played the Allegro of an unpublished piano concerto of his own in June 1852, Henry Chorley remarked, "We have met with no Englishman for whom we have so long been waiting than Mr. Bache."Quoted in Temperley, 1:879. In November 1851 Bache went to live with Mellon, who was then living in London, and in 1852 was given a contract by Addison, Hollier and Lucas to write light piano pieces; he turned out these works in considerable numbers. Of one of these he wrote, "I must say that I would sooner have written my Galop di Bravura than a Sonata which is only printed to lie on the shelf like a dead weight on account deficiency of anything like idea."
In 1853, on Sterndale Bennett's recommendation, Bache continued his musical education at Leipzig. He studied there with Moritz Hauptmann, acquiring the then-conventional prejudices against the music of Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner. (This would be in sharp contrast to his brother Walter, who would become a staunch champion of Liszt and Wagner's music.) After visiting Dresden, he returned to London by way of Paris in February 1855. He attended the 1855 Birmingham Festival and reviewed it for some of the local newspapers. Afterwards, he suffered a severe attack of the tuberculosis that had plagued him for several years.
On medical advice, Bache went to Algiers early in 1856. There he gave a concert on 28 March. He travelled by way of Paris to Leipzig, arriving there in June, then through Dresden and Vienna to Rome by December of that year. His health again deteriorated, so he returned home in June 1857. He spent the following winter in Torquay, where he succeeded in giving a concert in February 1858. After his return to Birmingham, his illness continued to progress. He died less than three weeks after a farewell concert of his music on 5 August, at the age of 24.
According to an evaluation in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition, [tpl]quote|Considering the early age at which he died, his compositions are fairly numerous, and the best, a trio for piano and strings, was long held in high esteem. Two operettas, a piano concerto and a number of published pianoforte pieces and songs do little more than show how great was his promise.[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bache, Francis Edward |volume=3[/tpl][/tpl]
His younger brother, Walter Bache (1842–1888), was a successful pianist and conductor.
A memoir of the two brothers, by their sister Constance Bache, appeared in 1901 under the title Brother Musicians.

Backnang ([tpl]pronunciation|Backnang.ogg[/tpl]) is a town in Germany in the Bundesland of Baden-Württemberg, roughly [tpl]convert|30|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] northeast of Stuttgart. Its population has increased greatly over the past century, from 7,650 in 1900 to 35,761 in 2005.
Backnang was ceded to Württemberg by the Baden (Zähringer family) in 1325.[tpl]EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Backnang|volume=3[/tpl] Backnang has been known as Gerberstadt due to several tanneries and leather factories, and wool and cloth mills that dominated Backnang's industries. Today, all of these have vanished and, instead, telecommunication companies like Ericsson (formerly AEG, Telefunken, ANT Nachrichtentechnik, Bosch and Marconi) and Tesat-Spacecom dominate the town's industries. The Stiftskirche, formerly the church of Backnang Abbey, dates back to the 12th century.
Backnang's cultural highlight is the annual Strassenfest during the last weekend in June. It has been founded as a street festival where local sports and cultural clubs offered drinks and foods. The traditional opening of the Strassenfest is marked with cannon shots from the picturesque city tower at 6 p.m. on Friday and ends with the Zapfenstreich on the following Monday at 11 p.m. The Strassenfest tends to attract more than 100,000 spectators.
Another cultural highlight in Backnang is the annual Murr-Regatta organized by the Jugendzentrum (youth center). It is generally held two weeks after the street festival. The Regatta is a race down the river Murr in self-made boats. Besides the prize for the fastest boat, an environmental prize is awarded to the crew that collects the most rubbish along the way, an originality prize is given to the most creative crew, and a drunkenness prize to the most inebriated crew.
The local Jugendzentrum (youth center) is remarkable as it has been independently self-administered by Backnang's youth and young adults for more than 30 years. It hosts numerous concerts and contributes events to the cultural life of Backnang.

[[Normal backwardation]]

CATEGORIES: Derivatives (finance), Financial terminology

Normal backwardation, also sometimes called backwardation, is the market condition wherein the price of a forward or futures contract is trading below the expected spot price at contract maturity.Contango Vs. Normal Backwardation, Investopedia The resulting futures or forward curve would typically be downward sloping (i.e. "inverted"), since contracts for further dates would typically trade at even lower prices.The curves in question plot market prices for various contracts at different maturities—cf. yield curve In practice, the expected future spot price is unknown, and the term "backwardation" may be used to refer to "positive basis", which occurs when the current spot price exceeds the price of the future.Gorton G, Rouwenhorst KG. Facts and Fantasies about Commodity Futures. NBER.[tpl]rp|22[/tpl]
The opposite market condition to normal backwardation is known as contango. Similarly, in practice the term may be used to refer to "negative basis" where the current spot price is below the future price.
A backwardation starts when the difference between the forward price and the spot price is less than the cost of carry, or when there can be no delivery arbitrage because the asset is not currently available for purchase.
Futures contract price includes compensation for the risk transferred from the asset holder. This makes actual price on expiry to be lower than futures contract price. Backwardation very seldom arises in money commodities like gold or silver. In the early 1980s, there was a one-day backwardation in silver while some metal was physically moved from COMEX to CBOT warehouses.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] Gold has historically been positive with exception for momentary backwardations (hours) since gold futures started trading on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in 1972.[tpl]cite web | author = Antal E.

The term is sometimes applied to forward prices other than those of futures contracts, when analogous price patterns arise. For example, if it costs more to lease silver for 30 days than for 60 days, it might be said that the silver lease rates are "in backwardation". Negative lease rates for silver may indicate bullion banks require a risk premium for selling silver futures into the market.

[[John Bacon (sculptor)]]

CATEGORIES: 1740 births, 1799 deaths, English Methodists, English sculptors, 18th-century Methodists

John Bacon (November 24, 1740 – August 4, 1799) was a British sculptor.
Born in Southwark, he was the son of a cloth worker from Somerset. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a manufacturer of porcelain at Lambeth, where he was at first employed in painting the small ornamental pieces of china, but was promoted to modeller. His observation of the models executed by different sculptors of eminence, which were sent to be fired at an adjoining pottery, determined the direction of his genius; he imitated them with so much success that in 1758 a small figure of Peace sent by him to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts received a prize, and the highest premiums given by that society were adjudged to him nine times between the years 1763 and 1776. 
During his apprenticeship he also improved the method of working statues in artificial stone, by 1769 working for the Coade Artificial Stone Manufactory, an art which he afterwards carried to perfection. 
Bacon first attempted working in marble in about 1763, and during the course of his early efforts in this art was led to improve the method of transferring the form of the model to the marble (technically "getting out the points") by the invention of a more perfect instrument for the purpose. This instrument possessed many advantages; it was more exact, took a correct measurement in every direction, was contained in a small compass, and could be used on either the model or the marble. In 1769 he was awarded the first gold medal for sculpture given by the Royal Academy, for a bas-relief representing the escape of Aeneas from Troy. In 1770 he exhibited a figure of Mars, which gained him the gold medal of the Society of Arts and his election as A.R.A. 
As a consequence of this success he was engaged to execute a bust of King George III, intended for Christ Church, Oxford. He retained the king's favour throughout life, though he was commonly criticised for ignorance of classic style. This charge he refuted with a noble head of Jupiter Tonans, and many of his emblematical figures are in perfect classical taste. 
He died on August 4, 1799 and was buried in Whitfield's Tabernacle.  His various sculptures, which may be studied in St Paul's Cathedral (London), Christ Church and Pembroke College, Oxford, Bath Abbey and Bristol Cathedral, give ample testimony to Bacon's powers. Perhaps his best works are to be found among the monuments in Westminster Abbey.
After his death, Bacon's practice was carried on by his son John Bacon, Jnr.

János Batsányi (May 9, 1763, Tapolca – May 12, 1845, Linz) was a Hungarian poet.
In 1785, he published his first work, a patriotic poem, "The Valour of the Magyars". In the same year he obtained a job as clerk in the treasury of the Hungarian city of Kassa (Košice), and there, in conjunction with other two Hungarian patriots, edited the Magyar Museum, which was suppressed by the government in 1792.
In the following year he was deprived of his clerkship and in 1794, having taken part in the conspiracy of Ignác Martinovics, he was thrown into the state prison of the Kufstein Fortress, where he remained for two years.
After his release, he took a considerable share in the Magyar Minerva, a literary review, and then proceeded to Vienna, where he obtained a post in the bank. He married Gabriella Baumberg,aka [tpl]ill|de|Gabriele von Baumberg[/tpl] a renowned poet from Vienna in 1805. Four years later he translated Napoleon's proclamation to the Hungarians, and, in consequence of this anti-Habsburg act, had to take refuge in Paris.
After the fall of Napoleon he was given up to the Austrians, who allowed him to reside at Linz until his death, on condition that he never left town. He published a collection of poems at Pest in 1827 and also edited the poetical works of Anyos and Faludi.

[[Paratrooper]]

CATEGORIES: Parachuting, Combat occupations, Infantry, Airborne warfare

Paratroopers are military parachutists — soldiers, marines, and others trained in parachuting into an operation and usually functioning as part of an airborne force. They are used for tactical advantage as they can be inserted into the battlefield from the air, thereby allowing them to be positioned in areas not accessible by land. It is one of the three types of "forced entry" strategic techniques for entering a theater of war; the other two are by land and sea. This ability to enter the battle from different locations allows paratroopers to evade fortifications that are in place to prevent attack from a specific direction, and the possible use of paratroopers forces an army to spread their defences to protect other areas which would otherwise be safe by virtue of the geography. Another common use for paratroopers is to establish an airhead for landing other units. Paratroopers are also trained in conducting drop zones, pickup zones, and landing sites for various aircraft.
This doctrine was first practically applied to warfare by the Italians and the Soviets. During World War II, however, the two countries' ground forces were often overstretched, leaving their elite paratroopers to be employed as regular infantry. Paratroopers (Fallschirmjäger) were first used extensively by the Germans during World War II and later in the war also by the western Allies. Owing to the limited capacity of cargo aircraft of the period (for example the Ju-52) they rarely, if ever, jumped in groups much larger than 20 from one aircraft. In English language parlance, this load of paratroopers is called a "stick", while any load of soldiers gathered for air movement is known as a "chalk". The terms come from the common use of white chalk on the sides of aircraft and vehicles to mark and update numbers of personnel and equipment being emplaned.
In World War II, paratroopers most often used parachutes of a round design. These parachutes could be steered to a small degree by pulling on the risers (four straps connecting the paratrooper's harness to the connectors) and suspension lines which attach to the parachute canopy itself. German paratroopers, whose harnesses had only a single riser attached at the back, could not manipulate their parachutes in such a manner. Today, paratroopers still use round parachutes, or round parachutes modified as to be more fully controlled with toggles. The parachutes are usually deployed by a static line. Mobility of the parachutes is often deliberately limited to prevent scattering of the troops when a large number parachute together. Some military exhibition units and special forces units use "ram-air" parachutes, which offer a high degree of manoeuvrability and are deployed manually (without a static line) from the desired altitude.

Bacup [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ay|k|ʌ|p[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Miller|1971|p=8[/tpl]. is a town within the Rossendale borough of Lancashire, England. It is located amongst the South Pennines, along Lancashire's eastern boundary with West Yorkshire. The town sits within a rural setting in the Forest of Rossendale, amongst the steep-sided upper-Irwell Valley, through which the River Irwell passes. It is [tpl]convert|3.5|mi|km|1[/tpl] east of Rawtenstall, [tpl]convert|6.4|mi|km|1[/tpl] north of Rochdale, and [tpl]convert|21|mi|km|0[/tpl] east of Preston. At the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Bacup—which encompasses the outlying communities of Britannia, Stacksteads, Rockcliffe, Trough Gate and Weir—had a population of 12,763.
Bacup emerged as a settlement following the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the Early Middle Ages. For centuries, Bacup was a small and obscure centre of domestic flannel and woollen cloth production, and many of the original weavers' cottages survive today as listed buildings. Following the Industrial Revolution Bacup became a mill town, its landscape dominated by distinctive and large rectangular woollen and cotton mills. Bacup received a charter of incorporation in 1882, giving it municipal borough status and its own elected town government, consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors to oversee local affairs.
In the late 20th century Bacup became part of the borough of Rossendale – at which time the town was suffering from chronic depopulation and urban decay with little in the way of infrastructural change in a century. Nevertheless, Bacup's historic character, culture and festivities have encouraged the town's suburbanisation and redevelopment as a commuter town; English Heritage has proclaimed Bacup as the best preserved cotton town in England, and its town centre is designated as a conservation area for its special architectural qualities.

[[Airborne forces]]

CATEGORIES: Airborne warfare, Types of military forces

 
  
 Airborne
 
 Military parachuting or gliding form of inserting personnel or supplies.

Purpose
 
 Delivering personnel, equipment, or supplies.

Origins
 
 Attributed to Italian troops on November 1927.

 
 
Airborne forces are military units, usually light infantry, set up to be moved by aircraft and "dropped" into battle. Thus, they can be placed behind enemy lines, and have the capability to deploy almost anywhere with little warning. The formations are limited only by the number and size of their aircraft, so given enough capacity a huge force can appear "out of nowhere" in minutes, an action referred to as vertical envelopment.
Conversely, airborne forces typically lack the supplies and equipment for prolonged combat operations, and are therefore more suited for airhead operations than for long-term occupation; furthermore, parachute operations are particularly sensitive to adverse weather conditions. Advances in helicopter technology since World War II have brought increased flexibility to the scope of airborne operations, and air assaults have largely replaced large-scale parachute operations, and (almost) completely replaced combat glider operations. However, due to the limited range of helicopters and the limited number of troops that can be transported by them, many countries retain paratroopers as a valuable strategic asset.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

It is situated close to the Portuguese border, on the left bank of the river Guadiana. The population in 2011 was 151,565.
Conquered by the Moors in the 7th century, Badajoz became a Moorish kingdom, the Taifa of Badajoz. After the reconquista, the area was disputed between Spain and Portugal for several centuries with alternating control resulting in several wars including the Spanish War of Succession (1705), the Peninsular War (1808–1811), the Storming of Badajoz (1812), and the Spanish Civil War (1936). Spanish history is largely reflected in the town.
Badajoz is the see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mérida-Badajoz. Prior to the merger of the Diocese of Mérida and the Diocese of Badajoz, Badajoz was the see of the Diocese of Badajoz from the bishopric's inception in 1255. The city has a degree of eminence, crowned as it is by the ruins of a Moorish castle and overlooking the Guadiana river, which flows between the castle-hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal. The architecture of Badajoz is indicative of its tempestuous history; even the Badajoz Cathedral, built in 1238, resembles a fortress, with its massive walls. Badajoz is home to the CD Badajoz 1905 and Cerro Reyes football clubs and the AB Pacense basketball club. It is served by Badajoz Railway Station and Badajoz Airport.

His best known work as an engraver was the Raphael's Bible series, which he created together with his fellow student, Giovanni Lanfranco. The images depict a series of frescoes by Raphael's workshop in the Vatican loggia. As a painter, his most important work is the frescoes the church of San Giovanni Evangelista, Reggio Emilia, which are based on Caravaggio's earliers works. He executed the decoration of the cupula and pendentives of the church of San Giovanni Evangelista in Reggio.
Though he often cooperated  in fresco painting with Lanfranco, for example in Annibale designed series the San Diego Chapel in San Giacomo degli Spagnoli (1602–1607) and in Palazzo Costaguti (Nessus and Deianeira), Badalocchio never received the same recognition as his peer.

John Badby (died 1410), one of the early Lollard martyrs, was a tailor (or perhaps a blacksmith) in the west Midlands, and was condemned by the Worcester diocesan court for his denial of transubstantiation.[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Badby, John[/tpl]
Badby bluntly maintained that when Christ sat at supper with his disciples he had not his body in his hand to distribute, and that “if every host consecrated at the altar were the Lord’s body, then there be 20,000 Gods in England.” A further court in St Paul’s, London, presided over by Archbishop Thomas Arundel, condemned him to be burned at Smithfield, the tournament ground just outside the city walls.
It is said that the prince of Wales (afterwards Henry V) witnessed the execution and offered the sufferer both life and a pension if he would recant; but in Walsingham’s words, “the abandoned villain declined the prince’s advice, and chose rather to be burned than to give reverence to the life-giving sacrament. So it befell that this mischievous fellow was burnt to ashes, and died miserably in his sin.”
Narration in Foxe's Book of Martyrs:John Foxe's Book of Martyrs, book 5
''" .. And then was the tunne put ouer hym, and fire putte vnto hym. And when he felt the fire, he cryed, mercy (calling belike vpon the Lorde) and so the Prince immediatlye commaunded to take away the tunne, and quenche the fire.

Robert Baddeley (1733–1794) was an English actor. His parentage is unknown, as is his place of birth, though the latter may have been London. He worked as a cook and valet, and one of his employers was the actor-manager Samuel Foote, who may have inspired him to take to the stage. He spent three years following another employer on a Grand Tour, which helped him to develop the facility with languages and accents which was to be a hallmark of his career.
In 1760 Baddeley made his stage debut in one of Foote's productions at the Haymarket Theatre in London. Soon afterwards he trod the boards of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. By 1762 he was a full member of the Drury Lane company, and he remained there for the rest of his career, while also playing summer seasons at the Haymarket. He was a great success in low comedy and servants' parts, and often played comic foreigners such as Canton in The Clandestine Marriage. In 1777 he played Moses in The School for Scandal, which came to be the role with which he was most associated.Broadbent, R. J. (1908). Annals of the Liverpool Stage, p. 41. Edward Howell.
Baddeley's wife, Sophia Baddeley, exceeded him in fame. The couple had a troubled relationship. At one point Baddeley insisted that Sophia stop living with one Doctor Hayes, and in the financial negotiations that followed Baddeley ended up fighting a duel with David Garrick's brother and business manager George, who had disputed his version of events. No one was injured and a separation was agreed.
Baddeley continued acting until just before his death. A sufferer of epilepsy, he was taken ill on 19 November 1794 while preparing to play Moses in The School for ScandalHickman, Katie (2003).

The permanent population is about 600; the nearest big city on the German side of the border is Freiburg, about 30 kilometers away. Badenweiler lies at the western edge of the Black Forest. It is sheltered by the Blauen, 1,164 m (3,820 ft), and the climate is excellent. Its parish (Evangelical) church (1897) is built at the foot of an 11th-century castle which belonged to the margraves of Baden and was destroyed by the French during the wars of Louis XV.
Badenweiler is visited by some 5,000 people annually. Some come for its warm mineral springs, with temperatures of 21°C (70°F), others for its whey cure, and still others on account of its equable climate and picturesque surroundings. There is a Kurhaus, built in 1853, and a park of 15 acres (61,000 m²) containing a historic arboretum (the Staatliche Baderverwaltung Badenweiler), as well as a grand-ducal castle, refitted in 1887–88.

He was also a scholar of considerable repute, had studied at Brussels and Ferrara, and, before settling in Paris, had taught Greek for several years at Lyon. He illustrated with notes several of the classics which he printed, and was the author of numerous pieces, amongst which are a life of Thomas a Kempis, and a satire on the follies of women, entitled Navicula Stultarum Mulierum.[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Badius, Jodocus[/tpl]
Badius worked first as an editor and proof-reader for the printer Jean Trechsel in Lyon (1492–1498).
He then moved to Paris where he set up his printing shop in 1503.
His production was almost entirely in Latin. He specialised in editions of Roman classical texts, often with his own familiare commentum for the student market,[ref]For example, for the Roman playwright Terence (195–159 BC) Badius printed in 1502 in Lyon his Praenotamenta: Jodocus Badius Ascensius,
Praenotamenta to the comedies of Terence (1502)
edited by Paul White, consisting of a lengthy and thorough treatment of general theories of poetry, its origins, development, and classifications, that had the purpose of serving as an introduction to the subject of Roman Comedy.[/ref]
and also Latin works by contemporary humanist writers.Imprimeurs & libraires parisiens du XVIe siècle, t. 2 (Paris 1969) pp. 6--24; with a chronological list of his published output pp. 24--297
Badius's shop was one of the most productive of the period 1501–1530: 775 editions are listed in the bibliography in Philippe Renouard's Imprimeurs & libraires parisiens du XVIe siècle. 
He frequently worked for or in partnership with Johannes Parvus (Jean Petit), who was by far the most important wholesale bookseller/publisher of this period.
After his death the second eldest son Conrad continued his work. However, Conrad Badius  
confessed to being a Protestant and therefore fled to Calvinist Geneva in 1549.

Its founders and history therefore remained controversial until recent research conducted both in the West and within China.

[[Grover's algorithm]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum algorithms, Search algorithms

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database with N entries in O(N1/2) time and using O(log N) storage space (see big O notation). Lov Grover formulated it in 1996.
In models of classical computation, searching an unsorted database cannot be done in less than linear time (so merely searching through every item is optimal). Grover's algorithm illustrates that in the quantum model searching can be done faster than this; in fact its time complexity O(N1/2) is asymptotically the fastest possible for searching an unsorted database in the linear quantum model.Bennett C.H., Bernstein E., Brassard G., Vazirani U., The strengths and weaknesses of quantum computation. SIAM Journal on Computing 26(5): 1510–1523 (1997). Shows the optimality of Grover's algorithm. It provides a quadratic speedup, unlike other quantum algorithms, which may provide exponential speedup over their classical counterparts. However, even quadratic speedup is considerable when N is large.
Like many quantum algorithms, Grover's algorithm is probabilistic in the sense that it gives the correct answer with high probability. The probability of failure can be decreased by repeating the algorithm.  (An example of a deterministic quantum algorithm is the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which always produces the correct answer.)

CATEGORIES: Health in Australia, Public policy in Australia, Publicly funded health care, Medicare Australia

Medicare is a publicly funded universal health care scheme in Australia. Operated by the government authority Medicare Australia, Medicare is the primary funder of health care in Australia, funding primary health care for Australian citizens and permanent residents (except for those on Norfolk Island). Residents are entitled to subsidised treatment from medical practitioners, eligible midwives, nurse practitioners and allied health professionals who have been issued a Medicare provider number, and can also obtain free treatment in public hospitals. The plan was introduced in 1975 by the Whitlam Government as Medibank, and was supplemented in 1976 by a government-owned private health insurance fund, Medibank Private, established by the Fraser Government. Medibank was renamed Medicare in 1984.
Reciprocal Health Care Agreements (RHCA) are in place with the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Slovenia, Malta, Italy, Republic of Ireland and New Zealand, which entitle visitors from these countries to limited access to Medicare and entitles Australian residents to reciprocal rights while in one of these countries.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/medicare/reciprocal-health-care-agreements|title = Reciprocal Health Care Agreements|accessdate = 11 August 2013|publisher = Department of Human Services (Australia)[/tpl]
Since 1999, the public health plan has been supplemented by a Private Health Insurance Rebate, where the government funds up to 30% of any private health insurance premium covering people eligible for Medicare. Including these rebates, Medicare is the major component of the total Commonwealth health budget, taking up about 43% of the total. The program is estimated to cost $18.3 billion in 2007–08.General Government Expenses, Budget 2007–08. In 2009 before means testing was introduced, the private health insurance rebate was estimated to cost $4 billion, around 20% of the total budget.[tpl]cite news|last=Metherell|first=Mark|title=High Cost of Health Reform|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/high-cost-of-health-reform-puts-insurance-rebate-under-scrutiny-20090728-e067.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=8/01/2012|date=29 July 2009[/tpl] The overall figure is projected to rise by almost 4% annually in real terms over the next few years.

[[Contango]]
CATEGORIES: Derivatives (finance), Basic financial concepts, Financial terminology

Contango is a situation where the futures price (or forward price) of a commodity is higher than the expected spot price.[tpl]harv|Black|2009[/tpl][tpl]cite dictionary|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199237043.001.0001/acref-9780199237043|series=A Dictionary of Economics|edition=3|title=Contango|editor1=John Black|editor2=Nigar Hashimzade|editor3=Gareth Myles|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2009|isbn=9780199237043[/tpl][tpl]harv|investopedia[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contango.asp |publisher=Investopedia|title=Contango|accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl]  In a contango situation, hedgers (commodity producers and commodity users) or arbitrageurs/speculators (non-commercial investors),[tpl]harv|EU|2008|6[/tpl] are "willing to pay more for a commodity at some point in the future than the actual expected price of the commodity. This may be due to people's desire to pay a premium to have the commodity in the future rather than paying the costs of storage and carry costs of buying the commodity today."[tpl]harv|investopedia[/tpl]
The opposite market condition to contango is known as normal backwardation.[tpl]harv|investopedia[/tpl] "A market is "in backwardation" when the futures price is below the expected future spot price for a particular commodity. This is favorable for investors who have long positions since they want the futures price to rise."[tpl]harv|investopedia[/tpl]
The Commission of the European Communities [tpl]harv|CEC|2008|6[/tpl] described backwardation and contango in relation to futures prices: "The futures price may be either higher or lower than the spot price. When the spot price is higher than the futures price, the market is said to be in backwardation. It is often called "normal backwardation" as the futures buyer is rewarded for risk he takes off the producer. If the spot price is lower than the futures price, the market is in contango."[tpl]harv|CEC|2008|6[/tpl][tpl]cite report|publisher=Commission of the European Communities|location=Brussels|author=CEC|date=21 November 2008|number=SEC(2008)2971|=Task force on the role of speculation in agricultural commodities price movements|title=Is there a speculative bubble in commodity markets?|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication13765_en.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl]
The futures or forward curve would typically be upward sloping (i.e. "normal"), since contracts for further dates would typically trade at even higher prices. (The curves in question plot market prices for various contracts at different maturities—cf. term structure of interest rates) "In broad terms, backwardation reflects the majority market view that spot prices will move down, and contango that they will move up. Both situations allow speculators (non-commercial traders)"A non-commercial trader is a trader that is not commercially engaged in business activities hedged by the use of the futures or option markets (CFTC classification). The non-commercial classification does not include swap dealers and commodity index trading is generally considered as commercial." to earn a profit."[tpl]harv|CEC|2008|6[/tpl]
A contango is normal for a non-perishable commodity that has a cost of carry. Such costs include warehousing fees and interest forgone on money tied up, less income from leasing out the commodity if possible (e.g. gold).[tpl]cite web | author = Izabella Kaminska | title = It’s the BIS| url = http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/07/08/281601/the-bis/ | publisher = The Financial Times | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2010-09-01 [/tpl] For perishable commodities, price differences between near and far delivery are not a contango. Different delivery dates are in effect entirely different commodities in this case, since fresh eggs today will not still be fresh in 6 months' time, 90-day treasury bills will have matured, etc.

CATEGORIES: Free improvisation, Jazz genres, Jazz techniques

Free improvisation or free music is improvised music without any rules beyond the logic or inclination of the musician(s) involved. The term can refer to both a technique (employed by any musician in any genre) and as a recognizable genre in its own right.
Free improvisation, as a genre of music, developed in the U.S. and Europe in the mid to late 1960s, largely as an outgrowth of free jazz and modern classical musics. None of its primary exponents can be said to be famous amongst the general public; however, in experimental circles, a number of free musicians are well known, including saxophonists Evan Parker, Anthony Braxton,  Peter Brötzmann and John Zorn , drummer Christian Lillinger, trombonist George Lewis, guitarists Derek Bailey and Fred Frith and the improvising groups The Art Ensemble of Chicago and AMM.

Æthelstan or Athelstan (Old English: Æþelstan, Æðelstān; [tpl]circa[/tpl] 893/895 – 27 October 939) was King of the Anglo-Saxons from 924 to 927 and King of the English from 927 to 939.[tpl]efn|Ninth-century West Saxon kings before Alfred the Great are generally described by historians as kings of Wessex or of the West Saxons. In the 880s Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, accepted West Saxon lordship, and Alfred then adopted a new title, king of the Anglo-Saxons, representing his conception of a new polity of all the English people who were not under Viking rule. This endured until 927, when Æthelstan conquered Viking York, and adopted the title rex anglorum (king of the English), in recognition of his rule over the whole of England. The term "Englalonde" (England) came into use in the late tenth or early eleventh century.Entries on ninth century West Saxons kings describe them as kings of Wessex in Lapidge, et al, ed., Blackwell Encyclopaedia; Keynes, "Rulers of the English", pp. 513–515; Higham and Ryan, Anglo-Saxon World, p. 8[/tpl] He was the son of King Edward the Elder and his first wife, Ecgwynn. Historians regard him as the first King of England and one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon kings. He never married, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Edmund.
When Edward died in July 924, Æthelstan was accepted by the Mercians as king. His half-brother Ælfweard may have been recognised as king in Wessex, but died within weeks of their father. Æthelstan still encountered resistance in Wessex for several months, and was not crowned until September 925. In 927 he conquered the last remaining Viking kingdom, York, making him the first Anglo-Saxon ruler of the whole of England. In 934 he invaded Scotland and forced King Constantine of Scotland to submit to him, but Æthelstan's rule was resented by the Scots and Vikings, and in 937 they invaded England. Æthelstan defeated them at the Battle of Brunanburh, a victory which gave him great prestige both in the British Isles and on the Continent. After his death in 939 the Vikings seized back control of York, and it was not finally reconquered until 954.
Æthelstan centralised government; he increased control over the production of charters and summoned leading figures from distant areas to his councils. These meetings were also attended by rulers from outside his territory, especially Welsh kings, who thus acknowledged his overlordship. More legal texts survive from his reign than from any other tenth-century English king. They show his concern about widespread robberies, and the threat they posed to social order. His legal reforms built on those of his grandfather, Alfred the Great. Æthelstan was one of the most pious West Saxon kings, and was known for collecting relics and founding churches. His household was the centre of English learning during his reign, and it laid the foundation for the Benedictine monastic reform later in the century. No other West Saxon king played as important a role in European politics as Æthelstan, and he arranged the marriages of several of his sisters to continental rulers.

In abstract algebra, an abelian group (G,+) is called finitely generated  if there exist finitely many elements x1,...,xs in G such that every x in G can be written in the form 
with integers n1,...,ns. In this case, we say that the set {x1,...,xs} is a generating set of G or that x1,...,xs generate G.

[[Alliteration]]

CATEGORIES: Poetic devices, Poetry articles needing expert attention

Alliteration is the repetition of the same sounds or of the same kinds of sounds at the beginning of words or in stressed syllables of an English language phrase. Alliteration developed largely through poetry, in which it more narrowly refers to the repetition of a consonant in any syllables that, according to the poem's meter, are stressed,[tpl]cite web|url = http://volweb.utk.edu/school/bedford/harrisms/allitera.htm|title=Alliteration, University of Tennessee Knoxville|accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://literarydevices.net/alliteration/|title=Definition of Alliteration, Literary Devices|accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/virtualit/poetry/alliteration_def.html|title=Definition of Alliteration, Bcs.bedfordstmartins.com|accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl] as in James Thomson's verse "Come…dragging the lazy languid Line along".

Consonance (ex: As the wind will bend) is another 'phonetic agreement' akin to alliteration. It refers to the repetition of consonant sounds. 
Alliteration is a special case of consonance where the repeated consonant sound is at the stressed syllable.Alliteration - The Free Dictionary Alliteration may also include the use of different consonants with similar properties[tpl]cite journal | author = Stoll, E. E. | title = Poetic Alliteration | work = Modern Language Notes | volume = 55 | issue = 5 |date=May 1940 | page = 388[/tpl] such as alliterating z with s, as does Tolkien in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, or as Anglo-Saxon (Old English) poets would alliterate hard/fricative g with soft g (the latter exemplified in some courses as the letter yogh - ȝ - pronounced like the y in yarrow or the j in Jotunheim); this is known as license.[tpl]citation needed |date=September 2013[/tpl]
There is one specialised form of alliteration called Symmetrical Alliteration. That is, alliteration containing parallelism.[tpl]cite book|author=Paul Fussell|title=The Great War and Modern Memory|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QFL-BGRCv1kC&pg=PP98|accessdate=24 September 2013|date=15 May 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-997197-8|page=98[/tpl] In this case, the phrase must be constituted of two end words both starting with the same letter, and the pairs of outside words getting progressively closer to the centre of the phrase also starting with identical letters. For example, "rust brown blazers rule", "purely and fundamentally for analytical purposes" or "fluoro colour co-ordination forever". Symmetrical alliteration is similar to palindromes in its usage of symmetry.

In Anglo-Saxon times the river formed a boundary between Wessex and Dumnonia. It later served the Port of Bridgwater, and enabled cargoes to be transported inland. The arrival of the railways led to a decline in commercial shipping and the only working docks are at Dunball. Man's influence on the river has left a legacy of bridges and industrial artefacts. The Parrett along with its connected waterways and network of drains supports an ecosystem that includes several rare species of flora and fauna. The River Parrett Trail has been established along the banks of the river.

Walter Ulbricht (30 June 1893[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]1 August 1973) was a German communist politician.  He played a leading role in the creation of the Weimar-era Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and later (spending the years of Nazi rule in exile in the Soviet Union) in the early development and establishment of East Germany (the German Democratic Republic). He was first secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, and as such the actual leader of East Germany, from 1950 to 1971.  From President Wilhelm Pieck's death in 1960, he was also the East German head of state until his own death in 1973.

[[Zymotic disease]]

CATEGORIES: Medical terminology, Obsolete medical theories

Zymotic diseases (from the Greek word ζυμοῦν zumoun "to ferment"), a 19th-century medical term for acute infectious diseases,[tpl]cite book|title=Hospitalism and Zymotic Disease|author=Kennedy, Evor|year=1869|edition=2nd|location=London|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N2Gp-S-xgKAC[/tpl] especially "chief fevers and contagious diseases (e.g. typhus and typhoid fevers, smallpox, scarlet fever, measles, erysipelas, cholera, whooping-cough, diphtheria, &c.)."[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Zymotic Diseases[/tpl]
Zyme or microzyme was the name of the organism presumed to be the cause of the disease.
 As originally employed by Dr W. Farr, of the British Registrar-General's department, the term included the diseases which were "epidemic, endemic and contagious," and were regarded as owing their origin to the presence of a morbific principle in the system, acting in a manner analogous to, although not identical with, the process of fermentation. 
In the late 19th century, Antoine Béchamp proposed that tiny organisms he termed "microzymas," and not cells, are the fundamental building block of life. Bechamp claimed these microzymas are present in all things—animal, vegetable, and mineral—whether living or dead [tpl]when|date=April 2013[/tpl]. Microzymas are what coalesce to form blood clots and bacteria. Depending upon the condition of the host, microzymas assume various forms. In a diseased body, the microzymas become pathological bacteria and viruses. In a healthy body, microzymas form healthy cells. When a plant or animal dies, the microzymas live on.[tpl]clarify|date=April 2013[/tpl]  His ideas did not gain acceptance.[tpl]cite book|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=Can bacteria cause cancer?: alternative medicine confronts big science|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KojMTlCdYCUC&pg=PA76|year=1997|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0-8147-3561-4|pages=76–77[/tpl]

Robert Newstead used this term in a 1908 publication in the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, to describe the contribution of house flies (Musca domestica) towards the spread of infectious diseases. However, by the early-1900s, bacteriology "displaced the old fermentation theory," and so the term became obsolete.

The city is situated in a valley at the foot of the Erzgebirge mountains and is also part of what is called the Saxon triangle metropolitan area, an economic network which includes Leipzig-Halle, Dresden and Chemnitz. The city has slightly fewer than 100,000 inhabitants, but has a regional catchment area of over 480,000 people.Zwickau.de: Zwickau in Zahlen (Zwickau in Numbers) From 1834 until 1952 Zwickau was the former seat of the government of the south-western region of Saxony.
Zwickau, known as the city of automobiles,Zwickau.de: Industrie und Wirtschaft (Industry & Commerce) is the centre of the Saxon automotive industry, with a tradition over one hundred years old. Well known beyond Germany's borders are car makers such as Horch, Audi, Trabant and Volkswagen. Since 2000 its history has been presented in the August-Horch Museum,Official Website of August Horch Museum Zwickau inside the former Audi Works.   The West Saxon University of Applied Sciences of Zwickau (Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau) is an important centre for educating and training automotive engineers. The Romantic composer Robert Schumann was born in Zwickau.
The valley of the [tpl]convert|166|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] long Zwickauer Mulde river stretches from the Vogtland to Colditz Castle at the other end.

[[Winter wheat]]

CATEGORIES: Wheat, German-Russian culture in the United States

Winter wheat (usually Triticum aestivum) are strains of wheat that are planted in the autumn to germinate and develop into young plants that remain in the vegetative phase during the winter and resume growth in early spring. Classification into spring or winter wheat is common and traditionally refers to the season during which the crop is grown in the Northern Hemisphere. For winter wheat, the physiological stage of heading is delayed until the plant experiences vernalization, a period of 30 to 60 days of cold winter temperatures (0° to 5°C).B.C.Curtis, S.Rajaram, H. Gómez Macpherson (eds.). 2002. Bread Wheat: Improvement and Production. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
Winter wheat is usually planted from September to November in the Northern Hemisphere and harvested in the summer or early autumn of the next year. In some few places (e.g. Chile), winter wheat even celebrates a "birthday", meaning it is harvested more than a year after it was planted. Winter wheat usually provides higher yields compared to spring wheat.
So-called "facultative" wheat varieties need shorter periods of vernalization time (15 - 30 days) and temperatures of 3° to 15°C. In many areas facultative varieties can be grown either as winter or as a spring, depending on time of sowing.
In countries that experience mild winters, such as in South Asia (India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh), North Africa, the Middle East and the lower latitudes (e.g. Sonora in Mexico), spring wheat (not requiring a period of vernalization) is also sown in the autumn (November/December) and harvested in late spring (April - May) the next year. This spring wheat planted in the autumn and grown over the winter is sometimes also incorrectly called "winter wheat".
Hard winter wheats have a higher gluten protein content than other wheats. They are used to make flour for yeast breads, or are blended with soft spring wheats to make the all-purpose flour used in a wide variety of baked products. Pure soft wheat is used for specialty or cake flour. Durum, the hardest wheat, is primarily used for making pasta. Almost all durum wheat grown in North America is spring-planted.
Winter wheat is grown throughout Europe, North America, and in Siberia.

The German minority in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union, self-termed as Russaki was created from several sources and in several waves. The 1914 census puts the number of Germans living in Russian Empire at 2,416,290.The Long March of the Innocents In 1989, the German population of the Soviet Union was roughly 2 million.Bonn Urges Russia to Restore Land for Its Ethnic Germans, New York Times In the 2002 Russian census, 597,212 Germans were enumerated, making Germans the fifth largest ethnic group in Russia. In 1999, there were 353,441 Germans in Kazakhstan and 21,472 in Kyrgyzstan.Case Studies Database According to the 2001 census, 33,300 Germans lived in Ukraine.2001 Ukrainian Population Census
In the Russian Empire, ethnic Germans were strongly represented among royalty, aristocracy, large land owners, military officers and the upper echelons of the imperial service, engineers, scientists, artists, physicians and the bourgeoisie in general. The Germans of Russia did not necessarily speak Russian; they spoke German, while French was often the language of the high aristocracy. However, the present Russian Germans usually speak only Russian, are assimilated into Russian culture, and have a poor command of German. Consequently, Germany has recently strictly limited their immigration, and a decline in the number of Germans in the Russian Federation has moderated as they no longer emigrate to Germany and as Kazakh Germans move to Russia instead of Germany.

The attack followed the President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser's decision of 26 July 1956 to nationalize the Suez Canal, after the withdrawal of an offer by Britain and the United States to fund the building of the Aswan Dam, which was in response to Egypt's new ties with the Soviet Union and recognizing the People's Republic of China during the height of tensions between China and Taiwan."Suez crisis"  The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003.

Less than a day after Israel invaded Egypt, Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to Egypt and Israel, and then began to bomb Cairo. Despite the denials of the Israeli, British, and French governments, allegations began to emerge that the invasion of Egypt had been planned beforehand by the three powers.How Britain France and Israel Got Together, Time, 12 November 1956.  "Within 24 hours after Israel invaded Egypt, Britain, and France joined in an ultimatum to Egypt and Israel—and then began to bomb Cairo.  Israel's Foreign Ministry talked of "the unexpected intervention of Britain and France." Britain's Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd protested: "There was no prior agreement between us." Despite their words, there was plenty of evidence to show that the two attacks were planned in collusion ("orchestration" was the French word for it). In this conspiracy, France was the instigator, Britain a belated partner, and Israel the willing trigger." Anglo-French forces withdrew before the end of the year, but Israeli forces remained until March 1957, prolonging the crisis. In April, the canal was fully reopened to shipping, but other repercussions followed.
The three allies, especially Israel, were mainly successful in attaining their immediate military objectives, but pressure from the United States and the USSR at the United Nations and elsewhere forced them to withdraw. As a result of the outside pressure Britain and France failed in their political and strategic aims of controlling the canal and removing Nasser from power. Israel fulfilled some of its objectives, such as attaining freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran. As a result of the conflict, the UNEF would police the Egyptian–Israeli border to prevent both sides from recommencing hostilities.

[tpl]lang-he-n|בֵּית אֵל[/tpl], also transliterated Beth El, Beth-El, or Beit El; [tpl]lang-el|Βαιθηλ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-la|Bethel[/tpl]) was a border city described in the Hebrew Bible as being located between Benjamin and Ephraim.
Edward Robinson identified the village of Beitin in the West Bank with ancient Bethel in Biblical Researches in Palestine, 1838–52. He based this assessment on its fitting the location described in earlier texts, and on the philological similarities between the modern and ancient name, arguing that the replacement of the Hebrew el with the Arabic in was not unusual. During Israelite rule, Bethel first belonged to the Tribe of Benjamin, but was later conquered by the Tribe of Ephraim. Eusebius of Caesarea and Jerome describe it in their time as a small village that lay 12 Roman miles north of Jerusalem, to the right or east of the road leading to Neapolis.Robinson and Smith, 1856, pp. 449–450.
Ten years after the Six Day War, the biblical name was applied to an Israeli settlement Beit El constructed adjacent to Beitin. In several countries - particularly in the US - the name was given to various locations (see Bethel (disambiguation)).
A second biblical Bethel, in the southern Judah, is mentioned in the Book of Joshua ([tpl]bibleverse||Joshua|8:17|1000[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse||Joshua|12:16|1000[/tpl]), and seems to be the same as Bethul or Bethuel, a city of the tribe of Simeon.

Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. (December 31, 1943 – October 12, 1997), known professionally as John Denver, was an American singer, songwriter, actor, activist, and humanitarian. He was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the 1970s and one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mademan.com/mm/10-best-selling-artists-70s.html |title=10 Best Selling Artists of the 1970s |author=Maphis, Susan  |publisher=mademan.com |accessdate=May 16, 2012[/tpl] After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career in folk music groups in the late 1960s. His greatest commercial success was as a solo singer, starting in the 1970s. Throughout his life, Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed, with total sales of over 33 million http://floridatheatre.com/event/john-denver-rocky-mountain-high-concert/.
He performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, his enthusiasm for music, and his relationship trials. Denver's music appeared on a variety of charts, including country and western, the Billboard Hot 100, and adult contemporary, in all earning him twelve gold and four platinum albums with his signature songs "Take Me Home, Country Roads", "Annie's Song", "Rocky Mountain High", and "Sunshine on My Shoulders".
Denver further starred in films and several notable television specials in the 1970s and 1980s. In the following decade, he continued to record, but also focused on calling attention to environmental issues, lent his vocal support to space exploration, and testified in front of Congress to protest against censorship in music. He was known for his love of the state of Colorado, which he sang about numerous times. He lived in Aspen, Colorado, for much of his life. He was named Poet Laureate of the state in 1974. The Colorado state legislature also adopted "Rocky Mountain High" as one of its state songs in 2007. Denver was an avid pilot, and died in a single fatality crash of his personal aircraft at the age of 53.

[[Axe historique]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of Paris, Buildings and structures in Paris, La Défense, Environmental design, Urban design, Landscape architecture, Champs-Élysées

The Axe historique ([tpl]IPA-fr|aks istɔʁik|pron[/tpl]) ([tpl]lang-en|historical axis[/tpl]) is a line of monuments, buildings and thoroughfares that extends from the centre of Paris, France, to the west. It is also known as the Voie Triomphale ("triumphal way").
The Axe Historique began with the creation of the Champs Élysées, designed in the 17th century to create a vista to the west, extending the central axis of the gardens to the royal Palace of the Tuileries. Today the Tuileries Gardens (Jardins des Tuileries) remain, preserving their wide central pathway, though the palace was burned down during the Paris Commune, 1871.
Between the Tuileries gardens and the Champs Élysées extension a jumble of buildings remained on the site of Place de la Concorde until early in the reign of Louis XV, for whom the square was at first named. Then the garden axis could open through a grand gateway into the new royal square.
To the east, the Tuileries Palace faced an open square, the Place du Carrousel. There, by order of Napoleon, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel was centered on the palace (and so on the same axial line that was developing beyond the palace). Long-standing plans to link the entrance court of the "Vieux Louvre", as the disused palace was called, with the court of the Tuileries, by sweeping away the intervening buildings, finally came to fruition in the early 19th century. Consequently, the older axis extending from the courtyard of the Louvre is slightly skewed to the rest of what has become the Axe historique, but the Arc du Carrousel, at the fulcrum between the two, serves to disguise the discontinuity.
To the west, the completion of the Arc de Triomphe in 1836 on the Place de l'Étoile at the western end of the Champs Élysées formed the far point of this line of perspective, which now starts at the equestrian statue of Louis XIV placed by I.M. Pei adjacent to his Pyramide du Louvre in the Cour Napoléon of the Musée du Louvre. 
The axis was extended again westwards along the Avenue de la Grande Armée, past the city boundary of Paris to La Défense. This was originally a large junction, named for a statue commemorating the defence of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War.
In the 1950s, the area around La Défense was marked out to become a new business district, and high-rise office buildings were built along the avenue. The axis found itself extended yet again, with ambitious projects for the western extremity of the modern plaza.
It was not until the 1980s, under president François Mitterrand, that a project was initiated, with a modern 20th century version of the Arc de Triomphe. This is the work of Danish architect Johann Otto von Spreckelsen, La Grande Arche de la Fraternité (also known as simply La Grande Arche or L'Arche de la Défense), a monument to humanity and humanitarian ideals rather than militaristic victories. It was inaugurated in 1989.
The network of railway lines and road tunnels beneath the elevated plaza of La Défense prevented the pillars supporting the arch from being exactly in line with the axis: it is slightly out of line, bending the axis should it be extended further to the west. From the roof of the Grande Arche, a second axis can be seen: the Tour Montparnasse stands exactly behind the Eiffel Tower.
The Seine-Arche project is extending the historical axis to the West through the city of Nanterre, but with a slight curve.

[[Name change]]

CATEGORIES: Public law, Gender transitioning, Transgender law, Human names

Name change generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption. The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, common law jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while civil law jurisdictions are more restrictive.
A pseudonym can be regarded as a name adopted to conceal a person's identity, and does not always require legal sanction. Additionally, there are other reasons for informal changes of name that are not done for reasons of concealment, but for personal, social or ideological reasons.

The Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs (PASSIA) was founded in Jerusalem in March 1987 by Dr. Mahdi Abdul Hadi and a group of Palestinian academics and intellectuals. PASSIA is not affiliated with any government, political party or­ganization, and maintains a completely independent financial and legal inde­pendent status.
PASSIA deals with the various national, Arab and international aspects of the Palestinian Ques­tion through its academic Research Studies Program, dialogue and publication.
A major component of PASSIA’s activities is its Roundtable Meetings Program, and with over 100 publications to its credit, many of which include the minutes of these meetings, PASSIA has proved most successful at promoting understanding of international relations as they affect the Palestinian struggle for justice and peace. As part of its Religious Studies Unit PASSIA also holds regular meetings with religious leaders (mainly local Muslim and Chris­tian dignitaries, but also involving Jews and foreign scholars) in an effort to foster schol­arly under­standing.
Considered to be of equal importance by those familiar with PASSIA’s activities is its Semi­nar Program, which provides a much-needed venue for Palestinian graduates to benefit from the ex­perience and knowledge of local and foreign experts of the highest caliber. PASSIA’s educational and training seminars are divided into two categories: In­ternational Affairs – including seminars on Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution, Strategic Studies and Security, the EU, Education on Democ­racy, The Foreign Policies of Arab States, Japan and the Middle East, and The United States and Canada: Political Systems, Policy-Making and the Middle East – and Civil Society Empowerment, with seminars held to date including those on Policy-Making, Strategic Planning & Media & Com­munication Skills.
Jerusalem has been and will continue to be the core of the Palestine Question. It is also the fo­cus of the majority of PASSIA’s activities due, in part, to its centrality to the Palestin­ian-Israeli struggle and the now inevitable establishment of a Palestinian state. PASSIA hosts regular work­shops that address different but inter-connected issues pertaining to Je­rusalem, such as freedom of access, Israeli settlements, and the various religious, politi­cal, cultural, historical, and civil as­pects of life in the city, in addition to municipal ar­rangements for Jeru­salem as the capital of two independent states. In these meetings, as during all other events held at PASSIA, it is the desire to promote communication, coop­eration and coordi­nation between those with an interest in the fate of this region that overrides any other con­sidera­tion, and which inevitably results in a dia­logue that is as stimulating as it is productive.

Hobbits are a fictional, diminutive, humanoid race who inhabit the lands of Middle-earth in J. R. R. Tolkien’s fiction.
Hobbits first appeared in the novel The Hobbit, in which the main protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, is the titular hobbit. The novel, The Lord of the Rings, includes more Hobbits as major characters, Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck, as well as several other minor hobbit characters. Hobbits are also briefly mentioned in The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales.

[[Trusted Computing]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography, Business law, Copyright law, Trusted computing, Microsoft Windows security technology

Trusted Computing (TC) is a technology developed and promoted by the Trusted Computing Group.Chris Mitchell, Trusted Computing, Institution of Electrical Engineers, 2005. The term is taken from the field of trusted systems and has a specialized meaning. With Trusted Computing, the computer will consistently behave in expected ways, and those behaviors will be enforced by computer hardware and software. Enforcing this behavior is achieved by loading the hardware with a unique encryption key inaccessible to the rest of the system.
TC is controversial as the hardware is not only secured for its owner, but also secured against its owner. Such controversy has led opponents of trusted computing, such as free software activist Richard Stallman, to refer to it instead as treacherous computing,[tpl]cite web|last=Stallman|first=Richard|title=Can You Trust Your Computer?|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/can-you-trust.html|work=gnu.org|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] even to the point where some scholarly articles have begun to place scare quotes around "trusted computing".Ross Anderson, "Cryptography and Competition Policy - Issues with ‘Trusted Computing’ ", in Economics of Information Security, from series Advances in Information Security, Vol. 12, April 11, 2006.F.

[[Non-Euclidean geometry]]

CATEGORIES: Non-Euclidean geometry

In mathematics, non-Euclidean geometry consists of two geometries based on axioms closely related to those specifying Euclidean geometry. As Euclidean geometry lies at the intersection of metric geometry and affine geometry, non-Euclidean geometry arises when either the metric requirement is relaxed, or the parallel postulate is set aside. In the latter case one obtains hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry, the traditional non-Euclidean geometries. When the metric requirement is relaxed, then there are affine planes associated with the planar algebras which give rise to kinematic geometries that have also been called non-Euclidean geometry.
The essential difference between the metric geometries is the nature of parallel lines. Euclid's fifth postulate, the parallel postulate, is equivalent to Playfair's postulate, which states that, within a two-dimensional plane, for any given line  ℓ and a point A, which is not on ℓ, there is exactly one line through A that does not intersect ℓ. In hyperbolic geometry, by contrast, there are infinitely many lines through A not intersecting ℓ, while in elliptic geometry, any line through A intersects ℓ (see the entries on hyperbolic geometry, elliptic geometry, and absolute geometry for more information).
Another way to describe the differences between these geometries is to consider two straight lines indefinitely extended in a two-dimensional plane that are both perpendicular to a third line:

Polyglotta Africana is a study written by the German missionary Sigismund Wilhelm Koelle in 1854 in which he compared 156 African languages (or about 120 according to today's classification; several varieties considered distinct by Koelle were later shown to belong to the same language). As a comparative study it was a major breakthrough at the time. 
Koelle based his material on first hand observations, mostly with freed slaves in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He transcribed the data using a uniform phonetic script devised by the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius. Koelle's transcriptions were not always accurate; for example, he persistently confused [tpl]IPA|s[/tpl] with [tpl]IPA|z[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|tʃ[/tpl] with [tpl]IPA|dʒ[/tpl].

[[Court-martial]]

CATEGORIES: Military courts, Courts by type

A court-martial (plural courts-martial, as "martial" is postpositive) is a military court. A court-martial is empowered to determine the guilt of members of the armed forces subject to military law, and, if the defendant is found guilty, to decide upon punishment.
Most militaries maintain a court-martial system to try cases in which a breach of military discipline may have occurred. Some countries, however, have no courts-martial in time of peace; this is the case in France and Germany, for example, where ordinary, civilian courts are used instead.Note about the military justice, French Senat
In addition, courts-martial may be used to try prisoners of war for war crimes. The Geneva Convention requires that POWs who are on trial for war crimes be subject to the same procedures as would be the holding military's own forces.
Most navies have a standard court-martial which convenes whenever a ship is lost; this does not presume that the captain is suspected of wrongdoing, but merely that the circumstances surrounding the loss of the ship be made part of the official record.

[[Group A streptococcal infection]]

CATEGORIES: Bacterial diseases

The group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) (a single species, Streptococcus pyogenes, constituting Lancefield group A) is a form of β-hemolytic Streptococcus bacteria.  It is a gram-positive bacterium responsible for a wide range of both invasive and non-invasive infections.[tpl]cite web|title=Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Disease|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=November 21, 2012[/tpl]  The name derives from the Greek word 'streptos,' meaning 'twisted chain,' due to the fact that the bacterium resembles a string of small pearls when viewed under the microscope.[tpl]cite web|title=Definition of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11270|accessdate=November 21, 2012[/tpl]
Infection of GAS may spread through direct contact with mucus or sores on the skin.

There are many other types of streptococci (species of Streptococcus), including group B Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause other types of infections and should not be confused with group A strep.  Several virulence factors contribute to the pathogenesis of GAS, such as M protein, hemolysins, and extracellular enzymes.

[[Dida language]]

CATEGORIES: Kru languages, Languages of Ivory Coast

Dida is a dialect cluster of the Kru family spoken in Ivory Coast.
Ethnologue divides Dida into two groups, Yocoboué Dida (101,600 speakers in 1993) and Lakota Dida (93,800 speakers in 1993), which are only marginally mutually intelligible and best considered separate languages. Each is dialectically diverse: Yocoboué (Yokubwe) consists of the Lozoua (Lozwa) and Divo dialects (7,100 and 94,500 speakers), and Lakota the Lakota (Lákota), Abou (Abu), and Vata dialects. The prestige dialect is the Lozoua speech of the town of Guitry.
Yocoboué is also known as Guitry, Yocoboue, Yokouboué, Gakpa, Goudou (Gudu), and Kagoué (Kagwe). Lakota is also known as Dieko, Gabo, Satro, Guébie (Gebye), Brabori, and Ziki.

Jerónimo (or Gerónimo) de Zurita y Castro (1512 – 3 November 1580) was an Aragonese historian of the sixteenth century who founded the modern tradition of historical scholarship in Spain.
Born at Zaragoza, Kingdom of Aragon, he studied at Alcalá de Henares under the Hellenist Hernan Nufiez. Through the influence of his father, Miguel de Zurita, physician to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, he entered the public service as magistrate at Barbastro, and in 1537 was appointed assistant-secretary of the Inquisition. In 1548 Zurita was nominated official chronicler of the Kingdom of Aragon, and in 1566 Philip II of Spain attached him as secretary to the council of the Inquisition, delegating to him the conduct of all matters sufficiently important to require the king's signature. Zurita resigned these posts on the January 21, 1571, obtained a sinecure at Zaragoza, and dedicated himself wholly to the composition of his Anales de la Corona de Aragón, the first part of which had appeared in 1562; he lived to see the last volume printed at Zaragoza on the April 22, 1580, and died on the November 3 following.
Zurita's style is somewhat crabbed and dry, but his authority is unquestionable; he displayed a new conception of an historian's duties, and, not content with the ample materials stored in the Archives of Aragon, continued his researches in the libraries of Rome, Naples and Sicily.

James Bay ([tpl]lang-fr|Baie James[/tpl]) is a large body of water on the southern end of Hudson Bay in Canada. Both bodies of water extend from the Arctic Ocean.  It is the southernmost part of the Arctic Ocean. James Bay borders the provinces of Quebec and Ontario; islands within the bay (the largest of which is Akimiski Island) are part of Nunavut. The James Bay watershed is the site of several major hydroelectric projects, and is also a destination for river-based recreation. Several communities are located near or alongside James Bay, including a number of Aboriginal communities such as the Kashechewan First Nation and nine communities affiliated with the Crees of northern Quebec.
As with the rest of Hudson Bay, the waters of James Bay routinely freeze over in winter, although it is the last to freeze over in winter, and conversely the first to thaw in summer.

[[Labrador]]

CATEGORIES: Labrador, Territorial disputes of Canada

Labrador is the distinct, northerly region of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It comprises the mainland portion of the province, separated from the island of Newfoundland by the Strait of Belle Isle. It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in Atlantic Canada.
Labrador occupies the eastern part of the Labrador Peninsula. It is bordered to the west and the south by the Canadian province of Quebec. Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of Nunavut on Killiniq Island.
Though Labrador's area is over twice that of the island of Newfoundland, it has only 8% of the province's population. The aboriginal peoples of Labrador include the Northern Inuit of Nunatsiavut, the Southern Inuit-Métis of Nunatukavut (NunatuKavut), and the Innu. The non-aboriginal population in Labrador did not permanently settle in Labrador until the natural resource developments of the 1940s and 1950s.  Before the 1950s, very few non-aboriginal people lived in Labrador year round.  The few European immigrants who worked seasonally for foreign merchants and brought their families were known as Settlers.

[[Faraday constant]]

CATEGORIES: Electrochemistry, Physical constants, Michael Faraday, Units of electrical charge, Units of amount of substance

In physics and chemistry, the Faraday constant (named after Michael Faraday) is the magnitude of electric charge per mole of electrons.The term "magnitude" is used in the sense of "absolute value": The charge of an electron is negative, but F is always defined to be positive. It has the currently accepted value
The constant F has a simple relation to two other physical constants:
where
NA is the Avogadro constant (the ratio of the number of particles N to the amount of substance n - a unit mole), and e is the elementary charge or the magnitude of the charge of an electron. This relation is true because the amount of charge of a mole of electrons is equal to the amount of charge in one electron multiplied by the number of electrons in a mole.
One common use of the faraday constant is Electrolysis. One can divide the amount of charge in coulombs by the Faraday constant in order to find the amount (in moles) of the element that has been Oxidized.
The value of F was first determined by weighing the amount of silver deposited in an electrochemical reaction in which a measured current was passed for a measured time, and using Faraday's law of electrolysis.NIST Introduction to physical constants Research is continuing into more accurate ways of determining the interrelated constants F, NA, and e.

[[Fundamental unit]]
CATEGORIES: Measurement, Dimensional analysis

[tpl]refimprove|date=March 2013[/tpl][tpl]about|the type of unit of measure|the concept in number theory|Fundamental unit (number theory)[/tpl]
A set of fundamental units is a set of units for physical quantities from which every other unit can be generated. 
In the language of measurement, quantities are quantifiable aspects of the world, such as time, distance, velocity, mass, temperature, energy, and weight, and units are used to describe their measure. Many of these quantities are related to each other by various physical laws, and as a result the units of some of the quantities can be expressed as products (or ratios) of powers of other units (e.g., momentum is mass times velocity and velocity is measured in distance divided by time). These relationships are discussed in dimensional analysis. Those that cannot be so expressed can be regarded as "fundamental" in this sense.
There are other relationships between physical quantities which can be expressed by means of fundamental constants, and to some extent it is an arbitrary decision whether to retain the fundamental constant as a quantity with dimensions or simply to define it as unity or a fixed dimensionless number, and reduce the number of fundamental constants by one.
For instance, time and distance are related to each other by the speed of light, c, which is a fundamental constant. It is possible to use this relationship to eliminate either the fundamental unit of time or that of distance. Similar considerations apply to Planck's constant, h, which relates energy (with dimensions of mass, length and time) to frequency (dimensions of time). In theoretical physics it is customary to use such units (natural units) in which [tpl]nowrap|c [tpl]=[/tpl] 1[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|ħ [tpl]=[/tpl] 1[/tpl].  
Slightly different considerations apply to the so-called permittivity of free space, which historically has been regarded as a separate physical constant in some systems of measurement but not in others.
In the SI system, there are seven fundamental units: kilogram, meter, candela, second, ampere, kelvin, and mole. 
In theory, a system of fundamental quantities (or sometimes fundamental dimensions) would be such that every other physical quantity (or dimension of physical quantity) can be generated from them. 
A widely used choice is the so-called Planck units, which are defined by setting [tpl]nowrap|ħ [tpl]=[/tpl] c [tpl]=[/tpl] G [tpl]=[/tpl] 1[/tpl].
That leaves every physical quantity expressed simply as a dimensionless number, so it is not surprising that there are also physicists who have cast doubt on the very existence of incompatible fundamental quantities.M.

[[CDC 6600]]

CATEGORIES: 1964 introductions, CDC hardware, Supercomputers, Transistorized computers, Superscalar microprocessors

The CDC 6600 was a mainframe computer manufactured by Control Data Corporation. A CDC 6600 was delivered in 1965 to the CERN laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland,http://timeline.web.cern.ch/the-cdc-6600-arrives-at-cern CERN Timelines, "The CDC 6600 arrives at CERN" where it was used to analyse the 2-3 million photographs of bubble-chamber tracks that CERN experiments were producing every year.
In 1966 another CDC 6600 was delivered to the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, part of the University of California at Berkeley, where it was used for the analysis of nuclear events photographed inside the Alvarez bubble chamber.http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fchp6.html "Bumper Crop", chapter 6 in "Lawrence and His Laboratory", 1981 
The CDC 6600 is generally considered to be the first successful supercomputer, outperforming its fastest predecessor, the IBM 7030 Stretch, by about a factor of three. With performance of about 1 megaFLOPS,http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/CDC_6600.html the CDC 6600 was the world's fastest computer from 1964 to 1969, when it relinquished that status to its successor, the CDC 7600.
The CDC 6600 was the flagship of Control Data Corporation's 6000 series of computer systems, which included four basic models, the CDC 6400, the CDC 6500, the CDC 6600, and the CDC 6700. The models of the 6000 series differed only in their CPUs, which were of two kinds, the 6400 CPU and the 6600 CPU. The 6400 CPU had a unified arithmetic unit, rather than discrete functional units. As such, it could not overlap instructions' execution times. For example, in a 6400 CPU, if an add instruction immediately followed a multiply instruction, the add instruction could not be started till the multiply instruction finished, so the net execution time of the two instructions would be the sum of their individual execution times. The 6600 CPU had multiple functional units which could operate simultaneously (i.e., in parallel), allowing the CPU to overlap instructions' execution times. For example, a 6600 CPU could begin executing an add instruction in the next CPU cycle following the beginning of a multiply instruction (assuming, of course, that the result of the multiply instruction was not an operand of the add instruction), so the net execution time of the two instructions would simply be the (longer) execution time of the multiply instruction. The 6600 CPU also had an instruction stack, a kind of instruction cache, which helped increase CPU throughput by reducing the amount of CPU idle time caused by waiting for memory to respond to instruction fetch requests. The two kinds of CPUs were instruction compatible, so that a program that ran on either of the kinds of CPUs would run the same way on the other kind but would run faster on the 6600 CPU. Indeed, all models of the 6000 series were fully inter-compatible. The CDC 6400 had one CPU (a 6400 CPU), the CDC 6500 had two CPUs (both 6400 CPUs), the CDC 6600 had one CPU (a 6600 CPU), and the CDC 6700 had two CPUs (one 6600 CPU and one 6400 CPU).
The CDC 7600 was originally intended to be fully compatible with the existing 6000-series machines as well. (It started life as the CDC 6800.) But during its design, the designers determined that maintaining complete compatibility with the existing 6000-series machines would limit how much performance improvement they could attain and decided to sacrifice compatibility for performance. While the CDC 7600's CPU was basically instruction compatible with the 6400 and 6600 CPUs, allowing code portability at the high-level language source code level, the CDC 7600's hardware, especially that of its Peripheral Processor Units (PPUs), was quite different, and the CDC 7600 required a different operating system. This turned out to be somewhat serendipitous because it allowed the designers to improve on some of the characteristics of the 6000-series design, such as the latter's complete dependence on Peripheral Processors (PPs), particularly the first (called PP0), to control operation of the entire computer system, including the CPU(s). Unlike the 6600 CPU, the CDC 7600's CPU could control its own operation. In fact, the 6000-series machines were retrofitted with this capability.
A CDC 6600 is on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.

[[Gas turbine]]
CATEGORIES: Gas turbines, Engines, Turbomachinery, Turbines, Marine propulsion, Norwegian inventions

A gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of internal combustion engine. It has an upstream rotating compressor coupled to a downstream turbine, and a combustion chamber in-between.
The basic operation of the gas turbine is similar to that of the steam power plant except that air is used instead of water. Fresh atmospheric air flows through a compressor that brings it to higher pressure. Energy is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. This high-temperature high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a shaft work output in the process. The turbine shaft work is used to drive the compressor and other devices such as an electric generator that may be coupled to the shaft. The energy that is not used for shaft work comes out in the exhaust gases, so these have either a high temperature or a high velocity. The purpose of the gas turbine determines the design so that the most desirable energy form is maximized. Gas turbines are used to power aircraft, trains, ships, electrical generators, or even tanks.Introduction to Engineering Thermodynamics, Richard E. Sonntag, Claus Borrgnakke 2007.
