Jewish mythology is the sacred and traditional narratives that help explain and symbolize Judaism. Elements of Jewish mythology have had a profound influence on Christian and Islamic mythology, as well as world culture in general. Christian mythology directly inherited many of the narratives from the Jewish people, sharing in common the narratives from the Old Testament. Islamic mythology also shares many of the same stories; for instance, a creation account spaced out over six periods, the legend of Abraham, the stories of Moses and the Israelites, and many more.

Jewish folklore are legends, music, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, fairy tales, stories, tall tales, and customs that are the traditions of Judaism. Folktales are characterized by the presence of unusual personages (dwarfs, giants, fairies, ghosts, etc.), by the sudden transformation of men into beasts and vice versa, or by other unnatural incidents (flying horses, a hundred years' sleep, and the like). A number of haggadic stories bear folktale characteristics, especially those relating to Og, King of Bashan, which have the same exaggerations as have the lügenmärchen of modern German folktales.G.

Some Like It Hot is a 1939 comedy film starring Bob Hope, Shirley Ross, and Gene Krupa.  The movie was directed by George Archainbaud, and the screenplay was written by Wilkie C. Mahoney and Lewis R. Foster, based on the play The Great Magoo by Ben Hecht and Gene Fowler, which performed briefly on Broadway in 1932.[tpl]ibdb title|11690|The Great Magoo[/tpl]  The film was released the year before Road to Singapore converted theatre and radio star Hope into a huge movie box office draw. Legendary cinematographer Karl Struss filmed the movie.
The title of the film is taken from a nursery rhyme, and bears no relation to the Billy Wilder's acclaimed 1959 comedy film Some Like It Hot starring Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis. The movie was reissued for television as Rhythm Romance, presumably to avoid viewers confusing it with the other Some Like It Hot.

"In the Crossfire" is a rock song written by britpop band Starsailor, which talks about the suffering of people who have lived the Iraq war.  The song says "I hear them screaming on the radio, it's getting louder in the crossfire, trying to find some hope from the ashes of their broken homes". 
This is the first political song of the band which denounced the alliance of Prime Minister Tony Blair with president George W. Bush (I don't see myself when I look at the flag) during the war on Iraq. It peaked at number 22 on the UK Singles Chart.
"In the Crossfire" shows a more mature and heavier-sounding Starsailor, unique from what they have done before.  Noticeably, it shows a marked distance between the sound of other britpop groups like Coldplay.Starsailor proves success isn't easy

[[Attacks at Fort Blue Mounds]]
CATEGORIES: Battles and skirmishes of the Black Hawk War, 1832 in the United States, Dane County, Wisconsin

The attacks at Fort Blue Mounds were two separate incidents which occurred on June 6 and 20, 1832, as part of the Black Hawk War. In the first incident, area residents attributed the killing of a miner to a band of Ho-Chunk warriors, and concluded that more Ho-Chunk planned to join Black Hawk in his war against white settlers. The second incident occurred east of the fort as a Sauk raiding party, estimated by eyewitnesses to be as large as 100 warriors, attacked two militia men who were investigating noises heard the night before. Two members of the militia stationed at Blue Mounds were killed in the attack, and both their  bodies were badly mutilated.
The attacks followed an increase in tension after the Hall sisters were released at Fort Blue Mounds on June 1. The sisters had been kidnapped during the Indian Creek massacre in May and were brought to Blue Mounds by a party of Ho-Chunk. Militia leader Henry Dodge became suspicious of the Ho-Chunk and took them prisoner, though they were later released as tension between the Ho-Chunk and white settlers increased. The attacks also lent credence to the belief that more Ho-Chunk were set to join Black Hawk's war against white settlers in Illinois and Michigan Territory. Though other attacks on the fort were expected they never happened and Fort Blue Mounds served as a supply center for the remaining days of the war.

Cyril Lionel Houri (born April 1969 in Meudon, Hauts-de-Seine, France) is a New York-based entrepreneur who has founded two geolocation technology companies: InfoSplit, Inc. and Mexens Technology Inc. (now called Navizon. Houri has designed IP address geolocation, WiFi and cellular positioning technologies, and has testified as an expert witness on location-based technology in LICRA vs. Yahoo!.
Houri was educated in Paris before graduating with an MS degree in both engineering and computer science from the National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse, France in 1992. He moved to New York in 1996 to take a job designing financial software. In 1999, Houri founded InfoSplit Inc., a pioneer in IP geolocation, which identifies the geographic location of an Internet user. Houri designed and patented some of the technology that is now commonly used to geolocate website visitors. Houri’s patent is now[tpl]When|date=May 2011[/tpl] co-owned by Microsoft and Quova.
In 2000, Yahoo! was sued by two French anti-racism groups demanding that Yahoo! France prevent French web users from accessing English-language auction sites offering Nazi memorabilia, which are illegal in France. Yahoo! argued in court that it was technically impossible to block only French web surfers from the site. Houri was called to testify on behalf of the plaintiff groups and demonstrated that geolocation technology could be used to block at least 90% of France-based users from accessing the offending Yahoo! sites. The court ruled for the plaintiffs and ordered Yahoo! to block French web users from accessing the unlawful content.
In 2004, Houri sold InfoSplit to Quova, a larger California-based geolocation company. Shortly thereafter, he launched Mexens Technology, Inc. and created Navizon, a wireless positioning system for handheld devices that triangulates signals from cellular tower and/or Wi-Fi access points to pinpoint the user’s location. Navizon is based on a collaborative database compiled by users with GPS devices who collect positional information of Wi-Fi hotspots and cellular signals.

[[North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough]]
CATEGORIES: Cricket grounds in North Yorkshire, Buildings and structures in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Sport in Scarborough, North Yorkshire

North Marine Road Ground, formerly known as Queen's, is a cricket ground in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England.[tpl]cite web |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/england/content/ground/57290.html |work=CricInfo |title=North Marine Road Ground |accessdate=31 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/724.html |work=CricketArchive |title=North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough |accessdate=31 August 2010[/tpl]  It is the home of Scarborough Cricket Club which hosts the Scarborough Cricket Festival and the Yorkshire County Cricket Club plays a series of fixtures in the second half of the season each year.  The current capacity is 11,500, while its record attendance is the 22,946 who watched Yorkshire play Derbyshire in 1947.  The two "ends" are known as the Pavilion End and the Trafalgar Square End.
Cricket was first staged at the ground in 1863, when tenancy of Jackson's field on North Marine Road was obtained, matches having been played at Castle Hill in Scarborough since 1849.  Yorkshire has played there since 1878, when MCC beat Yorkshire by 7 wickets.  The first County Championship game was held there in 1896, when Yorkshire beat Leicestershire by 162 runs.  With the demise of the other 'out' grounds, Scarborough is the only regular venue for county cricket in Yorkshire other than Headingley Stadium, Leeds.
The end-of-season Scarborough Festival, staged to capitalise on the large numbers of Yorkshire tourists in the seaside resort, saw touring teams, county teams and Yorkshire play in a mixture of friendly, championship and one-day cricket.  The Fenner Trophy, a one-day competition featuring four counties, ran from 1971 to 1996 under the names of various sponsors.  The centenary of the festival was celebrated in 1986, with Sir Len Hutton as president.   
The ground has also staged two One Day Internationals, pitting England against the West Indies and New Zealand in 1976 and 1978. In 2005, Yorkshire signed a new deal with the ground authorities which ensured that the county would continue to play there until 2010. 
The ground is situated close to the sea and features a raised cricket pavilion built at a cost of £2,150 in 1895. A new seating enclosure was added in 1902 and further extended over the next five years. A concrete stand was added in 1926, at a cost of £6,700 and in 1956 a new West Stand was erected, costing £16,000.  More recently, the Jack Knowles Building was completed in 1995 at a cost of £210,000, new all-weather nets and a press box were constructed in 1997 for £50,000 and the enclosure and tea rooms were refurbished in 1998 for £95,000.
After the 2010 county season The Guardian named North Marine Road their Ground of the Year.[tpl]cite news|last=Hopps|first=David|title=The 2010 County Cricket Awards|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/sep/14/cricket|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 February 2011|location=London|date=14 September 2010[/tpl]
The ground is known to have a fast-scoring outfield and a pitch which is often receptive to spin. The ground hosts Senior Premier League matches while ECB representative games, under-19 and Women's Test matches have also been held there in recent years.
At different stages of the club's history, the stadium has also contained a Velodrome, hosted athletics events, was the original home of Scarborough F.C. and, in more recent times, was a venue for Scarborough Hockey Club fixtures. The pavilion facilities are utilized throughout the year for a variety of functions.

It was designed as a counter forum to the World Economic Forum (WEF) held in Davos at the same time. While the WEF is a meeting of the political and economic elite of the world, the WSF gathers social forces and promotes democratization and social justice.
After the first WSF, the Social Forum idea was replicated across the world in various transnational, national, and local Social Forums. Most, though not all, Social Forums adhere to the WSF Charter of Principles drawn up by the International Council of the WSF. The diversity of actors participating in the Social Forums has become iconic for the diversity of the Global Justice Movement (or Anti-Globalization Movement).

Tao-cho (Ch: 道綽 Dào Chāo, Jp: Dōshaku), who lived 562–645, was a Chinese Buddhist scholar of the Nirvana Sutra, but later became an eminent scholar of the Pure Land school.  In Jodo Shinshu, he is considered the fourth Patriarch.  According to legend, Tao-cho once visited the temple of Tan-luan, and read an inscription on the wall that venerated Tan-luan.  Tao-cho was so impressed by this inscription that he took up the pursuit of Pure Land Buddhism over his previous studies.JODO SHU English
Among Tao-cho's contributions to Pure Land Buddhism was his distinction that there existed two Paths in Buddhism: The Holy Path (monastic practices leading to the purification of the mind) and the Pure Land Path (relying on Amida's grace).  He also linked the Buddhist concept of Mappo with the salvation of Amida, by teaching that Amida's compassion was particularly focused on those living in the degenerate age.JODO SHU English

[[Winter (The Rolling Stones song)]]
CATEGORIES: The Rolling Stones songs, 1973 songs, Songs written by Jagger/Richards, Song recordings produced by Jimmy Miller

"Winter" is a song by English rock and roll band the Rolling Stones featured on their 1973 album Goats Head Soup.
It bears many similarities to "Moonlight Mile" from their 1971 album Sticky Fingers. Credited to singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards, "Winter" is likely the work of Jagger and the Stones' lead guitarist at the time, Mick Taylor. It was the first song recorded for the album and does not feature Richards at all. On the song, Bill Janovitz says in his review, "Here they were in sunny Jamaica, and the Stones were writing and recording an entirely convincing and evocative picture of a Northern Hemisphere winter. Perhaps they were so happy to be escaping the season they felt that starting the sessions with "Winter" could transition them out of the old and into the new climate. Though it bemoans many of the negatives of the season the lyrics... "Winter" seems to simultaneously celebrate the season as something inherently beautiful, with other evocations of holiday scenes and wanting to wrap a coat and keep a lover warm."[tpl]cite web |last=Janovitz |first=Bill |title=Winter |work=allmusic |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t806668|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |accessdate=2006-07-31[/tpl]
Recording began at Kingston's Dynamic Sound Studios in November and continued into December 1972. Jagger opens the song with the acoustic rhythm guitar piece and is accompanied by Taylor's "country-like licks" on lead. Taylor also plays slide guitar. Nicky Hopkins performs the song's accompanying piano while Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts perform bass and drums, respectively. The songs strings were arranged by Nicky Harrison.Nick Harrison Biography
Despite his considerable contribution to the song, Taylor never received official credit from Jagger or Richards.
This song was featured in the series finale of the CBS drama Cold Case.

[[Hold On (John Lennon song)]]
CATEGORIES: 1970 songs, John Lennon songs, Songs written by John Lennon, Song recordings produced by Phil Spector, Song recordings produced by John Lennon, Song recordings produced by Yoko Ono

"Hold On" is a song from the album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band by John Lennon. It features only vocals, tremolo guitar, drums, and bass guitar, typical of the sparse arrangements Lennon favoured at the time. In the middle of the song, Lennon mutters the word "cookie", imitating the Cookie Monster from the US  children's television show Sesame Street.[tpl]cite book|title=Still the Greatest: The Essential Solo Beatles Songs|author=Jackson, A.G.|page=85|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810882225[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Words and Music of John Lennon|authors=Urish, B. & Bielen, K.|page=18|year=2007|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-99180-7[/tpl] On the 2000 reissue of John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, "Hold On" features a slightly longer introduction. The original version was restored on the 2010 reissue.
The song's theme is emotional fragility, as the lyrics state that when you're alone in the world you just have to "hold on."  Lennon tries to assure himself that he and wife Yoko Ono have the strength to overcome their challenges, and if he holds on, "it's gonna be all right" and "we're gonna win the fight."  Lennon explicitly namechecks himself and Yoko Ono, but author Andrew Jackson does not believe that this detracts from the universality of the message.  Indeed, towards the end of the song Lennon expands the subject to encompass the whole world, singing that peace will be achievable when everyone will "see the light" and realize that we are all "one."
Musically, Lennon plays his guitar gently, applying tremolo, in an effect that Jackson states matches "the soothing reassurance of the lyrics."  Lennon took 32 takes experimenting with different approaches before hitting on this one.  However, music critics Wilfrid Mellers and Johnny Rogan state that other elements of the music create some tension with the reassuring message.[tpl]cite book|title=The Music of the Beatles|author=Mellers, W.|page=163|year=1973|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=670735981[/tpl]  These elements include Ringo Starr's "jittery" drumming, with many silences, and the fragmented vocal melody, which break up the sentences of the lyrics.[tpl]cite book|title=The Complete Guide to the Music of John Lennon|author=Rogan, J.|pages=38–39|year=1997|publisher=Omnius Press|isbn=0711955999[/tpl]

[[Gans theory]]
CATEGORIES: Scattering, Scattering, absorption and radiative transfer (optics)

Gans theory or Mie-Gans theory is the extension of Mie theory for the case of spheroidal particles. It gives the scattering characteristics of both oblate and prolate spheroidal particles much smaller than the excitation wavelength.
Since it is a solution of the Maxwell equations it should technically not be called a theory.
The theory is named after Richard Gans who first published the solution for gold particles in 1912 in an article entitled "Über die Form ultramikroskopischer Goldteilchen".Gans, R. Ann. Phys. 1912, 342, 881 A subsequent article in 1915 discussed the case of silver particles.Gans, R. Ann. Phys. 1915, 352, 270
In Gans theory, the absorption is only dependent on the aspect ratio of the particles and not on the absolute dimensions. This dependence is introduced through so called polarization- or shape factors related to the three dimensions of the particle. For the case of spheroids, this reduces to only two different factors since the particle is rotational symmetric around one axis.
It is currently being applied in the field of nanotechnology to characterize silver and gold nanorods.Eustis, S., El-Sayed, M.A. J. Appl. Phys., 2006, 100, 044324 [tpl]cite doi|10.1063/1.2244520[/tpl] A popular alternative for this is the Discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method. Gans theory gives the exact solution for spheroidal particles; real nanorods, however, have a more cylindrical shape. Using DDA, it is possible to better model the exact shape of the particles. As the name suggests, this will only give an approximation.

"Rise Today" is a song recorded and performed by hard rock band Alter Bridge. The song was released as the first single in promotion of the band's second studio album, Blackbird. "Rise Today" is one of the band's most well-known songs.
The song is about making the world a better place ("I want to rise today/And change this world") and raises the question "Was the enemy just your brother all along?" Lyrically, it is one of the band's most uplifting songs. Singer Myles Kennedy plays lead guitar on "Rise Today" except for the ending guitar solo, which is performed by Mark Tremonti.
The song received heavy rotation in the media when it was featured in promos for the Season 6 premiere of CSI: Miami and in Fox's promo music video for the series premiere of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. In addition, "Rise Today" was named the official theme song to Unforgiven 2007.
Slash and Myles Kennedy, who have toured together in support of Slash's self-titled debut solo album, have covered this song on tour. Their version can be found on the rare live album Live in Manchester. Slash also joined Alter Bridge on stage in Stockholm on November 2, 2010 to perform the song, and has appeared on stage with Alter Bridge several times since. Alter Bridge has closed their concerts with this song since the release of Blackbird. "Rise Today" can be considered as the band's signature song.

[[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible, Hebrew Bible topics, Jewish history

Rabbinic Judaism recognizes the 24 books of the Masoretic Text, commonly called the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, as authoritative. Modern scholarship suggests that the most recently written are the books of Jonah, Lamentations, and Daniel, all of which may have been composed as late as the second century BCE.
The Book of Deuteronomy includes a prohibition against adding or subtracting,[tpl]bibleverse||Deut|4:2[/tpl][tpl]bibleverse||Deut|12:32[/tpl] which might apply to the book itself (i.e. a "closed book," a prohibition against future scribal editing) or to the instruction received by Moses on Mt. Sinai.McDonald & Sanders, ed., The Canon Debate, page 60, chapter 4: The Formation of the Hebrew Canon: Isaiah as a Test Case by Joseph Blenkinsopp.
The book of 2 Maccabees, itself not a part of the Jewish canon, describes Nehemiah (around 400 BCE) as having "founded a library and collected books about the kings and prophets, and the writings of David, and letters of kings about votive offerings" ([tpl]bibleverse-nb||2Macc|2:13–15|NRSV[/tpl]). The Book of Nehemiah suggests that the priest-scribe Ezra brought the Torah back from Babylon to Jerusalem and the Second Temple ([tpl]bibleverse-nb||Nehemiah|8–9[/tpl]) around the same time period. Both 1 and 2 Maccabees suggest that Judas Maccabeus (around 167 BCE) also collected sacred books ([tpl]bibleverse-nb||1Macc|3:42–50|NRSV[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse-nb||2Macc|2:13–15|NRSV[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse-nb||2Macc|15:6–9|NRSV[/tpl]). 
There is no scholarly consensus as to when the Hebrew Bible canon was fixed: some scholars argue that it was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty,Philip R. Davies in The Canon Debate, page 50: "With many other scholars, I conclude that the fixing of a canonical list was almost certainly the achievement of the Hasmonean dynasty." while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later.

CATEGORIES: Statistical terminology, Means, Exploratory data analysis

In statistics, the midhinge is the average of the first and third quartiles and is thus a measure of location.
Equivalently, it is the 25% trimmed mid-range or 25% midsummary; it is an L-estimator.
The midhinge is complemented by the H-spread, or interquartile range, which is the difference of the third and first quartiles and which is a measure of statistical dispersion, in sense that if one knows the midhinge and the interquartile range, one can find the first and third quartiles.
The use of the term "hinge" for the lower or upper quartiles derives from John Tukey's work on exploratory data analysis,Tukey, J.W. (1977) Exploratory Data Analysis, Addison-Wesley. ISBN 0-201-07616-0 and "midhinge" is a fairly modern term dating from around that time. The midhinge is slightly simpler to calculate than the trimean, which originated in the same context and equals the average of the median and the midhinge.

[[Public talks]]
CATEGORIES: Types of diplomacy

Public Talks is a new form of international dialogue that would be introduced into conflict-related negotiations only after conventional authorized private negotiations have failed.  The centerpiece of this worldwide communication process is a series of small, magazine-size "Challenge Documents." These communiques would be issues by each involved party—a country, rebel faction, etc. -- and would feature each side’s interpretation of the relevant conflict’s history, questions posed to the party’s adversary, current negotiating positions on  issues central to the dispute, and other content inherent to international conflicts.  Each Challenge Document  would then be published in—and distributed to the general population through—a handful of influential national and international newspapers and magazines. Additionally, these statements would be posted online, creating the potential for a worldwide audience to remain intimately informed on any developments. Public Talks is the sole active project of the Institute for Public Dialogue (IFPD).
The IFPD states on its website that the Public Talks process “is designed to be under the auspices of an organization that would shape the rules and terms of this level communication playing field. As to what organization should oversee this process, competing issues of legitimacy and function provide varying arguments for and against the U.N., Congressional committees, various established NGOs and other forums.”
The two fundamental intentions of Public Talks are a.) to resolve conflicts; and  b.) to influence public opinion.
The underlying motive for adversaries to engage in Public Talks is not an idealistic notion of goodwill, but rather recognition of the growing importance of public opinion.  Any involved party’s rejection of a Public Talks challenge would likely pose a risk of allowing for increased international acceptance of the adversary's interpretation of the conflict. Thus, relevant groups would be encouraged to engage in Public Talks to head off the potential for erosion of public support in their region and worldwide.  In this way, the soft power of American and world opinion would exert pressure on both sides to take incremental steps toward a compromise.
The IFPD asserts that Public Talks has potential to encourage progress in historical and developing conflicts such as those between Israel and Palestine, China and Taiwan, the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers (LTEE), India and Pakistan, and the United States—along with involved European allies—and Iran.
Public Talks is a sister project of the IFPD’s Print Debate concept, also created by Connolly, which seeks to encourage political candidates to debate one another in written form during domestic political campaigns.

The National City Bank Building at 55 Wall Street between William and Hanover Streets in the Financial District of downtown Manhattan, New York City, was built in 1836-41 as the Merchants' Exchange, replacing the previous exchange, which had opened in 1827 and burned down in the Great Fire of New York in 1835.[tpl]cite book |author= |title= The Picture of New-York, and Stranger's Guide to the Commercial Metropolis of the United States|url= https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t51g0vs4w;view=1up;seq=226|location= New York|publisher= A. T. Goodrich|date= 1828|isbn= |accessdate= December 3, 2013[/tpl], p. 206  The new building was designed by Isaiah Rogers in the Greek Revival style. The United States Custom House moved into the building in 1862 – with the conversion of the building overseen by William A. Potter – and occupied it until 1907, when it moved to the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House at 1 Bowling Green.
After the Custom House left, James Stillman, president of National City Bank (predecessor bank of Citibank), arranged for his company to buy the building from the government to be their headquarters.NHL Details Charles Follen McKim of McKim, Mead & White was engaged to enlarge the building, including removing the dome, adding four floors and a second colonnade and gutting the interior, the main floor of which McKim redesigned with William S. Richardson (1907-1910). The old main banking hall has been used as a ballroom and event space since 1998, and the remainder of the building is now condominium apartments.[tpl]cite aia5[/tpl], p.16
55 Wall Street became the new home of National City Bank on December 19, 1908 when the bank moved across the street from 52 Wall Street. Stillman ordered that the building's Ionic colonnade be preserved and that the interior be remodeled to look like the Pantheon in Rome.  van B. Cleveland, Harold and Huertas, Thomas F. Citibank 1812-1970 Harvard University Press, 1985 page 54  
55 Wall Street served as Citibank's global headquarters from 1908 to 1961, when it moved to the newly completed 399 Park Avenue, one of the earlier migrations by Wall Street commercial and investment banks from downtown to midtown Manhattan.http://www.nybookdistributors.com/wall_street/feature/citibank.html  Years after the headquarters move, 55 Wall Street continued as a full service retail branch (still carrying the moniker Branch # 001), as well as a substantial location for private banking operations. The building served as the headquarters for the law firm of Shearman & Sterling, lead counsel for Citibank and the Rockefeller family for decades.http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/realestate/commercial-property-55-wall-street-for-film-makers-least-lemon-becomes-plum.html?

Sykes was also a VFL footballer, playing 48 games of football for Fitzroy, and later coaching Shepparton, Benalla and Benalla & District Junior Football teams.  As well as being a member of parliament, Sykes and his wife Sally also run a beef cattle and sheep property just out of Benalla.

[[Henry G. Schermers]]
CATEGORIES: 1928 births, 2006 deaths, People from Epe, Dutch lawyers, Dutch jurists, Leiden University alumni, University of Amsterdam faculty, Leiden University faculty

Henricus Gerhard "Hein" Schermers (27 September 1928, Epe, Gelderland – 31 August 2006, Leiden) was a pioneering giant in three areas of law: International Institutional Law, the Law of the European Union and European Human Rights Law.  He played a key role in developing these subjects through his writings.  He was Professor of the Law of International Organisations at the University of Amsterdam, and then at the University of Leiden, where he had done his law studies.  
Amongst his notable books International Institutional Law and Judicial Remedies in the European Union are classics and have run into numerous editions.  Schermers was a prolific writer of case-books and articles.  Through his writing and teaching he influenced the development of his subjects.
Schermers first was a Legal Advisor at The Netherlands Foreign Ministry, and there began his contacts with international organisations.  The result was the book by which he made his first career, becoming an acknowledged expert in Public International Law with the publication of International Institutional Law.
Schermers then turned his attention to the emerging law of the European Economic Community and published widely in this field.  He became Director of the Europa Instituut at the University of Leiden and Executive Editor of the Common Market Law Review, the leading English-language journal in its field.  He also hosted the annual London-Leiden meetings, a closed invitation-only annual meeting which proved a fertile forum for discussing and developing the law of the European Communities.  The 2007 London-Leiden meeting was dedicated to his memory. Apart from his books, he wrote numerous articles and case-notes.
Schermers was appointed a member of the European Commission for Human Rights and developed what might be described as his third career (carried out in parallel with his other two), developing into one of the leading practitioners and scholars of European Human Rights law.  Again he wrote prolifically in this area.
Schermers received honorary degrees, decorations from The Netherlands and Belgium, and countless academic honours, including being appointed a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy.  He was the subject of a massive three-volume Festschrift.  He remained untouched by these distinctions: he was completely devoid of arrogance or pretension and was a role model for virtually all with whom he came into contact.  He was a superb teacher, and took infinite trouble with his students, and was legendary in his care for them.
Having retired from his Chair in Leiden, Schermers was appointed to a special Chair in order to continue his link with the University.  His final farewell lecture was attended by the leaders of Dutch academia and policy-makers, many of whom had been his colleagues or students.
Schermers was a scholar of genuine intellectual independence: at the time when all leading Dutch international law scholars without exception signed a document urging sanctions against South Africa and suggested that they were indeed required under public international law, he was the lone dissenter (on purely technical grounds) and in a highly controversial move, made his views public.  His views were attacked, but his intellectual honesty was respected.

[[Hey Negrita (song)]]

CATEGORIES: The Rolling Stones songs, 1976 songs, Songs written by Jagger/Richards, Music videos directed by Bruce Gowers, Song recordings produced by the Glimmer Twins

"Hey Negrita" is a song by The Rolling Stones that appeared on their 1976 album Black and Blue.
Credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Ron Wood apparently wrote the song's main riff, a piece of music he took with him to Munich's Musicland Studios where he and other guitarists were auditioning for the second guitarist slot left open after the departure of Mick Taylor.[tpl]cite web |last=Janovitz |first=Bill |title=Hey Negrita |work=allmusic |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t806685|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |accessdate=2006-07-31[/tpl] For his contribution, Wood would receive an "inspiration by" credit on the final album. In 2003, Wood recounted, "All of us, independently and together, were into reggae, and it was also a mood of the time. I had this particular lick that I took into the studio and the others said, What are we going to start with? and I said, I've got this song. Charlie Watts was sitting behind his kit, so he was already into it and then Keith and Mick both got into the motion of it. That was 'Hey Negrita', which came together very easily. The key to getting a song across in this band is never to try and write all the words. If you've got the rhythm, you're lucky! Let Mick write the words and then you're in with a chance."[tpl]cite web |last=| first = |title=Hey Negrita |work=timeisonourside.com |url=http://timeisonourside.com/SOHeyNegrita.html |accessdate=2006-07-31[/tpl]
In his review, Bill Janovitz says, "Negrita straddles Latin, reggae, and funk musical styles. Mick Jagger had been spending a lot of time in New York City and absorbing new elements of dance music, specifically Latin forms." Black and Blue is known for its heavy contribution from Stones recording and touring veteran Billy Preston, of which Janovitz says, "...Preston plays a very percussive Afro-Cuban-sounding piano part over the... riff." Also prominent is Ollie Brown (another veteran of the Stones' mid-1970s tours) who provides the song's heavily Latin-influenced percussion.
Of the song's substance, Janovitz says, "Jagger again chooses not to shy away from controversy... "Negrita," a Spanish term translating as "little black girl," was a pet name he had coined for his wife at the time, Bianca, a Latina. The song, however, is undeniably sexy, and Jagger is playing with the stereotypical Central and South American approaches to the battle of the sexes."
Janovitz concludes, "Mostly, though, the lyrics are meant to stay out of the way of the groove and are an excuse to throw in some fresh-sounding Spanish phrases. But the song did little to avoid the controversy the Stones continued to stoke..." This song, along with some of the promotional billboards for Black and Blue, were called out for their apparent sexist content directed towards women, a criticism not new to the Stones at the time. Jagger said at the time, "Hey Negrita. It's a compliment. I mean,  it's not a put down. I mean, what's the problem, the 'Hey' part? No, I think 'hey' will get past. What, you think colored people won't like it? Well... only the most sensitive ones. It's about South Americans, that's just what you say, you know? You say, hey negrita... one negri... negrota... you say to a lady one, a lady negress... hey negrita! In fact, it's been done, been said to my old lady, you see?"
While considered "splendid... edgy, funky" by Janovitz and popular among Stones fans, it is considered one of the songs that earned Black and Blue its unofficial title as the Stones' "jam album". Recorded in December, 1974 and in March and April 1975 at Munich and Mountain Recording Studios in Montreux, "Hey Negrita" features Jagger on lead vocals, Richards and Wood (lead) on guitars, Bill Wyman on bass, and Watts on drums. In addition to piano, Preston also performs organ and backing vocals with Richards and Wood.
"Hey Negrita" has only been performed live during the Tour of Europe '76, evidently because of the controversial lyrics (although one of the longtime mainstays of the band's shows, "Brown Sugar", has similar issues with its lyrics).

CATEGORIES: Timaru, Populated places in New Zealand

Washdyke is an industrial suburb in the north of Timaru, in south Canterbury, New Zealand. State Highway 1 passes through Washdyke on the way north out of the city. The northern terminus of State Highway 8 is in Washdyke.
Washdyke is home of Timaru's horse racetrack, which is named for the suburb's most famous former resident, champion racehorse Phar Lap.
The Main South Line railway passes through Washdyke, and it was formerly the location of a railway junction.  On 18 February 1874, construction began on a branch line to Pleasant Point; this line ultimately became known as the Fairlie Branch when it was opened past Pleasant Point to Fairlie in 1884.  Declining traffic led to the closure of the branch on 2 March 1968 and since then, the Main South Line has been the only railway through Washdyke.  Passenger services through Washdyke ceased on 10 February 2002 with the cancellation of the Southerner express that operated between Christchurch and Invercargill.
Slightly south of the suburb is Washdyke Lagoon, a medium-sized tidal lagoon which a variety of wading birds frequent.

The Whitney Museum of American Art original building is a collection of three 1838 rowhouses located at 8-12 West 8th Street between Fifth Avenue and MacDougal Street in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. In 1914, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney established the Whitney Studio Club at 8 West 8th Street adjacent to her own MacDougal Alley studio. The club was intended to be a place where young artists could exhibit their works.
In 1929, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art rejected Whitney's offer of a gift of new artworks that she had collected, Whitney established the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1931 she had architect Auguste L. Noel of the firm of Noel & Miller convert the three row houses at 8-12 West 8th Street into a gallery and residence for herself, and then, in 1936, into the museum's first home.  In 1954, the museum moved uptown to new quarters – eventually settling in 1966 at 945 Madison Avenue at East 75th Street – and the building, with the addition of #14 West 8th Street, an Italianate house built in 1853-54, became the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture.
The building is located within the Greenwich Village Historic District, established in 1969 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1992.[tpl]Cite journal|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Historic Landmark Nomination: Whitney Museum of American Art / New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture|702 KB[/tpl]|author=Avis Berman|date=December 2, 1991|publisher=National Park Service|postscript=[/tpl] and [tpl]PDFlink|Accompanying 26 photos, exterior and interipr, from 1906-1991|10.1 MB[/tpl]

[[Non-possessors]]

CATEGORIES: Christian theological movements, Russian Orthodox Church

Non-possessors ([tpl]lang-ru|нестяжатели[/tpl], nestyazhateli) belonged to a 16th-century movement in the Russian Orthodox Church in opposition to ecclesiastical land-ownership.  It was led by Nil of Sora and later Maximus the Greek and others and was opposed to the Josephites led by Joseph of Volokolamsk and later Archbishop Theodosius II of Novgorod.  It was finally defeated at the Stoglav Council in 1551.John Meyendorff, Rome Constantinople and Moscow: Historical and Theological Studies (Crestwood NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1996), 179-180.
The non-possessors are similar to other movements in Christianity, the Spiritual Franciscan for example, in that they believed that ownership of land and the Church's possession of wealth in general had corrupted the church.  The non-possessors also believed that the Church should not forcibly convert or persecute heretics or pagans, but should patiently work to convert them to the true faith.

[[Vetterli rifle]]
CATEGORIES: Rifles of Switzerland, Early rifles

The Vetterli rifles were a series of Swiss army service rifles in use from 1869 to circa 1890, when they were replaced with Schmidt-Rubin rifles. Modified Vetterli rifles were also used by the Italian Army.
The Swiss Vetterli rifles combined the American Winchester Model 1866's tubular magazine with a regular bolt featuring for the first time two opposed rear locking lugs . This novel type of bolt was a major improvement over the simpler  Dreyse  and  Chassepot bolt actions.  The Vetterli was  also the first repeating bolt action rifle to feature a self-cocking action and a small caliber bore. Due to the Swiss Federal Council's early 1866 decision to equip the army with a breechloading repeating rifle, the Vetterli rifles were, at the time of their introduction, the most advanced military rifles in Europe . The Vetterli was the replacement for Amsler-Milbank rifles, which were a metallic cartridge conversion from previous Swiss muzzle loading rifles.

Greg Neeld (born February 25, 1955 in Vancouver, British Columbia) is a retired ice hockey defenceman. He played for the Toronto Toros. He lost his left eye after being high-sticked in a junior game in 1973. Neeld became the first player (excluding goaltenders) to wear a facial shield in regular play. Neeld's injury brought attention to issue of ocular safety in ice hockey, and in Canada, facial protection was made mandatory for minor hockey by 1980.
He persevered with his dream to become a professional hockey player. He was drafted 71st overall in the fourth round of the 1975 NHL Amateur Draft by the Buffalo Sabres and 40th overall in the third round of the 1975 WHA Amateur Draft by the Minnesota Fighting Saints. He never played an NHL game, as the Sabres were not able to get around the rule that a player was required to be sighted in both eyes. However, Neeld appeared in 17 games with the Toronto Toros in the 1975-76 WHA season, registering only one assist. He spent part of the season in the NAHL, and the entirety of the next season. He played two more seasons in the International Hockey League (IHL) for four various teams before going to play in Europe after the 1978-79 season.  
Neeld is currently the CEO of a Vancouver-based mining exploration company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/Visors+should+mandatory+says+Greg+Neeld+should+know/4589725/story.html|title=Visors should be mandatory in the NHL, says Greg Neeld — and he should know|publisher=Vancouver Province|accessdate=2011-05-16|date=2011-04-09|author=Jim Jamieson[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 2007 singles, Paul Kelly (Australian musician) songs, 2007 songs, Songs written by Paul Kelly (Australian musician), EMI Records singles

"God Told Me To" is the first single from Australian songwriter Paul Kelly's album Stolen Apples.
The song deals with a fictional character called John Johanna, on trial for murder. To explain his actions, John defends himself by saying that God told him to do this. The song continues Paul Kelly's affair with using biblical imagery in his songs.
In an interview Kelly explains[tpl]quote|The way for me into a song often is to imagine someone speaking. Sometimes that's the way the song starts, once you get the voice of that character. God Told Me To is an angry song, imagining a character that's kinda crazy and then writing in that voice. He sees evil and needs to wipe it out. And that's a form of acting, writing that way.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22018071-5003425,00.html |title=Paul Kelly has no answers|publisher=The Courier-Mail|last=McMahon|first=Bruce|date=2007-07-07|accessdate=2008-09-03[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]|Paul Kelly|2007[/tpl]
Kelly explains that he borrowed the opening line - "My name is John Johanna" - from American folk antiquity but points out that John is also the name of the author of the Book of Revelation, the apocalyptic last book of the New Testament. [tpl]quote|The last verse of the song is pretty much directly from Revelation, which is sort of the text of fundamental Christianity. George Bush, the religious right in America, they're all over it.

[[4chan]]
CATEGORIES: 2channel, American websites, Community websites, Internet forums, Internet memes, Internet properties established in 2003, Internet trolling

4chan is an English-language imageboard website. Users generally post anonymously, with the most recent posts appearing above the rest. 4chan is split into various boards with their own specific content and guidelines.  Registration is not required, nor is it possible (except for staff).
Launched on October 1, 2003, its boards were originally used for the posting of pictures and discussion of manga and anime, as the site was modelled on Japanese imageboards. The site quickly became popular and expanded, though much of 4chan's content still features otaku, anime and other Japanese cultural influences.
The site has been linked to Internet subcultures and activism, most notably Project Chanology. 4chan users have been responsible for the formation or popularization of Internet memes such as lolcats, Rickrolling, "Chocolate Rain", Pedobear and many others. The site's "Random" board, also known as "/b/", was the site's first forum, and is the one that receives the most traffic.[tpl]cite web | url=http://projects.csail.mit.edu/chanthropology/4chan.pdf | title=4chan and /b/: An Analysis of Anonymity and Ephemerality in a Large Online Community | publisher=Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence | work=MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lboratory | year=2011 | accessdate=February 27, 2014 | author=Bernstein, M.

Gawker once jokingly claimed that "reading /b/ will melt your brain". The site's anonymous community and culture have often provoked media attention. For media planners, this enterprise is "further proof that creativity is everywhere and new media is less accessible" to advertisement agencies.[tpl]cite news|author=Unattributed|title=It's all about the money, stupid, not the latest online technology|newspaper=Marketing Week|page=13|date=August 7, 2008|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8246737/It-s-all-about-the.html|accessdate=February 4, 2009|postscript=[/tpl]
4chan has been instrumental in hijacking Internet destinations for pranks, so that, for example, images of Rick Astley appeared instead of the page that was searched for; the coordination of attacks against other websites and Internet users; and reactions to threats of violence that have been posted on the site. The Guardian once summarized the 4chan community as "lunatic, juvenile... brilliant, ridiculous and alarming."

Twenty Questions was a Canadian television game show, which aired on CTV in the 1961-62 television season. Produced by CJAY-TV in Winnipeg and hosted by Stewart Macpherson, the show was an adaptation of the earlier American game show Twenty Questions.
Panelists on the show included Rassy Ragland, the mother of Neil Young.
Twenty Questions was broadcast on Wednesday evenings, 19:30 in Toronto, beginning 4 October 1961. The programme lasted only a single season on CTV. Macpherson subsequently went on to host a British adaptation of Twenty Questions for Associated-Rediffusion.
Les Wedman, television columnist for The Vancouver Sun, deemed the production to be a "dull, witless presentation of a parlor sic game".[tpl]Cite news| title=TV - The Glass Eye | first=Les | last=Wedman | publisher=The Vancouver Sun | date=5 October 1963 | page=13 [/tpl]

"You Can't Win" is an R&B, pop and soul song performed by American recording artist Michael Jackson, who played Scarecrow in the 1978 musical film The Wiz,Jones (2002), pp. 229–259[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT127&dq=you-can-t-win+%22charlie+smalls%22&lr=&cd=13#v=onepage&q=you-can-t-win%20%22charlie%20smalls%22&f=false|title='Wiz' composer tapes LP|last=Radcliffe|first=Joe|date=March 25, 1978|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl] an urbanized retelling of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.Brooks, p. 30 The movie featured an entirely African American cast and was based on the 1975 Broadway musical The Wiz.
After the original soundtrack version was recorded, Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones went back into the studio and re-recorded the track. It was the re-recording that was released in January 1979 as the second single from The Wiz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, following the release of "Ease On Down the Road" in 1978, and was Michael's first solo chart single on Epic Records. The 7" version included "You Can't Win, parts 1 & 2". The full length version was released on 12" and was included on The Ultimate Collection in 2004.
The single only charted in the United States, where it reached number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 42 on the R&B singles chart. Since its release, the song has been well received by music critics. The song has been performed by contemporary singers such as Jill Scott and Charles Grigsby.
In 1982, part 2 of the song, in which Michael Jackson repeatedly sings "Can't Get Outta The Game", was dusted off, given a couple of vocal overdubs, was renamed "Can't Get Outta The Rain" and became the B-side of the first single of his landmark album Thriller: "The Girl Is Mine".

[[Quantum dimer models]]
CATEGORIES: Quantum Lattice models, Condensed matter physics, Statistical mechanics, Matching

Quantum dimer models were introduced to model the physics of resonating valence bond (RVB) states in lattice spin systems.  The only degrees of freedom retained from the motivating spin systems are  the valence bonds, represented as dimers which live on the lattice bonds.  In typical dimer models, the dimers do not overlap ("hardcore constraint").
Typical phases of quantum dimer models tend to be valence bond crystals.  However, on non-bipartite lattices,  RVB liquid phases possessing topological order and fractionalized spinons also appear.  The discovery of topological order in quantum dimer models (more than a decade after the models were introduced) has led to new interest in these models. 
Classical dimer models have been studied previously in statistical physics.

Pax Ting was the first Girl Guide and Girl Scout World Camp held after the formation of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. It was held in Gödöllő, Hungary from July 25 to August 7, 1939, and attended by some 5,800 Girl Guides from around the world.
At the 10th World Conference of Girl Guides which was held in Adelboden, Switzerland, it was decided to hold a world meeting for Girl Guides in 1939, following the example of the World Scout Jamborees. The site was chosen as Gödöllő in Hungary, where in 1933, the 4th World Scout Jamboree had been held. It was suggested calling the camp "Jamborina", but consultations had to be held with the World Organization of the Scout Movement about using this as the official name. Later, on the advice of Olave Baden-Powell the name Pax Ting (meeting of peace) was chosen. It was decided that 120 Girl Guides and 12 leaders from every country could take part. The minimum age for participation was 14 years, and the Girl Guides had to have achieved second class and a camping badge. The leaders had to have a camping diploma. In the year preceding the camp, Hungarian Girl Guides had learned foreign languages so as to be able to act as a guides and interpreters.  Archduchess Anna of Hungary, Prince Gustaf Adolf and Princess Sybilla of Sweden were also present at Pax Ting. Due to the threat of World War II, which broke out a month later, there were only 5800 girls from 32 countries present.
A set of four postage stamps was issued to celebrate Pax Ting. The 2f stamp has a hand raised in salute with an olive branch in background. The 6f stamp features the Hungarian Girl Guide insignia, composed of the Shield of Hungary, the Crown of St. Stephen and Lily. The 10f stamp shows the heads of two women. The 10f stamp features a dove with olive branch in front of a banner.

Fate Is the Hunter is a 1964 film about the crash of an airliner and the subsequent investigation: it was directed by Ralph Nelson and released by 20th Century Fox. It was nominally based on the bestselling 1961 novel Fate Is the Hunter by Ernest K. Gann, but the author was so disappointed with the result that he asked to have his name removed from the credits.  In his autobiography, A Hostage to Fortune, Gann wrote, "They obliged and, as a result, I deprived myself of the TV residuals, a medium in which the film played interminably."
The film stars Glenn Ford, Nancy Kwan, Rod Taylor, and Suzanne Pleshette.  It also features Jane Russell (playing herself entertaining for the USO in a flashback sequence), Nehemiah Persoff, Wally Cox, and Mark Stevens; it also includes an uncredited appearance by Dorothy Malone.  It also features an early film score by prolific composer Jerry Goldsmith.Clemmensen, Christian. "Jerry Goldsmith (1929-2004) tribute." Filmtracks.com. Retrieved: April 14, 2011.

Caseolus sphaerulus is a species of small land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk.
The specific epithet is spelled C. sphaerulus in both of the references here cited, however the species is also often referred to in reputable sources as C. sphaerula, for example in the Convention of Berne and the Habitats Directive. Here we are assuming these usages are in error, firstly because the Latin word "caseolus" is masculine, and also for reasons of consistency, because R.T.

[[Aluminium smelting]]
CATEGORIES: Metallurgical processes, Aluminium, Electrolysis

Aluminium smelting is the process of extracting aluminium from its oxide, alumina, generally by the Hall-Héroult process. Alumina is extracted from the ore bauxite by means of the Bayer process at an alumina refinery.
This is an electrolytic process, so an aluminium smelter uses prodigious amounts of electricity; they tend to be located very close to large power stations, often hydro-electric ones, and near ports since almost all of them use imported alumina. A large amount of carbon is also used in this process, resulting in significant amounts of GHG emissions.

Bertha Clayden was a British police officer. After the London Metropolitan Police's women police were reorganised in 1922 and most were dismissed, Clayden was put in charge of the twenty who remained, becoming the first attested female officer to hold the rank of Inspector. When Dorothy Peto was appointed Superintendent in charge of women police in 1930, Clayden remained as Woman Inspector at Bow Street. On 30 April 1934 she was promoted to Sub-Divisional Inspector, the first (and possibly only) woman to hold that rank, and became deputy to Peto at Scotland Yard. She seems to have eventually reached the rank of Chief Inspector. A motherly woman, her officers considered her to be far more approachable than the austere Peto.

[[Take a Pebble]]

CATEGORIES: Emerson, Lake & Palmer songs, Progressive rock songs, 1970 songs, Songs written by Greg Lake, Song recordings produced by Greg Lake

"Take a Pebble" is a song by the British progressive rock group Emerson, Lake & Palmer. It is the second track of their eponymous debut album. It was written by Greg Lake, and was arranged by the full band.
The song starts as a soft ballad... On the original recording it begins with Keith Emerson holding down voicings on the piano keys (without having the hammers strike the notes) while strumming the grand piano strings with a plectrum, while Greg Lake enters on electric bass guitar, and Carl Palmer on subtle percussion;
Emerson switches to fast Eb-Minor and F-Minor ascending and descending hand-over-hand piano runs (not to be confused with piano glissandos - See: Glissando) in the first 8 bars of the first "A" section (when Lake first enters singing "Just take a pebble... And cast it to the sea", etc.);
Emerson switches back to strumming the grand piano strings with a plectrum between the first and second "A" sections, while the bass and drums play;
Then, Emerson improvises behind Lake's singing in the first 8 bars of the second "A" sections;
A short piano interlude leads into a composed band jazz section - where the theme Lake has previously sung is developed and expanded much further;
Then on the original recording, another piano interlude leads into strumming the grand piano strings;
The short Greg Lake folk-style acoustic guitar section that follows in the middle of the original recording (where Lake briefly switches from playing electric bass guitar, with Palmer playing water-like percussion sounds, then a rhythmic hoedown-like strummed guitar chord section, with hand-clapping on 2 and 4, followed by plucked guitar arpeggios), gives an idea of what the original style of song may have sounded like, before Emerson's arrangement of the majority of the piece;
Then another piano interlude leads into a modal jazz band improvisation, followed by the "head out" and coda.
The jazz-style sections are reminiscent in some ways of Keith Emerson's late-1960s jazz-style adaptation for his band "The Nice" of "Hang On To A Dream" aka "How Can We Hang On to a Dream?" (composed by American folk musician Tim Hardin).
In later versions of "Take A Pebble", the Greg Lake song "Lucky Man" (and later, "Still, You Turn Me On" followed by "Lucky Man" - as recorded on Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends... Ladies and Gentlemen) was added to the Greg Lake folk-style acoustic guitar section, followed by a solo Keith Emerson jazz and blues piano medley of tunes (that the band would join in on the very end of), followed by a "Take A Pebble" band improvisation moving between F-minor and Eb-Minor (often featuring Palmer on Timpani), and then the conclusion of the piece.
The Greg Lake folk-style acoustic guitar section and/or the format of  inserting of other Greg Lake songs inside "Take A Pebble" was later completely dropped, and Emerson usually performs a shorter solo piano improvisation (not a medley of tunes) based on an F-minor ostinato, followed by the "Take A Pebble" band improvisation, and then the conclusion of the piece (as seen in the "Emerson, Lake & Palmer - Live at Montreux 1997" DVD).[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.eaglerockent.com/product/EE390409/Live+at+Montreux+1997|title=Live at Montreux 1997|publisher=eaglerockent.com|accessdate=February 11, 2012[/tpl]

New York State Route 99 (NY 99) was a state highway in Franklin County, New York, in the United States. The western terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 30 in Duane. Its eastern terminus was at a junction with NY 3 near the Franklin community of Merrillsville. NY 99 was known as the Port Kent–Hopkinton Turnpike and maintained by Franklin County, which co-designated the highway as County Route 26 (CR 26). The narrow, winding route passed through isolated and heavily wooded areas of Adirondack Park.
The routing of NY 99 was originally part of the Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike, a 19th-century toll road that began in the town of Hopkinton and passed through central Franklin County on its way to the hamlet of Port Kent on the shores of Lake Champlain. The portion of the turnpike between Duane Center and Merrillsville was designated as NY 99 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It remained unchanged until September 26, 1994, when the NY 99 designation was removed from the highway.

"A Beautiful Morning" is a song written by Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati and recorded by The Rascals. Coming out in early 1968, it was the group's first single released under that name rather than The Young Rascals.

The song was a big hit in the United States, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and also reaching number thirty-six on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart.[tpl]cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=482[/tpl] It was RIAA-certified as a Million Seller on June 28, 1968.

[[GP Challenge]]

Not to be confused with the similarly titled Grand Prix Challenge.

GP Challenge is a 1998 Formula One racing game by Midas Interactive Entertainment. The game features teams from the [tpl]f1|1998[/tpl] season, but the circuits are based on the [tpl]f1|1994[/tpl] season. From the games Main Menu: One can choose between a Single Race mode, or to go to the Options Menu.
In Single Race mode; one can choose from a selection of Four Circuits to race on, and the Grands Prix feature realistic schedules from a Formula One Race Weekend; Including: Friday Practice, Saturday Qualifying, and Sunday's Grand Prix.
Also in Single Race mode; One can choose to have a Four-Race Championship Season, but manual work from the player is required to undertake in this. After each GP is completed, the game subsequently shows the points each driver has gained for that race. However, the game does not add up the scores each driver gets over the course of the Four-Race season. Instead, players of the game must write down the scores each driver receives after each race, and then add them up manually at the end of the Final Race to see if they have become the Drivers World Champion.
The Four Race Championship Season consists of Rounds 10, 13, 14, and 16 from the [tpl]f1|1994[/tpl] season. These tracks are Hungary in Budapest*, Portugal in Estoril, Spain at Jerez, and Australia at Adelaide. The races consist of either 3 or 5 Laps, depending on the players preference; and one can choose from three modes of difficulty: Novice, Amateur and Professional.
The 1998 Teams are realistic in livery, but the drivers names are fictitious due to licensing arrangements; although the Drivers Helmet Livery's make it apparent to whom they are supposed to be. The game is similar to "Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II" in this sense.
The List of Drivers is as Follows:
Car Number: 2 
Team: Williams 
Driver: H.H.Frentzen
Driver Name on Game: T.Bailey
Car Number: 3
Team: Ferrari
Driver: M.Schumacher

David Waddington (1810– 12 October 1863Boase, F., Modern English biography, 6 vols, 1892-1921. Boase gives Waddington's date of death as somewhere between 1860 and 1863) was an English Conservative Party politician. He was born in Manchester the son of an iron founder.

Between the years of 1845-49 Waddington was Vice-Chairman of the Eastern Counties Railway and Chairman from 1851-56. He negotiated agreements to work most of the lines (that had been built by this point) in East Anglia creating a network of 565 miles by 1854.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal 154 page 24 "The Great Eastern Railway 1862 to 1865 Incorporation and early Challenges" - G Ashton(April 2013) He was  responsible for the takeover of the Eastern Union Railway in 1856 where his ability to drive a hard bargain caused the EUR chairman J Cobbold to remark "a strong minority of our Board consider that you have done us”.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dalling|first=G|title=David Waddington - a great survivor|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=August 1978|volume=19|page=20[/tpl]
He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Maldon from 1847 to 1852, for Harwich from 1852 to 1856. His election for the Maldon constituency is interesting in that he was at the time backing the construction of the Witham-Maldon branch line and a significant number of people working on the branch were registered to vote locally and a number of local people were employed on the works but this employment ceased the Tuesday after the election. Locally these men were known as "Waddington's Guinea Pigs"! A report published after the following election (by which time Waddington was standing in Harwich) was quite damning in its belated assessment of the 1847 election.[tpl]cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=P|title=The Witham - Maldon branch|journal=Great Eastern Railway Society Journal|date=July 1977|volume=11|page=5[/tpl]

Fantozzi (also known as White Collar Blues) is a 1975 cult Italian comedy movie. It is the first film in the saga of the unlucky Italian clerk Ugo Fantozzi, played by its creator, Paolo Villaggio.
Along with following Il secondo tragico Fantozzi, is considered the pinnacle of the series and it shows the involvement of actors who are likely to come into comic episodes: Plinio Fernando, Anna Mazzamauro and Gigi Reder, among others.
Fantozzi can be seen as symbol of the Italian middle class of the 70's, unhappy and frustrated at work and with family.
The success of this film and the saga that has generated has remained virtually unchanged through the years, contributing to credit Paolo Villaggio as one of the principal authors of comic films and actors of Italian cinema.The film was released on Italian cinemas on 27 March 1975.
The song of the closing credits, La ballata di Fantozzi, written by Leo Benvenuti, Piero De Bernardi and Fabio Frizzi, is sung by Paolo Villaggio.

Panchi (Urdu: پہنچی, literal English translation: "bird") is the debut studio album of the Pakistani progressive rock band Mizraab, released in April, 1999 on Sound Master. Mizraab's debut album is considered by many to be the first progressive rock album in Pakistan.
The album was recorded and composed by founder, lead vocalist and guitarist Faraz Anwar. According to Faraz, the album was an experiment in exploring new musical styles, as the album contains fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship blending with eastern classical music like the use of tablas and traditional Pakistani folk music elements. Panchi was not a commercial success. However, the release of the album earned the band a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim and thus the album was regarded as the first progressive rock album in the country.

"[tpl]lang-la|Incurvatus in se[/tpl]" (Turned/curved inward on oneself) is a theological phrase describing a life lived "inward" for self rather than "outward" for God and others.  
Paul the Apostle wrote of this condition in the Epistle to the Romans [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Rom|7:15[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Rom|7:8-19[/tpl]:
It was perhaps Augustine of Hippo who first coined the phrase incurvatus in se.[tpl]cite book|author=Matt Jenson|title=Gravity of Sin|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uwsRAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=16 November 2012|year=2006|publisher=T & T Clark|isbn=978-0-567-03138-9|accessdate=2012-11-17|accessdate=2012-11-17[/tpl] Martin Luther expounded on this in his Lectures on Romans and described this state as:
[tpl]quote|Our nature, by the corruption of the first sin, being so deeply curved in on itself that it not only bends the best gifts of God towards itself and enjoys them (as is plain in the works-righteous and hypocrites), or rather even uses God himself in order to attain these gifts, but it also fails to realize that it so wickedly, curvedly, and viciously seeks all things, even God, for its own sake."[tpl]citation|last=Johnston|first=Mark|title=Saving God|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xf8N_p2eqX4C&pg=PA80|accessdate=16 November 2012|date=6 July 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-14394-1|page=88|chapter=6|accessdate=2012-11-17[/tpl][/tpl]
This was later extended by Karl Barth to include other sins beyond pride. It is also believed that, even though people are justified by Jesus dying on the Cross, they still possess a propensity to sin against God because of this condition (i.e. simul justus et peccator).

CATEGORIES: Design museums, Types of museum

A design museum is a museum with a focus on product, industrial, graphic, fashion and architectural design.
Many design museums were founded as museums for applied arts or decorative arts and started only in the late 20th century to collect design.
The first museum of this kind was the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In Germany the first museum of decorative arts was the Deutsches-Gewerbe-Museum zu Berlin (now Kunstgewerbemuseum), founded in 1868 in Berlin.  

in 2010 opened the Design Museum Holon, in Tel Aviv, Israel.
Also some museums of contemporary or modern art have important design collections, like the MoMA in New York, the Centre Pompidou in Paris. 
A special concept has been realised in the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, in which four independent museums cooperate, one of them being Die Neue Sammlung - the largest design museum in the world.
Today corporate museums like the Vitra Design Museum, Museo Alessi or Museo Kartell play an important role.

[[Olympia Master]]

CATEGORIES: 5th-century BC Greek sculptors, Ancient Greek sculptors, Ancient Olympia

The Olympia Master is the name given to the anonymous sculptor responsible for the external sculpture of the Temple of Zeus, Olympia.Possibly also a porphyry head of Zeus, see J. Dorig, Une tête colossale en porphyre de le collection Burrell à Glasgow, Antike Plastik 15, 1975, p. 15. From what Pausanias tells us of the dates of the Temple, the Master and his workshop were active between 470 and 457 BCE Pausanias, 5.10.2 and 5.10.4. The two pediments and the series of metopes ascribed to him are the paradigmatic expression of the Early Classical or Severe style of 5th century Greek sculpture.
The site of the sanctuary was first systematically excavated by a French team in 1829Blouet, Expedition scientifique de Morée, vol I, 1831. then the German expedition headed by Georg Treu from 1875-81, and the results published in a 5 volume report by Ernst Curtius and Friedrich Adler, Olympia: Die Ergebnisse der von dem deutschen Reich veranstalteten Ausgrabung, 1892-7. The building  and sculpture had been shattered by an earthquake in antiquity and subsequently partially reused as building material, the rest buried under alluvial mud. The early classical sculptures did not initially attract as much attention as the later works such as the Nike of Paionios.  Since the first reconstruction of the pediments by Treu in 1897 and the rejection of Pausanias’s ascription to Paionios of Mende and Alkamenes on grounds of chronologyBy Richard Foerster, Alkamenes und die Giebelkompositionen de Zeustempels in Olympia, Rheinisches Museum 38, 1883, pp. 421-449. the temple decoration is now commonly attributed to the putative Olympia Master,The name was first coined by Ernst Buschor in Die Olympiameister, Athenische Mitteilungen, 51, 1926, pp. 163-170. one amongst a studio of five sculptors. 
The two gable ends and metopes exhibit a stylistic unity of strong rhythms and simple planes. The dress of the figures has not yet reached the naturalism of the mature classical, yet in the temple sculptures there is evidence of an experimentation not pursued by the younger Greek sculptors. The Olympia Master's work achieves a complexity of emotion that exceeds the conventions of the archaic; we find pathos, hubris, tension, exhaustion, disgust - markedly so in his characterization of Herakles, nuances lost to the idealised art of the later 5th century. The east pediment represents Pelops’s race against Oinomaos for the hand of Hippodamia, seemingly at the moment of the oath of the two contestants before Zeus himself.We also owe the naming of the subject matter to Pausanias, but this depiction evidently owes something to the 1st Olympian ode of Pindar dated 476 BCE. On the west we find Theseus and Perithoos fighting the Centaurs at the point of greatest violence in contrast to the instant of duplicitous tension on the east. Apollon in the center of the west pediment. The metopes depict the twelve labours of Herakles, a figure of singular importance to the temple, as it was he, a son of Zeus, who according to legend marked out the sanctuary and instituted the Olympic games. Traces of colour have been found on the sculpture and a case has been made that some of the detailing was painted on.Paul Rehak, Unfinished hair and the Installation of the Pedimental Sculptures of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, in Stephanos, Studies in Honor of Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, 1998. The arrangement of the Pediments remains a matter of dispute, and the subject of no fewer than 59 conjectured restorations.See HV Herrmann Die Olympia Skulpturen, 1987 and M-L Säflund, The East Pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, 1970, pp. 12-59, for a summary of the restorations of the East gable. The pediments are sculpted in the round albeit dowelled on to the pediment background and most backs are unfinishedl; some are hollow, presumably to save weight. They are of Paros marble with a few of the heads in pentelic marble, notably the heroes wear Attic and not Peloponnesian helmets. Several of the heads of the pediment figures have unworked bosses suggesting that a pointing process was used from clay or wood models, it is highly unusual to find traces of technique on work of the era.
The architectural decoration of Zeus’s temple is perhaps the only major monument from a significant studio of the Severe period to survive; consequently it is taken to be the summation of the Severe style from which other works in the idiom beg comparison. Several regional styles have been suggested as an origin for the artist including the Ionian, Peloponnesian and Laconian.These attributions are summarized in Dorig, Olympia Master.... pp. 6-7.

Jean Jacques Surian is a French painter born in 1942 in Marseille. He studied in Marseille and Paris and lives in Marseille. He carried out a lot of exhibitions since its first exposure in Marseille in 1965. He was inspired by the painters of its area, Cézanne, of course, and Vincent Van Gogh, but especially, he kept his freedom, illustrating magnificently that art is initially freedom to do something and to call it art… with the proviso of doing it with talent, inspiration and genius.
Recently it was noticed while exposing in 2004 a series of painting in Aix-en-Provence on the Divine Comedy of Dante (see some examples on fr:Wikipedia) and took part in 2006 in "the Cézanne year" with an exposure to the museum of the tapestries of Aix-en-Provence, where it reinterpreted the work of the Master of Aix, with much of affection, freedom and creative intelligence. The town of Aix en Provence required of him to carry out an earthenware work and high relief in likings with the workshops "Décoramic" and P. Architta, to mark the year Cézanne 2006. It is intended to be installed on a pinion wall of the city in June 2007.

[[The Stonebreaker]]
CATEGORIES: 1857 paintings, English paintings, Collections of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Paintings of the Walker Art Gallery Liverpool, Paintings by Henry Wallis

The Stonebreaker is an 1857 oil-on-canvas painting by Henry Wallis. It depicts a manual labourer who appears to be asleep, worn out by his work, but has actually been worked to death.
The painting was first exhibited in 1858 at the Royal Academy in London and was highly acclaimed. Many viewers assumed the man was sleeping, worn out by his day of hard but honest labour. Wallis gave no outright statement that the man depicted was dead, but there are many suggestions to this effect. The frame was inscribed with a line paraphrased from Tennyson's A Dirge (1830): "Now is thy long day's work done"; the muted colours and setting sun give a feeling of finality; the man's posture indicates that his hammer has slipped from his grasp as he was working rather than being laid aside while he rests, and his body is so still that a stoat, only visible on close examination, has climbed onto his right foot. The painting's listing in the catalogue was accompanied by a long passage from Thomas Carlyle's "Helotage", a chapter in his Sartor Resartus, which extols the virtues of the working man and laments that "thy body like thy soul was not to know freedom".
Wallis is believed to have painted The Stonebreaker as a commentary on the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 which had formalised the workhouse system for paupers and discouraged other forms of relief for the poor. The able-bodied poor were forced into long hours of manual labour in order to qualify for the lodgings and food provided by the workhouse and the gruelling work sometimes resulted in the death of the workers. Carlyle's accompanying passage also has strong words for supporters of the workhouses:
It was later claimed that by this painting, Wallis moved away from the Pre-Raphaelite principles towards those of an early Victorian Social Realism.J. Treuherz: Hard Times: Social Realism in Victorian Art (London, 1987), pp. 36–39. However, for Wallis' contemporaries, The Stonebreaker consolidated his reputation as a true Pre-Raphaelite.Robin Hamlin: Henry Wallis, in: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, vol. 57, London 2004, p. 14.
The dead man wears the smock of an agricultural labourer which suggests that in former times  he would have been employed year-round on a farm. Changing social conditions have robbed him of his employment and forced him instead to accept the charity of the workhouse and the arduous job of flint-knapping to produce material for the roads.
The painting provides a strong contrast with John Brett's painting of the same name, completed the year after Wallis's version. Brett's Stonebreaker shows another pauper breaking rocks, but this time it is a smartly dressed, well-nourished boy, accompanied by a playful puppy, working away in a bright, sunlit landscape. Brett's painting made his reputation. The details are captured with a scientific accuracy, and the painting was lauded by the art critic John Ruskin. It too makes a statement about the poor, although it lacks the hopelessness and finality of Wallis's painting, just as in Wallis's version there is an underlying realism that is not at first obvious: the boy is rosy-cheeked not because of healthy exercise, but because of the work he is forced to undertake; the puppy cavorts happily, but the boy, working for the chance of receiving charity, cannot afford to stop to play.  Brett's painting is in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.
Although Wallis's technique was admired, his choice of subject divided the critics. The Illustrated London News found it shocking and offensive while The Spectator said it embodied "the sacredness and solemnity which dwell in a human creature, however seared, and in death, however obscure".

William Adams (April 17, 1885 – April 6, 1957) was an English cricketer. He was a left-handed batsman who played first-class cricket for Northamptonshire. He was born in Staple Claydon and died in Ashton, Northamptonshire.
Adams had represented Buckinghamshire on six occasions in the Minor Counties Championship from 1911 to 1913, making his debut as an opening order batsman but moving down the order upon several substandard batting performances.
Adams did not play another cricket match until the 1920 season, when he made his County Championship debut at the age of 35 for Northamptonshire, batting extensively throughout the next two seasons, though the team would struggle for decent form in the two years in which he played. Following the close of the 1921 season, Adams spent five years out of the game, returning in an innings victory against Dublin University in 1926.
Adams played regularly in the County Championship during 1927, though Northamptonshire had still made little progress in the league, finishing second bottom. Over the next two years, before making his exit from the game, Adams played just two first-class games, quitting in 1929.
He scored 2 first class centuries, with a best of 154 not out against Hampshire.

The Red-throated Thrush is a migratory Asian species. Its range overlaps with the more westerly-breeding Black-throated Thrush. It is a large thrush with a plain grey back and reddish underwings. The adult male has a red throat. Females and young birds lack the bib, but have black-streaked underparts. This bird species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

Charles Addis (February 2, 1902 – August 15, 1983) was an English cricketer. He was a left-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler who played first-class cricket for Northamptonshire. He was born in Finedon and died in Northampton.
Addis made his debut during the 1924 season, playing against Dublin University, against whom he took three wickets with the ball. His contribution with the bat, an innings of 38 from eighth in the batting order, was to prove the only time he would take to the field with a bat in his hand. Northamptonshire beat their university opponents by an innings margin.
Addis's second and final first-class appearance came against the very same team almost exactly two years later, with the same end result, thanks to century innings from team-mates William Adams and John Timms. Addis took one wicket in the first innings of the match, and in the second, bowled four overs, conceding just one run.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Idah ([tpl]lang-la|Idahin(us)[/tpl]) is a diocese located in the city of Idah, Kogi State in the Ecclesiastical province of Abuja in Nigeria.
Idah is located along the Niger river in Kogi State of Nigeria. The diocese of Idah largely embodies the Igala and Bassa ethnic groups, who live in the Igala Kingdom ruled by the Attah of Igala, along the Niger and Benue rivers, below their confluence, around Lokoja.
The diocese was first evangelized by the Spiritans (Congregatio Sancti Spiritus C.S.Sp a.k.a. Holy Ghost) priests. The first missionary to the diocese was Father Joseph Liechtenberger who was sent to the area in 1902, and later missionaries of the same order including Irish bishop Joseph Shanahan were the progenitors of the first Catholic mission in Dekina. By 1905, this mission closed as a result of the hostility of the local community, constituted mainly of Muslim communities.
Bishop Shanahan, the ordinary of Onitsha archdiocese, called upon the German spiritans working in the then Benue Province to collaborate in reopening the Igala area to Catholicism. Fr. Anthony Konrath, a German Spiritan reopened Catholicism in the area around 1932, operating out of Utonkon.  He engaged in vigorous pastoral ministrations, visiting Ankpa and its vicinities such as Imane and Ojoku, celebrating masses for Catholic soldiers at the old Ankpa military barrack, Catholic residents, and traders, especially of Igbo stock, residing within the area. He also visited and introduced Catholicism into adjoining areas. Eventually reaching Idah, in 1934 Fr. Konrath and his associates set up camp, establishing Idah as the headquarters of their Catholic operations, the first parish in what became Idah diocese.
The Cathedral church in Idah is named after the German missionary and bishop St. Boniface. The diocese of Idah continues to have a link with Germany, especially the diocese of Fulda, a diocese since 1990 has helped to train seminarians and priests for Idah diocese, and undertaken various ecclesial initiatives and social projects.
The Second World War truncated the German missionary efforts in this area. They were arrested and interned in the Caribbean, as Nigeria was a British territory. At the end of the war they were returned to Germany, being replaced by English and Irish missionary priests from the Benue Province and later Nsukka area. Nigerian indigenous missionaries, such as the bishops John Cross Anyogu and Anthony Nwedo also carried out missionary activities.
The Spiritan priests from Canada (mainly from around the Montreal, Quebec region) continued as missionaries there and in the neighboring diocese of Lokoja in the 1950s, building ecclesiastical structures and institutions. The Canadian missionaries provided personnel and material resources until the indigenous clergy and religious began to take over pastoral responsibilities; some Canadians remained.
Apart from priests, there are many religious orders of women and men in Idah diocese. While some of these orders, such as the Holy Rosary sisters and Congregatio Sancti Spiritus (Holy Ghost sisters) in Ankpa, Inyano, and Ogugu, are old, and possess a relatively long ecclesial history in providing pastoral, social and healthcare services alongside the Canadian missionary priests, Bishop Obot brought Nigerian-founded religions congregations into the diocese, especially of women, such as the Handmaid of the Holy Child Jesus (HHCJ) in Idah and Okpo; the Daughters of Divine Love (D.D.L.) in Egume, Imane, and Idah; the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy (D.M.M.M.) in Sheria, Abejukolo, and Ayangba. The order of Discalded Carmelites nuns also established their community in Okura, in 2000.
The Marist Brothers of Schools have also had a long history in the diocese teaching at the Our Lady of Schools, Ayangba. A women's religious congregation, Marist Missionary Daughter of the Society of Jesus the Good Shepherd, though founded as a Pious Association in Uturu, Okigwe in 1989, received canonical approval from Bishop Ephraim Silas Obot on November 27, 2000 at the Holy Cross Parish, Dekina. Marist Brother Thomas Ezeaku established a school,with the approval and support of Obot, patterned upon the model of the Marist Brothers Secondary School in Uturu, Okigwe, in Ejule and Ayangba.
Prior to Obot's arrival two Nigerian priests, later bishops, John Cross Anyogu and Anthony Nwedo, were active in the area as missionaries in the 1940s and 1950s.
Equally, the church of Idah has embraced lovingly and cordially within its prebystery priests whose natal origines emanate from other Nigerian regions or dioceses. Idah dioceses have priests with hometowns from such places as Achi in Oji River, Enugu State, Nsukka area of Enugu State, Agenebode in Edo State, Igarra in Edo State, Idoma area of Benue State, Owerri in Imo State, Awka, Enugu Agidi, and Enugu-Ukwu in Anambra State among many areas and dioceses of Nigeria.
The church in Idah diocese continued to grow, with more priestly and religious vocations, under the leadership of Obot, its first Bishop (from December 1977 to April 2009).
a member of the Missionary Society of St. Paul, Auxiliary Bishop Anthony Adaji, M.S.P., was named auxiliary bishop of the diocese on June 28, 2007. Following the death of Bishop Obot, Adaji was named by the Holy See the Second Bishop and incumbent ordinary on June 1, 2009.

CATEGORIES: Villages in Hampshire

Brambridge is a village in the parish of Colden Common in the Winchester District in Hampshire, England, north east of Eastleigh and close to the River Itchen. It lies in the south of Twyford civil parish.
The hamlet of Brambridge was granted by Bishop Richard Foxe to the newly founded Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in the sixteenth century. In 1609-10, Brambridge, with other lands, belonging to three recusants, Ursula Uvedale, Richard Bruning and Thomas Welles was granted to John Pierson. Charles I granted Brambridge to Gilbert Welles in 1636 and the property remained in the Welles family until the late eighteenth century, when it passed to a cousin, Walter Smythe.
In the 17th century, the Welles were determined recusants and Swithun Wells was hanged for his faith in 1591. The house was once a refuge for Roman Catholic priests and the family assisted in the clandestine burials of Catholics in the local churchyard.
Brambridge House was the birthplace of Maria Anne Fitzherbert, Walter Smythe's eldest daughter, and the home of the High Sheriff of Hampshire. There has been a house on the site since the 16th century, although the current building was constructed after the old house burnt down in 1872. One of the rooms in the old Brambridge House was consecrated as a Roman Catholic chapel, but after the first of the Catholic Relief Acts, a small chapel was built in the village and endowed by Mrs. Fitzherbert in about 1782.

[[Speech production]]
CATEGORIES: Language, Phonetics, Motor control, Phonation, Human voice, Speech

Speech production is the process by which spoken words are selected to be produced, have their phonetics formulated and then finally are articulated by the motor system in the vocal apparatus. Speech production can be spontaneous such as when a person creates the words of a conversation, reaction such as when they name a picture or read aloud a written word, or a vocal imitation such as in speech repetition.
Speech production is not the same as language production since language can also be produced manually by signs.
In ordinary fluent conversation people pronounce each second roughly four syllables, ten or twelve phonemes and two to three words out of a vocabulary that can contain 10 to 100 thousand words.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~rmk7/HC/HC_Readings/Levelt.pdf |pmid=10354575|year=1999|last1=Levelt|first1=WJ|title=Models of word production.|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01319-4[/tpl] Errors in speech production are relatively rare occurring at a rate of about once in every 900 words in spontaneous speech.[tpl]cite journal|author=Garnham, A, Shillcock RC, Brown GDA, Mill AID, Culter A|year=1981|url=http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/15615/1/6017.pdf|title= Slips of the tongue in the London–Lund corpus of spontaneous conversation|journal=Linguistics |volume=19|pages=805–817|doi=10.1515/ling.1981.19.7-8.805|issue=7–8[/tpl] Words that are commonly spoken or learned early in life or easily imagined are quicker to say than ones that are rarely said, learnt later in life or abstract.[tpl]cite journal|author=Oldfield  RC, Wingfield  A|year=1965|title=Response latencies in naming objects|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=17|pages=273–281|doi=10.1080/17470216508416445|pmid=5852918|issue=4[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/33/1/73.full.pdf|pmid=11296722|year=2001|last1=Bird|first1=H|last2=Franklin|first2=S|last3=Howard|first3=D|title=Age of acquisition and imageability ratings for a large set of words, including verbs and function words|volume=33|issue=1|pages=73–9|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers|doi=10.3758/BF03195349[/tpl]
Normally speech is created with pulmonary pressure provided by the lungs that generates sound by phonation in the glottis in the larynx that then is modified by the vocal tract into different vowels and consonants. However speech production can occur without the use of the lungs and glottis in alaryngeal speech by using the upper parts of the vocal trait. An example of such alaryngeal speech is Donald Duck talk.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=5163900|year=1971|last1=Weinberg|first1=B|last2=Westerhouse|first2=J|title=A study of buccal speech|volume=14|issue=3|pages=652–8|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Research|bibcode=1972ASAJ...51Q..91W|doi=10.1121/1.1981697[/tpl]
The vocal production of speech can be associated with the production of synchronized hand gestures that act to enhance the comprehensibility of what is being said.[tpl]cite book|author=McNeill D|year=2005|title=Gesture and Thought|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-51463-5[/tpl]

Barbara Lilian Kelley MBE (26 August 1920 – 2 March 1998) was a British police officer with the London Metropolitan Police. She was the first woman in the country to be promoted to the rank of Detective Chief Superintendent.
Kelley was born in Bridgwater, Somerset. She enlisted in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) on 6 June 1940 and was discharged with the rank of Sergeant on 17 January 1946. She was Mentioned in Despatches on 8 August 1944.
She joined the Metropolitan Police on 2 December 1946. In the late 1940s, she served as a Detective Constable at West End Central Police Station with Shirley Becke, later to become the first female Commander in the Metropolitan Police. The two officers persuaded their Divisional Detective Inspector to allow them to serve on all cases instead of the limited range of cases (mainly involving women and children) to which women detectives had previously been restricted. This paved the way to full integration of female detectives. By 1972 Kelley had reached the rank of Chief Superintendent and was serving in the Murder Squad at Scotland Yard.
Kelley was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1973 New Year Honours.[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=45860 |date=29 December 1972|startpage=15 |supp=yes[/tpl] She retired in August 1975.

The provisional government of Israel ([tpl]lang-he-n|הַמֶמְשָׁלָה הַזְמַנִּית[/tpl], translit. HaMemshela HaZmanit) was the temporary cabinet which governed the Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine, and later the newly-established State of Israel, until the formation of the first government in March 1949 following the first Knesset elections in January that year.
It was formed as Minhelet HaAm ([tpl]lang-he-n|מנהלת העם[/tpl], lit. People's Administration) on 12 April 1948, in preparation for independence just over a month later. All its members were taken from Moetzet HaAm (People's Council), the temporary legislative body set up at the same time. On 12 May, Minhelet HaAm convened to vote on whether to declare independence. Three of the members were missing; Yehuda Leib Maimon and Yitzhak Gruenbaum were stuck in Jerusalem, whilst Yitzhak-Meir Levin was in the United States.
The meeting started at 1:45 and ended after midnight. The decision was between accepting the American proposal for a truce, or declaring independence. The latter option was put to a vote, with six of the ten members present supporting it:
On 14 May, the day Israel declared independence, Minhelet HaAm was converted into the Provisional government, whilst Moetzet HaAm became the Provisional State Council.

The team was founded in 1980 by Vic Dasaro, an American veterinary student attending university in Parma. Dasaro created the team from an amalgam of power lifters from a local high school gym, ex-rugby players, other vet students, and a mixed bunch of soccer goalies, track and field athletes, and local kids who had seen football on the occasional TV broadcast and liked the helmet and shoulderpad look. The team is now built on longtime IFL veterans and young players from the Panthers' own youth teams, with still a healthy contingent of University of Parma students.
In 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 Panthers won the title of Italian champion by beating respectively Catania Elephants, Bologna Warriors, Catania Elephants and Milano Seamen.

Tarff Rovers F.C. are a defunct football club from Kirkcowan in Wigtownshire, Scotland.
One of Scotland's oldest clubs, they were formed in 1874 and were full members of both the Scottish Football Association and the Southern Counties Football Associations. Having full SFA status entitled Rovers to compete in the Scottish Qualifying Cup South competition and, on occasion, play in the Scottish Cup proper.
The club's finest hour came in 1967 when they faced Scottish League side Alloa Athletic in the Scottish Cup. This home tie saw Tarff triumph by one goal to nil. Despite belonging to a remote and sparsely populated part of Scotland - indeed Kirkcowan's current population is less than 400 - Tarff enjoyed certain periods of success. Perhaps the most notable of these came during their final few years of existence when several league titles, cup wins and big name signings, including Chic Charnley and Rowan Alexander, came the way of Tarff Rovers thanks to a local businessman's financial assistance.
Despite their recent successes in football in southern Scotland, the club folded in 2003 when local interest quickly dwindled to the point where a committee could not be formed. The club's home ground Balgreen Park still exists and is currently used by local Sunday league side Kirkcowan Wanderers.

The Statenvertaling (Dutch for States Translation) or Statenbijbel (Dutch for States Bible) is the first Bible translation from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek languages to the Dutch language, ordered by the government of the Protestant Dutch Republic first published in 1637.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bijbelsdigitaal.nl/statenvertaling-1637/ |title=Statenvertaling (1637) |publisher=Nederlands Bijbel Genootschap BijbelsDigitaal.nl |accessdate=2010-06-04 |language=Dutch[/tpl]
The first complete Dutch Bible was printed in Antwerp in 1526 by Jacob van Liesveldt.Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juhász, Guido Latré (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, ISBN 2-503-51411-1, p. 120. This translation and other existing Dutch Bibles were merely translations of other translations. Furthermore, the translation from Martin Luther was widely used, but it had a Lutheran interpretation. At the Synod of Dort in 1618/19, it was therefore deemed necessary to have a new translation, accurately based on the original languages in imitation of the King James Bible from 1611. The synod requested the States-General of the Netherlands to commission it.
In 1626 the States-General accepted the request from the Synod and the translation started. It was completed in 1635 and authorized by the States-General in 1637. From then until 1657 half-a-million copies were printed. This translation remained authoritative in Protestant churches well into the 20th century.
The source material for the Old Testament of the Statenvertaling was the Masoretic Text. The New Testament was translated from the Textus Receptus.

[[Texas Terri]]
CATEGORIES: Living people, Female punk rock singers, 1955 births

Texas Terri, (born Terri Laird, April 6, 1955) is a punk rock singer and songwriter originally from Austin, Texas. She has been in the rock 'n' roll business for over two decades.
Texas Terri has been compared to Iggy Pop, Lux Interior, Mick Jagger and Wendy O Williams amongst others by the music press[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]. Like Williams, she has developed a reputation for wild, scantily clad stage antics including regular performances where she would rip off her shirt to only be censored by electrical tape reading 'TXT' (her preferred shortening of her name). She also performed in black underwear.
Laird grew up in Fort Worth, Texas and claims to have spent time in front of the mirror practicing to be a rock star from as young as six years old[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl].
In Hollywood, California in 1984 she formed trash rock band The Killer Crows. After their break-up and a three year break she formed Texas Terri & The Stiff Ones with Don "Demon Boy" Cilurso who became her song writing partner. They released one album in 1998 Eat Shit on the Burning Tree label. Eat Shit has subsequently been re-released twice as Eat Shit +1 and more recently Eat Shit +4, the + number signifying the number of bonus tracks on each re-release. The band achieved a sizable cult status in America and Europe over the course of their six year together.
When Cilurso left the band because of 'personal problems' Texas Terri chose to change the name to 'Texas Terri Bomb!'. Under this name she has released the Your Lips...My Ass! album which was produced by remounted rock producer Jack Douglas and featured a guest appearance by Wayne Kramer of the MC5 (though she claims she originally wanted Lemmy Kilmister to appear on the track)[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl].

CATEGORIES: 1752 births, 1828 deaths, English composers, Classical-period composers, People from Dorking

John Marsh (31 May 1752 – 31 October 1828) was an English music composer, born in Dorking, England. A lawyer by training, he is known to have written at least 350 compositions, including at least 39 symphonies. While today known primarily for his music, he also had strong interest in other fields, including astronomy and philosophy, and wrote books about astronomy, music, religion, and geometry.
Marsh lived in Dorking, Gosport, Romsey, Salisbury and Canterbury before settling in Chichester in 1787 until his death in 1828.  As a concert organizer, he was responsible for the music making in the towns and cities where he worked, especially in Chichester, where he led the subscription concerts for some 35 years.
Marsh was perhaps the most prolific English composer of his time. His own catalog of compositions records over 350 works, of which he lists 39 symphonies. Of these, only the nine that Marsh had printed are extant, together with three one-movement finales.
Marsh was a man of varied interests, and his 37 volumes of journals are among the most valuable sources of information on life and music in 18th-century England.  They represent one of the most important musical and social documents of the period.  It remained unpublished until the first volume was published in 1998.  In one passage, Marsh describes the great Handel Commemoration of 1784 in London.
Marsh's son was poet and cleric Edward Garrard Marsh.

CATEGORIES: 1911 births, 1995 deaths, British electronics engineers, Computer hardware engineers, People associated with Bletchley Park

Allen William Mark (Doc) Coombs (23 October 1911 – 30 January 1995) was a British electronics engineer at the Post Office Research Station, Dollis Hill. He was one of the principal designers of the Mark II or production version of the Colossus computer used at Bletchley Park for codebreaking in World War II, and took over leadership of the project when Tommy Flowers moved on to other projects.
Later, he headed the scientific side of R14, the division working on optical character recognition for postal mechanisation, which moved to the new BT Research Centre at Martlesham in Suffolk. His work on pattern recognition led to the development of an early postcode-reading machine.
He frequently lectured on pattern recognition using the concept of multi-dimensional space, and the 'caltrop', and would demonstrate the presence of feature-detection in the human visual system by means of a flash gun, the persistence of vision in the audience leading them to observe disintegration of a character fragment by fragment. 'Doc' Coombs was notable for a facial 'tic', which gave him something of the appearance of the 'mad professor', and these days would probably be classed under Tourette's syndrome.

Loft Story was a Quebec television series broadcast on the TQS television network, and was an adaptation of the show Loft Story in France, which itself was an adaptation of the Big Brother franchise. TQS became V and replaced Loft Story with a new Big Brother series for Quebec in 2010.
During the first season (2003), the show had TVA's Occupation Double as its main competitor, and was a success in terms of viewership, but was not as financially successful as the French version.  Therefore, the program was discontinued the following season, but was resurrected three years later in January 2006. In response to criticism of year 1, year 2 toned down the sexual content and replaced it with daily games and truth/dare events.  The loft was also changed to include a "stunt room" the size of a basketball court, which serves for games and entertainment.   A third season started in September 2006, a fourth on September 26, 2007, a fifth in Fall 2008 and an All-Star season subtitled La Revanche in Spring 2009.

[[Oxus Treasure]]

The Oxus treasure is a collection of about 180 surviving pieces of metalwork in gold and silver, the majority rather small, plus perhaps about 200 coins, from the Achaemenid Persian period which were found by the Oxus river about 1877-1880.Curtis, 5 The exact place and date of the find remain unclear, and it is likely that many other pieces from the hoard were melted down for bullion; early reports suggest there were originally some 1500 coins, and mention types of metalwork that are not among the surviving pieces. The metalwork is believed to date from the sixth to fourth centuries BC, but the coins show a greater range, with some of those believed to belong to the treasure coming from around 200 BC.Curtis, 48, 57-58 The most likely origin for the treasure is that it belonged to a temple, where votive offerings were deposited over a long period. How it came to be deposited is unknown.Curtis, 58-61
As a group, the treasure is the most important survival of what was once an enormous production of Achaemenid work in precious metal.  It displays a very wide range of quality of execution, with the many gold votive plaques mostly crudely executed, some perhaps by the donors themselves, while other objects are of superb quality, presumably that expected by the court.Curtis, 23-46, 57; Yamauchi, 340-341
The British Museum now has nearly all the surviving metalwork, with one of the pair of griffin-headed bracelets on loan from the Victoria and Albert Museum, and displays them in Room 52. The group arrived at the museum by different routes, with many items bequeathed to the nation by Augustus Wollaston Franks.  The coins are more widely dispersed, and more difficult to firmly connect with the treasure.  A group believed to come from it is in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Peterburg, and other collections have examples.Curtis, 48

Hula Dancer (foaled 1960 in Kentucky) was an American-bred French-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. She was sired by Native Dancer, the 1952 and 1954 United States Horse of the Year and a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. Owner Gertrude Widener raced Ambrose Light in France and brought him to the United States to stand at stud where he sired Hula Dancer's dam, Flash On.
Gertrude Widener sent Hula Dancer to trainer Etienne Pollet at his stables at Chantilly Racecourse in France. Racing as a two year old in 1962, she defeated colts while winning the Prix de la Salamandre and the Grand Critérium, two of France's most important races for her age group.
At age three, Hula Dancer raced both in France and in England where she again defeated colts on a regular basis as well as older horses in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. The highlight of her 1963 racing campaign was a victory in the British Classic, the 1,000 Guineas.
Hula Dancer was the first racehorse of her sex to win over 100,000 pounds in Europe. The quality of horses she beat is evidenced by the fact that every one of her six conditions race wins are now Group 1 events.
Hula Dancer was retired to broodmare duty in France.  In 1968, Raymond Guest paid a European auction record price of 1.02 million French francs for her. She was shipped to the United States in 1970. Hula Dancer met with limited success as a broodmare.

Awake Zion is a 2005 documentary by Monica Haim that documents a connection between Jews and Rastafarians. Rasta is a religious movement that came out of Jamaica. The followers accept Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia as God incarnate, grow their hair in dreadlocks and smoke cannabis for religious purposes. Jews trace their history back to the Holy Land of Israel and look to the Torah for instruction. Although Jews and Rastas appear different, both claim figures from the Old Testament as their forefathers, both send a message of truth and love to their followers, both speak of Zion, both have integrated their beliefs into their lifestyles and Rastafarians also claim to be descended from the children of Israel. Haim, who relates to and enjoys both cultures, raises the question, "if we're both identifying with the same things, are we not then identifying with one another?"

[[Marsh funnel]]
CATEGORIES: Drilling fluid, Viscosity, Petroleum engineering

The Marsh funnel is a simple device for measuring viscosity by observing the time it takes a known volume of liquid to flow from a cone through a short tube.  It is standardized for use by mud engineers to check the quality of drilling mud.  Other cones with different geometries and orifice arrangements are called flow cones, but have the same operating principle.right|thumb|A modern plastic Marsh Funnel
In use, the funnel is held vertically with the end of the tube closed by a finger.  The liquid to be measured is poured through the mesh to remove any particles which might block the tube.  When the fluid level reaches the mesh, the amount inside is equal to the rated volume.  To take the measurement, the finger is released as a stopclock is started, and the liquid is allowed to run into a measuring container.  The time in seconds is recorded as a measure of the viscosity.

[[Pressure angle]]

CATEGORIES: Gears

Pressure angle in relation to gear teeth, also known as the angle of obliquity,http://books.google.com/books?id=uH4aAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87 is in general the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure which is normal to the tooth surface, and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The pressure angle gives the direction of the normal to the tooth profile.  The pressure angle is equal to the profile angle at the standard pitch circle and can be termed the "standard" pressure angle at that point.  Standard values are 14.5, 20 and 25 degrees. Earlier gears with pressure angle 14.5 were commonly used because the cosine is larger for a smaller angle, providing more power transmission and less pressure on the bearing;[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] however, teeth with smaller pressure angles are weaker. To run gears together properly their pressure angles must be matched.[tpl]Cite book|isbn=1-55589-846-7|oclc=65562739|title=Gear Nomenclature, Definition of Terms with Symbols|pp=72|id=ANSI/AGMA 1012-G05|publisher=American Gear Manufacturers Association[/tpl]
The pressure angle is also the angle of the sides of the trapezoidal teeth on the corresponding rack.
Just as there are three types of profile angle, there are three types of corresponding pressure angle: the transverse pressure angle, the normal pressure angle, and the axial pressure angle.

[[The Billion Dollar Boy]]
CATEGORIES: 1990s science fiction novels, Novels by Charles Sheffield, 1997 novels, Jupiter novels

The Billion Dollar Boy is a 1997 science fiction novel by Charles Sheffield. The story takes place centuries in the future where asteroid mining is a major industry. Earth's population is 14 billion, most live in poverty. The protagonist is Shelby Cheever, a spoiled, exceedingly rich teenager, who lords his wealth over everyone around him, while taking pride in being completely unproductive. In a drunken vacation mishap, Shelby accidentally ends up in a remote mining colony with no easy return, due to entering a FTL translation node without setting the coordinates. There he is forced to work hard to survive, and interact with his new shipmates as equals. Through both routine labor, and many misadventures, Shelby endures much positive character building.
This book is a future retelling of Kipling's Captains Courageous. Same plot: spoiled rich kid gets high drunk and falls off an ocean liner spaceship into the oceanwormhole node. He is picked up by a fishing boat mining ship and forced to work for/with them for several months until the hold is full. There is even the mysterious Pennsylvania Pratt Limes who has forgotten his identity after a personal tragedy and remembers it temporarily while saving shipwreck sabotage victims.
The book is a relatively light adventure tale, by Sheffield standards, and serves mainly as a platform for the author's views on child rearing, while giving some hard science fiction theories about far future technology and economics.

Like most sillaginids, the species inhabits areas populated with a number of other whiting species of similar appearance, causing the species to often be misidentified as the well known Sillago sihama, and for this reason its biology is poorly known. The species is taken by seine net in Vietnam and is often exported to Japan.

Alexander of Argyll, also known as Alexander of Lorne, and Alexander MacDougall ([tpl]lang-gd|Alasdair MacDubhgaill[/tpl]; died 1310), was a Scottish magnate from the late 13th and early 14th century.
Alexander was the son of Ewen MacDougall, Lord of Argyll. Although the details of Alexander's early life are largely unknown, he appears to have succeeded to his father's position as Lord of Argyll and Lorne and head of the MacDougall kindred after the latter's death in 1268. Alexander appears to have been named after King Alexander III of Scotland. Under the latter's authority, Alexander was involved in a Scottish invasion of the Isle of Man in 1275. 
In 1284 he joined with other Scottish noblemen who acknowledged Margaret of Norway as the heir of Alexander.Foedera, p228 Here he is referred to as "Alexander of Orgadia"

The Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP) is a software tool used in atmospheric chemistry. Taking a set of chemical reactions and their rate coefficients as input, KPP generates Fortran 90, FORTRAN 77, C, or Matlab code 
of the resulting ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Solving the ODEs allows the temporal integration of the kinetic system. Efficiency is obtained by exploiting the sparsity structures of the Jacobian and of the Hessian. A comprehensive suite of stiff numerical integrators is also provided. Moreover, KPP can be used to generate the tangent linear model, as well as the continuous and discrete adjoint models of the chemical system.

Patrick Egan (August 31, 1841 – 1919) was an Irish and American political leader.
Egan was born in Ballymahon, Co. Longford, Ireland. His family later moved to Dublin and at the age of fourteen he entered the office of an extensive grain and milling firm, the North City Milling Company, in Dublin, and before he was twenty had been promoted to the post of chief bookkeeper and confidential man. Later he was elected managing director of this, as a stock company, it being the most extensive one in Ireland. He was, at the same time, senior partner in the most extensive bakery establishment in the county. He had been an industrious learner before going into business, and all this time took evening lessons of various instructors, and particularly of a brilliant young Episcopal minister of Dublin named Porte."1889 HISTORY  OF LINCOLN  NEBRASKA  - Chapter Twenty at www.memoriallibrary.com
Egan became involved with the Irish Republican Brotherhood soon after its establishment. He and others (including John O'Connor Power, Joseph Biggar and John Barry) resigned from the Irish Republican Brotherhood in August 1877 over the condemnation by its leaders of the use of politics within a revolutionary organisation.
In 1873, Egan was treasurer of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and with the IRB's supported, participated in the establishment of the Home Rule League with fellow IRB Supreme Council members John O'Connor Power, Joseph Biggar and John Barry.
At its foundation in 1879, he was elected treasurer of the Irish Land League. He was a close associate of Michael Davitt and Charles Stewart Parnell. At the end of 1880, he, with twelve others, including Parnell, Dillon, Bigger, Sexton, Sullivan, Sheridan, and Matt Harris, were singled out by the government for prosecution for alleged conspiracy. After a costly trial of sixteen days the jury stood ten for acquittal and two for conviction. The government did not dare arraign them again, but brought in a bill to suspend the habeas corpus act, and to permit the arrest of any one obnoxious to the government, intending to proscribe all members of the league.
Following the arrest of Parnell, in his function as Treasurer of the Land League he signed the No Rent Manifesto of 18 October 1881. This led to proscription of the League by the British government. This led Egan to flee to Paris with the organisation's funds in order to prevent their confiscation by the authorities.The Life of Henry George at www.questia.com He remained in Paris from February 1881 to the end of 1882.
Between 1880 to 1882, Egan was nominated a number of times for election to parliament, and was twice unanimously nominated, once for Queen's County and again for Meath, but he declined because he could not take the oath of allegiance to England required by the government.
Learning that the government was conspiring to arrest him and colleagues, and make him the victim of a pretended trial, he quietly fled to the Netherlands, and later fled to the United States, settling in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he continued to work strenuously for the Irish Land League and Irish home rule. In 1881 he was elected, at its convention in Boston, president of the National Executive Committee of the Irish National League of America.RootsWeb: FENIANS-L Re: (Fwd: 1884 Irish National League of America) at archiver.rootsweb.com 
Egan was instrumental in exposing the Piggott forgeries. He gave an interview to the New York Times in October 1888, predicting that the Times' case would be demolished:
Nothing new has developed yet to talk about. What has been said so far is simply a rehash of charges, without proof, that has been made for the last five years. But wait until the evidence for Parnell is produced. The whole Times' case will be exploded and indisputable evidence produced which will show Parnell guiltless and the true character of the allegations against him. You may expect some sensational testimony ... I have no doubt of the complete vindication of Parnell and all his associates and this will greatly injure the government.NYT, 25 October 1888. See That Irishman: The Life and Times of John O'Connor Power, Jane Stanford, Part Four, Taking a Stand, May 2011, ISBN 978-1-84588-698-1
He subsequently became involved in American politics and was a minor power in the Republican Party until he left it for William Jennings Bryan and the Democratic Party in 1896.
As United States Minister to Chile (1889–93), he represented the United States when relations were strained during the revolt against President José Manuel Balmaceda. He caused the Baltimore Crisis.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] The general Chilean attitude was probably best expressed by Eduardo Phillips, Chief of the Diplomatic Section of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, who described Egan in a letter to one of the newspapers as a person "utterly lacking in all elements of culture and courtesy, and ever-ready to descend to the level of invective and calumny"."Chile and the United States, 1880-1962, The Emergence of Chile's Social Crisis and the Challenge to United States Diplomacy", Frederik B. Pike, University of Notre Dame Press, 1963, page 81
Egan supported John Redmond and the Irish Volunteers in his final years.Patrick Egan at Ricorso In an interview with the New York Times, following the executions of the leaders of the Easter Rising, he declared:
Ninety-eight per cent of all Irishmen were not in sympathy with the revolt, and England had nothing to gain by shooting people after it is over ... If anyone were shot it should have been John Devoy who hatched the whole nefarious scheme here in New York and was personally responsible for it.Entry Patrick Egan, A New Dictionary of Irish History from 1800, D J Hickey & J.E Doherty, Gill and Macmillan, 2003
Egan was the father of fourteen children, nine of whom survived childhood. His residence in Lincoln was located at 1447 Q street.

In the early postwar years, he studied photography in Paris with fellow Hungarian émigré Ervin Marton, already a recognized artist.  Returning to London, Peto established his career as a photojournalist, covering the 1948 Summer Olympics and starting on staff of The Observer in 1949. He gained recognition in the 1950s and 1960s, capturing British cultural life, including figures ranging from ballet dancers Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev to The Beatles. He also traveled internationally and produced many photographs of people and regions around the world.

Established in 1993, when the Cambodian government began to take action to protect many of its threatened areas,  encompasses 210 km² including 150 km² of terrestrial and 60 km² of marine habitats. The national park contains beaches, mangrove forests, tropical jungles and over 150 species of bird and is well noted for its monkey population.
Uninhabited Koh Sess island is located at the southeastern end of the park.
In February 2012, construction work and road building was going on at the south-eastern tip of the park in order to create a small tourist resort. All this seems to be funded by Chinese capital. Was not clear how all this fits into the idea of protecting threatened areas. Park rangers stated that many animals had fled from the area since 2011.

[[Y-stations]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography organizations, Bletchley Park, Locations in the history of espionage, Military history of Norfolk

Y-stations were British Signals Intelligence collection sites initially established during World War IY-stations in World War I  and later used during World War II.  These sites were operated by a range of agencies including the Army, Navy and RAF plus the Foreign Office (MI6 and MI5), General Post Office and Marconi Company receiving stations ashore and afloat.
The "Y" stations tended to be of two types, Interception and Direction Finding. Sometimes both functions were operated at the same site with the direction finding (D/F) hut being a few hundred metres away from the main interception building because of the need to minimise interference. These sites collected traffic which was then either analysed locally or if encrypted passed for processing initially to Admiralty Room 40 in London and during World War II to the Government Code and Cypher School established at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire.

==Background==
End of paragraph.[]

[[Consolidated power generation]]

CATEGORIES: Energy conversion, Energy conservation

Consolidated Power Generation occurs when the total number of energy changing devices, such as automobile engines, decreases, while the total amount of usable energy increases or stays the same.
The consolidation of hydrocarbon power generation to electrical power, and increased output of electricity, must take place for this change to occur.  Currently, the prime example of this metamorphosis is the shift from hydrocarbon powered combustion engines to electricity.
A requirement for consolidation is the acceptance of a "common" form of energy, such as electricity, to be the predominant one.  The prime environment for the consolidation of power generation is the replacement of combustion engines with electric motors in vehicles, 
Even if the electricity was produced in coal plants or by burning crude oil, this would consolidate hydrocarbon power generation from millions of small engines to only a few massive power plants. In doing so the release of carbon would also be consolidated, which would allow for more regulation, and it would also increase demand for technologies that increase efficiency and decrease the release of anything harmful to the environment.  This would be a gradual and realistic step.

Yu Zhining (于志寧) (588–665), courtesy name Zhongmi (仲謐), formally Duke Ding of Yan (燕定公), was a chancellor of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, during the reigns of Emperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong.  He had served on the staff of Emperor Taizong's oldest son and crown prince Li Chengqian and, after Li Chengqian was removed for plotting to overthrow Emperor Taizong in 643, received approval for having tried to correct Li Chengqian in his ways.  Emperor Taizong promoted him, and he subsequently played prominent roles in the imperial government late in Emperor Taizong's reign and early in Emperor Gaozong's reign.  In 659, however, because he had previously not supported the ascension of Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), he was removed from his office based on accusations by her ally Xu Jingzong that he had conspired with Emperor Gaozong's uncle Zhangsun Wuji, who had opposed Empress Wu's ascension.

On signing with Epic, they anglicized their name and made a record, "Should I Run?" which was released as catalog # 9009 by Epic. This was not a hit, but their next record, "(My Baby Don't Love Me) No More," written by the sisters with music by their brother Leo in 1955 and released as catalog #9085, became a major hit (#6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart,The DeJohn Sisters bio on Allmusic site #8 on the Billboard Best Sellers chart).

[[Arapoti]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Paraná (state)

Arapoti is a city in Paraná, Brazil.
The city is served by Avelino Vieira Airport.
A história de Arapoti tem origem na Fazenda Jaguariaíva, que pertenceu ao lendário povoador desta região, coronel Luciano Carneiro Lobo. Os campos daqui, até então, eram ocupados por gado de corte e serviam como pouso para tropas vindas do sul do país. Na época, era o Distrito do Cerrado, hoje uma vila rural, que tinha a maior concentração de pessoas nessas terras que hoje formam o município. O local começou a se desenvolver de fato na década de 1910 com a instalação de uma serraria e fábrica de papel da Southern Brazil Lumber & Colonization Companye. No Cerrado tinha de tudo, comércio, escola, delegacia e posto de saúde.Logo em seguida, em 1912, chega a essas terras o Ramal Ferroviário do Paranapanema, que atravessou a fazenda Capão Bonito e oportunizou a instalação de moradores em torno da estação ferroviária “Cachoeirinha”, hoje sede do Memorial Capão Bonito – Casa da Cultura. Isso fez com que as pessoas residentes no Distrito do Cerrado preferissem ficar mais próximos da estação por conta da comercialização dos produtos e a localidade ficou cada vez menos habitada.Vivendo os ciclos econômicos do café e da madeira produzidos em grande escala na região do Norte Pioneiro do Paraná, começaram a chegar, em 1916, os imigrantes – inicialmente espanhóis e poloneses.Foi aos 18 dias de dezembro de 1955 que Arapoti se emancipou. Em 1960 foi a vez da imigração holandesa chegar à região. Eles vieram em maior escala e fundaram aqui a Cooperativa Agroindustrial (Capal), atualmente integrante do grupo ABC (do complexo Batavo). A criação da cooperativa transformou o município em pólo de alta tecnologia em agricultura e pecuária com destaque para a produção de soja, milho, trigo, suínos, frangos e gado holandês leiteiro de alta linhagem.Nos anos 80 a construção da fabricante de papel e celulose Inpacel Indústria LTDA fez surgir no município uma das mais modernas indústrias papeleiras do país. Nas mesmas instalações já passou a International Papel e atualmente, num novo complexo industrial, a gigante multinacional Stora Enso que tem como carro chefe a produção de papel revista.

Overshadowing the destruction or attempted destruction of bombings, as well as the subsequent arrests, trial and convictions of the perpetrators, was a series of kidnappings, hijackings and killings staged over the next several years to pressure Kuwait to release those convicted of the bombings.
The perpetrators of the bombing are thought to have been Shia Islamist members of the Iraqi Islamic Dawa Party working with the support and assistance of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The motivation of the bombing is suspect to have been punishment against Kuwait, America and France for their military and financial assistance to Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War.Ranstorp, Hizb'allah in Lebanon (1997), p. 117

The A. J. Clark Store is located along Main Street in downtown Cornwall, New York, USA. It is a brick Italianate building dating from approximately 1875. 
It has a two-foot (60 cm) parapet around its entire roof and a covered two-story porch looking out on the street. Inside, original period features such as a pressed-metal ceiling, hardwood floors, doors and staircase remain. There have been no significant changes to the building since its original construction.
Archer Clark built the building to house his butcher shop around 1875, after an 1870 fire destroyed his earlier quarters. It would continue in existence in that building for a century. Later, one of his descendants converted it into a delicatessen, and today another Clark does financial planning on the ground floor. In 1996 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as an intact commercial building dating from Cornwall's days as a summer resort town in the late 19th century.

[[Kuki-Chin–Naga languages]]

CATEGORIES: Kuki-Chin–Naga languages

The Kuki-Chin–Naga languages are a geographic clustering of languages of the Tibeto-Burman family in James Matisoff's classification used by Ethnologue. Their genealogical relationship both to each other and to the rest of Tibeto-Burman is unresolved, but Matisoff lumps them together as a convenience pending further research. 
The languages are spoken by the ethnically related Naga people of Nagaland, the Chin people of Burma, and the Kuki people. The larger among these languages have communities of several ten thousands of native speakers, and a few have more than 100,000, such as Mizo (674,756 in India as of 2001Distribution of the 100 non-scheduled languages), Thado (150,000) or Ao (140,000).
None of these ethnicities corresponds to a linguistic unit. "Kuki" and "Chin" are essentially synonyms, whereas the Naga speak languages of several families. The established families are:
Meithei, the official language of Manipur, is also often included. The Konyak languages of Nagaland, also spoken by ethnic Naga, are not grouped within Kuki-Chin–Naga, but rather Brahmaputran (Sal). Ethnologue adds Koki, Long Phuri, Makuri, and Para, all unclassified, and all distant from other Naga languages they've been compared to, though Koki is perhaps closest to (or one of) the Tangkhul languages, and the other three may belong together.

The Four Garrisons of Anxi were Chinese military garrisons installed by the Tang Dynasty between 648 and 658. They were stationed at the city and capital of the Indo-European statelet Kucha, Khotan, Kashgar and Karashahr. The capital of Kucha was also the seat of the Protectorate General to Pacify the West. The troops were sent and stationed here from within Tang China proper."Anxi Sizhen"Xue, p. 596-598. 
The fortress of the Four Garrisons were first built in 648, when the main opponent statelets in the Tarim Basin were subdued by force. Shortly after, in 651, the garrisons were taken by the Turkic prince Ashina Helu, until the conquest of Su Dingfang after 657. 
The main challengers for the Chinese establishing their hegemony over the region were the Tibetans, who since 662 had constantly set their aggression over the region and briefly seized it between 670 and 692. During this period the Chinese re-captured them in 675, 679, 682 and again in 686.Wang, p. 69-89, 294-295 Meanwhile in 679, another fortress was built in Suyab, situated near the Chui River, this would later replace Karashahr as one of the Four Garrisons until 719, when the Turgesh took over it.
In 692[tpl]Reference needed|date=September 2012[/tpl], with the last defeat of Tibetans, and after a brief seizure of Kucha by Turgesh for 8 months in 709, the Four Garrisons were continuously controlled by the Chinese, until their eventual loss. Even though most of the regular prefectures at Hexi Corridor, such as Liangzhou (764), Ganzhou, Suzhou (766), Guazhou (776), Yizhou (781) and Shazhou (787) were occupied between the 760s and 780s by the Tibetans, and the contacts between the capital were limited, the Chinese continued to maintain the order of these garrisons until 791, when these, along with the seat of Protectorate General to Pacify the West, would eventually fallen to the Tibetan hands.Wang, p. 207-210, 296-300

The Glen is dominated by the River Moriston, which in Gaelic might mean "River of the Waterfalls". The river is a big attraction for fishers, but also for birdwatchers who come to see osprey and eagles fishing on the river. The river crashes over waterfalls at Invermoriston into Loch Ness, passing under an original Thomas Telford bridge, built in 1813.
About five miles along the glen from Invermoriston is Loch Dundreggan, "Dundreggan" being of Gaelic origin and meaning "Dragon Haugh".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/gaelic/pdfs/placenamesC-E.pdf| title=Placenames| author=Iain Mac an Tàilleir| publisher=Pàrlamaid na h-Alba|format=PDF| accessdate=2007-07-23[/tpl] Here the natural force of the river is tapped through a hydro-electric dam, which supplies power to the area. Water is let out of the dam on Tuesdays, making it a popular attraction for white water rafting and canoeing.

Dr. John Pemberton was experimenting with a medicial formula which included coca leaves and kola nuts as sources of its ingredients. Frank Mason Robinson gave the formula the name Coca-Cola, writing the name in Spencerian script which was popular with bookkeepers of the era. His script of Coca-Cola remains one of the most recognized trademarks in the world. The formula was introduced in May 1886 at the Jacobs Pharmacy in Atlanta. It sold [tpl]convert|25|USgal|L[/tpl] the first year. The next year sales increased to [tpl]convert|1049|USgal|L[/tpl]. In 1888 Dr. Pemberton sold the formula to Asa G. Candler.

‘P.W.’ to those that knew him, he was most famous for his work as Naval Liaison Officer to RAF Coastal Command.Hendrie 2006, p.50. The work he performed in this capacity was of utmost importance to the smooth functioning of Coastal Command operations, tactics and weapons (see: Coastal Command weapon development. Among other things, he personally championed and facilitated the increased use of Very Long Range aircraft, such as the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. These aircraft allowed continual air cover over the Atlantic and closed the notorious Mid-Atlantic gap, where Axis U-Boats could freely operate against Allied convoys.
It was said of him that he was the only person of lower than Air Marshal rank whose portrait appeared in the mess at Coastal Command.Air Estimates 10 March 1955
After the war he wrote an eight-volume internal history for the Royal Navy, entitled The R.A.F. in the Maritime War,http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/RAF.html a copy of which resides at The National Archives in Kew, London.

Mardale [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɑr|d|eɪ|l[/tpl] is a glacial valley in the Lake District, in northern England. The valley used to have a hamlet at its head, called Mardale Green, but this village was submerged in 1935 when the water level of the valley's lake, Haweswater, was raised to form Haweswater Reservoir by the Manchester Corporation.The "lost village" of Mardale, BBC, November 2003. Retrieved 2013-01-01.Emergency water measures planned, BBC news website, 2003-11-11. Retrieved 2013-01-01.
Most of the village's buildings were blown up by the Royal Engineers, who used them for demolition practice.  The exception was the small church, which could accommodate only 75 people, and had an all-ticket congregation for its last service.  It was then dismantled stone by stone, and the stones and windows were re-used to build the water take off tower which is situated along the Western shore of the reservoir.The "lost village" of Mardale, BBC news website. 2010-07-15. Retrieved 2013-01-01. Some 97 sets of remains were disinterred from the churchyard and transferred to Shap. Alfred Wainwright protested bitterly about the loss of Mardale in his series of pictorial guides to the Lakeland fells, having first visited it in 1930. The ruins of the abandoned village occasionally reappears when the water level in the reservoir is low. This village is the inspiration for the satirical newspaper the Mardale Times.
In response to the submerging of the village the Manchester Corporation provided an access road that runs for four miles along the south-eastern side of the reservoir to a car park at Mardale Head. From here ascents of the peaks surrounding the head of the valley, such as Harter Fell, High Street and Kidsty Pike may be made.

Wisner Stadium is an athletic facility located in Pontiac, Michigan.
Wisner Stadium was built in 1941 and named for Moses Wisner, the 12th Governor of the State of Michigan.  Wisner, a resident of Pontiac, was a lawyer who became active in the anti-slavery movement.
The stadium seats 6,600 and has hosted many different events over the years.  The football field was home to both public high schools in the city, Pontiac Northern High School and Pontiac Central High School, and is now home to the Pontiac High School Phoenix football team.  Pontiac High School, which is located at the former Pontiac Northern High School, was created in 2009 by the merger of both Pontiac Northern and Pontiac Central high schools.
During Super Bowl XL week, the Pittsburgh Steelers used the vacant Pontiac Silverdome as a practice facility.  FieldTurf was installed specifically for the practices, rather than using the artificial turf that was previously used.  Following the game, the new playing surface was donated to Wisner Stadium by FieldTurf.
This was Oakland County's largest high school football stadium in terms of seating capacity until the late-2000s (decade) expansion of the Clarkston Sports Complex stadium.

[[Organizational justice]]

CATEGORIES: Industrial and organizational psychology, Organizational behavior, Justice

Greenberg (1987) introduced the concept of organizational justice with regard to how an employee judges the behaviour of the organization and the employee's resulting attitude and behaviour. (e.g., if a firm makes redundant half of the workers, an employee may feel a sense of injustice with a resulting change in attitude and a drop in productivity).
Justice or fairness refers to the idea that an action or decision is morally right, which may be defined according to ethics, religion, fairness, equity, or law. People are naturally attentive to the justice of events and situations in their everyday lives, across a variety of contexts (Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008). Individuals react to actions and decisions made by organizations every day. An individual’s perceptions of these decisions as fair or unfair can influence the individual’s subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Fairness is often of central interest to organizations because the implications of perceptions of injustice can impact job attitudes and behaviors at work. Justice in organizations can include issues related to perceptions of fair pay, equal opportunities for promotion, and personnel selection procedures.

Paddy Turner (born 1940 in Dublin) was an Irish football player during the 1960s and 1970s.
Paddy was a forward who played for Shamrock Rovers, Shelbourne, Morton, Celtic, Glentoran, Dundalk and Bohemians. On the international front he won two full caps for the Republic of Ireland national football team, his first cap coming in a 1-0 home win for Ireland over Scotland on 9 June 1963.
He won a League of Ireland winners medal with Shamrock Rovers in 1958/59 and made 2 appearances in European competition for Rovers before signing for Shels in August 1960 http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1960/0808/Pg002.html#Ar00204:4977034F67225FA76763A7854699704A198A4FB9B75359D1462A6349CA7D467B504A0B6A4057034887225917675ED78540897245998C49A9B94E99D3408A65458A7F408B5044FB6A44FB50459B6A.
Paddy Turner signed for Celtic from Morton in May 1963. http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1963/0601/Pg003.html#Ar00316:4F84955384AD5384945464AC54E49459A4AC. The former Shelbourne and Shamrock Rovers inside right was a cultured player and seemed to have settled well in Scotland producing some fine displays for the Cappielow club. However his debut in the Hoops was one to forget as the Bhoys lost 3-0 to Rangers at Parkhead in a League Cup tie on August 8. Unfortunately for Turner his arrival at Parkhead coincided with the emergence of Bobby Murdoch and despite being more than a fair player himself Paddy was always going to be second choice behind the wonderful talent of Murdoch. Consequently after little more than one year and 14 games Paddy headed back across the Irish Sea to play for Glentoran. 
While at The Oval (Belfast) he scored against Panathinaikos in the 1964–65 European Cup http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1964/0917/Pg003.html#Ar00316.
In November 1972, he signed for Bohs from Dundalk on a free transfer. He made 17 league appearances in Bohs colours scoring 5 goals before he left the club at the end of the 1972/73 season. He also netted the first goal in Bohemians 3-1 win over Shamrock Rovers in the 1973 Leinster Senior Cup Final.

R Aquarii is a symbiotic star believed to contain a white dwarf and a Mira-type variable in a binary system. The orbital period is approximately 44 years.By its gravitational pull, the white dwarf draws in material from the red giant and occasionally ejects some of the surplus in weird loops to form the nebula seen in the linked image.[tpl]cite web | url = http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinPreview?-c=23+43+49.4616-15+17+04.202&ident=V*+R+Aqr&submit=Aladin+previewer | title = Aladin previewer | publisher = CDS[/tpl] The whole system appears reddened because it is situated in a very dusty region of space, and its blue light is absorbed before reaching us. 
The nebula around R Aquarii is also known as Cederblad 211. According to Tom Polakis,[ref]
</ref> as of 1998 no one had succeeded to observe this challenging object visually. It is possible that the nebula is the remnant of a nova-like outburst, which may have been observed by Japanese astronomers, in the year 930 AD.

CATEGORIES: 1928 songs, 1961 singles, Connie Francis songs, Songs with music by Ray Henderson, Songs with lyrics by Buddy DeSylva, Songs with lyrics by Lew Brown, Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles, MGM Records singles

"Together" is a 1928 popular song with music by Ray Henderson and lyrics by Buddy G. DeSylva and Lew Brown. The most popular 1928 recording of the song, by Paul Whiteman, with Bix Beiderbecke on cornet, was a #1 hit for two weeks.
The song was included in a 1944 movie, Since You Went Away. This gave rise to a revival of the song, and it was recorded by Dick Haymes and Helen Forrest in a duet. Their recording was released by Decca Records as catalog number 23349. It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on October 5, 1944 and lasted 10 weeks on the chart, peaking at #3. This recording was paired on a single with "It Had to Be You," a #4 hit, producing a big two-sided hit.
"Together" became a Top Ten hit in the summer of 1961 via a recording by Connie Francis cut in New York City on 3 June 1961 with Cliff Parman acting as arranger and conductor. After focusing on new material for her recent singles releases, Francis with "Together" reverted to the mode of remaking traditional pop songs which had provided her with her biggest hits in the '50s. "Together" reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first single release by Francis which could avail itself of the July 1961 inauguration of Billboard's Easy Listening chart where "Together" peaked at #1. Francis' "Together" also reached #2 in Australia, #6 in the UK, #7 in Ireland and #6 in New Zealand and was a #1 hit in India.
"Together" was the title cut for a 1964 collaborative album by Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells which - apart from the original songs "Once Upon a Time" and "What's the Matter with You Baby" released as a single- consisted of remakes of traditional pop songs. "Together" was also the title cut of a 1976 Anne Murray album. See Together (Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells album); Together (Anne Murray album).
A recording of "Together" plays in the background on the John Lennon and Yoko Ono album Two Virgins, released in 1968 on Apple Records.

Nick the Knife is a 1982 album by Nick Lowe. The album was Lowe's third solo LP, and his first since the 1981 breakup of his band Rockpile. However, the record still has several Rockpile ties, as Lowe's former bandmates Billy Bremner and Terry Williams play on the album. In addition, Lowe does a slowed-down remake of the Rockpile song "Heart"; the original version can be found on the band's album Seconds of Pleasure sung by Bremner.
Nick the Knife reached #50 on the Billboard 200, and #99 on the UK album charts. No singles from the album made the US or UK charts, although in Canada "Stick It Where The Sun Don't Shine" hit the top 40.
Nick the Knife is notable for being one of only two Nick Lowe solo albums with no covers, as it is composed entirely of songs written or co-written by Lowe (the other album is 1990's Party of One).

He was the first known Shilahara  king of North Konkan, was placed in charge of the country by the Rashtrakuta  king Govinda III. Since then North Konkan  came to be known as Kapardi-dvipa or Kavadi-dvipa. The capital of this branch was Puri, after which the country was called Puri-Konkan . Their capital seems to have been Puri and their places of note were Hamjaman probably Sanjan in Dahanu, Thane  (Shristhanak), Sopara (Shurparak), Chaul (Chemuli), Lonad (Lavanatata) and than. As the Yadavas call themselves lords of the excellent city of Dvaravatipura or Dwarka and the Kadambas call themselves lords of the excellent city of Banavasipura or Banavasi, so the Shilaharas call themselves lords of the excellent city of Tagarapura or Tagar. This title would furnish a clue to the origin of the Shilaharas it unfortunately, the site of Tagar was not uncertain. From numerous references and grants the Thane Shilaharas seem to have been worshippers of Shiva. (Dept. Gazetteer: 2002)

Written jointly by lead singer Philip Oakey and keyboard player Ian Burden, the song was recorded at Genetic Sound Studios, Reading, in March 1981.

"The Sound Of The Crowd" was the first Human League song to feature female vocals, from new band members Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall, interacting with  Philip Oakey's baritone lead.The Human League
The single was the first to feature a distinctive, though short-lived, marketing tactic, where Human League singles were labelled 'Red' or 'Blue' to help buyers differentiate between the band's musical styles.  'Red' was for dance tracks, 'Blue' for pop songs.  "The Sound Of The Crowd" was designated 'Red'.  When asked to explain the system, vocalist Sulley explained that "Red is for posers, for Spandy (Spandau Ballet) types."  Oakey added: "Blue is for ABBA fans."NME 3 October 1981
The original 7" B side "The Sound of the Crowd (Add Your Voice)" is the closing track of the remix album Love and Dancing, issued in 1982 under the name of The League Unlimited Orchestra.
The song appears on all The Human League's "Greatest Hits" compilation albums. The bonus remix disc issued with 2003's The Very Best of The Human League contains three different remixes of the song

{{Blacklisted-links|1=
Javad Shamaqdari is an Iranian filmmaker and "deputy culture minister of film" to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He has attacked the film 300 as  psychological warfare and accused American 'cultural authorities' and Hollywood of attacking Iranian culture. 
He has since rebuffed American film director Oliver Stone's offer to make a film about President Ahmadinejad, saying Iran would only allow it if an Iranian director was allowed to make a film about George W. Bush. Like 300, Stone's 2004 biopic Alexander was controversial in Iran for its depictions of ancient Persians.
In April 2012, he responded to "What Must Be Said" with a letter to Günter Grass: "I have read your literary work, highly responsible both from a human and historical point of view, and I found it extremely timely. Telling the truth in such a way may truly awaken the west's silent and dormant conscience".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.agi.it/english-version/world/elenco-notizie/201204071522-cro-ren1030-iran_congratulates_gunter_grass_over_anti_israel_poem|title=Iran congratulates Gunter Grass|work=Agenzia Giornalistica Italia|date=7 April 2012|accessdate=7 April 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Oakland Athletics seasons, 1931 Major League Baseball season, American League champion seasons

The 1931 Philadelphia Athletics season involved the A's finishing first in the American League with a record of 107 wins and 45 losses. It was the team's third consecutive pennant-winning season and its third consecutive season with over 100 wins. However the A's lost the 1931 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. The series loss prevented the Athletics from becoming the first major league baseball team to win three consecutive World Series; the New York Yankees would accomplish the feat a mere seven years later. The Athletics, ironically, would eventually earn their own threepeat in 1974, some forty-three years after the failed 1931 attempt.
1931 was also the A's final World Series appearance in Philadelphia. Their next AL pennant would be in 1972, after they had moved to Oakland.

[[Spets]]

CATEGORIES: Russian crime television series, Russian television miniseries

Spets was a seven-part Russian TV series that aired on Ussuriysk T.V. It chronicled the day-to-day activities of a group of gangsters in a Far East Russian town. The show's writer, producer, director and star, Vitali Dyomochka, was a real life Russian mafia boss and the head of a podstava group. A lot of the events depicted on the show were based on Dyomochka's real life experiences, such as an incident where a blackmail victim turns out to be a judge.
The gangsters were played by their real-life counterparts and performed their own stunts. Over the course of the series, a nightclub and casino were heavily damaged. Also during the series ten gang members were arrested and another was murdered by rivals. Local police showed opposition to the show and refused to play themselves, and questioned and investigated Dyomochka several times over the production of the show.
When the series finished production in 2003, it became a hit on local television, getting around 100% ratings. However, the show also divided viewers,  and raised controversy if the mafia should be allowed to profit from their crimes in this way. Dymochka, however, has repeatedly insisted he has not made money from the show, and rather did it to show people the real side of organized crime.

[[1973 Press-on-Regardless Rally]]

CATEGORIES: 1973 World Rally Championship season

The 1973 Press-on-Regardless Rally was the 25th running of the American rally, and the eleventh round of the inaugural World Rally Championship season.  Run at the outset of November in the State of Michigan in the United States, the rally was run entirely on gravel.
Due to a combination of scheduling and location, the event was not attended by most European competitors.  Giving teams only two weeks following the preceding Sanremo Rally to travel across the Atlantic Ocean, and then giving even less time for a return to Europe for the following RAC Rally in England, proved unrealistic for most teams, and in the event, only a few teams from Poland made the trip with their domestic Polski Fiat 125p vehicles.  As it turned out, the event was primarily a local affair, with a Canadian, Walter Boyce, taking the win ahead of a field of American drivers.
In 1973, and for several years afterward, only manufacturers were given points for finishes in WRC events.  With the teams focused on the prestigious RAC Rally upcoming, and with the year's championship already sewn up by Alpine Renault, the works teams did not make an effort to compete in the American leg of the championship.  Toyota became the beneficiary as it was a Corolla that carried Boyce to victory, while other makes popular on the North American market filled out the ranks.  Datsuns were particularly prevalent—especially the locally popular Datsun 510—and Polski Fiat was rewarded for their effort in making the trip by a finish in the points, but overall, the results factored little into the factory efforts for the championship.

[[Social networking potential]]
CATEGORIES: Social networks

Social networking potential (SNP) is a numeric coefficient, derived through algorithms[tpl]Which|date=June 2011[/tpl] to represent both the size of an individual's social network and their ability to influence that network. A close synonym is the Alpha User, a person with a high SNP.
SNP coefficients have two primary functions:
By calculating the SNP of respondents and by targeting High SNP respondents, the strength and relevance of quantitative marketing research used to drive viral marketing strategies is enhanced.
Variables used to calculate an individual's SNP include but are not limited to: participation in Social Networking activities, group memberships, leadership roles, recognition, publication/editing/contributing to non-electronic media, publication/editing/contributing to electronic media (websites, blogs), and frequency of past distribution of information within their network. The acronym "SNP" and some of the first algorithms developed to quantify an individual's social networking potential were described in the white paper "Advertising Research is Changing" (Gerstley, 2003) See Viral Marketing.
The first book[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] to discuss the commercial use of Alpha Users among mobile telecoms audiences was 3G Marketing by Ahonen, Kasper and Melkko in 2004. The first book to discuss Alpha Users more generally in the context of social marketing intelligence was Communities Dominate Brands by Ahonen & Moore in 2005. In 2012, Nicola Greco (UCL) presents at TEDx the Social Networking Potential as a parallelism to the potential energy that users generate and companies should use, stating that "SNP is the new asset that every company should aim to have".[tpl]cite web|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxMilano-Nicola-Greco-on-math;search%3Atag%3A%22technology%22 -  Mathematics of Social Networks, Nicola Greco -- TEDxMilan[/tpl]

[[Geoparsing]]
CATEGORIES: Geocodes, Geographic information systems

Geoparsing is the process of assigning geographic identifiers (e.g., codes or geographic coordinates expressed as latitude-longitude) to textual words and phrases that occur in unstructured content, such as "twenty miles north east of Jalalabad". You can also geoparse location references from other forms of media, for example audio content in which a speaker mentions a place. With geographic coordinates the features can be mapped and entered into Geographic Information Systems. Two primary uses of the geographic coordinates derived from unstructured content are to plot portions of the content on maps and to search the content using a map as a filter.  
Geoparsing goes beyond geocoding. Geocoding analyzes unambiguous structured location references, such as postal addresses and rigorously formatted numerical coordinates. Geoparsing handles ambiguous references in unstructured discourse, such as "Al Hamra," which is the name of several places, including towns in both Syria and Yemen.
A geoparser is a piece of software or a (web) service that helps in this process.

[[Aparajita]]

CATEGORIES: Shilahara dynasty, 10th-century rulers in Asia, 11th-century rulers in Asia

Aparajita was Shilahara  ruler of north Konkan branch from 975 CE – 1010 CE.
Chhadvaideva was followed by his nephew Aparajita, the son of Vajjada. Aparajita was an ambitious king. He sought to extend his sphere of influence by alliance with the mighty kings of other countries. He probably represents the Vidyadhara king Shikhandaketu, mentioned in the Navasahasankacharita of Padmagupta, who sent his son Shashikhanda to render help to the Paramara king Sindhuraja (993 CE 1010 CE) in his invasion of South Kosala at the request of the Naga king of Bastar. Aparajita's extensive conquests, his alliance with the Paramaras, his assumption of grandiloquent titles and his refusal to recognise the suzerainty of the Later Chalukya s exasperated Satyashraya, the son of Tailapa. He invaded the kingdom of Aparajita and pressed as far as the capital Puri.(Dept. Gazetteer: 2002)

The Cleveland Indians are a professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio.
They were a founder member of the American League in 1901 as the Cleveland Blues and Cleveland Naps, and established themselves in professional baseball during the 1900s and 1910s. They won the first of two World Series in 1920 at their first attempt.
Since then, the Indians have had two major periods of success. The first was from 1947 to 1956, when they had winning records in every season and won their only other World Series in 1948, including a 111-43 record in 1954, which remains the best Major League Baseball regular season record since the 1909 Pirates. The Indians’ other highly successful period was from 1994 to 2001, when they had eight consecutive winning seasons but were unable to win a third World Series, losing in both of their appearances during this stretch (1995 and 1997).
The Indians have also experienced failure in their history. From the split of the American League into two divisions in 1969 until 1993, the Indians did not make a single postseason appearance and played only four winning seasons. They posted 100 losses four times during the era. Since 2002, the Indians have declined with only three winning seasons and two postseason appearances.

 The Heavenly Vision

O soul, are you weary and troubled?

No light in the darkness you see?

There's light for a look at the Saviour,

And life more abundant and free!
Refrain:

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face;

And the things of earth will grow strangely dim

In the light of His glory and grace.
Thro' death into life everlasting

He pass'd, and we follow him there

Over us sin hath no more dominion

For more than conquer'rs we are!
His word shall not fail you--He promised;

Believe him and all will be well:

Then go to a world that is dying,

His perfect salvation to tell.
by Helen Howarth Lemmel, © 1922

The Heavenly Vision is a hymn written by Helen Howarth Lemmel. It was inspired by a tract written by Lilias Trotter entitled "Focussed". Today the chorus is most widely known.
This song was sung by Michael W. Smith
The refrain of the hymn was used in the worship song, "Center" by Charlie Hall and Matt Redman.
In 2013, the Christian punk pop band Eleventyseven covered the hymn on their Good Spells EP.  It was re-titled "Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus" for the release.

[[Someshvara]]

CATEGORIES: 13th-century monarchs in Asia, Shilahara dynasty, 13th-century Indian people

Someshvara was Shilahara ruler of north Konkan branch from 1255 CE – 1265 CE.
The successor of Keshideva II was Someshvara, who, like Aparaditya, assumed the imperial titles Maharajadhiraja and Konkana Chakravarti.
Someshvara is the last known king of North Konkan. In his time the power of the Yadavas of Devagiri was increasing. The Yadava king Krishna (1247 CE - 1261 CE) sent an army under his general Malla to invade North Konkan. Though Malla claims to have defeated the Shilahara king, the campaign did not result in any territorial gain for the Yadavas. Mahadeva, the brother and successor of Krishna, continued the hostilities and invaded Konkan with a large troop of war-elephants. Someshvara was defeated on land and betook himself to the sea. He was pursued by Mahadeva. In the naval engagement that followed, Someshvara was drowned. Referring to this incident Hemadri says thatSomeshvara preferred to drown himself and face the submarine fire rather than the fire of Mahadeva's anger. The scene of this fight is sculptured on some Virgal stones found near Borivali station in Bombay. Some of the stones show the land battle in which the elephants took part, while others depict the lines of vessels propelled by oars, both in advance upon the enemy and in the melee itself. Since Mahadeva's force was strong in elephants and the stone from the sculptures upon it appears to belong to the 12th or 13th century CE, it is quite possible as Cousens has suggested, that these stones may be commemorating the heroes who fell in the battle between Someshvara and Mahadeva. The battle may have taken place in 1265 CE. Thereafter the Yadavas appointed a governor named Achyuta Nayaka to rule over North Konkan. His Thane plates are dated in 1272 CE. Thereafter, we get several inscriptions of the Yadavas from North Konkan. (Dept. Gazetteer: 2002)

The filius philosophorum (Latin for "the philosophers' child", i.e. made by the true students of philosophy) is a symbol in alchemy.  In some texts it is equated with the philosopher's stone (lapis philosophorum), but in others it assumes its own symbolic meanings.  Other terms for the filius philosophorum include filius sapientiae ("child of wisdom"), infans noster ("our child") and infans solaris ("sun child").
There are several images that have been used to represent the filius philosophorum.  Among these are the transformed hermaphroditic Hermes, the child of the Red King and the White Queen (the Sun and Moon), the child of the egg, and the three-fathered Orion.
The filius philosophorum was also one of the Jungian archetypes analyzed by the Swiss psychologist.

"Leaving So Soon?" is a song performed and composed by English piano rock and alternative rock band Keane, featured on their second studio album, Under the Iron Sea. "Leaving So Soon?" was the last song composed for the album, circa 2005.
The song is considered a fan favourite, and was believed by some to be a potential single for the album. It remains the Keane song with the highest tempo released (144). Written by pianist Tim Rice-Oxley, it has been rumoured amongst fans that the lyrics were aimed at fellow band member Tom Chaplin after the band had an argument, similarly to two other songs on the album, 'Hamburg Song' and 'Broken Toy'. Others claim it's a jab at former band member Dominic Scott, who left the band in 2001.

This article is about the British popular record label.  For information about the earlier American classical label, see Dover Publications.
Dover Records was a British record label that was formed about 1989.
One of the recordings was a celebration of Arsenal winning the 1989 League Division One with "We're Back (Where We Belong)" single.
Recordings on the Dover label released compilations related to the magazine Smash Hits, starting with Smash Hits Party '89.
Dover was a subsidiary of Chrysalis Records and incorporated another Chrysalis offshoot, Flutterby Records. The change-over from Flutterby to Dover was so messy that a single by Steeleye Span, "Following Me," appeared on the Dover label under a Flutterby number - "FLUT 4". The label evidently disappeared in 1991.

Amalia of Neuenahr (April 6, 1539 – April 10, 1602) was the daughter of Gumprecht of Neuenahr and Cordula of Holstein Schauenburg.
Her first husband was Hendrik van Brederode, who played an important part in the events leading up to the Eighty Years' War. After he became one of the leaders in the resistance against the Spanish Inquisition and Spanish rule in the Netherlands, she helped him collect funds. After his death in 1568, she married Frederick III, Elector Palatine of the Rhine in 1569. It was in the same year that Emilia, the second daughter of William the Silent and his second wife Anna of Saxony was named after her. This is because she was in charge of Anna's household at the time. Frederick died in 1576.
From 1579 until 1587 she was in charge of Vianen, which she inherited from her first husband. In 1589 she inherited Limburg from Adolf, her half-brother. In 1590 she was given the rights of use of Alpen, Helpenstein, Lennep and Erbvogtei of Köln by her half-sister, Magdalena. Alpen was occupied by the Dutch Republic in 1597 and the following year by Spanish forces.

On August 5, official sources from the Palestine Liberation Organization confirmed that the group - led by Ahmad Zarur - had joined the Palestine Armed Struggle Command. According to a declassified CIA document, the group had around fifty members. In August 1969, the APO claimed responsibility for bombing the Israeli pavilion at the International Fair in İzmir, Turkey.Fedayeen: Small Independent Fedayeen Groups: The Arab Palestine Organization Central Intelligence Agency, Directorate of Intelligence. January 1971
In the summer of 1970, the group attracted controversy as it, along with another Nasserist group, the Action Organization for the Liberation of Palestine, briefly expressed sympathy for the Rogers Plan - which was proposed to reduce belligerence between the Arab states and Israel after the Six-Day War. This approach was however, withdrawn. There were some reports that the controversy sparked clashes with other Palestinian factions, such as Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The APO claimed that the PFLP had attacked their office in Lebanon. The accusation was however withdrawn at a meeting of Palestinian factions.

Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, or Custodiol HTK solution is a high-flow, low-potassium preservation solution used for organ transplantation. 
HTK solution is intended for perfusion and flushing of donor liver kidney, heart, lung and pancreas prior to removal from the donor and for preserving these organs during hypothermic storage and transport to the recipient. HTK solution is based on the principle of inactivating organ function by withdrawal of extracellular sodium and calcium, together with intensive buffering of the extracellular space by means of histidine/histidine hydrochloride, so as to prolong the period during which the organs will tolerate interruption of oxygenated blood. The composition of HTK is similar to that of extracellular fluid. All of the components of HTK occur naturally in the body.
Custodiol HTK is the registered trademark of Dr. Franz Köhler (Chemie GmbH, Germany).

CATEGORIES: Gert Wingårdh buildings, Natural history museums in Germany, Museums in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Buildings and structures completed in 2007, German architecture, Museums established in 2007, Nature centres in Germany, Waren (Müritz), 2007 establishments in Germany

The Müritzeum is a visitor centre and nature discovery centre for the Müritz National Park, located on Lake Müritz, near the town of Waren in the north German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The concept of the visitor centre is to have a enjoyable and interactive science-based approach to the themes of nature and regional history. The exhibition and aquarium area is devoted to the presentation of the flora and fauna and history of the Mecklenburg Lake District. Its centrepiece is the largest aquarium for native freshwater fish in Germany, with a capacity of 100,000 litres. More than 40 aquatic species may be seen in the 25 aquaria, with almost all of Mecklenburg's native species, including rare crustacea and turtles. Thematic exhibition areas cover the underwater world, birds, forests, the region's history and the moor. The 1000-year-old oaks at Ivenack, the fieldstone church and estate villages form other topics in the exhibition. There is also an adventure garden and adventure playground. The film in the site's multi-vision cinema gives overview on the checkered history of Mecklenburg. The scenic beauty of the region is always to the fore.
The foundation stone of the 13 million euro and 2,000-square-metre building was laid on 14 December 2005. The first phase was completed in June 2006 and it was opened on 2 August 2007.http://www.mueritzeum.de/ The building is entirely covered with charred (angekohlt) larch wood. Just as the Mecklenburg Lake District is known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes", the Müritzeum describes itself as the "House of a Thousand Lakes". As a visitor centre, the Müritzeum provides information for visitors and tourists about the cultural and tourist attractions of the Mecklenburg Lake District and the Müritz National Park.
The Müritzeum is supported by the collections of the Müritz Museum, with its 140-year history, the Natural History Collection of the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the Müritz Aquarium. The Müritz Museum was the precursor of the Müritzeum. In 1866, the first collection was created when Hermann von Maltzan founded as the Maltzan Natural History Museum for Mecklenburg (Maltzan`sches Naturhistorisches Museums für Mecklenburg) or Maltzaneum for short.
At the Müritzeum, as part of the Natural History State Collection of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, are about 275,000 exhibits, especially molluscs, insects, eggs, bird specimens, antlers and a geological collection. The extensive library of approximately 16,000 volumes, mainly focuses on "Mecklenburgica" and scientific literature on botany, zoology, geology and natural history.

Cleats is a comic strip by Bill Hinds. Cleats features a group of young kids, coaches, and their parents as they deal with the day-to-day trials and tribulations of being on a soccer team (Although there are storylines that have the kids engaged in physical sports other than soccer). Cleats was carried in over 75 newspapers[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/products/?isbn=0740741381| author=Andrew McMeel Publishing| title=Cleats Information Page |accessdate = 2007-09-12[/tpl]
The last iteration of Cleats had been run on 31 October 2010, in the form of a special Halloween 'exit' strip.  Bill Hinds stated that he had ceased producing Cleats because the strip "had suffered in many newspaper comic polls over the past nine years."
In many newspapers, editors have chosen to run the earliest Cleats strips again, allowing readers to compare Hinds' initial style and characters against their more recent development.  This has resulted in previous Sunday strips appearing on weekdays, but has opened to broad examination the processes by which a professional cartoonist evolves his work over years of production.

I Hate Hamlet is a dramatic comedy written in 1991 by Paul Rudnick.  Set in John Barrymore's old apartment in New York City - at the time, the author's real-life home - the play follows successful television actor Andrew Rally as he struggles with taking on the dream role of Hamlet, dealing with a girlfriend who is keeping a firm grip on her chastity, and playing host to the ghost of John Barrymore, who, clothed as Hamlet, has come back to earth for the sole purpose of convincing Rally to play the part.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tspinc.org/IHateHamlet/Synopsis.html|title=I Hate Hamlet Plot Summary|accessdate=2007-12-13|author=Townsquare Players[/tpl] Real estate agent, Felicia Dantine convinces Rally to stay in the apartment and hold a seance.
Barrymore proves to be very convincing (challenging Andrew to a sword fight in the middle of the New York loft), and Andrew decides to play Hamlet.  But when a Hollywood friend shows up offering Andrew a new role in a television pilot, with a potentially large salary and fame, Andrew is forced to choose between Shakespeare, whom his girlfriend loves, or television, where he is loved by millions.

Father Gregório Amúrrio, O.F.M. was a Catholic priest of the Franciscan Order, and a Spanish missionary in California during the 18th century. A member of the Franciscan Province of Cantabria, Spain, he was one of twenty Franciscans who set out from the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico in October, 1770 to labor in the Spanish missions in Baja California. In the summer of 1773 the Franciscans surrendered all missions on the Baja Peninsula to the Dominicans, after which Father Amúrrio along with five other friars volunteered to work the new missions in Upper California. Upon arrival in San Diego on August 30, Fray Amúrrio was assigned to Mission San Diego de Alcalá; the padre administered his first baptism that same day.
In May, 1774 Father Amúrrio was transferred to the Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, registering his first baptism at that station on July 7. Father Presidente Junípero Serra appointed Father Amúrrio to accompany Father Fermín Lasuén in the founding of Mission San Juan Capistrano in October 1775. However, a native uprising in San Diego forced the priests to abandon the site and flee to the safety of the San Diego Presidio. On November 1, 1776 Father Presidente Serra founded the mission San Juan Capistrano with Friars Amúrrio and Pablo de Mugártegui in attendance. Father Amúrrio conducted his first baptism in San Juan on December 19, 1776. 
Ill health compelled Father Amúrrio to retire to the Missionary College in 1779.

In addition to processing the transactions themselves, these plans also emit the price and volume data for these transactions.  Information on each securities trade is sent to a central network at the Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC) where it is then distributed, consolidated with other trades on the same "tape".
There are three major tapes in the United States: Tape A and Tape B (which together are called the "Consolidated Tape"), and Tape C.

The continental shelf of Russia (also called the Russian continental shelf or the Arctic shelf in the Arctic region) is a continental shelf adjacent to Russia. Geologically, the extent of the shelf is defined as the entirety of the continental shelves adjacent to Russia's coast. In international law, however, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea more narrowly defines the extent of the shelf as the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas over which a state exercises sovereign rights.
The Siberian Shelf in the Arctic Ocean is the largest (and least explored) of the Russian shelves, a region of strategic importance because of its oil and natural gas reserves.The Battle for the Next Energy Frontier: The Russian Polar Expedition and the Future of Arctic Hydrocarbons, by Shamil Midkhatovich Yenikeyeff and Timothy Fenton Krysiek, Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, August 2007 Other parts of the Russian shelf are typically named after the corresponding seas: Barents Shelf (Barents Sea Shelf), Chukchi Shelf (Chukchi Sea Shelf), etc. With the exception of internal Russian seas, these geological shelves are shared with other countries which share the corresponding seas. For example, the Chukchi Shelf is shared between Russia and the United States according to the 1990 USA-USSR maritime boundary.

CATEGORIES: House of Reginar, Counts of Louvain, 1054 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Lambert II (died Tournai, June 19, 1054) was count of Louvain between 1033 and 1054. Lambert was the son of Lambert I of Louvain (d. 1015).
According the Vita Gudilae (recorded between 1048–1051) he followed his brother Henry I of Louvain. 
Lambert scorned both temporal and spiritual authorities and in 1054 even took up arms against Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. He was defeated and lost his life at Tournai. 
During his reign Brussels began its growth. Lambert arranged to transfer the remains of Saint Gudule to the St. Michael church. This church, thereafter known as Saints-Michel-et-Gudule, developed to become St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral. Lambert also constructed a fortress on the Coudenberg hill.
Since Lambert II died in 1054, an imperial charter of September 1062 connecting a certain Lambert to the county Brussels, is probably referring to another person.

[[Jiankou]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Beijing, Great Wall of China, Visitor attractions in Beijing

Jiankou ([tpl]zh|c=箭扣|p=Jiànkòu[/tpl]) is a section of the Great Wall of China. This section is a photographic hotspot due to its unique style, steep mountains and beautiful scenery. 'Jiankou', is translated as 'Arrow Nock' in English, for the shape of the mountain is like an arrow, with the collapsed ridge opening as its arrow nock.
Jiankou Great Wall located in the Huairou District 73 km north of Beijing.  The Jiankou section of the Great Wall of China is located between the Mutianyu - ten kilometers to the east - and the Moshikou sections of the Great Wall of China. The Jiankou section of the wall was constructed in 1368 during the period of the Ming Dynasty.  It is made of large white rocks which can be seen from a great distance. Jiankou retains its original appearance since its construction, and is an ideal place for adventurous and experienced hikers and photographers.
This section of the Great Wall of China has fallen into disrepair and this, along with its location along a mountain ridge bordered by jagged cliffs and steep drop-offs, makes the Jiankou segment of the Great Wall of China potentially dangerous to climb. The section is more easily reached from villages like Xizhazi (西栅子) and Jiushuikeng (旧水坑) at the north side of the wall, locally known as Hou Jiankou (后箭扣), than from the south, called Qian Jiankou (前箭扣). The climb from the north goes up just over 100 meters in about a one kilometer hike, whereas from the south the climb is about 450 meters up over a horizontal distance of also one kilometer.
There are many scenic sites along the Jiankou Great Wall of China, one of which is the watch tower known as "The Eagle Flies Facing Upward" (鹰飞倒仰 / 鷹飛倒仰). This tower appears extremely high as it was built on a mountain which forms the highest section of the Jiankou Great Wall. The eagles can only do so facing upwards before reaching the top of the tower when they pass through here.
The "Sky Stairs" is another famous scenic spot with a precipitous stair whose angle of elevation is 70 to 80 degrees. The stairs are so narrow that it is barely possible to obtain a foothold.  
Other scenic areas include the Beijing Knot (the meeting point for three walls coming from different directions), the Nine-Eye Tower (a watchtower with  three layers, and nine holes which look like nine eyes on each side), the Zhengbei Tower (a good place to watch the sunrise and the sunset), the Cloud Stairs (a section of the Jiankou Great Wall which rises like a staircase into the white clouds), and many other watch towers.
Because of its connection with Mutianyu, along with its relative sparseness in visitors, the Jiankou-Mutianyu trail is one of the most popular Great Wall hikes today.

[[Laneshaw Bridge]]

CATEGORIES: Towns and villages in Pendle, Civil parishes in Lancashire

Laneshawbridge (otherwise Laneshaw Bridge) is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Pendle. It is to the east of Colne in Lancashire and is the easternmost settlement in Lancashire on the main road route, before the North Yorkshire border.
The roots of Laneshawbridge, or “The Brig” as it is affectionately know by the locals, date from the time of William the Conqueror, when he gave some land to the Emmott family, which they still own. It is thought that the family were given land for their military support,[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] and founded a hamlet known as “Eamot” which later became Laneshawbridge. The family resided at Emmott Hall, the first of which dated back to 1310, but it was to be modified, rebuilt and finally demolished in 1967.
Near to where the hall stood is Emmott House, which was a coach house to the main hall and dates back to 1737. In the 1990s, the old boating lake was dug out to create Hullow’n Fishery, and this is run by the Choyce family for sporting purposes.
Next to the lake is Hullow’n Well which has its own history. It has been claimed that this the Eamot where in AD 926 King Athelstan, confirmed a treaty of peace between the Welsh, Scots and Northumbrians.[tpl]Citation|last=Wilkinson|first=Thomas T|year=1857|title=Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, Volume 9|page=31|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=18ExAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2012-05-17[/tpl]
The Emmotts owned much of the village, and provided a school, as well as St Andrew's Church, both of which are residential properties to this day.[tpl]Clarify|date=May 2010[/tpl]
It would also appear that the family had a public house which was probably used as a shooting lodge. The first village inn, possibly called "the Rochester" is rumoured to be what is today Rye Flatt Farmhouse which has just been restored to be the village's only bed and breakfast.
A trip up Emmott Lane will take you past the village park, around which the village is built, to the Alma Inn.

Windsor Community Museum is a historical museum located in Windsor, Ontario, Canada which displays the city's rich and colourful past. It is located in the historic François Baby House, built in 1812 by François Baby, a prominent French-Canadian (which is now designated as a National Historic Site).http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage-display.aspx?id=9557 Canadian Register of Historic Places 
The Museum was originally named the Hiram Walker Historical Museum due to the large amount of money donated by the Hiram Walker and Sons Limited for the restoration of the Baby House. In 1991 the Museum’s name was changed to the “François Baby House: Windsor’s Community Museum” in an attempt alleviate confusion between the Museum and the Hiram Walker Brewing Company. Also, the name did not accurately reflect the Museum's aim or purpose. Finally, in 1996 the Museum was given its present name. 
The building now houses over 15,000 artifacts and documents which hold particular importance to the history of Windsor and the greater Essex County, Ontario region. The Museum was originally founded in 1958 by local amateur historian and merchant, George Fortune Macdonald (1877-1959) and is now administered by the City of Windsor. The Museum also runs and operates the Interpretation Centre located behind the Duff Baby House. This particular building is used mostly for educational programs.

[[Pratiloma ujjayi]]
CATEGORIES: Pranayama

Ujjayi meaning 'victorious' is an integral type of Pranayama, breathing exercise, used in yoga. It is often called the psychic breath because of its effects on the mind state. Pranayama techniques should be studied with a qualified teacher to ensure correct practice.
Simple Ujjayi is achieved by consciously restricting the flow of air through the larynx producing a 'just audiable' snoring sound, like whispering with the mouth closed or breathing through a straw. Although a valuable practice in its own right there are several variations, one of which is Pratiloma Ujjayi.
Pratiloma Ujjayi utilises alternate nostril breathing and Ujjayi in a way that balances and centres the body/mind and extends the length of the breath. In this description there is no breath retention. Retention is a more advanced stage and again should be studied with a qualified teacher.
The body should be steady, shoulders back, relaxed and away from the ears, the back and neck long, this opens the chest to allow unrestricted breathing.
Left hand in Jnana mudra and right hand in Vishnu or Mrgi mudra. The right hand is taken to the nose and the thumb used to block the right nostril and the ring finger to block the left.

Cava is an uninhabited island in the Orkney archipelago in Scotland. It is [tpl]convert|107|ha|sqmi|2[/tpl] in extent and rises to [tpl]convert|38|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level. The literal meaning of the name is 'calf island', a terminology often used to designate a small island near to a larger one. Cava is unusual in that it includes a small peninsula joined to the main body of the island by a narrow isthmus, which is in turn called 'Calf of Cava'.
It is situated in the Scapa Flow just offshore from the much larger island of Hoy. Nearby are the islets of Rysa Little and Fara and the skerry Barrel of Butter. To the south of Cava, between Fara and Rysa Little lies Gutter Sound, the scene of the mass-scuttling of the interned German Imperial High Seas Fleet in 1919.
In the eighteenth century a notorious Orkney pirate, John Gow, raided Hall of Clestrain, in Orphir and abducted two servant girls. Reports vary as to their treatment, with one claiming that they were put ashore on Cava "so loaded with presents that they soon afterwards got husbands.""John Gow - The Orkney Pirate" Orkneyjar. Retrieved 11 Mar 2012. Gow's ship Revenge then ran ashore on the Calf of Eday, leading to his capture.Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 388

The summit of Sugarloaf Mountain itself is accessible from a hiking trail that climbs its eastern slope; this trail is closed during the winter season and is suitable for those with intermediate hiking experience.  At the summit, a viewing platform provides hikers with a vista of the Restigouche River valley including the City of Campbellton, village of Atholville as well as other rural communities in New Brunswick and Quebec.
Sugarloaf Provincial Park has an alpine ski resort on another mountain ridge that is adjacent to but separate from Sugarloaf Mountain.  During the winter months, the alpine ski resort offers a variety of alpine skiing for all enthusiasts ranging from beginner to expert, as well as other winter activities such as snowshoeing, cross country skiing, ice skating, snowmobiling, and sleigh rides.  During the summer months, the resort still operates its ski lift so that park visitors may ride it to take in vistas of the river valley.  The alpine ski hill also offers a downhill mountain bike park as well as an alpine slide.
On 9 November 1924 two young women fell to their deaths on the steep almost vertical north slope of Sugarloaf Mountain facing the City of Campbellton.  The two women, Mrs. Edmund MacLean (age 19) and Miss Lottie Ramsay (age 17), were sisters and had reportedly left their homes at approximately 4pm when they apparently decided to hike the mountain during a light snowfall.  A search began later that evening when they had not returned to their homes.  The following morning, searchers followed the footprints of the two women in the snow to the summit of the mountain and discovered that they ended near the cliff.  Their disfigured bodies were discovered below the cliff, approximately six to seven hundred feet from the summit.  Two crosses (white on red background) have been painted on the north slope of Sugarloaf Mountain near where the bodies of the two women were discovered as a continuous memorial to the only known deaths on this mountain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.destinationrestigouche.ca/sites/default/files/crossesEng.pdf |title=The Story Of The Crosses On Sugarloaf Mountain |accessdate=2013-01-14[/tpl]

[[Ivychurch]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Kent, Civil parishes in Kent

For Ivychurch, Wiltshire, see Ivychurch Priory
Ivychurch is a village and civil parish in the Shepway District of Kent, England. The village is located on the Romney Marsh, three miles (4.8 km) north-west of New Romney. The parish council consists of five members.Ivychurch Parish council
The parish is huge and spreads across the marsh down to the Kent ditch (the boundary between Kent and East Sussex) although its population is only some 170, 50% of whom live in the village. The shape of the parish is rather unusual as it follows the parcels of land to the south-west which were progressively 'inned' (drained) in the 12th century onwards.
Due to its size and space, St. George's is known as 'the Cathedral of Romney Marsh' and is mainly a 14th-century building with a seven bay arcade built in the late Decorated style of English architecture. The body of the church dates from around 1360 with the Perpendicular-style tower and west end being added about 100 years later. There are some remains/ reminders of an earlier, Early English, church which are mainly found at the east end and the first Rector is recorded as taking up his post in 1242. The building is mainly constructed of Kentish ragstone but some Caen stone from the earlier church can also be found as can many wave-rolled flints which are a reminder of the close proximity of the English Channel. The nave is particularly impressive as it is empty of seats and the space is put to uses such as exhibitions, concerts, barn dances and the annual Harvest Supper. The recently restored north aisle (originally the Lady Chapel) is now a Museum of Rural Life.
The pub, The Bell Inn, acts as a centre point for many village activities, hosting local morris men groups and inviting many local musicians to showcase their talents. The Bell presents a very popular beer and cider festival every year.

[[Dam failure]]
CATEGORIES: Dam failures

A dam is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or slows down the flow, often creating a reservoir, lake or impoundments. Most dams have a section called a spillway or weir over which, or through which, water flows, either intermittently or continuously, and some have hydroelectric power generation systems installed.
Dams are considered "installations containing dangerous forces" under International Humanitarian Law due to the massive impact of a possible destruction on the civilian population and the environment. Dam failures are comparatively rare, but can cause immense damage and loss of life when they occur.   In 1975 the failure of the Banqiao Reservoir Dam and other dams in Henan Province,  China caused more casualties than any other dam failure in history.  The disaster killed an estimated 171,000 peopleOsnos, Evan. "Faust, China, and Nuclear Power," The New Yorker, Wednesday October 12, 2011.

An anti-fascist, Stepper-Tristis traveled extensively throughout Europe, preaching pacifism and drawing support for the League of Nations. He lived for a while in France, but was mostly reduced to homelessness and vagabondage. He joined the French Resistance following the occupation of France by Nazi Germany, was captured, and probably died in a concentration camp.

[[Vivaldi antenna]]

CATEGORIES: Radio frequency antenna types

A Vivaldi antenna is a co-planar broadband-antenna, which is made from a dielectric plate metalized on both sides.
The feeding line excites a circular space via a microstrip line, terminated with a sector-shaped area.
From the circular resonant area the energy reaches an exponential pattern via a symmetrical slot line.
Vivaldi antennas can be made for linear polarized waves or – using two devices arranged in orthogonal direction – for transmitting / receiving both polarization orientations.
If fed with 90-degree phase-shifted signals, orthogonal devices can transmit/receive circular-oriented electromagnetic waves.
Vivaldi antennas are useful for any frequency, as all antennas are scalable in size for use at any frequency. Printed circuit technology makes this type antenna cost effective at microwave frequencies exceeding 1 GHz.
Advantages of Vivaldi antennas are their broadband characteristics (suitable for ultra-wideband signals), their easy manufacturing process using common methods for PCB production, and their easy impedance matching to the feeding line using microstrip line modeling methods.
The MWEE collection of EM simulation benchmarks includes a Vivaldi antenna.[tpl]cite web|title=Vivaldi Antenna|url=http://www.cst.com/Content/Applications/Article/15|publisher=CST Computer Simulation Technology[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The 2000 CAD Benchmark|url=http://www.microwave-eetimes.com/en/the-2000-cad-benchmark.html?cmp_id=7&news_id=17301185|publisher=Microwave Engineering Europe[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Design An X-Band Vivaldi Antenna|url=http://www.mwrf.com/Article/ArticleID/19382/19382.html|publisher=Microwaves and RF[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Characterization of Vivaldi antennas utilizing a microstrip-to-slotline transition|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel2/3094/8735/00385130.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Dual-orthogonal polarized Vivaldi Antenna for Ultra Wideband Applications|url=http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/documents/688417[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Vivaldi antenna|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7088300.html[/tpl]

The Underage Festival is a music festival which takes place in Victoria Park, London. It is open to 13 to under 17 year olds,  and only those within this age limit are allowed entry to the festival. In the two years since its creation, the festival has taken place at the beginning of August each year. There are five main stages, the Converse Century Main Stage, the NME Stage, the Topman New Music Stage, the Domino Stage (aptly named the "Domino 15th Anniversary Stage" for the label's 15th anniversary of creation in 2008), and the Red Bull Bedroom Jam Stage. As well as this, some of the smaller features included the Habbo Dj Tent, the CM Tower Hamlets Music Space Stage, and the Artrocker Signing Tent. 2008's event also included a MySpace bus, where secret sets and interviews with bands took place.
The festival evolved out of a series of club nights held in the Elephant and Castle area of South London, hosted and organised by Sam Kilcoyne, (the teenage son of Barry 7 from Add N to (X) and current member of the band S.C.U.M) after he was refused admission to a Buzzcocks gig due to his age (he was fourteen years old at the time). These grew popular with preteens and teenagers, even receiving press coverage in broadsheet national newspapers (The Guardian, to name one) and the BBC's arts programmes who reported this as a "youthquake".

One of these activities was the set-up of a private intelligence organization, "The Firm" (Firmaet), in 1948, involved in PSYOPS against communist targets. One of these targets was the eavesdropping of leaders within the Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti (DKP). The firm managed to bug the apartment of communist vice-chairman Alfred Jensen for several years from the apartment below. Sejr's organization also produced "black letters," to stir up paranoia in the party. The DKP was further damaged by the defection of Aksel Larsen, who then formed his own political party in 1959, the Socialistisk Folkeparti (SF). Larsen, who had become disillusioned with communism at that time, co-engineered his defection with the Central Intelligence Agency, with contacts established by a member of The Firm, which already enjoyed a working relationship with the CIA. 
Although The Firm was disbanded in 1963, its eavesdropping program was revealed at the end of 1975, by former prime minister Jens Otto Krag.

Tony Williamson (b. Manchester 18 December 1932, died 19 June 1991) was a prolific British television writer, most active from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s.  He wrote primarily for the action/adventure and espionage genres.  Perhaps because of his early involvement inThe Avengers, he often found work on shows that featured fantasy adventure, rather than the kitchen sink realism that had arisen in Britain at the start of his career.  Series with extraordinary lead characters in unusual circumstances, such as Department S, Jason King, Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) and The Adventurer, dominated his output.
He has been credited with creating the short-lived dramas Intriguehttp://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/overview6.htm A to Z of TV.  television.co.uk. and Counterstrike, as well as being a key player in the development of Adam Adamant Lives!.

In 1836 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna, where in 1864 he became a full professor. 
He is remembered for his pioneer investigations of the central nervous system, particularly his studies involving nerve fiber localization, direction and degeneration.http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_rO4ZFpUcgC&pg=RA1-PA284&lpg=RA1-PA284&dq=%22Ludwig+T%C3%BCrck%22+degeneration&source=bl&ots=re9IJ5wEvE&sig=96he0cFYtXjHLSqA_Bre62piFTs&hl=en&ei=5uYZSuSRC5q0NdCQhJMP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4 The human brain and spinal cord by Edwin Clarke and Charles Donald O'Malley His name is lent to the "bundle of Türck", which are uncrossed fibers forming a small bundle in the pyramidal tract. Today this bundle of fibers is usually called by its clinical name: the anterior corticospinal tract. In medical literature, the terms "Türck's bundle", "Türck's column" and "Türck's tract" are also used for the anterior corticospinal tract.http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?Turck's+bundle Mondofacto Dictionary
During the latter part of the 1850s, Türck, along with physiologist Johann Nepomuk Czermak (1828-1873) were responsible for introducing the laryngoscope into medicine. Among Türck's assistants and students in Vienna were laryngologists Karl Stoerk (1832-1899), Leopold von Schrötter (1837-1908) and Johann Schnitzler (1835-1893).

[[Moral Minds]]

CATEGORIES: 2006 books, Books about evolution, Ethics books

Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong is a 2006 book by former Harvard psychologist Marc Hauser in which he develops an empirically grounded theory to explain morality as a universal grammar. He draws evidence from evolutionary biology, moral and political philosophy, primatology, linguistics, and anthropology.[tpl]cite book|title=Science Set Free: 10 Paths to New Discovery|authors=Rupert Sheldrake|date=2013|isbn=978-0770436704|publisher=Deepak Chopra Books|location=New York|pages=311|quote=Hauser is the author of a book called Moral Minds: The Nature of Right and Wrong (2007), in which he claims that morality is an inherited instance, produced by evolution and independent of religion."[/tpl]
Hauser uses artificial moral dilemmas as a research strategy. The reason is that people already have moral judgments of real world cases such as abortion and euthanasia, so there is no intuition left. In artificial moral dilemmas intuition plays an important role. A second advantage of artificial cases is that they can be subtly modified to observe the effects on moral judgments on people. There is an internet version of the test called the Moral Sense Testhttp://moral.wjh.harvard.edu/index.html which is aimed at a worldwide public.

[[Contract field team]]

The Contract Field Teams program (also called Contractor Field Teams and commonly abbreviated CFT) is a program of the United States Air Force designed to provide temporary and long-term labor support for a variety of technical service needs; maintenance and repair, depot services, inspections, modernization for contingency support for aircraft, vehicles, weapon systems and other equipment.  The CFT program is currently administered by the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center at Tinker Air Force Base, and has been in place since 1951.thumb|200px|Seal of the Department of the Air Force thumb|200px|Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center Shield
The official USAF definition of CFT is: "A group of skilled contractor maintenance personnel who are provided with government furnished special tools, equipment, and supplies to accomplish maintenance on site at operational bases. The contractor provides supervision, people and hand tools."
Under the CFT program, a series of contracts is awarded to various contractors, from which separate task orders will later be issued.  To win a CFT task order the contractor must be able to demonstrate that it can assemble the necessary personnel and deploy them to the directed site within a short time frame (generally 30 days from notification).  The task orders may involve recurring effort (such as augmenting a depot workforce with certain skill positions for a specified period of time, usually an entire calendar year) or nonrecurring effort (such as installation of field kits on selected systems at a military installation).  Usually all the contractors are eligible to bid on any task order; however, the USAF reserves the right to award a task order to a contractor without competition.
Although the program is administered by the USAF, all branches of the military are eligible to use the CFT program for their needs, as well as some civilian agencies.

The Battle of the Gulf of Riga was a World War I naval operation of the German High Seas Fleet against the Russian Baltic Fleet in the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea in August 1915. The operation's objective was to destroy the Russian naval forces in the Gulf and facilitate the fall of Riga to the German army in the later stages of the Central Powers' offensive on the Eastern Front in 1915. The German fleet, however, failed to achieve its objective and was forced to return to its bases; Riga remained in Russian hands until it fell to the German Army on 1 September 1917.

Per Tommy Jansson (2 October 1952 – 20 May 1976) was a motorcycle speedway rider. He was one of Sweden's most exciting speedway prospects in the 1970s but was killed in the Swedish Final a World Championship Qualifying Round meeting.Oakes, P.(2004). British Speedway Who's Who.  ISBN 0-948882-81-6
He was the son of former Swedish International speedway rider Joel Jansson. His brother Bo (Bosse) Jansson was also a speedway rider. He rode Smederna, in Sweden. And also had had a few meetings for the Wimbledon Dons in 1976
He initially appeared in the UK on 23 July 1970 while touring with the Young Sweden team, in a British League Division Two test series, at Teesside, scoring 10 points.

He came back to England in 1971 to ride for the Wembley Lions making his debut on 9 April, in an away match against Wolverhampton, where he scored 6 points. But his stay with the 'Lions' only lasted for three British League Division One matches. Although he did continue to race in the UK for the Young Sweden touring team, against Young England in a British League Division Two test series.

CATEGORIES: 1973 World Rally Championship season, Rally GB, 1973 in British motorsport

The 1973 Daily Mirror RAC Rally was the 22nd running of the British rally, and the twelfth round of the inaugural World Rally Championship season.  Run in mid-November in the County of Yorkshire in England, the rally was run primarily on gravel, with some sections of tarmac as well.  The rally carried the name of its title sponsor, a popular British newspaper, The Daily Mirror.
In 1973, and for several years afterward, only manufacturers were given points for finishes in WRC events.  Britain was home terrain for the Fords and the RS1600 wrapped up all three podium spots.  While both Alpine Renault and Fiat finished in the points, neither had their points applied to championship standings.  This however didn't hurt either one's chances, as they still placed first and second respectively at the end of the season.

 How will the legend of the age of trees

Feel, when the last tree falls in England?

When the concrete spreads and the town conquers

The country’s heart; when contraceptive

Tarmac’s laid where farm has faded,

Tramline flows where slept a hamlet,

And shop-fronts, blazing without a stop from

Dover to Wrath, have glazed us over?

Simplest tales will then bewilder

The questioning children, “What was a chestnut?

Say what it means to climb a Beanstalk,

Tell me, grandfather, what an elm is.

What was Autumn? They never taught us.”

Then, told by teachers how once from mould

Came growing creatures of lower nature

Able to live and die, though neither

Beast nor man, and around them wreathing

Excellent clothing, breathing sunlight –

Half understanding, their ill-acquainted

Fancy will tint their wonder-paintings

Trees as men walking, wood-romances

Of goblins stalking in silky green,

Of milk-sheen froth upon the lace of hawthorn’s

Collar, pallor in the face of birchgirl.

So shall a homeless time, though dimly

Catch from afar (for soul is watchfull)

A sight of tree-delighted Eden.

[[Broughton (name)]]
CATEGORIES: English-language surnames, Toponymic surnames

Broughton (pronounced Brottun) (or, alternatively and largely in New England, Broton) has two claimed origins as a name.
According to M. Leon Broughton, author of "Broughton Memoirs" (Copyright 1962, Second Edition):
"The name Broughton is often derived from the Saxon “Broc”, which means brook or broken land; and “Tun”, the dwelling or town.  In King Ethelred’s charter to the monastery of Shaftesbury, England, 1001 AD, Elfwig’s boundaries at Broctun are mentioned.  The Domesday Book of William the Conqueror, 1086 AD, describes thirty-four manors of Broctun, variously Latinized by the clerks of the records to: Brochthon, Brocton, Brotton, Broton, Brogton, and Broughton, perhaps according to the pronunciation peculiar to the localities where the manors where situated.
Later the spelling of Broughton seems to have generally been adopted.  There are about twenty distinct parishes besides hamlets and different localities in England that bear the name; and it is locally applied to a small parish in Canada, to an island in the Alatamaha river in Georgia, and also occurs in the states of South Carolina, Texas, and some of the New England states.  The Broughtons are now widespread throughout the United States, and the world."
Broughton may also come from an Old English word meaning 'stronghold'. It is also likely to be derived from “berg” (a hill), and “ton” (a town), both Saxon words.
This is the case in Lincolnshire, England. At this Broughton, the mound is near the west end of the village and may have been the site of a Roman station Pretorium from about 400 AD. Many Roman coins, bricks, tiles and other artifacts have been found in the area. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the name appears as Bertone. Dictionary of English Place-Names," A. D.

CATEGORIES: English farmers, 1796 births, 1862 deaths

Jonas Webb (10 November 1796 –  10 November 1862) was an English farmer and stock breeder who was responsible for developing the Southdown breed of sheep into its modern form. 
Webb was born in Great Thurlow in Suffolk but began farming in Babraham, Cambridgeshire in 1822. He acquired a flock of the then rare Southdowns from John Ellman of Glynde, Sussex and bred them to produce a strain of larger size, earlier maturity and improved fleece quality. 
By the 1830s he had become the leading breeder of Southdowns and in the 1840s and 1850s won prizes at virtually every annual Royal Agricultural Society exhibition, until in 1860 he won all six prizes offered by the society for rams. He achieved international recognition in 1855 at the Paris Universal Exhibition, winning a gold medal. Emperor Napoleon III admired his exhibits and was presented with Webb's prize ram in return.
Webb was also a noted breeder of cattle; his shorthorn herd was praised by contemporaries and won him several prizes. 
Webb died in 1862, shortly after breaking up his flocks and retiring. His sheep were exported all over the world, to countries including France, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. He was commemorated with a statue at the Cambridge Corn Exchange; it is now located in his home village of Babraham.

Pablo de Mugártegui, O.F.M., was a Basque Catholic priest and friar of the Franciscan Order, and a missionary in California during the 18th century. Along with Father Gregório Amúrrio, Mugártegui was a member of the Franciscan Province of Cantabria before he joined the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico 
When Father President Junípero Serra returned to California from Mexico on March 13, 1777, he brought Mugártegui with him. However, due to illness, Mugártegui had to remain at the Mission San Diego de Alcalá for some six months to recuperate. From that point forward he divided his duties between the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo until November of 1776 when he was called to the newly founded Mission San Juan Capistrano. The friar performed his first baptism at the new site on December 25 of that year. Mugártegui had long been considered a worthy successor to then Father President Fermín Lasuén and to that end the Missionary College elected him Vice-President (with authority to administer Confirmation) in an emergency on August 16, 1786.
Mugártegui continued in residence at Mission San Juan until November 13, 1789, at which time he retired to Mexico. By order of the Commissary General, Mugártegui presided at the Chapter of the College that had convened to elect a Guardian and Councillors on May 23, 1795.

[[Yellow After the Rain]]
CATEGORIES: Compositions for marimba, Compositions by Mitchell Peters

"Yellow After the Rain" is a composition for solo marimba, written by former Los Angeles Philharmonic principal percussionist Mitchell Peters. Peters reportedly wrote the work for his own private students, for whom he was unable to find musically interesting material that introduced four-mallet techniques.[tpl]Fact|date=August 2007[/tpl] The work is modal and employs many basic skills, introduced in a sequential manner.
After a metrically deceptive introduction, the main melody is stated in the right hand, with left hand accompaniment. This is immediately followed by a repeat of the melody with the left hand taking over the tune and the right hand assuming the accompanimental role. Throughout, the performer is able to maintain a consistent interval in the accompaniment (parallel P4).  Chordal rolls form a transition to the work's exciting "B" section, which utilizes single independent strokes with each hand fixed in the interval of a perfect fifth. The consistency of these intervals allows the performer to concentrate on the wrist and hand motions involved in the strokes without worrying about changing the spatial relationship of the mallets. After a recap of the right hand melody, the theme is stated in four-voice homorhythmic style, again maintaining the perfect fourth relationship (spaced a major second apart). A brief coda ends the work.
Virtually an entire generation of marimbists has been introduced to four-mallet techniques with this work, and it is likely that this legacy will continue, even as a wealth of excellent material joins it in the repertoire.

[[Cista]]
CATEGORIES: Ornaments, Numismatics

A cista (kiste) in the classical world was generally a casket, used for example to hold unguents or jewels. More specifically, in the Mystery cult, a cista mystica (literally "sacred chest") is a basket or chest used to house snakes.  Cistae mystica were used in the initiation ceremony of the cult of Bacchus or Dionysus, as well as an early gnostic sect called the Ophites.  Cistae mysticae appear on ancient Roman and Greek coins.
Furthermore small Cistas were worked in Etruria, contained in cylindrical bronze containers for domestic use and storage of toiletries. Their faces were usually adorned engraved with figures, soldered on the top small bronze figures.
The Cista could be realised with different materials like wicker, wood, rawhide, but above of all in metal, used from the 5th century. The Etruscans manufactured it in different qualities from the 5th century, at first in ovoid form with thrown scenes, and then in cylindrical form with engraved scenes. The handle of the lid consisted of little structures. One of the most important city of production of Cista is Preneste, an old city of Lazio, which realised different types of Cista from the 4th century.

St. Mary of the Annunciation Roman Catholic Church is the first Roman Catholic parish in the Carolinas and Georgia. The current building at 93 Hasell St. in Charleston, South Carolina, is the third structure to house the congregation on this site.
The property and an old building were purchased in 1789. It was incorporated as the Roman Catholic Church of Charleston by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1791. The first structure was replaced by a brick church that burned in the Charleston fire in 1838.
left|alt=The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin is one of the many beautiful paintings that adorn the church.The church was rebuilt quickly and reopened on June 9, 1839. It is a rectangular building, 84 ft (25.6 m) by 50 ft (15.2 m). It is built of brick with a stucco covering. There are four Doric columns that support a large entablature. The parapet wall at the top of the church was probably constructed around 1896. There are stained glass windows imported from Munich.
The nave has a central aisle and two large rows of pews. There are smaller pews along the side aisles. Above the altar, there is a painting of the Crucifixion by John S. Cogdell. The artist donated this painting to replace an earlier painting he had done in 1814, which was destroyed in the fire. Much of the interior of the church was renovated during a three month renovation in 1884.[tpl]cite news|title=Sunday in the City|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=0oeUc68sgesC&dat=18841006&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|accessdate=November 14, 2012|newspaper=Charleston News & Courier|date=October 6, 1884|page=8[/tpl]
The church graveyard is on each side and to the rear of the church.
In the early 1980s, the neighboring Charleston Place complex was constructed, bordering the church on all sides. It was the only structure preserved on the lot, besides the few storefronts facing Meeting Street which were incorporated in the parking structure.
The St. Mary's Church is on the National Register of Historic Places, No. 76001697.

Billy Al Bengston (born June 7, 1934 in Dodge City, Kansas) is an American artist and sculptor who lives and works in Venice, California. 
He was educated at Los Angeles City College Los Angeles, CA (1952), California College of Arts & Crafts Oakland, CA (1955), and the Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles, CA (1956).
After seeing the work of Jasper Johns at the 1958 Venice Biennale he adopted the motif of a set of sergeant's stripes. This recurring image was painted with industrial materials and techniques associated with the decoration of motorcycle tanks and surfboards.Thomas E. Crow, The Rise of the Sixties: American and European Art in the Era of Dissent, Laurence King Publishing, 2004, p80-81. ISBN 1-85669-426-7
Bengston encouraged viewers in the early 1960s to associate his art with  motorcycle subculture, for instance by straddling a bike on the cover of the catalogue for a 1961 show at Ferus Gallery.Cécile Whiting, Pop L.A.: Art and the City in the 1960s, University of California Press, 2006, p94. ISBN 0-520-24460-5 His interest in cars lead to Judy Chicago, one of his students, attending auto body school and using spray painting techniques. Thomas E. Crow draws attention to the deliberate contrast between Bengston's flamboyant, competitive, aggressively masculine stance and a delicate, modest approach to his art.
He has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (1967), the Tamarind Lithography Workshop (1968, 1982, 1987), and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1975).  His work is found in many public and private collections, including the Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris), Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (Los Angeles), Museum of Modern Art, New York (New York), Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York), The Corcoran Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.), and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York)
His first solo exhibition was at the Ferus Gallery in 1958.Otis College of Art Alumni Listing, accessed Aug 4, 2007 In 2010 at Samuel Freeman, Bengston recreated this first solo exhibition, including a scale replica of the Ferus Gallery inside Freeman's space.http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/02/art-review-billy-al-bengston-at-samuel-freeman-gallery.html

[[Alfred Machin (writer)]]
CATEGORIES: British sociologists, 20th-century British writers, 1888 births, Year of death missing, Councillors in Bedfordshire

Alfred George Fysh Machin (born 1888) was an early twentieth-century British writer on the evolution of societies. Writing at the time when Darwin's theory of evolution was being reappraised in the light of the discovery of Gregor Mendel's work and advances in our knowledge of genetics, he tries to make sense of society in evolutionary terms. 
In The Ascent of Man (a title he used long before Jacob Bronowski made his famous television series of the same name), he compares the ideas of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer in particular, with reference to Benjamin Kidd. The book is notable for his theory that the ills of society, and in particular mental illness, are caused by the increasing demands of society on the human organism which is adapted for life in small, unpoliced, communities of equals, rather than the constraining power structures of modern societies which leave man anything but free. This line of thought would later be expressed by Boris Sigis and Wilfred Trotter, and by Sigmund Freud in Civilisation and its Discontents

[[Voluntary Exclusion]]

CATEGORIES: Gambling and society

A Voluntary Exclusion Program (also known as Voluntary Self-Exclusion) is a policy enacted by several U.S. states and/or individual casinos as a method of addressing the issue of addictive and compulsive gambling. Some Canadian provinces such as Manitoba[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mlc.mb.ca/MLC/content.php?pageid=420&langdir=E|title=Voluntary Exclusion Program|publisher=Manitoba Lotteries Corporation|accessdate=30 July 2010[/tpl] and British Columbia also have similar programs.
In areas that have enacted VEP policies, an individual who is aware that they suffer from gambling addiction can voluntarily request that their name be added to the VEP list. If their application is accepted, the person in question becomes legally banned from all participating casinos within the VEP coverage area. If a person who has been added to the VEP list enters or attempts to enter a casino that participates in the VEP, they are immediately arrested and charged with criminal trespassing. In addition, any chips, tokens, credits or other winnings in their possession at the time of arrest can be confiscated or invalidated.
The participant must complete the form of their own free will and not be under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or prescription medication. Once enrolled, it is the responsibility of the VEP participant to stay away from gaming areas of the casinos. [tpl]cite web|title=Voluntary Exclusion Program|url=http://www.in.gov/igc/2331.htm|publisher=IN.Gov|accessdate=25 January 2013[/tpl]  Casinos do not enforce this.

CATEGORIES: The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show episodes

Jet Fuel Formula is the first and the longest  Rocky and Bullwinkle story arc. (Jet Fuel Formula covers forty episodes while the average story arc includes approximately sixteen.) It is also noteworthy in that it established most of the characters, themes, running gags, and other elements that would be employed in later stories and that would become so closely identified with the Rocky and Bullwinkle programs in the years since. The first few episodes contained a laugh track, which was removed when the episodes were released as part of Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends Complete Season 1.
In spite of the title, the story actually concerns the pursuit of a formula for rocket fuel.

They were the middle class who were educated in Spanish and exposed to Spanish liberal and European nationalist ideals. The Ilustrado class was composed of native-born intellectuals and cut across ethnolinguistic and racial lines—Indios, Insulares, and mestizos, among others—and sought reform through “a more equitable arrangement of both political and economic power” under Spanish tutelage. 
Stanley Karnow, in his In Our Image: America's Empire in the Philippines, referred to the Ilustrados as the “rich Intelligentsia” because many were the children of  wealthy landowners. They were key figures in the development of Filipino nationalism.Glossary: Philippines, Area Handbook Series, Country Studies, Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, LOC.gov (undated), retrieved on: July 30, 2007Grimsley, Mark.

Gopal Ganesh Agarkar (14 July 1856 – 17 June 1895) was a social reformer, educationist, thinker from Maharashtra, India during the British rule.
A close associate of Lokamanya Tilak, he was a co-founder of  the renowned educational institutes like New English School, the Deccan Education Society and Fergusson College along with Lokamanya Tilak, Vishnushastri Chiplunkar and others. He was the first editor of the weekly Kesari and founder and editor of periodical Sudhaarak. He was the second Principal of Fergusson College and served that post from August-1892 till his last breath.
Throughout his short life of just about 39 years, he exemplified impeccably high moral character, utter determination to attain one's goals, sacrifice, great courage and a total lack of greediness. He is considered as a model for any one who wants to be in public service  with unflinching devotion to his/her principles and a complete dedication to the work undertaken.
In his public life of just about 15 years, Agarkar made gigantic contributions to the field of social reforms and education and left an indellible mark on the social life of Maharashtra.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.in/books/about/Gopal_Ganesh_Agarkar.html?id=4NjZAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y |title=Gopal Ganesh Agarkar गणेश आगरकर |author=S M Garge मा गर्गे |date= |work= |publisher=National Book Trust, India |isbn=81-237-1745-8 |accessdate=[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Pistol and rifle cartridges

The .17 Remington Fireball was created in 2007 by Remington Arms Company as a response to the popular wildcat round, the .17 Mach IV. Factory loads drive a 20 grain (1.3 g) bullet around 4,000 ft/s (1,219 m/s). Velocity is close to the .17 Remington but with significantly less powder, and therefore less heat and fouling. Both are important issues to high-volume shooters such as varmint hunters.
It is based on the .221 Remington Fireball necked down to accept a .17 caliber bullet and is very similar to the .17 Mach IV. Reports on this cartridge show mild recoil, high velocity, with minimal report (noise).Which .17? by Jim Saubier

[[Goff Letts]]
CATEGORIES: 1928 births, Country Liberal Party politicians, Living people, Members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly

Dr Godfrey Alan (Goff) Letts CBE (b. 18 January 1928) was the Majority Leader of the Northern Territory of Australia from 1974 to 1977.
Born in Donald, Victoria, Letts attended Melbourne Grammar and Melbourne and Sydney Universities, graduating with a Bachelor of Veterinary Science in 1950. Letts gained employment with the Victorian Department of Agriculture and married Joyce Crosby on 29 November 1952. Together they had three sons and three daughters.Heatley, A. (1996) “Letts, Godfrey Alan (Goff)”, pp 192 – 194, Northern Territory Dictionary of Biography, vol. 3. Ed. Carment, D. & Wilson, H. NTU Press: Casuarina.
Letts moved to the Northern Territory in 1957, initially working in Alice Springs before transferring to Darwin as the District Veterinary Officer for the Northern Region of the Northern Territory. He was appointed Director of the Animal Industry and Agriculture Branch of the Northern Territory in 1963, Chair of the Northern Territory Wildlife Council and to the Northern Territory Lands Board in 1964. Awarded a Churchill Fellowship in 1966, Letts was appointed to the Northern Territory Legislative Council in 1967 as an official (non-elected) member representing the Department of Lands and Primary Industry before his growing disillusionment with the bureaucratic control of the Territory from Canberra led to him resigning from these positions in 1970 to enter private industry as a vet.
A founding member of the Northern Territory branch of the Country Party in 1966, Letts' high political profile in the Territory led him to successfully contest the Legislative Council seat of Victoria River for the Country Party at the 1971 elections and subsequently become leader of the Country Party in the Council. Following the announcement of the creation of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to replace the Council, Letts helped merge the Territory's Country and Liberal parties into the Country Liberal Party and led the CLP to victory at the 1974 election, winning 17 of 19 seats.  He was elected Majority Leader--the equivalent of a first minister in the federal and state governments.Powell, A. (1988)  Far Country: A Short History of the Northern Territory, Melbourne University Press, Carlton.  ISBN 0522843778.
As Majority Leader, Letts prepared the Territory for self-government as well as administering the day-to-day running of Territory affairs, and was generally considered a capable leader.  It was therefore surprising when he lost his seat at the 1977 election, even more so since it is almost unheard of for a major-party leader at the federal, state or territory level in Australia to lose his own seat.  Letts blamed his defeat on his long absences from his remote electorate on Majority Leader business.
Following his departure from politics, Letts served as Chair of the Board of Inquiry into Feral Animals in the Northern Territory from 1978–79, on the Advisory Council to the CSIRO from 1979–83 and on the Uranium Advisory Council from 1979-83.
He was pre-selected by the CLP to contest the Division of Northern Territory at the 1980 federal election but withdrew to accept the position of CEO of the Northern Territory Conservation Commission.
Made a Trustee of the World Wildlife Fund in 1981, Letts resigned from his position at the Conservation Commission in 1983 to stand as an independent for the Alice Springs based seat of Araluen at the 1983 Territory election, in opposition to the CLP's attitudes towards the Commonwealth and indigenous people. Following his loss at the poll, Letts left the Territory to work in his family's newspaper business in Victoria.
Known as the “Father of self-government”, Letts was awarded a CBE in 1978 for his services to the Territory and public administration.[tpl]cite web|title=LETTS, Godfrey Alan|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1065290&search_type=quick&showInd=true|work=It's An Honour|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=10 October 2007[/tpl]

[[Wrong Kind of Stone Age]]

CATEGORIES: New South Wales musical groups, Musical groups established in 1983, Australian post-punk groups, Musical groups disestablished in 1991

Wrong Kind of Stone Age was an Australian post-punk band formed in 1983 in inner-city Sydney by Gavin Williams (of Sydney punk band Identity X) and Miriam Williamson. The early Wrong Kind of Stone Age sound was a unique and wild fusion of post-punk attitude and bottom-heavy sonic distortion with strong dub and tribal influences, using Miriam's vocal range. They used occasional tape montage, didgeridoo, clarinet, or electronic noise.
Following some notorious inaugural performances, and the release of their first tape, Grace and Grossness,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=396598 |title=Poster, rock band, Wrong Kind of Stone Age |author=Powerhouse Museum |accessdate=27 May 2011 |publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Australia[/tpl] Wrong Kind of Stone Age soon attracted an appreciative audience, and built an enduring reputation. They regularly partnered with bands such as the Wet Taxis, Bloodloss, and Box of Fish; one show at the Rehearsal Room in Redfern attracted the Tactical Response unit. Wrong Kind of Stone Age supported the Dead Kennedys at Sefton, in Sydney’s west, on their 1983 Australian tour. Jello Biafra at the time described them as "one of the best morbid-ambient post-punk bands I've ever seen or heard".[tpl]cite web|last=Biafra|first=Jello|title=Dead Kennedys Tour Down Under|url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/australia/info/dktourreport.html|work=Kill From the Heart (originally published in Maximumrocknroll No. 10, 1983)|accessdate=26 May 2011|year=1983[/tpl]
The band's lineup shifted considerably in the first year or so of existence: alongside Miriam and Gavin could sometimes be found Drew Mayson, Andy Lonsdale, Jodi Grist, Jeremy Vermeesch, Geoff Nolan, and others.
By 1984, in time for their only vinyl recordings, the membership stabilized as Gavin Williams (guitar), Miriam Williamson (voice), Geoff Nolan (bass), Craig McLeod (drums). The Flying Low to Batavia EP was released in Sydney in 1984, and sold rapidly. For several years this highly acclaimed four-piece played at many infamous inner-Sydney venues, like The Britannia and The Sandringham, although only a handful of tracks would be recorded and released.
By the late 80s the style and the band members had shifted again: the sound became even more dub-infused, deprecating the 'grungy' bottom end and making stronger use of electronica and Middle Eastern-styled rhythms (while losing none of its uniqueness). The tribal lineup by the end of the decade consisted of Miriam and Gavin, with Bryce Cannon (percussion), Andy Rantzen (keyboards), and Drew Mayson (guitar). In 1989, Wrong Kind of Stone Age released a cassette LP, Traditional Musik,[tpl]cite web|title=Cosmic Conspiracy Productions|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Cosmic+Conspiracy+Productions|work=Discogs|accessdate=26 May 2011[/tpl] on the Cosmic Conspiracy Productions label which was noted as "a significant label"[tpl]cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Shannon|title=Experimental Music: Audio Explorations in Australia|year=2009|publisher=UNSW Press|location=Sydney|isbn=978-1-921410-07-9|page=78|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZOQqDz0Snm4C&lpg=PT92&ots=nbzeWlIlsu&dq=%22Cosmic%20Conspiracy%20Productions%22&pg=PT89#v=onepage&q=%22Wrong%20Kind%20of%20Stone%20Age%22&f=false|chapter="Copyright doesn't mean shit to me" : Sampling and appropriation in Australian experimental music and sound art|editor=Gail Priest|accessdate=26 May 2011[/tpl] by Shannon O'Neill in his article in Experimental Music: Audio Explorations in Australia. The band was playing live at venues such as the Evil Star (Evening Star Hotel), which O'Neill also mentions were where the Cosmic Conspiracy label events were held, organized by label owner and 2MBS-FM radio broadcaster, Alex Karinsky.[tpl]cite web[/tpl] Probably the most successful lineup, they were renowned for often spellbinding performances.
The band began to fragment in the early 90s. The last Wrong Kind of Stone Age performances were in 1991, with a hard-edged instrumental dub set, performed by Gavin Williams (guitar, rhythms, percussion), Drew Mayson (guitar), Andy Lonsdale (synthesizer, tapes, mixing).
Miriam Williamson recorded with Pelican Daughters, and Itch-e & Scratch-e (formed by Andy Rantzen and Paul Mac), in the early 1990s; she is creating new material as Princess Universe. Itch-e & Scratch-e, with Miriam, won an Aria award for their track Sweetness and Light (Itch-E & Scratch-E, Itch-E Kitch-E Koo, Second Nature/Volition, 1993). Wrong Kind of Stone Age samples are also used on Pelican Daughters recordings (Pelican Daughters, Fishbones and Wishbones, Silent Records, 1991: Pelican Daughters, Bliss, Silent Records, 1994). Wrong Kind of Stone Age tracks appear on several 1990s compilations—Go and Do It(1996), and Bloodstains Across Australia(1998).[tpl]cite web|title=Bloodstains Across Australia|url=http://www.lipstickkillers.com/comphell/baaustralia.html|work=compHELLation - A Punk Compilation Reissue Database|accessdate=26 May 2011[/tpl] Gavin Williams plays on the 1989 Browning Mummery track The Sorcerer's Philosophy, (Browning Mummery CD, Obelisk, 1996).

The Perlidae are a family of stoneflies, with a total of 84 species in 15 genera.http://bugguide.net/node/view/43174 The majority of the Perlidae are found in eastern North America, but they occur world-wide except for Antarctica and parts of Africa. Their lifecycles range between one and three years. They adults emerge in the summer; they are very active and known to be attracted to light sources. They are usually very sensitive to changes in environment. 
Perlidae are usually lotic and lentic erosional. They are found in cool, clear medium-sized to large streams and sometimes in larger, warm rivers that carry silt. They are crawlers and can move quickly. In still water, no water moves over their gills, so they move their bodies up and down to keep oxygen flowing over them.
They are engulfer-predators. They consume all types of invertebrates. Very young larvae are collector-gatherers.

[[Is He Dead?]]

CATEGORIES: 1898 plays, American plays, Works by Mark Twain, Plays set in France, Plays based on real people

Is He Dead? is a play by Mark Twain. Written by Twain in 1898, It was first published in print in 2003,[tpl]cite web|title=Is He Dead? A comedy in three acts|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10118.html|accessdate=2007-08-01[/tpl] after Mark Twain scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin read the manuscript in the archives of the Mark Twain Papers at the University of California at Berkeley. The play was long known to scholars but never attracted much attention until Fishkin arranged to have it published in book form. She later played a primary role in getting the play produced on Broadway. Contemporary American Playwright, David Ives adapted the play for the modern stage before its inaugural performance in 2007.[tpl]cite web|title=Playscripts Inc. - "Is He Dead?" adapted by David Ives|url=http://www.playscripts.com/play.php3?playid=1365|accessdate=2013-04-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Playscripts, Inc. - Production History - "Is He Dead?" adapted by David Ives|url=http://www.playscripts.com/productions.php3?playid=1365[/tpl] Is He Dead? is now published and licensed for theatrical use by Playscripts, Inc.playscripts.com
The play focuses on a fictional version of the great French painter Jean-François Millet as an impoverished artist in Barbizon, France who, with the help of his colleagues, stages his death in order to increase the value of his paintings, and afterwards dresses as a woman to keep his secret safe. Combining elements of burlesque, farce, and social satire, the comedy relies on such devices as cross-dressing, mistaken identities, and romantic deceptions to tell its story, which raises questions about fame, greed, and the value of art.
The play is similar to the short story "Is He Living, or Is He Dead?", also by Mark Twain.

Lucas Tanner is an NBC television drama that aired during the 1974-75 season.  The title character, played by David Hartman, was a former baseball player and sportswriter who becomes an English teacher at the fictional Harry S Truman High School in Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.  Episodes often deal with the resistance of traditional teachers to Tanner's unorthodox teaching style.
Regular co-stars included Rosemary Murphy, Kimberly Beck, and ten-year-old Robbie Rist. Unusually, the show was actually filmed in Webster Groves, rather than on a Hollywood backlot. That gave it a somewhat unusual "look" for a prime-time TV series.
A 90-minute pilot film of the series aired on NBC the week of May 4, 1974; the pilot also starred Kathleen Quinlan and Joe Garagiola.NBC TV Guide ad for week of May 4, 1974, at Vintage Toledo TV.
This series was Hartman's last television series as an actor—in November 1975, he began a long-running stint as co-host of ABC's Good Morning America.

Kakizome (書き初め, literally "first writing") is a Japanese term for the first calligraphy written at the beginning of a year, traditionally on January 2. Other terms include 吉書（kissho）, 試筆（shihitsu）and 初硯（hatsusuzuri）.
Traditionally, kakizome was performed using ink rubbed with the first water drawn from the well on New Year's Day. Seated facing a favourable direction, people would write Chinese poetry containing auspicious words and phrases such as long life, spring, or perennial youth. These poems were then often burned.  
In modern times, people often write out auspicious kanji rather than poems. School pupils up to senior high school are assigned kakizome as their winter holiday homework.
Each year on January 5, several thousand calligraphers gather at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo's Chiyoda-ku for a kakizome event that is widely covered by media.
The kakizome paper is usually burned on 14 January in the Sagicho festival. If the burning paper flies high, it is said that the person will be able to write a more fair hand.

[[Club América Reserves]]

Club América Reserves are the reserve team of Club América. It was founded as Socio Águila  with the purpose of creating a bond between the fans of América and the team itself through a series of exclusive benefits. One buys a membership to become a Socio (partner) Águila, and can be entered in drawings to win prizes, such as autographed jerseys, team apparel, posters, etc. There is even membership for children under 15, known as "Socio Águila Junior". Socio Águila was in the spotlight the last two weeks of the Apertura 2007 tournament. Due to the absence of the first team, which was in Argentina to play Arsenal de Sarandí in the Copa Sudamericana 2007 championship game, Socio Águila had most of its players called up to the first team. The Mexican sports press dubbed them "Las Águilitas" (The Little Eagles). The young players performed flawlessly, beating Necaxa and Monterrey in the final two weeks, and leading Ámerica to a spot in the repechaje (wild-card playoffs), where the true first team ultimately lost to Monarcas Morelia. The call-up of their players was the only positive note in a dismal season for Socio Águila in which they only won 2 games, tied 5, and lost 11, ending up with a measly 11 points out of a possible 51, making them the worst team in the Primera A. The next season saw better but not great results.
For the 2010 season, the club signed 2 important players like Mexican Jesus Reyes Monroy and the Spaniard Rubén Mesa Visiga. They won 5, tied 4, and lost 7. They finished 14th overall. By Apertura 2009, Socio Aguila changed to Club America U-20 and U-17.

[[Rhonda Volmer]]
CATEGORIES: Big Love characters

Rhonda Volmer is a fictional character in the HBO series Big Love, and is portrayed by Daveigh Chase. She is introduced in the series as the 15-year-old bride-to-be of Juniper Creek cult leader Roman Grant.
Rhonda has a complicated personality. Although extremely intelligent, she is a pathological liar, known to lie in response to even the simplest questions. She lived a very sheltered life. She frequently makes baseless accusations, especially if she believes it will garner the sympathies of those around her. She has a humble, trustworthy demeanor, but she is actually very calculating and manipulative. Rhonda has dreams of moving to New York and becoming a celebrity.   She is selfish and demanding.  She desperately wants people to like her but is unable to interact in a way that would actually encourage affection or friendship from anyone.
When Bill Henrickson and Nicolette Grant fled the Juniper Creek Compound, she stowed away in their truck. She has since stayed with the Henricksons, at a shelter, and with another family. At the beginning of season 3, Rhonda is living with a group of teenagers from the compound, including Bill's half-brother Frankie, but is later bribed by Adeleen to leave before she testifies.
She is partly responsible for the outing of Bill's family as polygamists at the end of season one. Rhonda is seen manipulating the family with lies, and learning about the situation with Barb entering the competition for Mother of the Year. Prior to the outing during the Mother of the Year event, Rhonda is seen giving Roman Grant a paper with a number, which he uses to call and inform an unknown person that the Henricksons are polygamists. After Roman makes his call, Rhonda smiles in satisfaction.
In season three Rhonda appears as a witness for the prosecution in the criminal trial for selling underage brides against Roman Grant.  Using her usual troubled but manipulative methods, she thinks she can lie on the stand to get the criminal conviction, then use that to secure a large civil verdict.  Bill tries to convince her she won't succeed.  Adaleen finds her and offers her thirty thousand dollars not to testify. She takes the money and hitchhikes to Los Angeles.
Episode four of season five introduces Rhonda as the wife of Cara Lyn's cousin, Verlan, and as mother to Verlan's child Jessica. In the sixth episode of season five, "D.I.V.O.R.C.E", Ben goes to the bar in which Rhonda has been hired as an exotic dancer/singer, and the two end up sleeping together. Ben later tells Rhonda that they cannot do what they did again.

[[LNG train]]

CATEGORIES: Liquefied natural gas, Liquefied natural gas plants

An LNG train is a liquefied natural gas plant's liquefaction and purification facility. 
In order to make it practical and commercially viable to transport natural gas from one country to another, its volume has to be greatly reduced. To obtain maximum volume reduction, the gas has to be liquefied (condensed) by refrigeration to less than -161 °C (the boiling point of methane at atmospheric pressure). This process also requires very strict safety measures and precautions during all liquefaction stages, due to the flammable nature of the gas involved. 
Since the numerous impurities that are naturally found in the raw gas freeze at low temperatures, and would thus block the cryogenic section of the plant, the gas has to be purified before it can be cooled down to cryogenic temperatures.www.adgas.com
Each LNG plant consists of one or more trains to compress natural gas into liquefied natural gas.  A typical train consists of a compression area, propane condenser area, methane, and ethane areas.www.mse.co.ukfreepatentsonline.com

Sérgio Dutra Santos, known as Serginho or Escadinha (born 15 October 1975 in Diamante do Norte), is a Brazilian professional volleyball player who plays in the libero position. In 2009 he became the first Libero to be named MVP in the World League (an honor which is usually given to spikers or setters).
He is widely regarded as one of the best liberos of all time and is unquestionably the best libero of the 2000s, with more awards than any other libero. Known for his outstanding service reception and digging capabilities, teams often attempted to avoid Sergio when serving. Beyond his defensive abilities, he was also capable of running the offense as a 'second setter' if the setter was forced to make the first contact. This was in large part due to Sergio playing the setting position while growing up and subbing in as a setter for his professional club teams over the years.
With Copra Piacenza he won the silver medal at the 2007–08 Indesit Champions League and also was individually awarded "Best Libero".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cev.lu/mmp/online/website/news/news_archive/news_archive_2008/news_archive_2008_03/11444_EN.html|title=KAZAN takes Indesit European Champions’ League title to Russia|author=CEV|accessdate=2010-06-10[/tpl]

The 11th Division (11. Division) was a unit of the Prussian/German Army.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as during the period of German unification (1866-1871) the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. It was formed in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) in November 1816 as a brigade, and became the 11th Division on September 5, 1818.Günter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabrück, 1993), Bd. 1, p.105; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deuschen Heeres (1905), pp.420-421  The division was subordinated in peacetime to the VI Army Corps (VI. Armeekorps).Wegner, p. 57.  The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.  The division was recruited primarily in the Province of Silesia, mainly in the region of Lower Silesia.

[[Galápagos hotspot]]
CATEGORIES: Hotspots of the Pacific Ocean, Galápagos Islands, Geology of Ecuador

The Galápagos hotspot is a volcanic hotspot in the East Pacific Ocean responsible for the creation of the Galapagos Islands as well as three major aseismic ridge systems, Carnegie, Cocos and Malpelso which are on two tectonic plates. The hotspot is located near the Equator on the Nazca Plate not far from the divergent plate boundary with the Cocos Plate. The tectonic setting of the hotspot is complicated by the Galapagos Triple Junction of the Nazca and Cocos plates with the Pacific Plate. The movement of the plates over the hotspot is determined not solely by the spreading along the ridge but also by the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and the Cocos and Nazca Plates.
The hotspot is believed to be over 20 million years old and in that time there has been interaction between the hotspot, both of these plates, and the divergent plate boundary, at the Galapagos Spreading Centre. Lavas from the hotspot do not exhibit the homogeneous nature of many hotspots; instead there is evidence of four major reservoirs feeding the hotspot. These mix to varying degrees at different locations on the archipelago and also within the Galapagos Spreading Centre.

[[Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (Australia)]]

CATEGORIES: Commonwealth Government agencies of Australia

The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) is an independent statutory office holder in the Commonwealth of Australia responsible for reviewing the activities of the six agencies which collectively comprise the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC). With own motion powers in addition to considering complaints or requests from ministers, IGIS is a key element of the accountability regime for Australia’s intelligence and security agencies.
There are currently six intelligence and security agencies which form the AIC, namely:
The office was formally established by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986  (the IGIS Act) and commenced operating on 1 February 1987.
The Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (OIGIS) is situated within the Prime Minister’s portfolio for administrative purposes, but as an independent statutory office holder, the IGIS is not subject to general direction from the Prime Minister on how the functions under the IGIS Act should be carried out.
The role and functions of the IGIS are set out in sections 8, 9 and 9A of the IGIS Act. These sections of the IGIS Act provide a legal basis for the IGIS to conduct regular inspections of the AIC agencies and to conduct inquiries, of varying levels of formality, as the need arises. The functions of the Inspector‑General do not include inquiring into the matters to which a complaint made to the Inspector‑General by an employee of an agency relates to the extent that those matters are directly related to the promotion, termination of appointment, discipline or remuneration of the complainant or to other matters relating to the complainant’s employment.
The IGIS:
The overarching purpose of these activities is to ensure that each AIC agency acts legally and with propriety, complies with ministerial guidelines and directives, and respects human rights.
The majority of the resources of the office are directed towards on-going inspection and monitoring activities, so as to identify issues or concerns before they develop into major problems which then require remedial action.
The inspection role of the IGIS is complemented by the Inspector-General’s inquiry function. In undertaking inquiries the Inspector-General has very strong investigative powers, akin to those of a Royal Commission.
Inquiries are conducted in private because they frequently involve highly classified or sensitive information, and the methods by which it is collected. The public ventilation of this material would be potentially very harmful to those persons involved in its collection, or compromise collection, neither of which would serve the national interest.
The AIC agencies are also subject to review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security as well as the Australian National Audit Office. Certain ASIO assessments can be appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a merits review of a decision. Proceedings can also be instituted against AIC agencies in the Courts.
Further information about the role and functions of the IGIS can be found by reference to the IGIS Act, and is also available from the IGIS Website.

Shangarai Chasset  (Shaarei Chesed) was a nineteenth-century New Orleans Orthodox (and later Reform) synagogue.  The synagogue was located on Rampart Street between St. Louis and Conti Streets (see picture of plaque, at site of original structure).  
The congregation was founded by Jacob Solis on December 20, 1827. The synagogue’s members were primarily Jews of  German background.  Around the same time the synagogue was founded, a related benevolent society was established with the same name, "Shaare Chessed,"  (the first interment therein was that of a Hyam Harris on June 28, 1828).  In 1881, the congregation merged with the Nefutzot Yehudah, (the Portuguese Sepharadic Synagogue), to form the present day Touro Synagogue.
Far from established Jewish communities, the congregation’s membership attempted to create a semblance of Jewish life and community in the new territory opened to them as part of the Louisiana Purchase.  Upon its founding, most Jewish people were reportedly indifferent and not affiliated with the synagogue.  Of those affiliated with the congregation, their level of observance was minimal.  Jacob Rader Marcus, a noted historian, comments that the lack of affiliation to the synagogue may have in part resulted in many of the Jewish men in the Louisiana Territory taking non-Jewish wives and having non-Jewish children.  However, the high intermarriage rate did not preclude the congregation from appointing men with gentile wives to leadership positions in the synagogue.  Despite shortcomings in their religious observance, their love of their religion, and service to their community was nonetheless noteworthy, as it paved the way for future generations of Jewish life in New Orleans.

[[Pablo Valencia]]

CATEGORIES: People from Arizona, American prospectors, Year of death missing, Year of birth missing

Pablo Valencia, a prospector, is remembered primarily for his extraordinarily close brush with death in August 1905. Valencia, en route with one Jesús Rios to an Arizona claim, realized belatedly that they had not brought enough water to sustain themselves, and sent his companion to secure more.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tw/06-27-96/outthere.htm |title=Out There: Hot Summer Reading |accessdate=[tpl]date|2011-06-20[/tpl] |last=Franklin |first=Kevin |date=[tpl]date|1996-06-27[/tpl] |publisher=Tucson Weekly |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080516083042/http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tw/06-27-96/outthere.htm |archivedate=[tpl]date|2008-05-16[/tpl] [/tpl] Rios did so, but afterwards could not find his partner for want of an agreed-upon meeting place; Valencia, consequently, found himself alone and waterless in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. In this state, he wandered for more than six days with nothing but his own urine and what moisture he could coax from a single scorpion to drink, growing ever weaker.Philbrick, Nathaniel. In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex. New York: Penguin Books, 2000. p 126 ISBN 0-14-100182-8. More dead than alive, he eventually reached the only source of water for miles in any direction, Tinajas Altas. There he was nursed back to health by W. J. McGee, who wrote of his ordeal in a paper, "Desert Thirst as Disease."

[[Helmet cover]]
CATEGORIES: Military camouflage

The helmet cover was first used by French soldiers during World War I.
Helmet covers are usually made out of canvas or cotton and come in many camouflage designs, for example: woodland, desert or urban, and different camouflage patterns like MARPAT, CADPAT and ACUPAT. It can also be used for UN peacekeeping missions with a UN Blue colour helmet cover.  Helmet covers are generally a flat colour to stop any reflection from a metal helmet. Helmet covers are attached to the helmet in many different ways, such as a tight rubber lip which goes all the way around the helmet rim and is pulled on and peeled off, also there are versions with draw-strings and types which are attached to the helmet suspension system. 
Helmet covers are used by most armies and are in the camouflage pattern of the country/military's camouflage pattern, but some armies do have different covers to the uniform, for example Austrian Bundesheer wear several different helmet covers and have not got one standardized cover for every soldier. The Israeli Defense Forces use a large, floppy helmet cover to break up the outline of the soldier.
Another type of helmet cover is the mesh net cover, which also helps reduce the metal glare from combat helmets as well as giving an opportunity to add natural camouflage such as grass, leaves and twigs. This type of cover is however not as widely used anymore, as the modern camouflage cloth covers in various patterns are more common on modern combat helmets.

Although cycloguanil is not currently in general use as an antimalarial, the continuing development of resistance to current antimalarial drugs has led to renewed interest in studying the use of cycloguanil in combination with other drugs.[tpl]cite pmid|8363372[/tpl]

[[Masona]]

Masona or MausonaAccording to Collins (Visigothic Spain, 155), his name is of African Berber origin (Massona or Massuna). (died circa 600/610) was the Bishop of Mérida and metropolitan of the province of Lusitania from about 570 (certainly by 573) until his death. He is famous for exercising de facto rule of the city of Mérida during his tenure as bishop and for founding the first confirmed hospital in Spain.
He was a Visigoth and originally an Arian, but converted to Roman Catholicism probably in the middle of the sixth century,Roger Collins, Mérida and Toledo: 550–585, in Edwards, 201. though some have supposed as late as 579. His biographer says he "was indeed a Goth, but was wholly devoted to God with very ready heart," i.e. Catholic.Thompson, The Goths in Spain, 25. He entered the church young and served from an early period in the Basilica of Saint Eulalia at Mérida, which had been rebuilt in her honour by Bishop Fidelis about 560. Masona is said to have had such a close relationship with Eulalia that by his prayers and her intercession a plague ravishing all Lusitania was lifted.Collins, Mérida and Toledo, 197. Though no writings of his survive, Masona was probably educated in a manner similar to men of classical learning, such as the contemporary Leander of Seville, with whom he shared an exile for a time.

The Swan Lake Nature Study Area (formerly called Lemmon Valley Marsh) is a small conservation area in Lemmon Valley, Nevada.  It contains marsh, alkali mud flats, and high desert.  The Lahontan Audubon Society describes it as "a nearly unspoiled wetland in the midst of suburban housing and warehouses" and designates it a Nevada Important Bird Area.  It is a notable location for birding; over 150 species have been observed there.Swan Lake, accessed August 1, 2007.
The Swan Lake Nature Study Area consists of over [tpl]convert|1800|acre|km2|0[/tpl] of land, with water supplied by the nearby Reno/Stead Sewage Treatment Plant.  The size of the actual wetland varies seasonally and yearly, depending on the amount of precipitation, between 100 and [tpl]convert|1000|acre|km2|0[/tpl].  It was formally dedicated as a nature study area in 1999, following several years of planning by Reno-area environmentalist/writer/photographer Bob Goodman.  The lead organization in planning and creating the conservation area was the Nevada Army National Guard, which contributed about [tpl]convert|360|acre|km2|1[/tpl] and performed preliminary ecological studies.  Other sponsoring organizations include: the Bureau of Land Management; the City of Reno; the Lahontan Audubon Society; Nevada Division of Wildlife; the Nevada Land Conservancy; Washoe County Parks and Recreation Department; and Washoe County School District.  Features include an observational boardwalk into the marsh and educational signs about the local ecology.April Conway, "Steady Hand Creates Reno's Swan Lake Nature Study Area", Land and Water, Vol. 48, No. 3.  Accessed August 2, 2007.
Swan Lake is located in the midst of the rapidly developing suburbs of Stead and Lemmon Valley, near Peavine Peak north of Reno.  According to a 1995 study, humans have lived in the area since as early as 400 AD;  Native American artifacts attributed to the Washoe people have been found in the area, indicating it to have been a wintering site.

Walker was involved in at least eleven slave trading voyages between 1784 and 1792, taking African captives from Sierra Leone to the British West Indies and the United States.

Bezhin Meadow ([tpl]lang|ru|Бежин луг[/tpl], [tpl]lang|ru-Latn|Bezhin lug[/tpl]) is a 1937 Soviet film famous for having been suppressed and believed destroyed before its completion. Directed by Sergei Eisenstein, it tells the story of a young farm boy whose father attempts to betray the government for political reasons by sabotaging the year's harvest and the son's efforts to stop his own father to protect the Soviet state, culminating in the boy's murder and a social uprising. The film draws its title from a story by Ivan Turgenev, but is based on the life of Pavlik Morozov, a young Russian boy who became a political martyr following his death in 1932, after he denounced his father to Soviet government authorities and subsequently died at the hands of his family. Pavlik Morozov was immortalized in school programs, poetry, music, and in film.
Commissioned by a Communist youth group, the film's production ran from 1935 to 1937, until it was halted by the central Soviet government, which said it contained artistic, social, and political failures. Some, however, blamed the failure of Bezhin Meadow on government interference and policies, extending all the way to Joseph Stalin himself. In the wake of the film's failure, Eisenstein publicly recanted his work as an error. Individuals were arrested during and after the ensuing debacle.
Bezhin Meadow was long thought lost in the wake of World War II bombings. In the 1960s, however, cuttings and partial prints of the film were found; from these, a reconstruction of Bezhin Meadow, based on the original script, was undertaken. Rich in religious symbolism, the film and its history became the focus of academic study. The film was extensively discussed both inside and outside of the film industry for its historical nature, the odd circumstances of its production and failure, and its imagery, which is considered some of the greatest in cinema. In spite of the failure of Bezhin Meadow, Eisenstein would rebound to win Soviet acclaim and awards, and become artistic director of a major film studio.

Rock Hudson's Home Movies is a 1992 documentary by Mark Rappaport.  It shows clips from Rock Hudson's movies that could be interpreted as gay entendres. Eric Farr speaks to the camera as if speaking Rock Hudson's words from a posthumous diary. Film clips from more than 30 Hudson films illustrate ways in which his sexual orientation played out on screen. First there are tenuous and unresolved relationships with women, then clips of Rock with men, cruising and circling. Second, there is pedagogical eros: Hudson with older men. Rock is seen with his male sidekicks, often Tony Randall. Next, the film looks in depth at comedies of sexual embarrassment and innuendo: films in which Hudson sometimes plays two characters, "macho Rock and homo Rock." Lastly, the film reflects on Hudson's death from AIDS.

Straight lines were smoothly rendered in real-time animation.  General principles of operation were similar to the systems used today - 4x4 transformation matrices, 1x4 vertices...  Possible uses included flight simulation (in the product brochure there are screenshots of landing on a carrier), scientific imaging and GIS systems.
The first LDS-1 was shipped to the customer (BBN) in August 1969.
Only a few of these systems were ever built. One was used by the Los Angeles Times as their first typesetting/layout computer. One went to NASA Ames Research Center for Human Factors Research.

[[Bear raid]]

CATEGORIES: Stock market, Finance fraud

A bear raid is a type of stock market strategy, where a trader (or group of traders) attempts to force down the price of a stock to cover a short position. The name is derived from the common use of 
bear or bearish in the language of market sentiment to reflect the idea that investors expect downward price movement.
A bear raid can be done by spreading negative rumors about the target firm, which puts downward pressure on the share price. This is typically considered a form of securities fraud. Alternatively, traders could take on large short positions themselves, with the large volume of selling ideally causing the price to fall, making the strategy self-perpetuating.

CATEGORIES: Visitor attractions in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, Natchitoches, Louisiana, Festivals in Louisiana, Christmas events and celebrations

The Natchitoches Christmas Festival (Festival of Lights) is held annually in Natchitoches, Louisiana on the first weekend in December. The Christmas festival is expanded throughout the community each year but is centered around the historic district of Natchitoches. The festival is a major tourist attraction for the area, drawing an estimated 100,000 visitors annually. It can be difficult to find a hotel, pushing many visitors into neighboring cities such as Winnfield and Alexandria.  Hotel prices can often jump into the hundreds for those who failed to make reservations. Front street, Jefferson, and Second Street constitute the main route of the Christmas Parade. The festival has been held the first Saturday in December since 1927. In 2013, the festival celebrates its 87th year of existence.
The official premiere of the Festival occurs on the first Saturday of December. Events include an early afternoon parade, an arts & crafts show, food booths along the river front selling Louisiana cuisine, including the famous Natchitoches meat pie, live entertainment, and a spectacular evening fireworks show accompanied with music and a laser show. At the end of the fireworks display (best in the State of Louisiana), the lights along Cane River are switched on - an incredible display of 300,000+ lights and 100+ riverbank set pieces. The lights continue to brighten the Cane River until after New Year's Day.
Country music singer Frank Foster will the Grand Marshall for 2013 and make an appearance in the parade as well as perform on December 7th at 4pm to 6pm, the Northwestern State University Marching Band, several high school marching bands, dance teams from around Louisiana, the winners of local beauty pageants including Miss Merry Christmas and the Christmas Belles, and, of course, Santa Claus. Schools as far away as Beaumont, Texas, have been known to send their marching bands to participate in the parade.
The Natchitoches Christmas Festival has appeared in several films, including Steel Magnolias, set in Natchitoches.
It is also a part of the Holiday Trail of Lights.

Twilight language is a rendering of the Sanskrit term [tpl]IAST|sāṃdhyābhāṣā[/tpl] (written also [tpl]IAST|sāndhyābhāṣā[/tpl], [tpl]IAST|sāṃdhyabhāṣā[/tpl], [tpl]IAST|sāndhyabhāṣā[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-bo|dgongs-pa'i skad[/tpl]) — or of their modern Indic equivalents (especially in Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Maithili, Hindi, Nepali, Braj and Khariboli).
As popularized by Roderick Bucknell and Martin Stuart-Fox in 1986, the notion of "twilight language" is a supposed polysemic language and communication system associated with tantric traditions in Vajrayana Buddhism and Hinduism. It includes visual communication, verbal communication and nonverbal communication. Tantric texts are often written in a form of the twilight language that is incomprehensible to the uninitiated reader. As part of an esoteric tradition of initiation, the texts are not to be employed by those without an experienced guide and the use of the twilight language ensures that the uninitiated do not easily gain access to the knowledge contained in these works.
The phrase "twilight language" has subsequently been adopted by some other Western writers. For example, according to Judith Simmer-Brown (2002): As has often been said, tantric texts are written in "twilight language" (sandha-bhasa, gongpay-kay), which, as the Hevajra-tantra states, is a "secret language, that great convention of the yoginis, which the shravakas and others cannot unriddle". This means that the texts of Buddhist tantra cannot be understood without the specific oral commentary by authorized Vajrayana teachers.[tpl]cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala Publications Inc.|location=Boston and London|year=2002|pages=169|isbn=1-57062-920-X[/tpl]

Mars Being Disarmed by Venus is the last painting produced by the French artist Jacques-Louis David. He began it in 1822 (aged 73) during his exile in Brussels and completed it three years later, before dying in an accident in 1825. He sent it to an exhibition in Paris from his exile, knowing that by then Romanticism was ascendant in the Salon. In 2007 it was displayed in the main hall of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, close to the entrance.  
At over 3 m (10 ft) high it is an imposing work. Set before a temple floating in the clouds, Venus the goddess of love and her followers, the three Graces and Cupid, are shown taking away the weapons, helmet, shield and armour of Mars the god of war. He allows himself to be disarmed and gives in to Venus's charms. Most of David's models for it were figures involved in the Théâtre de la Monnaie: Venus was modelled by the actress Marie Lesueur, Cupid by Lucien Petipa, Mars by a subscriber or 'abonné', and one of the Graces by the Prince of Orange's mistress.

The Handbook (formerly the Church Handbook of Instructions and earlier the General Handbook of Instructions) is a two-volume book of instructions and policies for leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The books are prepared by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the church. Along with the church's standard works (i.e., its scriptural canon), the Handbook stands as the preeminent policy and practice guide for the leaders of the LDS Church.Frank O. May, Jr., "General Handbook of Instructions", in Daniel H. Ludlow (ed), Encyclopedia of Mormonism, (New York: Macmillan Publishing, 1992) 2:541. The LDS Church only distributes copies of the handbook to individuals who fill certain leadership callings within the church hierarchy, although one of the two volumes is available for free on the church's official website.Peggy Fletcher Stack, "LDS Church handbook on social issues available online", Salt Lake Tribune, 2010-11-26.

[[Stock clearance]]
CATEGORIES: Process management

Stock clearance is an activity by a company where ownership of products and materials move on to another legal entity. These products and materials in stock clearance will not form the basis of a company's key activities. As such they are often end of line stock, surplus stock, returned stock or bankrupt stock.
A company will often pursue a non-profit making agenda when clearing stock, seeking a wider strategic advantage. This can be in the form of releasing storage space, releasing supervision of materials and equipment, ending technical support for a product. Many companies avoid channel conflict by selling anonymously through specialized stock clearance companies. In doing so they seek preservation of the existing corporate image.
Most companies from time to time end up with surplus goods, liquidated goods and bankrupt stock. This can be a costly problem. Stock Clearance is a process by which companies free up valuable money and space.
Reasons Leading to Stock Clearance
Cancelled orders or late deliveries 
Closing Down of business
Overproduction
Returns
Frustrated Stock (When importer or exporter decides to abandon the stock and leave it with the shipping company)
When customers are told that the reason for a price reduction is a stock clearance, they find this less attractive than other explanations such as a volume discount.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713770820&db=all |title= Effective methods of managing retail 'sales' |author=Bill Merrilees ;Kim Shyan Fam |doi=10.1080/095939699342697 |journal=The International Review of Retail Distribution and Consumer Research |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=January 1999 |pages=81–92[/tpl] This is because they suspect that the stock clearance indiactes that the products are of poor quality.
There are a number of companies that specialize in stock clearance. Clients can dispose of their surplus stock discreetly through companies such as stock buyers who will then re sell this stock to exporters, wholesalers, and smaller retailers. There are many benefits of using a stock clearance company to dispose of stock in this way. They generally have the cash available and the warehousing in place to offer a quick and efficient solution to stock disposal problems.

J. Raymond Jones (St. Thomas, Danish West Indies, 1899 - June 9, 1991 New York) was an African American New York City politician. He moved to New York City in 1918. Known as "The Fox," Jones was leader of Harlem's Carver Democratic Club.http://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/publicaffairsbooks-cgi-bin/display?book=9781610393010 A Mayor's Life: Governing New York's Gorgeous Mosaic He challenged Tammany Hall leader Carmine DeSapio twice, succeeding in 1964 in becoming Tammany's first black leader. In 1961 Jones supported the election of Robert F. Wagner Jr. as mayor of New York City, again in contrast to DeSapio. Jones served as mentor to many younger black politicians who later became prominent in New York politics. This group became known as the "Harlem Clubhouse". New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins said about Jones, "Without his counsel and guidance, Percy Sutton, Constance Baker Motley, Fritz Alexander, Charlie Rangel, Robert Weaver, and I might add, David N. Dinkins, would not have achieved as much. He was a true political pioneer and a deeply committed individual who dedicated his life to serving the people of New York."http://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/11/obituaries/j-raymond-jones-harlem-kingmaker-dies-at-91.html J.

In 1984, he and his son Robert collaborated in developing the 'Dubner cruncher', a board which used a commercial finite impulse response filter chip to speed up dramatically the multiplication of medium-sized multi-precision numbers, to levels competitive with supercomputers of the time, though nowadays his focus has changed to efficient implementation of FFT-based algorithms on personal computers.
He has found many large prime numbers of special forms: repunits, prime Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, twin primes, Sophie Germain primes, and primes in arithmetic progression.[tpl]cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Chris|title=Harvey Dubner|url=http://primes.utm.edu/bios/page.php?id=5|work=The Prime Pages|accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl]  In 1993 he was responsible for more than half the known primes of more than two thousand digits.
Dubner was also the first to publish a paper on the first blackjack point count (The High Low Count) which is used by most blackjack card counters today.  This was presented at the Fall Joint Computer Conference held in Las Vegas in 1963 at a panel titled "Using Computers in Games of Chance and Skill".

CATEGORIES: Debuggers, Operating system kernels

A kernel debugger is a debugger present in some kernels to ease debugging and kernel development by the kernel developers.  A kernel debugger might be a stub implementing low-level operations, with a full-blown debugger such as gdb, running on another machine, sending commands to the stub over a serial line or a network connection, or it might provide a command line that can be used directly on the machine being debugged.

CATEGORIES: Songs with music by Richard Rodgers, Songs with lyrics by Lorenz Hart, 1936 songs, 1930s jazz standards, Songs from Pal Joey (film)

"There's a Small Hotel" is a 1936 popular song composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Lorenz Hart. Originally written for but dropped from the musical Billy Rose's Jumbo (1935), it was then used in On Your Toes (1936), where it was introduced by Ray Bolger and Doris Carson and also interpolated in the film version of Pal Joey (1957) with a fine Frank Sinatra-Nelson Riddle collaboration.
According to the biography of Lorenz Hart by Frederick Nolan (Lorenz Hart - A Poet on Broadway, 1994; Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-510289-4),[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1VFwDk20BnUC&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=Lorenz+Hart+Stockton+Inn&source=web&ots=LeyEMfBEte&sig=W6FVRxonbHEyMC9sJFUQM_umvEs&hl=en |title=Lorenz Hart: A Poet on Broadway - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26[/tpl] the song was inspired by a visit that Richard Rodgers made to the Stockton Inn,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stocktoninn.com/ |title=http://stockton-inn-restaurant-bar-fine-dining-historic.eggzack.com |publisher=Stocktoninn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26[/tpl]  in Stockton, NJ.

[[Compact Disc bronzing]]

CATEGORIES: Compact disc, Materials degradation

CD bronzing is a specific variant of disc rot, a type of corrosion that affects the reflective layer of CDs and renders them unreadable over time. The phenomenon was first reported by John McKelvey in the September/October 1994 issue of American Record Guide.[ref]
</ref><ref name="Hirsch">
[/ref]
Affected discs show an uneven brownish discoloring that usually starts at the edge of the disc and slowly works its way toward the center. The top or label layer is affected before the bottom layer. The disc becomes progressively darker over time; tracks at the end of the disc show an increasing number of disc-read errors before becoming unplayable.
CD bronzing seems to occur mostly with audio CDs manufactured by Philips and Dupont Optical (PDO) at its plant in Blackburn, Lancashire, UK, between the years 1988 and 1993. Most, but not all, of these discs have "Made in U.K. by PDO" etched into them (see image). Discs manufactured by PDO in other countries do not seem to be affected. A similar, if considerably less widespread problem occurred with discs manufactured by Optical Media Storage (Opti.Me.S) in Italy. The problem is also prevalent with many discs that were manufactured by Nimbus during the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.
PDO acknowledged that the problem was due to a manufacturing error on its part, but it gave different explanations for the problem. The most widely acknowledged explanation is that the lacquer used to coat the discs was not resistant to the sulphur content of the paper in the booklets, which led to the corrosion of the aluminium layer of the disc, even though PDO later said it was because "a silver coating had been used on its discs instead of the standard gold." Peter Copeland of the British Library Sound Archive confirmed that silver instead of aluminium in the reflective layer of the CD would react with sulphuriferous sleeves, forming silver sulphate[tpl]dubious|date=October 2010[/tpl], which has a bronze colour. A combination of the two factors seems likely because, as Barbara Hirsch of the University of California points out, the oxidation could only have occurred if the protective lacquer did not seal the metal film and substrate well enough.
There are also isolated reports of CD discolouring with discs from other pressing plants, but these do not seem to be as widespread and may be due to other reasons than the manufacturing error that occurred at PDO. In particular, colour changes that occur along with the visible disintegration of the data layer (i.e. holes) are not typical of CD bronzing, but should be considered CD rot.
PDO also manufactured CDs that have an even yellowish-golden tint. This is due to a yellow dye in the disc and is unrelated to the bronzing effect.
As bronzing is a progressive effect that cannot be stopped, any PDO-manufactured CDs that are not yet showing any signs of bronzing by now are very likely safe.

Krishnan excelled in early student years and was given a fellowship to study in England. He completed his Ph. D. at the age of 26 and joined the Geological Survey of India and worked alongside Lewis Fermor, C. S. Fox, J. A. Dunn, A. M. Heron, H. C. Jones, and J. B. Auden in pre-Independence times.
He worked on stratigraphic mapping in Gangpur, Bonai, Bamra and Keonjar (parts of present Orissa State) and identified the 'Gangpur Series' published in GSI Memoir 71 (1937). He also worked on minerals of economic importance including iron, manganese ores, gypsum, mica, limestone and published his studies in the GSI Memoir 80 (1952). He also worked on the of the rocks of Girnar and Osham hills of Saurashtra (now in Gujarat), lateritization of the peculiar metasedimentary rocks called khondalite, the mineral resources of former Central Provinces and Berar (now forming parts of Madhya Pradesh), the geology of the Vindhyan formations of northern India, the Deccan traps, the Tertiaries of Tanjore (Tamil Nadu), and made observations on mythical rivers such as the Indobrahm and Saraswathi.
He taught geology at the Presidency College, Madras (1920–21), Forest College, Dehra Dun (1928–30) and the Presidency College, Calcutta (1933–35). At the suggestion of Cyril S. Fox of the Geological Survey of India he decided to work on a book on Indian stratigraphy. This resulted in the publication of Geology of India and Burma in 1943 and the Introduction to Geology of India in 1944. The first book has gone through 6 editions and has also been translated into Russian. He was the Director of Indian Bureau of Mines (New Delhi) from 1948 to 1951, Director of Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, during 1957–58, Head of the Geology and Geophysics Department, Andhra University, Waltair from 1958 to 1960, and helped found the National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad, of which he was the Director between 1961 and 1963.
He received the Padma Bhushan in January 1970 from the President of India, S. Radhakrishnan.

Dubgall mac Somairle (Modern Dubhghall mac Somhairle; Anglicized: "Dugald" or "Dougal, Somerled's son") was a 12th-century Scottish nobleman. The son of Somairle mac Gille Brigte, regulus of Argyll, Dubgall is the eponymous progenitor of Clan MacDougall (Clann Dubhghaill, literally "Children of Dougal" or "Dubgall"). 
According to the Chronicles of Mann, in 1155 he accompanied his father Somairle in an expedition against Goraidh mac Amhlaibh, King of Mann and the Isles.Lawrie, Annals, p. 20. In 1175, he was one of the Scottish magnates accompanying King William the Lion to York.Lawrie, Annals, p. 204; Woolf, "Age of the Sea-Kings", p. 105. In the same year, he and his chaplain Stephan made a pilgrimage to St Cuthbert at Durham, donating two gold rings to the Cathedral Priory.Lawrie, Annals, p. 204. The Chronicles of Mann alleged that the men of the Isles chose Dubgall to be their King, but this may have been a later concoction, and Dubgall is never given a title in any contemporary source.Woolf, "Age of the Sea-Kings", p. 105. It has been suggested that he was the founder of the bishopric of Argyll,McDonald, Kingdom of the Isles, p. 212. though more likely this took place under his brother Ragnall.Woolf, "The Age of Sea-Kings", pp. 105-6.
It is not known when Dubgall died. Dubgall is not mentioned again after 1175, but may have lived long afterwards, perhaps even into the 13th century.McDonald, Kingdom of the Isles, p. 73. He appears to have had the following sons, 
The last is uncertain. Gille Escoib appears in Haakon's Saga, which renders his name "Uspak", as a son of Dubgall upon whom is conferred the royal name Haakon; "Uspak" enjoyed a successful career, but it is not entirely certain that the Dubgall referred as his father is Dubgall mac Somairle.McDonald, Kingdom of the Isles, p. 89.

[[Learning pathway]]
CATEGORIES: Educational technology

Learning pathway is described as the chosen route, taken by a learner through a range of (commonly) e-learning activities, which allows them to build knowledge progressively. With learning pathways, the control of choice moves away from the tutor to the learner. "The sequence of intermediate steps from preconceptions to target model form what Scott (1991) and Niedderer and Goldberg (1995) have called a learning pathway. For any particular topic, such a pathway would provide both a theory of instruction and a guideline for teachers and curriculum developers" [tpl]Harv|Clement|2000[/tpl].
"Interactive courseware aids learners to access information and tools by which they can construct personalized transitions between the information to be accessed and their own cognitive structures. The process of navigation enables learners to experience the content of interactive courseware. Learning pathways also reveal the learning trails while learners traverse any interactive environment. Since learners have unique knowledge structures based upon their experiences and abilities, the ways that they choose to access, interact, and interrelate messages in interactive courseware also vary. Studies on pathways help us to explore and explain human behaviors during learning processes" [tpl]Harv|Jih|1996[/tpl].
Another well known definition of a learning path is defined by the Learning Paths methodology for employee training developed by Jim Williams and Steve Rosenbaum, which uses a performance improvement approach to learning and defines a Learning Path as the ideal sequence of learning activities that drives employees to reach proficiency in their job in the shortest possible time.  In the Learning Paths methodology a Learning Path is created for the entire job done by an employee. By looking at learning as a complete process rather than a single event, a Learning Path enables employers and employees to find new ways to drive out time, waste and variability in training which leads to improved results and reduced costs [tpl]Harv|Williams|Rosenbaum|2004[/tpl]. Learning Paths have been proven to reduce time to proficiency by 30-50%.

CATEGORIES: Rings, Death customs

A mourning ring is a finger ring worn in memory of someone who has died.  It often bears the name and date of death of the person, and possibly an image of them, or a motto. They were usually paid for by the person commemorated, or their heirs, and often specified, along with the list of intended recipients, in wills.  Any stone is usually in black, typically Jet stone.  They were  popular  in Victorian times, and earlier; such as this example of a ring commemorating Jeremy Bentham.  In many cases, there is a lock of hair of the deceased placed under the crystal stone.

Iranian Princess Ashraf, titled Fakhr-ol-Dowleh (1883–1955), meaning pride of the state, was one of the most prominent daughters of Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar of the Qajar dynasty, who had a reputably strong character, to the point that she was even willing and able to confront Reza Shah for her patrimony and right. 
She married Prince Mohsen, Amin ol dowleh junior, whose father, Mirza Ali Khan, Amin ol dowleh senior, was a prominent Qajar prime minister, often condemned for acting indecisively towards foreign powers, specifically Britain.
She took control of her husband's huge wealth, together with that of her own inheritance from his father, and managed to make his family the most financially powerful in the country. Most of the district of Elahieh in Tehran belonged to her.  She also introduced taxis for the first time in Tehran, white Fiats that slowly replaced old horse carriages during the 1950s.
Her son, Ali Amini, briefly became a Prime Minister of Iran under Mohammad Reza Shah, and after the Iranian Revolution of 1979 lead an opposition movement against the Islamic republic in Paris.

[[Swiss Light Source]]

CATEGORIES: Synchrotron radiation facilities

The Swiss Light Source is a synchrotron located at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland for producing electromagnetic radiation of high brightness. Planning started in 1991, project was approved in 1997, and first light from the storage ring was seen at December 15, 2000.
The experimental program started in June 2001 and it is used for research in materials science, biology and chemistry.
Main component of the SLS is the 2.4 GeV electron storage ring of 288 m circumference:
The ring is formed by 36 dipole magnets of 1.4 tesla magnetic field, combined in 12 groups of three (triple bend achromat, TBA) for achromatic deflection of the electron beam. 12 straight sections between the TBAs of different lengths (3×11.5 m, 3×7 m, 6×4 m) accommodate the undulator magnets to generate ultraviolet and X-ray light of extreme brightness. 3 of the dipoles have an increased center field of 3 tesla to produce hard X-rays.
A total of 177 quadrupole magnets (magnetic lenses) focuses the beam to provide an beam emittance of 5.5 nm rad.
120 sextupole magnets correct the chromatic focusing errors of the quadrupoles. 73 horizontal and vertical beam steerers are used to continuously correct the position of the electron beam. Finally 24 skew quadrupole magnets are adjusted to correct any torsion of the beam and to minimize the vertical emittance: a world record low value of 3 pm rad has been 
achieved in 2008.
The SLS has achieved a photon beam stability of 1 micrometre: the ring is operated in top-up mode, i.e. the stored current of 400 mA is kept constant to 1 mA by frequent (1–2 minutes) injections. This maintains a constant thermal load from synchrotron radiation. A fast orbit feedback system controlling the 73 beam position monitors and the 73 horizontal and vertical steeres corrects the position of the electron beam 100 times per second to suppress any distortions from ground vibrations etc. Beam distortions from changing the undulator status as done during experiments are minimized by application of a set of feed forward corrections measured once for the undulators, the orbit feedback takes care of the rest. Finally X-ray beam position monitors measuring the location of the synchrotron radiation itself perform the final adjustment in front of the experiment. 
SLS has a booster synchrotron optimized for top-up operation: it provides a low emittance of 10 nm rad for efficient beam injection into the storage ring, and it has a low average power consumption of 30 kW. This is achieved by a large circumference of 270 m, a large number (93) of small dipole magnets and a low aperture of only 30x20mm. The booster accelerates the beam from 100 MeV to 2.4 GeV (optional 2.7 GeV) at a repetition time of 320 ms. A 100 MeV linear accelerator as pre-injector completes the facility.
In 2006 the SLS-FEMTO facility came into operation: By interaction of a high energy (4 mJ), short pulse (50 fs fwhm) laser pulse with the electron beam in a wiggler magnet, a thin slice of the electron beam is modulated in energy. A magnetic chicane bracketing the wiggler and creating dispersion translates this energy modulation into a horizontal separation of the slices from the core beam. So radiation from the slices in a subsequent undulator can be separated by a system of apertures. In this way X-ray pulses of 140 fs length (fwhm) and a tunable photon energy of 3-18 keV can be generated. 
(This installation caused a major change of the storage ring resulting in the odd numbers of 177 quadrupoles and 73 steeres.)
As of June 2009 SLS has eighteen experimental stations (undulators and bending magnets) and seventeen operational beamlines. 
There are three protein crystallography beam-lines, two of which are partially funded by associations of Swiss pharmaceutical companies including Novartis, Roche, Actelion, Boehringer Ingelheim and Proteros.

[[Pilatus (detector)]]

CATEGORIES: Detectors, X-ray instrumentation

Pilatus is the name of a series of silicon pixel detectors developed at the Swiss Light Source, and commercialised by Dectris.  The common factor is that X-rays are converted to an electrical signal by the photoelectric effect in silicon subject to a substantial bias voltage, and then counted directly by a series of cells in an ASIC bonded to the silicon detector, rather than relying on a phosphor.  That is, each pixel has its own amplifier, discriminator (for distinguishing X-rays of the desired energy from noise) and counter circuit; this is possible because the desired pixel size for X-ray crystallography is around 100 micrometres, and a 100 micrometre square in a contemporary CMOS process can contain a significant quantity of electronics.
Design challenges include making the bonding of the ASIC to the sensor sufficiently reliable; the ASIC has to be manufactured in a radiation-tolerant process since the sensor layer by no means absorbs all the incident X-rays.
Other issues involve combining ASICs to make a sensor of usable size - protein crystallography applications tend to want an active area of around 100,000 mm², though powder diffraction work can use a rather smaller active area.  One detector inclines the ASICs so that the view from the point of view of the crystal is of an unbroken sphere of detector.
A problem with analysing Pilatus data is that most crystallography software is written to expect 16-bit data values, and Pilatus dynamic range is 20 bits so requires a different input stage to the software.

Morben is a hamlet in northern Powys, Wales. Part of the historic county of Montgomeryshire (Sir Drefaldwyn) from 1536 to 1974, it lies on the Afon Dyfi and was once the home of a number of riverside quays, including Cei Ward and Y Bwtri. The site of Cei Ward lies alongside the A487 opposite Plas Llugwy, where the road, railway and river run close together. Y Bwtri lay on the bend of the river opposite Pennal and was the site of a shipyard.
The narrow gauge Corris, Machynlleth and River Dovey Tramroad (opened 1859) carried slate from the quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni to Morben, where it was loaded into ships for onward shipment. At around the time the tramway became the Corris Railway in the early 1860s the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway extended the standard gauge rails west of Machynlleth, and soon after the section of the Tramroad west of Machynlleth was abandoned and slate was instead trans-shipped to main line trains.
Inward goods offloaded at Morben would have included lime and coal.
Morben lies on the A487 trunk road from Machynlleth to Aberystwyth. Plas Morben stands on the hillside above the road, while Morben Isaf caravan park lies between the road and the river.

Lake Connewarre is a shallow estuarine lake located on the Barwon River, on the Bellarine Peninsula near Geelong, Victoria.  It is adjacent to, and downstream from, the freshwater Reedy Lake.  Lake Connewarre is linked to the sea by the mangrove-fringed channel of the lower Barwon River estuary, resulting in the lake being subject to tidal flows, with a weir at the inflow to the lake preventing saline water progressing upstream.
Lake Connewarre forms part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site as a wetland of international importance, with much of the wetland area also part of the Lake Connewarre State Game Reserve. However, most of the land surrounding Lake Connewarre has been cleared for agricultural purposes resulting in environmental degradation. Water pollution from upriver has also resulted in a drop in water quality, and reduced inflows to the lake have caused silting problems.

Shikwa ([tpl]lang-ur|[tpl]Nastaliq|شکوہ[/tpl][/tpl]) (Complaint) and Jawab-e-Shikwa ([tpl]lang-ur|[tpl]Nastaliq|جواب شکوہ[/tpl][/tpl]) (Response to the Complaint) are poems written by well known Urdu language poet Muhammad Iqbal, which were later published in his book Kulliat-e-Iqbal. "Shikwa" is an Urdu word which translates to "complaint" in English.
Though much of best poetry is written in Persian, he is also a poet of stature in Urdu. Shikwa (1909) and Jawab-i-Shikwa (1913) extol the legacy of Islam and its civilising role in history, bemoan the fate of Muslims everywhere, and squarely confront the dilemmas of Islam in modern times. Shikwa is thus, in the form of a complaint to Allah for having let down the Muslims and Jawab-i-Shikwa is Allah's reply.
When the first part of these poems, Shikwa (1909), was published it created a big confusion amongst Muslim scholars who thought that Iqbal is being rude and harsh in his words when talking to God in his book and being unthankfull of the blessings of God since the second part of his poem (Jawab-e-Shikwa) was not announced with Publication of the first one. But later when Jawab-e-Shikwa (1913) was published all the problems went away and everyone praised Iqbal for his contribution to Urdu Poetry and making a difference in Islamic literature.

[[Bioadhesive]]

CATEGORIES: Adhesives, Biomolecules

Bioadhesives are natural polymeric materials that act as adhesives. The term is sometimes used more loosely to describe a glue formed synthetically from biological monomers such as sugars, or to mean a synthetic material designed to adhere to biological tissue.
Bioadhesives may consist of a variety of substances, but proteins and carbohydrates feature prominently. Proteins such as gelatin and carbohydrates such as starch have been used as general-purpose glues by man for many years, but typically their performance shortcomings have seen them replaced by synthetic alternatives. Highly effective adhesives found in the natural world are currently under investigation but not yet in widespread commercial use. For example, bioadhesives secreted by microbes and by marine molluscs and crustaceans are being researched with a view to biomimicry.Smith, A.M. & Callow, J.A., eds. (2006) Biological Adhesives. Springer, Berlin. ISBN 978-3-540-31048-8
Bioadhesives are of commercial interest because they tend to be biocompatible, i.e. useful for biomedical applications involving skin or other body tissue. Some work in wet environments and under water, while others can stick to low surface energy – non-polar surfaces like plastic. In recent years,[tpl]When|date=February 2011[/tpl] the synthetic adhesives industry has been impacted by environmental concerns and health and safety issues relating to hazardous ingredients, volatile organic compound emissions, and difficulties in recycling or re mediating adhesives derived from petrochemical feedstocks. Rising oil prices may also stimulate commercial interest in biological alternatives to synthetic adhesives.

Victor Moses (born 12 December 1990) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays for Liverpool on loan from Chelsea. Moses can play in a variety of positions, but in the first-team games he has taken part in so far, Moses has mostly played as a winger. Born in Nigeria, he represented England at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels, but opted to play for the Nigeria as opposed to being fully capped for England.
Moses began his career in the Championship with Crystal Palace, before his performances caught the eye of Wigan Athletic. After two years, his game had improved to the extent that European Champions Chelsea were interested. Despite 10 goals during his first season, he was deemed surplus to requirements following the purchases of several attacking players, and he was let out on a season-long loan to Liverpool.

The fifth government of Israel ([tpl]lang-he-n|מֶמְשֶׁלֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל הַחֲמִישִׁית[/tpl], translit. Memshelet Yisra'el HaKhamishit) was formed by Moshe Sharett during the second Knesset on 26 January 1954, and was the first government not led by David Ben-Gurion. Sharett kept the same coalition partners as during the fourth government, i.e. Mapai, the General Zionists, the Progressive Party, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Progress and Work and Agriculture and Development.
The only changes to the previous government were Sharett taking over as PM, Pinhas Lavon as Minister of Defense, the addition of Zalman Aran as a Minister without Portfolio and the dropping of the two Mizrachi and Hapoel HaMizrachi Deputy Ministerial posts.
Ben-Gurion returned to the government in February 1955, replacing Lavon following the former's resignation over the Lavon Affair.
The government fell when Sharett resigned on 29 June 1955, when the General Zionists refused to abstain from voting on a motion of no-confidence brought by Herut and Maki over the government's position on the trial of Malkiel Gruenwald, who had accused Israel Kastzner of collaborating with the Nazis.

CATEGORIES: 1856 births, 1924 deaths, English Baptists, English barristers, English judges, High Court judges (England and Wales)

Sir Clement Meacher Bailhache (2 November 1856 – 8 September 1924) was an English commercial lawyer and judge.
Born Leeds, the eldest son of parents of Huguenot descent, his father, Rev Clement Bailache was a Baptist minister, secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society, his mother, Emma né Meacher. He was educated at the City of London School and studied law at the University of London, graduating in 1877.Mathew (2004)
He initially practised as a solicitor in Newport, Monmouthshire, marrying Fanny Elizabeth Liebstein in 1881. The couple had a son and two daughters. However, it soon became clear that Bailhache possessed considerable skills as an advocate, skills under used as a provincial attorney. To pursue a career as a barrister, he entered the Middle Temple and was called to the bar in 1889. He practised in commercial law on the south Wales circuit, his existing network in the legal profession enabling him to advance rapidly. He soon attracted the attention of The City and he became in demand in London in the newly established Commercial Court.
Bailhache was made KC in 1908 and appeared in a Commercial Court graced by the advocacy of Thomas Edward Scrutton and John Hamilton. However, his two senior colleagues soon became High Court judges and Bailhache inherited an extensive practice. He had a great mastery of complex facts and law, and was concise in summarising them. "Few leaders at the bar have said so little or said it so well."The Times, 9 Sept 1924
With the growth of commercial litigation in the early twentieth century, by 1912 the Commercial Court was in need of more judges and Bailhache was elevated to a judge of the High Court with the customary knighthood. As a judge, he worked through his list briskly, often paying insufficient attention to the arguments of counsel and often, in consequence, giving rise to successful appeals. He was clear in his judgments though disliked having to reserve judgment. In 1916 he chaired a committee of enquiry into the Royal Flying Corps but did little other enquiry work.
He maintained his Baptist faith throughout his life and was a committed teetotaller. He was an enthusiastic pipe smoker, even during formal dinners. He died from a cerebral haemorrhage at Aldeburgh, Suffolk.

This article is about the Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin in the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA). For the diocese of the Episcopal Church, see Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin.

The Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin is a diocese in the Anglican Church in North America. It came into being after a majority of its congregants separated from the Episcopal Church in 2007. Those who did not separate remained and continue to constitute the Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin. Following the separation, those departing the Episcopal Church were initially named as a diocese of the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone. On June 22-25 2009, in Bedford, Texas, the Diocese of San Joaquin joined several others churches and dioceses in creating a new Anglican province that would be called the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA).
The diocese is headquartered in Fresno, California. The coterminous Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin, which did not separate from the Episcopal Church, is headquartered in Stockton, California, and was, until the events surrounding the creation of the Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin, one of the most conservative within the Episcopal Church and one of three that did not ordain women (the others being the dioceses of Quincy and Fort Worth).
The pre-separation Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin had a membership of approximately 8,500. http://www.episcopalchurch.org/79901_92524_ENG_HTM.htm 
On 8 December 2007, at the annual convention of the Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin, delegates voted to disaffiliate from the Episcopal Church and to align with the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone. The diocese claims to remain, through the Southern Cone, within the Anglican Communion headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Whether the diocese had the power to take that action is controversial. Those who believe it did not have this power say that the constitution and canons of The Episcopal Church do not permit dioceses to disaffiliate, that there is no provision for a diocese to relate to the Anglican Communion through an overseas province, and that the constitution and canons of the province of the Southern Cone do not permit it to have dioceses outside certain countries in South America.Microsoft Word - C & C Southern Cone.doc Those who believe it did have this power say that the diocese is the basic unit of the Anglican Communion and has the inherent power to leave a province, and that the Southern Cone claims it as a diocese under its protection in an extraordinary time of division. Any permanent change would require a change in the Southern Cone's constitution as well as the consent of the Anglican Consultative Council. Neither the diocesan bishop, John-David Schofield, nor the province of the Southern Cone have addressed the legality of this violation of the constitution of the Province of the Southern Cone. The Anglican Communion office website does not list the diocese as a part of the Province of the Southern Cone.
Schofield was consecrated 9 October 1988 and became the diocesan on 15 December 1988. On 1 March 2008, Schofield tendered his resignation from the House of Bishops of the Episcopal Church while claiming to possess continuing authority as the bishop of the Diocese of San Joaquin.http://www.episcopalcafe.com/lead/3-1-08_letter_to_Schori_and_HOB.pdf 
The Episcopal Church disputes the ability of a diocese to transfer from one province to another without the consent of its original province. As a result it considers those who have allied themselves with the province of the Southern Cone to have left the Episcopal Church and has taken steps to preserve a continuing Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin.  Schofield and many of the former leaders of the Episcopal diocese disagree.  Schofield has spoken as if there is a single diocese of San Joaquin, no longer a part of the Episcopal Church, of which he is the bishop and has not recognized the legitimacy of the Episcopal Church's claim of ongoing jurisdiction over this area. Following the vote, Schofield was deposed by the House of Bishops of the Episcopal Church, but continued in office as the bishop of the Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin. (Jerry Lamb was elected provisional bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin in March 2008.)
On July 23, 2009, the Superior Court in California ruled that a diocese cannot leave the Episcopal Church and that Bishop Lamb was the head of the continuing diocese. Bishop Schofield was found not to be the head of the diocese and had to relinquish all money, property and any assumed authority. However, on November 11, 2010 the lower court's ruling was overturned by the 5th appellate court who the local court erred when it involved itself in ecclesiastical issues by ordering that Lamb and not Schofield was the rightful bishop.  It remanded the property questions to the lower court to decide on "neutral" principles. The superior court scheduled oral arguments in the remanded property issues for January 6, 2014.  However, the appeals court also specified that the trial record had established several points of fact that could not be re-litigated during the property trial.  These included that Bishop Schofield had been inhibited from any episcopal actions in January 2008; had been removed as the Episcopal bishop in March 2008; and that Bishop Jerry Lamb was the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese.  None of this affected Bishop Schofield's status as a bishop of the Anglican diocese.  http://s3.amazonaws.com/dfc_attachments/public/documents/356/Order-MSA.PDF
On 14 May 2011, the Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin, in special convention meeting, elected the Rev. Eric Menees as the new bishop of the diocese, succeeding John-David Schofield, who was in office since 1988, starting with his consecration on 24 September 2011 and with his enthronement taking place on 23 October 2011.Election of the New Bishop of the Diocese of Saint Joaquin

CATEGORIES: Markup languages, Mathematical markup languages

ASCIIMathML is a client-side mathematical markup language for displaying mathematical expressions in web browsers.
Using the JavaScript script ASCIIMathML.js, ASCIIMathML markup is converted to MathML at the time the page is loaded by the browser, natively in Mozilla Firefox and via a plug-in in IE7. The simplified markup language supports a subset of the LaTeX language instructions, as well as a much less verbose syntax (which, for example, replaces "\times" with "xx" to produce the "×" symbol).  Both syntaxes are vastly less verbose than the raw MathML. The resulting MathML mathematics can be styled by applying CSS to class "mstyle".
The script ASCIIMathML.js is freely available under the GNU Lesser General Public License.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] The latest version also includes support for SVG graphics, natively in Mozilla Firefox and via a plug-in in IE7.
Per May 2009 there is a new version available. This new version still contains the original ASCIIMathML and LaTeXMathML as developed by Peter Jipsen, but the ASCIIsvg part has been extended with linear-logarithmic, logarithmic-linear, logarithmic-logarithmic, polar graphs and pie charts, normal and stacked bar charts, different functions like integration and differentiation and a series of event trapping functions, buttons and sliders, in order to create interactive lecture material and exams online in web pages.
ASCIIMathML.js has been integrated into MathJax, starting with MathJax v2.0.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mathjax.org/mathjax-v2-0-beta-now-available-on-cdn/ |title=MathJax v2.0 beta available[/tpl]

[[Transformers (film) toy line]]
CATEGORIES: Transformers lines and sublines, 2000s toys

The Transformers movie toys were released in conjunction with the 2007 Transformers film, comics and video games, and expanded on the characters and story in them. They were manufactured and sold by Hasbro worldwide, except in Japan by Takara Tomy.
It was expected that the release of a new movie would involve the production and release of associated toys from Hasbro and Takara Tomy. Images surfaced, online, of some toy prototypes, notably Starscream and a new Decepticon who was to be named Blackout, along with packaged samples of movie preview "Protoform" Optimus Prime and Starscream toys. Similarly, fans found preliminary artwork of multiple characters, although it was not known at the time how close these were to the final designs. The designs were significantly different from those of the Generation 1 characters with the same names. Reactions varied widely: some fans objected strongly to the designs, occasionally going so far as to threaten a boycott if the designs were not changed to be more traditional, while others liked them. The issue became a divisive one, as detractors accused supporters of lacking respect for the franchise's history, while supporters accused detractors of being "stuck in the past", and not accepting change. Fans of the franchise have affectionately nicknamed the designs "Bayformers" due to director Michael Bay's influence.
Even though the Transformers were heavily modified for the film for a more alien "feel", they still kept some key features from the G1 look to stay true to the character's origins.
In 2008, the Deluxe Class line was awarded "Boy Toy of the Year" at the 8th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the American International Toy Fair in New York City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/best_toys_2008_toy_industry_asso_10822?page=3 |title=The 11 Best Toys of 2008 |author=Per-Lee, Myra |publisher=InventorSpot |accessdate=2011-02-15[/tpl]

Bostrum praised the compilation:
"I’ve long toyed with the idea of putting together a “lost album” of sorts, all the various promotional tracks and b-sides released during our Polygram days, but never collected anywhere, and for the most part no longer in print. If there were anyone left at that label with a clue, I wouldn’t need to take such a project on myself, it’d get an official release. Now, thanks to Meat Puppets Yahoo Message Board member “nathang78,” I don’t have to do a damned thing; he’s done it for me. His “Rare Meat” compilation includes all the tracks from the Polygram days and as many others as he can find, including stuff from the “Classic Meat” album, the “Keats Rides A Harley” comp, and the much-desired “You Love Me” EP, offered as a giveaway back during Curt’s first attempt to reform the band eight years ago."

[[Radicalization]]
CATEGORIES: Terrorism, Political terminology, Sociological terminology

Radicalization (or radicalisation) is a process by which an individual or group comes to adopt increasingly extreme political, social, or religious ideals and aspirations that 
(1) reject or undermine the status quoWilner and Dubouloz, “Homegrown terrorism and transformative learning: an interdisciplinary approach to understanding radicalization,” Global Change, Peace, and Security 22:1 (2010).  38
or (2) reject and/or undermine contemporary ideas and expressions of freedom of choice. For example, radicalism can originate from a broad social consensus against progressive changes in society. Radicalization can be both violent and nonviolent, although most academic literature focuses on radicalization into violent extremism (RVE).Borum, Randy.  Radicalization into Violent Extremism I: A Review of Social Science Theories.  Journal of Strategic Security.  Vol. 4 Issue 4. (2011)  pp. 7-36  There are multiple pathways that constitute the process of radicalization, which can be independent but are usually mutually reinforcing.McCauley, C., Mosalenko, S.  "Mechanisms of political radicalization: Pathways towards terrorism,"  Terrorism and Political Violence (2008). 416Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Radicalization: A Guide for the Perplexed.  National Security Criminal Investigations. June 2009.   
Radicalization that occurs across multiple reinforcing pathways greatly increases a group’s resilience and lethality.  Furthermore, by compromising its ability to blend in with non-radical society and participate in a modern, globalized economy, radicalization serves as a kind of sociological trap that gives individuals no other place to go to satisfy their material and spiritual needs.Berman, Eli.

CATEGORIES: Islands of Norfolk Island, Geography of Norfolk Island

Nepean Island is a small uninhabited island located at 
[tpl]coord|29|04|S|167|57|E|type:isle_region:NF|display=inline,title[/tpl], about 1 km south off a golf course on Norfolk Island in the Southwest Pacific.  It was named in 1788 by Lieutenant Philip Gidley King for Evan Nepean, Under Secretary of the Home Department of the United Kingdom. It is part of the Australian territory of Norfolk Island and is included in the Norfolk Island National Park, as is nearby Phillip Island, and about 10 per cent of Norfolk Island proper.  The island is made of calcareous rock dating from the late Pleistocene and is a breeding site for several species of seabirds. The island is uninhabited due to its small size and tall cliffs flanking it, making it nigh on impossible for boats to land there. It forms part of the Norfolk Island National Park, along with Norfolk Island and Phillip Island.

[[Dissipative particle dynamics]]
CATEGORIES: Condensed matter physics, Soft matter, Computational fluid dynamics, Non-Newtonian fluids

Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is a stochastic simulation technique for simulating the dynamic and rheological properties of simple and complex fluids. It was initially devised by Hoogerbrugge and Koelman P. J. Hoogerbrugge and J. M. V. A. Koelman. Simulating microscopic hydrodynamic phenomena with dissipative particle dynamics. Europhysics Letters, 19(3):155–160, JUN 1 1992J. M. V. A. Koelman and P. J. Hoogerbrugge. Dynamic simulations of hard-sphere suspensions under steady shear. Europhysics Letters, 21(3):363–368, JAN 20 1993 to avoid the lattice artifacts of the so-called lattice gas automata and to tackle hydrodynamic time and space scales beyond those available with molecular dynamics (MD). It was subsequently reformulated and slightly modified by P. Español P. Español and P. B. Warren. Statistical-mechanics of dissipative particle dynamics. Europhysics Letters, 30(4):191–196, MAY 1 1995 to ensure the proper thermal equilibrium state. A series of new DPD algorithms with reduced computational complexity and better control of transport properties are presented in.N. Goga, A.J. Rzepiela, A.H. de Vries, S.J. Marrink, H.J.C. Berendsen: Efficient algorithms for Langevin and DPD dynamics, J. Chem. Th. Comp., 2012, DOI:10.1021/ct3000876 The algorithms presented in this article choose randomly a pair particle for applying DPD thermostating thus reducing the computational complexity.
DPD is an off-lattice mesoscopic simulation technique which involves a set of particles moving in continuous space and discrete time. Particles represent whole molecules or fluid regions, rather than single atoms, and atomistic details are not considered relevant to the processes addressed. The particles’ internal degrees of freedom are integrated out and replaced by simplified pairwise dissipative and random forces, so as to conserve momentum locally and ensure correct hydrodynamic behaviour. The main advantage of this method is that it gives access to longer time and length scales than are possible using conventional MD simulations. Simulations of polymeric fluids in volumes up to 100 nm in linear dimension for tens of microseconds are now common.

John Andrew Afford (born 12 May 1964, in Crowland, Lincolnshire) was an English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler who played for Nottinghamshire.
Afford made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire against Oxford University, during the 1984 season, appearing in single game during the 1984 County Championship season, but it wasn't until two years later that he would get a  regular first-team place, playing just two County Championship games during the 1985 season.
Afford played several times in the Second XI Championship in 1987 and 1988 and he returned to play several matches for the first team in 1989.
Afford started the following season promisingly, making the selection for an England A fixture against Zimbabwe in 1990 which the team won by nine wickets, and in which team-mate and three-time Test cricketer Steve Watkin took a 23-ball duck batting from tenth in the order. He finished the year being awarded his cap.
In 1991 the team's Second XI flourished, winning the Second XI Trophy with Afford putting in a strong bowling performance along the way to Nottinghamshire's top placing in the North Zone, and taking the wicket of Ali Brown in the final. Afford, now partnered on a regular basis by former England Test batsman Eddie Hemmings.
In total, Afford took 468 first-class wickets, including hauls of 10 wickets in a match on two occasions, and five-wicket innings on sixteen occasions, with his best haul of 6-51 coming against Lancashire. The two ten-wicket innings came against Kent and Sussex.
Andy Afford was editor of All Out Cricket between 2002 and 2011, nominated as one of the British Society of Magazine Editors (BSME) sports editors of the year in 2011. He now works as publishing director of The Cricketer magazine.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

Dentelin was a region of the Frankish Empire disputed between Austrasia and Neustria.
Mentioned in the Chronicle of Fredegar, the Duchy of Dentelin included far north-western parts of modern France and south-western parts of Belgium. The cities of Boulogne-sur-Mer, Thérouanne, Tournai, Arras, and Cambrai lay within the duchy.
Dentelin formed part of the inheritance of the Merovingian king of Neustria Chlothar II, but was lost by him to his cousins, Theudebert II and Theuderic II, following the battle of Dormelles in 599. 
Chlothar, who outlasted his rival kinsmen and became sole Frankish king, retained Dentelin when he installed his son Dagobert I as king of Austrasia in 623. When Dagobert died in 639, Dentelin was included in Neustria, and remained part of that kingdom afterwards.

[[Approved instrument]]
CATEGORIES: Legal terms, Canadian law, Driving under the influence

Canadian law describes two devices used for the detection of drunk driving offences. An "approved screening device" is a portable measuring instrument that a police officer can use to gather evidence related to blood alcohol content. If the driver fails the screening device test, a further test using an approved instrument will be used to gather evidence that is considered valid for criminal prosecution. Where the driver displays significant signs of impairment such as bad driving behavior or physical signs of intoxication, the officer does not need to use the screening device as well. In Ontario, failing the screening device can result in a temporary suspension of the driver's licence even if no subsequent criminal charges are laid.http://www.borkensteincourse.org/faculty%20documents/PerformanceApprovedScreening.pdf M.J.

Sci. J. Vol. 36. No 3 (2003) pp. 165-171   
An "approved screening device" is a portable instrument used in the field by a police officer, which is checked for accuracy at regular intervals. An "approved instrument" is used by a trained technician under controlled conditions, and checked for accuracy on each use, to produce evidence suitable for use in prosecution.  
The expression approved instrument is defined http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VIII::bo-ga:l_IX//en?page=6&isPrinting=false#codese:254 Criminal Code of Canada section 254 (1) in the Criminal Code of Canada as:  approved instrument means an instrument of a kind that is designed to receive and make an analysis of a sample of the breath of a person in order to measure the concentration of alcohol in the blood of that person and is approved as suitable for the purposes of section 258 by order of the Attorney General of Canada  An approved instrument demand can be made whenever a police officer believes on reasonable and probable grounds that a person has committed an impaired or over 80 offence within the preceding 3 hours.http://www.lawyers.ca/international/sectiondetail.asp?ID=3&state=Ontario Criminal Code of Canada section 254(3) The approved instrument breath demand should be made by the same officer who formed the reasonable and probable grounds. In order for the instrument to be approved, it must be calibrated 15 days within the time of testing. All roadside test kits must be calibrated in Ontario.http://www.lawyers.ca/private/Impaired2000/results.asp?ID=94 R. v. Pavel The indicia of impairment leading to the formation of the reasonable and probable grounds must be apparent before or at the time the opinion is formed, not discovered ex post facto.http://www.lawyers.ca/private/Impaired2000/results.asp?ID=82 R. v.

The Approved Breath Analysis Instruments Orderhttp://www.lawyers.ca/international/students/discussiondetail.asp?Law=DUI&T1=Approved+Instrument&ID=86 Canada Regulations SI/92-105, s. 2; SI/92-167, s. 1; SI/93-61, s. 1; SI/93-175, s. 1; SOR/94-422, s. 1; SOR/94-572, s. 1; SOR/95-312, s. 1; SOR/2000-200, s. 1; SOR/2002-99, s. 1 establishes certain breath instruments as approved instruments for use in Canada. A breath instrument is commonly known in the United States as a breathalyzer.
It is a criminal offence in Canada to refuse an approved instrument demand that has been lawfully made. Section 254(5) of the Criminal Code of Canada provides as follows:
 
 (5) Every one commits an offence who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer under this section. 

The calibration of an approved instrument in Canada should be checked using a standard alcohol solution at a specific temperature using a simulator each time the operator of the approved instrument conducts a subject test.http://ww2.csfs.ca/contentadmin/UserFiles/File/EtoHEn.pdf Alcohol Test Committee Recommended Standards and Procedures page 114
Evidence of the results of subject tests using an approved instrument in the context of several conditions precedent presumptively becomes proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the blood alcohol concentration at the time of the breath tests equals blood alcohol concentration at the time of the driving or care or control.http://www.lawyers.ca/international/sectiondetail.asp?ID=6&state=Ontario Criminal Code of Canada section 258 presumptions

[[You Are the Woman]]

CATEGORIES: 1976 singles, Firefall songs

"You Are the Woman" is the title of a 1976 Top Ten hit by Firefall. Written by Rick Roberts, then the group's frontman, the track is distinguished by the performance on flute of Firefall member David Muse.
Roberts would recall writing "You Are the Woman": "When that chorus and tune jumped into my head I realized I was not creating...one of the great works of art in history...rather a bouncy little pop ditty...I was stumped for several months about where the verses should go develop lyrically. Then I realized I was over thinking it. I took a more simple approach, and the verses were finished in a day or two."[tpl]cite web|url=http://rarwriter.com/Feature_RickRoberts_22_16.htm |title=Singer Songwriter Rick Roberts |publisher=Rarwriter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16[/tpl]
Introduced on Firefall, the band's debut album recorded at Miami's Criteria Studios and released in the spring of 1976, "You Are the Woman" was issued as the album's second single that summer after several other tracks had received airplay on FM radio including the lead single: "Livin' Aint Livin'", which had just missed the Top 40 of the Hot 100 in Billboard. After two months of support in smaller markets, "You Are the Woman" broke in such larger areas as Chicago and Houston in October 1976 effecting a Top 40 entry with a subsequent ascent to a #9 peak that November. 
Jock Bartley of Firefall would account for the popularity of "You Are the Woman" thus: "Every female between the ages of 18 and 24 wanted to be the woman portrayed in the song, and that caused their boyfriends and spouses to call radio stations and subsequently flood the airwaves with dedications of the song and the sentiment. The message was simple and sincere, and the song was easy to sing. It was like our fans let us be a singing version of the Hallmark card that said what they weren't quite sure what to express."Roger Blackwell & Tina Stephan Brands That Rock John Wiley & Sons Inc Hoboken NJ (2004) ISBN 0-471-45517-2p.8
Bartley, the sole founding member of Firefall to remain with the group to the present, also states: "Everybody knows 'You Are The Woman'. It ended up kind of being a hindrance because people would only hear 'You Are The Woman' and would think, oh, that light Rock band from Colorado. We're actually a pretty smokin' Rock band that really has fun onstage and cooks and jams and plays 'You Are The Woman' also."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/FirefallInterview.html |title=Firefall Interview |publisher=Classicbands.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16[/tpl]
A hit for Firefall in Canada (#6) and New Zealand (#15), "You Are the Woman" was remade by Josh Kelley for the Herbie: Fully Loaded soundtrack (2005).

Michael Lorkowski (born February 26, 1955 in Hamburg) is a former German football player and current manager. 
His greatest achievement was winning the 1992 DFB Cup with Hannover 96, while the team was still in the second flight. In an unlikely triumph, they defeated Borussia Mönchengladbach on penalties on May 23, 1992 to become the first - and thus far, only - non-Bundesliga side to lift the trophy.
He also achieved three promotions to the 2. Bundesliga with FC St. Pauli (1984 and 1986) and VfB Lübeck (1995).
In recent years, he has devoted himself more to other pursuits. He has worked as a sports teacher at diploma level and also explored his love of sailing by captaining voyages off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein.http://wwww.wsv45.de/presse.html

According to Mitsubishi, "the AWC is a four-wheel dynamic control philosophy for maximally exploiting the capability of all four tires of a vehicle in a balanced manner to realize predictable handling and high marginal performance." The core of the AWC philosophy is the integration of Mitsubishi's various proprietary technologies, such as 4WD drivetrains, suspension technologies, braking systems, stability/traction control systems and various differentials. Although initially developed for high performance Lancer Evolution full-time four-wheel drive models, the system is now incorporated in Mitsubishi's other 4WD vehicles, each having its own distinct configuration.

[[Canfield joint]]
CATEGORIES: Spacecraft components

The Canfield joint is a mechanism that allows for full hemispherical motion from whatever connects to it. Invented by Dr. Stephen Canfield of the Tennessee Tech University, this joint was developed specifically for spacecraft thrusters and solar panels. Its gimbal mount simplifies the roll manoeuvre performed when the space shuttle launches and allows for greater overall manoeuvrability from the Reaction control system.Nasa Spaceflight “CEV revolution mounted” Unlike other joints, which can only transmit rotational motion up to a constant 70° (not 0 ° to 70°), this joint can transmit rotary motion from 0° and in increments one 1° to 90°. Also this joint has higher stability due to its unique cage-like design. By making use of appropriate actuators (hydraulic/pneumatic), the joint can be moved with surprising speed and accuracy.
When applied to solar panels, the Canfield joint tracks the Sun more of the time and will not tangle the power cords attached to them. This is especially valuable to space flight when the spacecraft is performing complicated manoeuvres. Its applications will be incorporated into the Constellation Program as a key element.Tech Times by Tennessee Tech University “NASA proposes using Canfield invention on latest space craft”

Blow Up is a club night that was founded in the early 1990s by promoter and DJ Paul Tunkin at a North London pub called "The Laurel Tree".  The night quickly became the centre of the emerging Britpop scene in Camden attracting long queues of people eager to gain entry to the tiny venue.  Early regulars included members of Blur, Pulp, Elastica, Suede, The Buzzcocks, Huggy Bear and The Jesus and Mary Chain, leading to the club being referred to as the place where "Britpop was born".[ref]Bloomfield, R.

[[NOR flash replacement]]
CATEGORIES: Solid-state computer storage media, Computer memory, Non-volatile memory

While flash memory remains one of the most popular storages in embedded systems because of its non-volatility, shock-resistance, small size, and low energy consumption, its application has grown much beyond its original design. Based on its original design, NOR flash memory is designed to store binary code of programs because it supports XIP (eXecute-In-Place) and high performance in read operations, while NAND flash memory is used as a data storage because of its lower price and higher performance in write/erase operations, compared to NOR flash. In recent years, the price of NAND flash has gone down much faster than that of NOR flash. Thus, to reduce the hardware cost ultimately, using NAND flash to replace NOR flash (motivated by a strong market demand) becomes a new trend in embedded-system designs, especially on mobile phones and arcade games.

[[Beyond the Valley of 1984]]
CATEGORIES: 1981 albums, Plasmatics albums, Stiff Records albums

Beyond the Valley of 1984 is the second album by punk-metal band The Plasmatics.
After the success of their first album and tour, the band began recording their follow-up album, Beyond the Valley of 1984. After the amount of time and money that was put into their last album, Bruce Kirkland at Stiff Records agreed to put up the funds as long as Rod produced and the album was done in less than 3 weeks at a quarter of the cost of the first.
Given the recent turn of events, Rod proposed the name Beyond the Valley of 1984 and the tour, in 1981, became "The 1984 World Tour". In between touring drummers,  Alice Cooper's Neal Smith was brought in to do the drumming for the record, and the album, with its Orwellian and apocalyptic theme and songs such as "Masterplan", "Pig Is a Pig", and "Sex Junkie", was released a few months later.
The album was recorded at The Ranch in New York City, a studio owned by John Andrew "Andy" Parks, a singer-songwriter from Texas. A promotional tape exists with Andy doing the voice-over in an over-the-top Texan accent. The Ranch was equipped with a modified MCI JH-416 console, a 3M M-79 24-track and an Ampex ATR-102 1/4-inch two-track. Engineer Eddie Ciletti was brought in during the second phase to overdub guitars, vocals, electric chain saw and mix. 
Mixing was "unconventional," for a punk record due to rather "strict" parameters established by Rod. The record would not have any wide stereo panning, and it had to be mixed at a level low enough so that he could conduct business over the phone. The mix was done almost entirely on Auratone monitors.
During recording for the album, The Plasmatics were booked on the Tom Snyder late night TV show, where Tom Snyder introduced them as "possibly the greatest punk rock band in the entire world".
The album was re-released in 2000 by Plasmatics Media, Inc.

Karl Ludwig Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg (22 March 1902, Bad Neustadt an der Saale, Lower Franconia - 23/24 April 1945)
The von Guttenberg family originates back to 1149 in Franconia (northern part of Bavaria) in the southern part of Germany.  Karl Ludwig Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg studied law and history in Munich and graduated in 1929. In that year he married Therese, Princess Schwarzenberg. They had two daughters and one son.
Karl Ludwig von Guttenberg was a catholic monarchist who started publishing the "White Papers; Journals on History, Tradition and State" (formerly called "Monarchy") in 1934. Amongst its authors were Reinhold Schneider, Jochen Klepper, Ulrich von Hassell and Werner Bergengruen. The White Papers (in German: "Weiße Blätter") soon became an important organ and also a meeting place, through their publishers many various contacts, for the conservative opposition against the Nazi regime under Hitler.  Karl Ludwig Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg first introduced Carl Goerdeler and Ulrich von Hassell to each other in 1939.
In 1941, von Guttenberg was ordered to work in Counter-intelligence at the Foreign Affairs Office in Berlin through the help of Ludwig Beck. There, von Guttenberg worked under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris and belonged to the circle around Hans von Dohnanyi, Justus Delbrück, and Hans Oster.

During one month, the territories of Bukhara were conquered by the revolutionary forces, with the help of the Red Army contingent led by Mikhail Frunze. On September 14 an All Bukhara Revolutionary Committee (i.e. a provisional government) was established. On October 8, the All Bukhara People's Congress launched the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic, with the Communist Party of Bukhara as a leading force.

Stephen Prescott MBE (26 December 1973 – 9 November 2013) was an international rugby league footballer. Prescott was born in St Helens, and started his professional career with his hometown club, who signed him in 1992. He made his debut for St Helens a year later, and soon established himself as the club's first choice fullback. In 1996, Prescott helped Saints win the league championship and Challenge Cup for the first time in two decades. He went on to win a second consecutive Challenge Cup with the club in 1997, but was sold to Hull Sharks at the end of the season.
After spending two years at Hull, Prescott joined Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, but rejoined Hull a year later after being released by Wakefield due to the club's financial difficulties.
Prescott made his senior international debut in 1996, playing both games for England in their European Championship victory. He later changed his international allegiance to Ireland, who he represented at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. He also made one appearance for Lancashire in 2003, but suffered a serious knee injury while playing for the team, which ultimately ended his playing career.
In 2006, Prescott was diagnosed with a rare form of stomach cancer and was given months to live. He set up the Steve Prescott Foundation in 2007, and went on to organise a series of money-raising initiatives. He raised almost half a million pounds for charity through the foundation, and was awarded an MBE in 2009 for his efforts. After a long battle with the disease, he died in 2013, aged 39.
In October 2013 a small group of people started a campaign to get the highest honor in English Rugby League the Man of Steel Award to be renamed after Steve. On 5th of March 2014 the RFL announced that the Man of Steel award will be renamed after Steve and is now known as the Steve Prescott Man of Steel Award

Raspeball, also known in some areas as klubb, kumle, komle or kompe, is a potato dumpling, a traditional Norwegian or German dish. It consists of grated potatoes, where typically half is pre-cooked and half is raw, salt and varying kinds of flour (though often, barley is used). There are a great variety of regional variations to the dish, and in many areas the raspeball is filled with bits of salted lamb or pork.
The dish is more common in the southern (Sørlandet, where "kompe" is the most common name), western (Vestlandet, where "raspeball" and "komle" is the most used) and middle (Trøndelag, where it is nearly always called "klubb") parts of Norway than elsewhere. In Vestlandet, this dish is traditionally consumed on Thursdays, when it often makes an appearance as "Dish of the day" at cafes and restaurants specializing in local cuisine.
The condiments vary greatly throughout the Norwegian regions. They may include salted and boiled pork or lamb meat, bacon, sausages, melted butter, bacon fat, lard, mashed or cooked rutabaga, sour cream, sugar, syrup, cured meat, brown cheese sauce and, even, boiled potatoes. A variety of raspeballer is the fiskeball, where minced fish, fresh or salted, is added to the potato dough.
The raspeball is quite closely related to the Lithuanian cepelinai, the Acadian poutine râpée and the potato dumplings known as Klöße in Austria and Germany.

The Friends Of Everton Park have included the lock-up in their Everton Park Heritage Trail with information boards displayed near the building. Although the tower is locally called Prince Rupert's Tower, the name is anachronistic because the building was erected 143 years after a Royalist Army camped in the area during the English Civil War in 1644. It's likely the name arose because Everton Brow was historically where preparations were made to attack the Parliamentarian garrison holding Liverpool Castle. Prince Rupert, as commander of the Royalist Cavalry of Charles I is said to have looked down on the fortress and dismissed it with the words: "It is a crow’s nest that any party of schoolboys could take!" It eventually fell after a week of heavy fighting and the loss of 1500 of his men.[tpl]cite book|first=Robert |last=Halley|authorlink=Robert Halley|title=Lancashire: Its Puritanism and Nonconformity|publisher=Tubbs and Brook|year=1872|page=225|isbn=[/tpl]

[[Coup d'Etat (Plasmatics album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1982 albums, Plasmatics albums, Capitol Records albums

Coup d'Etat is the third studio album released by punk rock band The Plasmatics in 1982.
In 1982, a deal was inked with Capitol Records and Dan Hartman offered to produce a demo of the album for Capitol with Rod at Electric Lady Studios, Jimi Hendrix's old studio, in New York. A demo was arranged, recorded and mixed within a week (and 20 years later would be rereleased as Coup de Grace).
The album was recorded at Dierks Studios, near Cologne, Germany and was produced by Dieter Dierks, who had just come off a number one album with the Scorpions.
Coup d'Etat was a breakthrough album that began to blend the punk and metal genres, something that would later be done time and time again by bands such as S.O.D., Anthrax, and the Cro-Mags by the end of the 1980s. Wendy also broke ground for her unique singing style; she pushed her vocals so hard she had to travel into Cologne each day for treatment to avoid permanent damage to her vocal cords.
Despite the band's rise in fame, the band was dropped by Capitol Record shortly after the album's release.
In 2005, Rock Candy Records re-released the album with expanded liner notes, bonus tracks, and a re-master of the entire original album.
The song "The Damned" was covered by German Thrash band Destruction on the Mad Butcher EP in 1987. During the 1990s, Beavis & Butt-Head showed the video often.

The Zatsarenni herself was named after a torpedo boat captain who had distinguished himself in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878.
She was sunk on 30 June 1917, when she ran onto a German naval mine that had been laid only days before by the German-Turkish cruiser SMS Breslau. The Breslau had laid seventy mines off the mouth of the Danube, followed by another ten off Fidonisi Island, which to the Germans was then known as Schlangen Insel (Snake Island), off Sulina.
The Leytenant Zatsarenni was rediscovered in July 2007 by Russian divers.

Thirumavalavan or  Thol. Thirumavalavan  (born 17 August 1962), is  Dalit activist, Member of Parliament in 15th Lok Sabha and the current President of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (Liberation Panthers Party), a Dalit political party in the state of Tamil Nadu in India.  He rose to prominence in the 1990s as a Dalit leader, and entered politics in 1999.  His political platform centres around ending the caste-based oppression of the Dalits, which he argues can best be achieved through reviving and reorienting Tamil nationalism. He has also expressed support for Tamil nationalist movements and groups elsewhere, including Sri Lanka.
He did his Bachelor's course in chemistry, masters degree in Criminology and completed law at Madras Law College. He worked in the government's Forensic Department as a scientific assistant, which he later resigned in 1999 to contest polls. He contested the 1999 and 2004 general elections unsuccessfully and won the 2009 general elections from the Chidambaram constituency. He won the 2001 state assembly elections in alliance with Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a post he resigned in 2004 quoting idealogical differences with DMK. He has written a few books and has acted in a few Tamil movies.
Thiruma, being the leader of a caste centred party, is often alleged to have instigated caste violence in Tamil Nadu. His confrontation with Vanniyar based caste Pattali Makkal Katchi and its leader Ramadoss has resulted in frequent clashes between Dalits and Vanniyars. Both parties accuse each other of instigating violence against the other community. Both Thiruma and Ramadoss reconciled and worked together during the period of 2004 to 2009, when they were part of the same electoral alliance. Several party men quoted strained relationship with Thirumaa and quit the party on account of the increased involvement of him in Katta Panchayat (kangaroo courts), bringing disrepute to the party. Thiruma was also in the centre of controversy when the party asked party cadres to donate weighing against Thiruma in 2012, on the occasion of his 50th birthday. In August 2013, Kavitha, a divorcee and mother of a girl child, accused Thiruma of reneging her on the promise of marrying her and she filed a complaint in police to similar effect.

The Split Rock Wildway is a proposed wildlife corridor between the Split Rock Wild Forest and the Jay Mountain Wilderness Area in the eastern Adirondack Park in Essex County, New York. The area is located within the Champlain Valley along Lake Champlain. The Wildway captures a diversity of natural communities in the northern hardwood forest ecosystem, including low-lying clayplain forests, wetlands, the Boquet River floodplain forest, montane spruce-fir forests, and sub-alpine flora. The Champlain Valley is a major flyway for hawks, songbirds, and waterfowl; of the 193 birds that breed in the Adirondacks, 155 are found in the valley. The Wildway provides habitat for a variety of wildlife, including mink, otter, white-tailed deer, fisher, and bobcats. The northernmost population of eastern timber rattlesnakes, an endangered species in New York, inhabits rocky outcrops in the Split Rock Wild Forest. The majority of land in the Wildway is privately owned and at risk to land subdivision and habitat fragmentation.

Paul Marney (born 28 April 1982) is an English footballer currently unattached. 
Marney first came to prominence during the 2001/02 season when his allegedly 'improper' registration for St. Patrick's Athletic resulted in the League deducting the club nine points. St Pat's took the League to arbitration and won their case (Marney had already been playing for the club for some time).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2002/0412/world/st-pats-keep-mum-til-report-published-26585.html |title=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2002/0412/world/st-pats-keep-mum-til-report-published-26585.html |author=George, Bill |newspaper=Irish Examiner |date=12 April 2002 |accessdate=24 November 2013[/tpl] 
Marney made 29 appearances and scored one goal during that league campaign for the Saints, and though League winners' medals were awarded to both Shelbourne and St Pat's (due to further alleged irregularities), the Saints maintain that they are the sole and rightful League Champions for that season. The League's system for registering players was subsequently changed. He made 16 appearances the following season but after falling out of favour at Richmond Park, Marney was plucked from there before the closure of the final 2003 season transfer window when Trevor Anderson signed him for Dundalk.
Paul scored his first goal for Dundalk against Galway United F.C. in 2004. Marney also had previous spells with West Ham United F.C. and Sutton United F.C..
Marney won a FAI First Division winners medal after the 2008 season with Dundalk but he departed the Lilywhites after that season and has since has moved back to England.

Cromwell Manor, also known as the David Cromwell House and Joseph Sutherland House, is located on Angola Road in Cornwall, New York, United States, just south of its intersection with US 9W. It consists of four properties, two of which are of note: the 1820 manor house, built in a Greek Revival style and added onto in 1840[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cromwellmanor.com/manorhouse.html |title=The Manor House |accessdate=2007-08-02[/tpl] and a 1779 cottage known as  The Chimneys, the original home on the site.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cromwellmanor.com/chimneys-cottage.html |title=Chimneys Cottage and Shadow Mountain Farm |accessdate=2007-08-02[/tpl]
When built, it was one of the first large houses in rural Cornwall built as a luxury home rather than a farmhouse, and one of the few Greek Revival buildings built of brick in the town. After over a century as a Cromwell family home, it was sold and became a teachers' retreat. It is currently operated as a bed and breakfast, with both properties available to guests. In 1996 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

In 359, the Roman Emperor Constantius II requested a church council, at Constantinople, of both the eastern and western bishops, to resolve the split at the Council of Seleucia. According to Socrates Scholasticus, only about 50 of the Eastern bishops, and an unspecified number of the western ones, actually attended.Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 2, chapter 41.
Acacius of Caesarea declared that the Son was like the Father "according to the scriptures," as in the majority decision at Ariminum and close to the minority at Seleucia. Basil of Ancyra, Eustathius of Sebaste, and their party declared that the Son was of similar substance to the Father, as in the majority decision at Seleucia. Maris of Chalcedon, Eudoxius of Antioch, and the deacons Aëtius and Eunomius declared that the Son was of a dissimilar substance from the Father.Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 4, chapter 12 and book 5, chapter 1.Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 2, chapter 41.
The Heteroousians defeated the Homoiousians in an initial debate, but Constantius banished Aëtius,Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 4, chapter 12 and book 5, chapter 1. after which the council, including Maris and Eudoxius,Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 2, chapter 41. agreed to the homoian creed of Ariminum with minor modifications.Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 4, chapter 12 and book 5, chapter 1.Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 2, chapter 41.
Wulfila also attended the council and endorsed the resulting creed.Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 2, chapter 41.
After the Council of Constantinople, the homoian bishop Acacius deposed and banished several homoiousian bishops, including Macedonius I of Constantinople, Basil, Eustathius, Eleusius of Cyzicus, Dracontius of Pergamum, Neonas of Seleucia, Sophronius of Pompeiopolis, Elpidius of Satala and Cyril of Jerusalem.Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 5, chapter 1.Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 2, chapter 42.

Synodontis batensoda is a species of upside-down catfish.  This fish originates from the Nile, Chad, Niger, Senegal, and Gambia River basins.
S. batensoda has 39–42 gill rakers rather than 7–33 as in other Synodontis species, and its dorsal fin and adipose fin are contiguous. The body is short and deep, the eyes are large, and its colouration is grey-black tinged with brown, with a faint network of dark black spots. There is a comb of small spines near the point of the operculum.[tpl]cite journal |author=Friel, John P. & Thomas R.

This omnivorous fish feeds on plankton, algae, detritus, surface insects, chironomid larvae, benthic crustaceans and molluscs. It is oviparous and venomous.
In the aquarium hobby, this fish may be known as the giant upside-down catfish; it is peaceful and hardy fish, but may be bullied by more aggressive Synodontis species.

Gambling in India is heavily restricted but the opposite is true online. Approximately 40% of internet users in India have admitted to visiting a gambling site - but not placing a bet. The sites were primarily for lottery, cricket and horse betting fixes.Popularity of betting sites in India The Public Gambling Act of 1867 prohibits running or being in charge of a public gaming house. The penalty for breaking this law is a fine of [tpl]INR[/tpl]200 or imprisonment of up to 3 months. Additionally, this Act prohibits visiting gambling houses. A fine of [tpl]INR[/tpl]100 or imprisonment of up to one month is the penalty.The Public Gambling Act, 1867
The Information Technology Act 2000 regulates cyber activities in India and prohibits publication or transmission of information that can corrupt people.

In May 2011 India passed the Federal Information Technology Act which tries to put a stranglehold on internet gambling. This new act, which covers gambling sites, holds the Internet Service Providers responsible for blocking offshore betting sites.
One of the biggest obstacles faced by sports bettors in India is the fact that depositing to foreign bookies is extremely difficult. Typically, the majority of users deposit to online bookies using Moneybookers or Neteller.  Some attempts to deposit using a Visa or MasterCard may fail. The same is true of online bank transfers. In order to circumvent these blocks, savvy internet users have started to use ewallet services for depositing. These services add a middle layer to disguise the nature of transactions, enabling users to get around the blocks by first depositing to an ewallet and then using that ewallet to fund an online betting account in Rupees. This is important because it circumvents legal issues that may have arisen about Foreign Exchange law.[tpl]cite web|title=Rupee Betting Sites and Law|url=http://sportsbetting.net.in/bookmakers/[/tpl]

Nicholas Dominic Dallessandro (October 3, 1913 – April 29, 1988) was an outfielder in Major League Baseball who played for two teams between [tpl]By|1937[/tpl] and [tpl]By|1947[/tpl]. Listed at [tpl]height|ft=5|in=6[/tpl], 168 lb., Dallessandro batted and threw left-handed. He was born in Reading, Pennsylvania.
Dallessandro entered the majors in 1937 with the Boston Red Sox, playing for them one year before joining the Chicago Cubs in 1940. His most productive season came in 1941 with Chicago, when he hit .272 with six home runs and posted career-highs in games (140), hits (132), runs (73) and RBI (85), while his 36 doubles ranked him 4th in the National League. He enjoyed another solid season in 1944, hitting a career-high .304 with eight home runs and 74 RBI in 117 games. He missed 1945 due to military service during World War II and rejoined the Cubs in 1946, playing for them in part of the next two seasons. After his big league career ended, he saw action in the minor leagues until retiring in 1952.
In an eight-season career, Dallessandro was a .267 hitter (520-for-1945) with 22 home runs and 303 RBI in 746 games, including 242 runs, 11 doubles, 23 triples, 16 stolen bases, and a .369 on-base percentage. A disciplined hitter, he compiled a 2.07 walk-to-strikeout ratio (310-to-150).
Known by the alliterative but uncomplimentary nickname "Dim Dom", and short of stature, he was referenced in Chicago columnist Mike Royko's annual Cubs quiz on April 18, 1968:
Dallessandro's nephew Dick Gernert also played in the major leagues.
Dallessandro died in Indianapolis, Indiana at the age of 74.

Hennepin Island tunnel was a [tpl]convert|2500|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl]-long underground passage in Saint Anthony, Minnesota (now Minneapolis) dug beneath the Mississippi River riverbed between 1868 and 1869 to create a downstream spillway for hydro plants, milling and lumber business located upstream of St. Anthony Falls. The tunnel ran downstream from Nicollet Island, beneath Hennepin Island, and exited below St. Anthony Falls.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh5.asp |title= Falls of St. Anthony |accessdate = 2007-08-02 |work= A History of Minneapolis |publisher= Minnesota Public Library[/tpl]Engineering the Falls: The Corps Role at St. Anthony Falls - an article on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers website covering the history and geology of St. Anthony Falls.Minneapolis' official promotional site for the riverfront district
During construction of the tunnel, on October 5, 1869, the river broke through the thin layer of limestone separating the river's bed from the tunnel. The rushing river scoured the tunnel, caving in parts of Hennepin Island and causing the earth supporting St. Anthony Falls to collapse upstream. There was serious concern that the riverbed would crumble and reduce St. Anthony Falls to a long set of rapids. However, within a few weeks, dams were built to divert the river and stop St. Anthony Falls from being washed away. The fix was temporary as the 1870 spring floods damaged some of the new dams and swept away more of Hennepin Island. By the fall of 1870, the riverbed and banks were stabilized and a wooden apron capped St. Anthony Falls to stop the upstream progression of the collapsing falls. As a direct result of the collapse of the Hennepin Island tunnel, St. Anthony Falls ultimately received a sloping concrete apron to create an artificial falls that are held out as the only major waterfall on the Mississippi River.
The site of the tunnel is about a mile upstream from the 2007 collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge.

Jonathan Faulknor (fl. 1744 – 24 June 1795) was an officer of the Royal Navy who served during the Seven Years' War, the American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary Wars, in a career which spanned fifty years.
The son of a distinguished naval officer, Jonathan Faulknor continued the family tradition and forged a career in the navy. He was made an officer prior to the Seven Years' War and commanded his first ships before it ended. His service was punctuated by periods without command of a ship, and times as captain of guardships. Nevertheless he was able to impress his superiors with his services, including his cool handling of a crisis when his ship ran aground off Cork. He was back in command of ships during the American War of Independence, and was flag captain to Admiral Keppel at the battle of Ushant in 1778. He captained several other ships during the war, relieving Gibraltar in 1782 with Howe and seeing action at the Battle of Cape Spartel.
Promoted to flag rank after the war, he rose to be admiral of the blue before his death in 1795, during the French Revolutionary Wars, having only once hoisted his flag, during the period of the Spanish Armament in 1791.

Singlewell or Ifield is the name given to the area south of Gravesend in Kent, England. 
Originally two separate settlements on either side of Watling Street, it is now separated by the A2 road and bears little resemblance to its past. Singlewell Road leads from the town southwards to the A2. 
The name Singlewell, originally Shinglewell - and not therefore referring to it having the only well in the district -
and its eponymous ancient well with ancient origins has now come to mean the area now part of the built-up area of Gravesend. The well was filled in during World War I. The original Watling Street is now Hever Court Road and the nearby estate named after it was built in 1957. Hever Court itself was the original home of the medieval family who moved to Hever, Kent in 1331. Hever Court eventually became derelict and was demolished in 1952.
Ifield, once a large rural parish, is now a few houses south of the main road, and the tiny church of St Margaret, with Norman architecture included in its walls.A History of Gravesend, James Benson, revised by Robert H. Hiscock,1976, Phillimore & Co Ltd ISBN 0-85033-242-7 This book has been referred to throughout the article The parish formed part of the Hundred of Toltingtrough, then Strood Rural District from 1894 and was abolished on 1 April 1935, split between Cobham and the Municipal Borough of Gravesend.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10152045&c_id=10001043

Little Greenbrier is the name of a former Appalachian community that is now an historical area in the Great Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee.  The community was situated in a hollow rising from Metcalf Bottoms along Little River to the upper slopes of Cove Mountain, in the northeastern section of the national park.  Little Greenbrier was once known simply as "Greenbrier," but the "Little" was added to its name to distinguish it from the larger Greenbrier located between Mount Le Conte and Mount Guyot to the east.
Little Greenbrier is currently home to the Walker Cabin and the 
Little Greenbrier Schoolhouse— both on the National Register of Historic Places.

[[Water microphone]]
CATEGORIES: History of the telephone

A water microphone or water transmitter is based on Ohm's law that current in a wire varies inversely with the resistance of the circuit.  The sound waves from a human voice cause a diaphragm to vibrate which causes a needle or rod to vibrate up and down in water that has been made conductive by a small amount of acid.  As the needle or rod vibrates up and down in the water, the resistance of the water fluctuates which causes alternating current in the circuit. For this to work, the resistance of the water must vary substantially over the short distance the needle or rod vibrates.  Acidulated water works well because only a small amount of acid is added.  If one millimeter of acidulated water has a resistance of 100 ohms, two millimeters would have 200 ohms which would produce enough alternating current to transmit audio signals in thousands of feet of wire.  Mercury will not work because the resistance of one millimeter of mercury is less than a tenth of an ohm and vibration of a needle in mercury would produce negligible alternating current.
Elisha Gray reasoned that a metal rod vibrating up and down in acidulated water would alternately lengthen and shorten the small distance between the bottom end of the rod and a metal plate at the bottom of the glass container holding the water.  This is the invention described in Gray's caveat.Evenson, pages 222-223  When Alexander Bell's lawyer heard that Gray had described a vibrating rod in a liquid to vary the resistance, he added a claim for variable resistance in a draft of Bell's unfiled patent application and added an additional seven sentences that mentioned mercury as the liquid.Evenson, pages 195-196  The lawyer knew that Bell had experimented with a wire dipped in mercury to provide a flexible electrical switch. see Bell's US Patent 161,739 page 3 left column beginning "tween the overhanging end..."  
On March 10, 1876 when Bell and Watson tested their first successful water transmitter, Bell used a needle in the water to minimize the inertial mass moved by the diaphragm and relied on variable resistance in the meniscus of the water on the needle.  The depth of the needle made little difference.  
Other minor variations and improvements were made to the liquid microphone by Majoranna, Chambers, Vanni, Sykes, and Elisha Gray.
Although the water microphone was commercially impractical, the variable resistance feature inspired Thomas Edison to experiment with dry carbon (graphite and amorphous) to provide the variable resistance.  The Edison transmitter with later improvements was used for more than 60 years.

From 2000 to 2005 they have a comedy sketch show. In 2006 they produced a "Soap Opera" called O Proxeneta, a history about a businessman called Franco Faraco who owned a toilet company who was hit by a car driven by a Man with Black Boots and gets into a coma. The show was more about the people who knew Faraco. Later in the same year they've done another Soap called Sinha Boça who tells the history of one of the most loved character of the sketches show, he is an ordinary guy who goes to college and gets arrested because his rival incriminates him.
In 2007 they started a new show: Tela Class, in which they redub old trash and B-movies, creating a new script under it, always using loads of curse words and sarcasm... one of the episodes even got censured by MTV Brazil, due to its raw humor...
Now (2008) they've returned to the sketches, doing a Matrix parody in which their sketches are made only in their head on computer program.

[[Statistical energy analysis]]
CATEGORIES: Statistical mechanics, Mechanical vibrations, Acoustics

Statistical energy analysis (SEA) is a method for predicting the transmission of sound and vibration through complex structural acoustic systems. The method is particularly well suited for quick system level response predictions at the early design stage of a product, and for predicting responses at higher frequencies. In SEA a system is represented in terms of a number of coupled subsystems and a set of linear equations are derived that describe the input, storage, transmission and dissipation of energy within each subsystem.  The parameters in the SEA equations are typically obtained by making certain statistical assumptions about the local dynamic properties of each subsystem (similar to assumptions made in room acoustics and statistical mechanics).  These assumptions significantly simplify the analysis and make it possible to analyze the response of systems that are often too complex to analyze using other methods (such as finite element and boundary element methods).

CATEGORIES: Communist parties in the Soviet Union, Political parties established in 1918, Turkestan, Political parties disestablished in 1924

The Communist Part of Turkestan was the Turkestani branch of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks). It was formed in June 1918. At the time of its formation, the party was joined by a large section of Jadids.Dave Crouch: The Bolsheviks and Islam (2006)
In the spring of 1919 the RCP(b) leadership stressed "particular care and attention" toward "the remnants of national feelings of the toiling masses of the oppressed or dependent nations." Thus the Muslim Bureau (Musbiuro) of the Territorial Committee of the Communist Party of Turkestan was formed. Turar Rïsqulov, a Kazakh from Awliya Ata, was elected as the Chairman of Musbiuro.The Politics of Muslim Cultural ReformTo the Communists of Turkestan
In 1920 the 5th Territorial Congress of the Communist Party of Turkestan was held. The congress suggested that a unified Turkic Soviet Republic be formed, a demand that was later ignored by the RCP(b).Chapter One
In line with the line of attracting the Muslim masses to the party, the party employed different criteria on religious activities of Muslim and Orthodox members. In 1922, 1500 Russian Orthodox were purged from the Communist Party of Turkestan on the grounds of 'religious prejudice', but not a single Muslim.
In 1924 the Communist Party of Turkestan was dissolved, as the boundaries of Soviet Central Asia were re-drawn.

GameBooster is a non-licensed cartridge for the Nintendo 64 made by Datel Design & Development Ltd. It was made to be similar to the Super Game Boy for the Super Nintendo for playing Game Boy games on the Nintendo 64. It was released halfway through the console's time in the Gaming Market.
It plays most Game Boy games as well as working with Super Game Boy games with borders. By pressing both the L and R button will turn on the menu page to increase the screen to full as well as changing colour to the screen.
Because it's not licensed by Nintendo, a slot was added at the back whereby putting a Nintendo 64 game into the slot would override the lockout chip.
One problem with the Gamebooster is that it doesn't play any sounds from the Game Boy game in play, instead plays a tune over and over, being one of the main problem with the game cartridge.
Even with no Game Boy game inserted, the cartridge has a built in game called Rebound Mission.

CATEGORIES: 1980s economic history, 1980s in the United Kingdom, Economic history of the United Kingdom, Public economics, Inflation in the United Kingdom

The Lawson Boom was the macroeconomic conditions prevailing in the United Kingdom at the end of the 1980s, which were indelibly associated with the policies of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
The term was used by analogy with the phrase 'The Barber Boom', an earlier period of rapid expansion under the tenure as chancellor of Anthony Barber in the Conservative government of Sir Edward Heath. Critics of Lawson assert that a combination of the abandonment of monetarism, the adoption of a de facto exchange-rate target of 3 deutschmarks to the pound, and excessive fiscal laxity (in particular the 1988 budget) unleashed an inflationary spiral.
The economic boom saw strong economic growth during the second half of the 1980s, sparking a sharp fall in unemployment, which was still in excess of 3 million at the end of 1986, but had fallen to 1.6 million (the lowest for some 10 years) by the end of 1989. 
In 1990, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John Smith referred to the period as such in a House of Commons debate, quoting a report which said:
The "dash for growth" had failed to save the Conservative government from electoral defeat at the hands of Labour in the 1964 general election, and was followed by a difficult period for the economy (during which unemployment nearly doubled) in the second half of the 1960s. The Barber's boom a decade later had contributed to a recession and was a factor in the Conservatives losing its place in government to Labour yet again after the February 1974 general election. 
The inflationary pressures of the Lawson Boom were one of the reasons given for the UK's entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990, a move that was supposed to help restrain inflation (which had been approaching 10%) in the UK by "importing" the anti-inflationary credibility of the Bundesbank. However, the economy fell into its third recession in less than 20 years, with unemployment coming close to 3 million by the end of 1992, even though this time the Conservatives managed to gain re-election.

[[Kunu]]
CATEGORIES: Nigerian cuisine

Kunu (also known as kununzaki) is a popular drink consumed throughout Nigeria, mostly in the north. It is usually made from a grain such as millet or sorghum, although it can be made from maize as well. The variety of the drink made from sorghum is a milky light-brown colour, whilst that which is made from millet and maize is whitish in colour.
Kunu is made by first allowing the grain seeds to germinate, then soaking the seeds in water for a few days and blending the soaked grain with sweet potatoes and ginger or pepper to form a smooth paste. This paste is then divided into two parts. One part is placed in a vessel and has boiling water poured on it, then it is stirred to give a thick mixture. The other part of the paste is then added to this mixture and it is stirred some more.
The mixture is then left for a day or two for the grain husk to settle. After this, the husk and other sediment are filtered out of the mixture, and the filtered liquid is bottled for consumption.

The Polish Jura borders the Carpathian Mountains to the south, including part of the Carpathians of the Slovak Republic and the highland of Central Poland to the north, toward the Świętokrzyskie Mountains ([tpl]lang-pl|Góry Świętokrzyskie[/tpl]).
The Polish Jura consists of a hilly landscape with Jurassic limestone rocks, cliffs, valleys and vast limestone formations, featuring some 220 caves. The relief of the upland developed since the Paleogene, under climatic conditions changing considerably. Its main component is a peneplain, crowned by monadnocks, rocky masses that resisted erosion, generated as hard rock on Late Jurassic buildup surrounded by less resistant bedded limestone of the same age."Pattern of karst landscape of the Cracow Upland (South Poland)" by Witold Stefan Alexandrowicz and Zofia Alexandrowicz, Acta Carsologica, Slovenian Academy Of Sciences http://carsologica.zrc-sazu.si/?stran=article&id=185 The Polish Jura is visited by roughly 400,000 visitors a year.

Brigadier-General Henry Trelawny (ca. 1658 – 8 January 1702) was a British Army officer of Cornish descent, the seventh and youngest son of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 2nd Baronet and Mary Seymour.
From 1678 to 1681, he was a lieutenant of foot in the Admiral's Regiment. He then obtained a captain's commission in the 2nd Tangier Regiment, commanded by his brother Charles. Made a freeman of Portsmouth in 1683 and East Looe in 1685, he was returned to Parliament in the latter year for West Looe as a Tory on the interest of his eldest brother, Bishop Trelawny. In 1687, he was appointed to the commission of the peace for Cornwall.
During the Glorious Revolution, Charles, with a number of officers and men, including Henry, went over to William of Orange. Both Charles and Henry were returned to the Convention Parliament for East Looe, sitting as Tories. Both served as commissioners for assessment in Cornwall and Devon from 1689 to 1690.[tpl]cite web | title=Trelawny, Henry (c.1658-1702), of Trelawne, Pelynt, Cornw. | publisher=History of Parliament Trust | url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/trelawny-henry-1658-1702 | accessdate=7 May 2013[/tpl]
On 8 January 1690, Trelawny married Rebecca Hals (d. 1699), the daughter and coheiress of Matthew Hals of Eggbuckland, Devon. By Rebecca he had two sons and three daughters:[tpl]cite book | title=Baronetage of England | first1=Edward | last1=Kimber | authorlink1=Edward Kimber | first2=Richard | last2=Johnson | first3=Thomas | last3=Wotton  | publisher=G.

Trelawny was again absent from Parliament in 1693 with his regiment in Flanders, where they saw fighting at the Battle of Landen. In November, Trelawny was appointed Vice-Admiral of South Cornwall in place of his elder brother, Bishop Trelawny. In this post, he was active in raising men for sea service over the next few years. While generally a Court supporter, he was thought likely to oppose the proposed council of trade in the 1696 session. He did sign the Association Oath and, unlike his brother, supported fixing guineas at 22s. During that year, he was a commissioner for receiving subscriptions to the abortive land bank project.
Trelawny took part in the 1696 and 1697 campaigns in Flanders, and was promoted to brigadier-general during the former. In the fall of 1698, he and Charles were again returned for East Looe, but Charles was also returned for Plymouth, where he was Governor and for which he preferred to sit. Their first cousin Sir Henry Seymour replaced Charles at East Looe in a by-election in January 1699. Henry opposed the bill for disbanding much of the standing army in 1699, although his regiment was not affected. He went on half-pay in March 1700.
In February 1701, he was returned with Charles for Plymouth, allowing Francis Godolphin to take the seat at East Looe. On 26 March 1701, he made a second marriage to Mary, the widow of Thomas Stawell and daughter of Richard Trevill; they had no children. By this time, he had been added to the commission of the peace for Devon. He opposed preparations for the English entry into the War of the Spanish Succession, but died on 8 January 1702. A large funeral was held for him at Plymouth.

The New England hotspot, also referred to as the Great Meteor hotspot, is a long-lived volcanic hotspot in the Atlantic Ocean. The hotspot's most recent eruptive center is the Great Meteor Seamount, and it probably created a short line of mid to late-Cenozoic age seamounts on the African Plate but appears to be currently inactive.Age Progressive Volcanism in the New England Seamounts and the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean Retrieved on 2007-10-05
The New England hotspot track is used to estimate the movement of the North American Plate away from the African Plate from early Cretaceous period to the present.
The New England hotspot has been overridden by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

Lorraine "Rainie" Cross is a fictional character from the BBC One soap opera EastEnders, played by Tanya Franks. Introduced as the drug-addicted sister of Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Franks has had three separate guest stints in 2007 (two episodes), 2008 (four episodes) and 2010 (seven episodes). On 12 April 2011, Franks reprised her role as Rainie, this time as a regular character, departing on 8 December the same year.
Described as "the slightly broken sister who's one step away from a vodka bottle", Rainie's storylines have often centred around her addictions to drugs and alcohol. During her seven episode guest stint in 2010, Rainie was involved in a highly criticised crack cocaine storyline with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). It was branded "inappropriate" and "horrid" by the Daily Record. Former EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy also criticised the storyline, saying she was "shocked", but Franks defended the storyline, though she herself was not surprised that viewers had complained.

CATEGORIES: Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Flags of the United States

The Lincoln assassination flags were the five flags which decorated the presidential box of Ford's Theatre, and which were present during John Wilkes Booth's assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, were in this box watching a production of Our American Cousin. Booth's spur was allegedly caught by one of the flags when he began his escape from the theatre and broke his leg; this part of the story, however, is disputed.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z4cR0V75LqEC |title=Following in Lincoln's Footsteps: A Complete Annotated Reference to Hundreds of Historical Sites Visited by Abraham Lincoln |first=Ralph |last=Gary |publisher=Carroll & Graf |place=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7867-1068-3 |pages=360–361 |quote=Most historians feel that Booth broke his leg at this point, although there is some evidence and argument that it may have been broken when his horse fell crossing into Maryland. [/tpl] Three of the flags were American flags and the other two were Treasury Guard flags. According to Civil War historians, three of these five original flags are currently accounted for.

[[Jean Ker, Countess of Roxburghe]]
CATEGORIES: 1580s births, 1643 deaths, Daughters of barons, Drummond family, Governesses, Scottish countesses, Scottish Roman Catholics, Women of the Stuart period, Year of birth uncertain

Jean Ker, Countess of Roxburghe (née Drummond; c.1585–1643), was a Scottish courtier.
She was born Jean Drummond, the daughter of Patrick Drummond, 3rd Lord Drummond, and his first wife, Elizabeth. In 1603, on the accession of James VI of Scotland to the throne of England (as James I), she accompanied his queen, Anne of Denmark, to Stirling Castle to take custody of their son, the Duke of Rothesay, and then to London shortly after where she served as Mistress of the Robes.
In 1607/08, a marriage was arranged between her and Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll, but amounted to nothing. Instead she became the second wife of Robert Ker, 1st Lord Roxburghe (later created Earl of Roxburghe), on 3 February 1614; the wedding was celebrated at Somerset House and attended by the king and queen.
In 1617, Queen Anne forced the countess to retire after it was discovered that her husband sought to be appointed Lord Chamberlain to Prince Charles (later Charles I), without either of them informing the queen. Her dismissal particularly alarmed the ambassadors of Spain and Venice, who had relied on the Catholic countess as a confidante to the queen.
In 1630, the by-now Charles I had wished to appoint the countess as governess to his son, the Prince of Wales (later Charles II) but this was objected to on the grounds of her religion and the Countess of Dorset was appointed instead. A year later however, Lady Roxburghe was appointed governess to Princess Mary and later to Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth in 1641. In 1642, the countess accompanied Princess Mary to The Hague after the latter's marriage to Prince William of Orange but was soon replaced by Lady Stanhope. On her return to England, she resumed her governess-ship to Henry and Elizabeth and died the following year.

[[Abbamele]]

CATEGORIES: Italian cuisine, Honey, Rural culture, Cuisine of Sardinia

Abbamele is a honey-based product from the rural culture of Sardinia, Italy. It is also sometimes called "abbattu", "abazu" or "honey sapa".
According to the traditional methods of preparation, honeycombs are crushed, and the balls of wax containing 20-30% of honey are collected in "lucky" containers. In the days immediately after all the honey extract has settled, the remaining combs containing honey and pollen are dipped in hot water (~ 50 ° C), so that the water dissolves all the honey still present in the combs. At this point, any remaining lumps of wax and pollen are broken up through the use of a suitable mixer or by hand. The remaining wax is then pressed further to squeeze out any remaining liquid and is then stored in appropriate containers. The remaining liquid from the previous step is filtered, for example with a linen cloth, at least two times, and then placed in a suitable high-capacity boiler (sometimes made of copper) where it is boiled and concentrated via decoction.http://www.gourmetsardinia.com/s_abbamele.html During this "concentration", finely cut lemon or orange rinds are added, and any impurities on the surface of the liquid are removed. The content of the boiler becomes gradually syrupy and must be kept in constant motion to prevent sticking on the bottom. The liquid also becomes caramelized, becoming dark like molasses but much more complex, with a toasty flavor that has hints of coffee and caramel. When the liquid assumes a consistency similar to that of honey, the heating is interrupted, and the boiler is deposited in a secluded place and allowed to cool before the abbamele is obtained.
The resulting abbamele has a concentrated honey flavour, and can be eaten with cheese, fresh fruit or even pasta or vegetables. http://www.zingermans.com/product.aspx?productid=p-abb

CATEGORIES: Mayflies

Ephemerellidae are known as the Spiny Crawler Mayflies. They are a family of the order Ephemeroptera. There are 8 genera consisting of a total 90 species (Merritt & Cummins). They are distributed throughout North America as well as the UK. Their habitat is lotic-erosional, they are found in all sizes of flowing streams on different types of substrates where there is reduced flow. They are even found on the shores of lakes and beaches where there wave action present. They move by swimming and clinging, they are very well camouflaged. Most species have one generation per year. They are mostly collector-gatherers. 
If threatened by a predator, the larva will raise its three tails in a "scorpion posture" to appear larger. It will then project its tails in front and poke the enemy. Most species are sensitive to disturbance.
In the UK, the most commonly recorded species is Seratella ignita. The nymph of this animal is often distinguished from other Mayflies by the darker bands prominent on the legs and tails. Although another rare species Ephemerella notata lacks these prominent bands, and so are more difficult to identify.

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the emergence of sovereign Republic of Belarus, the situation of the Polish minority has been steadily improving.

Poles in Belarus began re-establishing the Polish language schools and their legal right of participating in the religious life. However, the attitude of new authorities to Polish minority are not very consistent.

The Battle of Catraeth was fought around AD 600 between a force raised by the Gododdin, a Brythonic people of the Hen Ogledd or "Old North" of Britain, and the Angles of Bernicia and Deira. It was evidently an assault by the Gododdin party on the Angle stronghold of Catraeth, perhaps Catterick, North Yorkshire. The Gododdin force was said to have consisted of warriors from all over the Hen Ogledd, and even some from as far afield as Gwynedd in North Wales and Pictland. The battle was disastrous for the Britons, who were nearly all killed. The slain warriors were commemorated in the important early poem Y Gododdin, attributed to Aneirin.

Caenidae, or the Small Squaregill Mayflies, is a family of insects consisting of 4 genera comprising 26 individual species. They are found throughout North America in lotic, depostional environments, and they are sprawlers. Caenids occur in quiet and even stagnant water and are often overlooked because they are so small. They like to live in silty bottoms, and their gills are specially adapted for such environments. Adults usually emerge from May to September, but they emerge all year in Florida. Unlike other mayflies, squaregills can be found in degraded conditions and are not reliable markers for undisturbed conditions.

[[Eldon Shamblin]]

CATEGORIES: American country guitarists, Western swing performers, Musicians from Oklahoma, 1916 births, 1998 deaths

Eldon Shamblin (April 24, 1916 - August 5, 1998) was an American guitarist and arranger, particularly important to the development of Western swing music as one of the first electric guitarists in a popular dance band.
Born in Clinton, Oklahoma, Shamblin learned guitar at a young age and learned to read music at his sister's piano. He became interested in Jazz when he heard Eddie Lang and Joe Venuti. In time he purchased transcriptions of Eddie's solos and learned them when he became interested in arranging, a skill he later proved to be in demand for as the Big Band era swept the nation. As a teenager he migrated from Weatherford, OK to Oklahoma City where he played some of the roughest dives and nightclubs and landed a daily 15 minute radio show where he sang and accompanied himself on his guitar. Eventually he wound up playing in hotel bands there in OK City with jazz musicians playing selections that were soon to become classics. His local fame spread and he soon was known as the other great guitarist in Oklahoma, the first being a young Charlie Christian who was playing in venues down in the Deep Deuce area of 2nd St and also with groups that had programs on some of the same radio stations as Eldon. Charlie played in a lot of the nightclubs on the 'other' side of town where few white people ventured. Likewise Blacks seldom were seen in the 'white' section. In the Deep Deuce area the color lines were often completely forgotten as in mixed races Jam sessions at Salathiel's Barn where Charlie was known to have played with steel guitarist Noel Boggs and pianist Clarence Cagle, both of whom figured into the Western Swing music of Bob Wills and other bands of the genre. Ironically, some of these artists played in clubs which were across the alley from one another, often well within earshot of the back door. Music being a bond between races it's said that Eldon & Charlie possibly heard one another either on the air or across the alleys.
In 1934 The Alabama Boys an early western swing band led by non-musician Dave Edwards came through Oklahoma City. When they heard him on the radio they recruited Eldon to join them as their new singer and guitarist. Eldon left with them en route to Tulsa where they headquartered having landed radio spots on KVOO and eventual jobs at various dancehalls there. He stayed with the Alabama Boys for about three years. He later had his own radio show and eventually joined another group playing hotels performing classical songs in the swing band tradition. By then Bob Wills had already began calling him. Bob was persuasive but Eldon was reluctant at first until Wills made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Bob sold him on the security of a future he could bank on. He joined Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys in November 1937.
A self-taught guitarist, he quickly became the band's musical arranger as he had learned to read charts by studying big band arrangements.Price, Jazz Guitar and Western Swing, p.81: "Eldon Shamblin was a session player for CBS and a regular in standard jazz and swing bands before he joined Bob Wills." Shamblin's trademark electric guitar style and musical knowledge was key to the success of Wills' Western swing.Carr, Western Swing Guitar Style, p. 3: "Many of these recordings feature the great Eldon Shamblin, Bob Wills' longtime guitarist and the undisputed master of this style guitar." His guitar featured prominently on the band's 1946 hit "Ida Red", which was later rewritten by Chuck Berry as "Maybellene". Then, on "Take Me Back To Tulsa" in 1940, he invented a two-beat rhythm arrangement which became his trademark sound.
Over the years Shamblin's rhythm style incorporated many dynamics including a Big Band style much the same as Freddie Greene from the Count Basie Orchestra. Based on much of what he learned from studying Eddie Lang's recorded work and transcribed solos Eldon was an a very creative innovator in his chord voicings moving beyond what Lang had brought to the fore along with other Lang influenced guitarists including Dick McDonough, Karl Kress and George Van Eps. Shamblin ranks right up there with the finest of these but is lesser known for his contributions because of his western swing affiliation which was looked down upon by many in the Jazz world because of western themes and dress, albeit the music was swing and utilized much of Jazz and other styles in the music produced by bands such as Bob Wills who was the most eclectic and swingingest of all WS bands. Over the years he hired many great musicians who had been in the known Jazz world and several who cut their teeth in his Playboys band who went to on Jazz careers.
Shamblin's lead guitar work was such that in April 1941 Metronome magazine called him the most creative and inventive guitarist since the discovery of Charlie Christian and the best white guitarist with the greatest flow of fresh ideas like Charlie played. They acknowledged Eldon as an emulator of Christian's style and made the distinction that he was an innovator and not an imitator of Charlie's style. Thirty years later a Rolling Stone editor wrote a piece on him called "Eldon Shamblin - the Greatest Rhythm Guitarist in the World" hailing Eldon for his creativity, solidity and echoing Metronome magazine's much earlier assessment. Similarly, Down Beat acknowledged Eldon's legendary status as a major contributor to the world of guitar noting he was Jazz oriented and a Swing musician albeit working in Western Swing and Country bands, particularly Merle Haggard who was on the cover - a first for the publication, granting a Country artist the coveted cover issue.
Over the years Eldon's lead guitar solo outings took on a life of their own evolving and moving along with the times. His acoustic single string lead guitar work in the 30's smacked of Lang and Django Reinhardt influences, while his occasional brief chord solos speak to an immense knowledge of harmony and the fretboard on a par with George Van Eps. By the 40's his style was reminiscent of early Bebop with the occasional chord flourish added to good effect. Bob Wills only told Eldon what to play on two occasions, the first being during recording Ida Red when he instructed him to put a lot of runs in his rhythm chords (because the bass player was very perfunctory) and after WWII he told Bob to "gouge your licks like ol' Junior" speaking of Junior Barnard who was in and out of the band and had a very bluesy style that was low down and dirty. Bob asked Eldon to bend the strings and turn up the volume. The result was Eldon venturing into what can now be considered proto-rockabilly with his somewhat "less than Junior" attack, playing more reserved by executing his licks with more harmonic structure and more intricacy in his very forward thinking solos. In the 40's Junior heralded what was to become rock guitar in the 60's with his proto-grunge distortion and sustain while Eldon held the reins and visited the soon to come Rockabilly era in California, Oklahoma and Texas a full decade before it launched in Memphis.
At any rate Rockabilly and Rock and Roll owe a debt to Bob Wills and his great guitarists of the 30's, 40's and 50's. Guitarist Jimmy Wyble who was a Texas Playboy from late 1943 until Spring 1945 waxed some of the finest guitars solos on record in any genre with Bob Wills on hits like Roly Poly and Texas Playboy Rag. His licks can be traced directly to almost note for note rip offs on Gene Vincent's recordings from his great sessions with guitarist Cliff Gallup. He also heavily influenced Hank Garland in Nashville and Jimmy Bryant on the coast in CA. Wyble went on to play Jazz with Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, Red Norvo and made solo Jazz albums as well as several Jazz guitar teaching resources. His Bebop style was closer to Christian's yet forward thinking and very distinct from Eldon's or any other western swing player. Eldon's lead stands out as something organic in that it was constantly growing in new directions, while Junior and Wyble were in their own respective Blues and Bebop Jazz bags.
During his tenure with Wills, Eldon played his 1936 Gibson Super 400 which he had bought from Wills upon joining, paying monthly payments. At Wills request he also purchased a Gibson ES-150 electric guitar and matching EH-150 amplifier in 1938. Eldon and Playboys steel guitarist Leon McAuliffe began experimenting with what would become their trademark Twin Guitar idiom right away in the motel rooms when they traveled just to amuse themselves in their off duty hours. One day a couple years later at a rehearsal Bob Wills heard what they were doing and asked them to work up a solo arrangement for a fiddle tune he was going to record called Bob Wills Special. That day one of Western Swing's most endearing guitar excursions came about and was quickly added to the arrangement of the song, where it remains to this day. A few days later Wills asked them to write a special instrumental that would feature them as primary artists. They quickly came up with not one but two tunes, Twin Guitar Special which Wills recorded along with his own Special fiddle tune in 1940. The other tune Eldon and Leon came up with was called Twin Guitar Boogie which Wills never recorded because Wills thought the tune was too 'out there' so he passed. The tune still made the set lists at dances and got airplay on KVOO as rare transcribed radio broadcasts from Cain's Ballroom attest. McAuliffe recorded this song on one of his Capitol albums from the 60's under the name Bouncing Bobby (a nickname for fiddler Bobby Bruce). In December 1973 Wills made his last recording in Dallas with an all-star cast of past Playboys including Eldon & Leon who played Twin Guitar Special but it was renamed Twin Guitar Boogie with the two of them listed as composers. The 'twin guitar' idiom inspired a whole generation of guitarists over the years including Dickie Betts of the Allman Brothers band who has attributed his twin lead work with the late Duane Allman and more notably the uncredited Les Dudek who played on the Brothers and Sisters album with their hit song Rambling Man and Jessica both of which feature great twin leads owing much to what Eldon & Leon invented.
Shamblin logged over 300 recorded sides with Bob Wills from 1938 until 1954. He also was in a few Hollywood films with Bob Wills most notably Take Me Back to Oklahoma with Tex Ritter etc. and Go West, Young Lady featuring Penny Singleton and the up-and-coming Glenn Ford. Wills music can be heard to great advantage in both of these films as well as Eldon's guitar.
Shamblin was drafted into the Army in 1942, where he served for four years as a Captain in Patton's 3rd Army in the European Theater of War and was there at the Battle of the Bulge. After his discharge he rejoined the Texas Playboys in September 1946 (after a brief stint with Leon McAuliffe's Western Swing Band in Tulsa), rejoining Wills in Fresno, CA where the Playboys were headquartered, staying with them until 1956. In 1957 Eldon joined Hoyle Nix and the West Texas Cowboys band in Big Spring, Texas where they played at the Stampede Ballroom. After two years on the Nix band Eldon returned to Tulsa where he managed a convenience store and went to night school earning a CPA license. He quickly decided the CPA business was not for him and began teaching guitar at the Guitar House music store there in Tulsa. He expanded his work to becoming a first rate piano tuner and electronic organ serviceman who was much in demand.
He returned to music in 1970 when he was called upon to help organize a tribute to Wills and played on Merle Haggard's album A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (or, My Salute to Bob Wills). Shamblin later joined Haggard's award winning Stranger's band, the Strangers in 1973. He toured with Hag on a fairly irregular basis, with most of his participation being in the Oklahoma & Texas area as well as Hag's usual seasonal 2 week stands every year at Harrah's in Reno, NV. Eldon played sessions with Hag in Hollywood at Capitol Records and studios in Nashville, TN. During his off time he worked in Tulsa playing locally with various acts playing everything from Jazz to Swing, Country music to western swing. Most notably was his presence at the Caravan Ballroom playing in a band led by Shirl Cummins a local drummer who owned a first class music store there in Tulsa called The Guitar House where Eldon taught music and guitar and also worked tuning guitars and servicing keyboard instruments. Shamblin had his own piano tuning and electronic organ servicing business that afforded him a decent living because he was so in demand. At one point he had nearly every church in town as one his accounts. Word has it that not only was he the best in town, he was the least expensive and most reliable.
In 1983 Eldon left Haggard because he was tired of the touring which had become more frequent and the extended stays away from home and his business. He returned to Tulsa and joined a late version of the Texas Playboys in 1983 led by Leon McAuliffe who fronted the Original Texas Playboys band which had been reassembled in 1971 for the 1st occasion of Bob Wills Days celebration held every year since the last weekend of April in Turkey, Texas near the area where Wills grew up. The Original Playboys recorded several albums for the now defunct Delta Records (as well as 2 pre-Eldon outings for Capitol Records featuring Bob Kiser on guitar) which also re-released an album that had been recorded locally called Eldon Shamblin - Guitar Genius. Eldon recorded with other artists including an album by Joe Venuti with Jethro Burns and Curly Chalker - 'S Wonderful 4 Giants of Swing as well as solo outings by fellow Texas Playboys & Stranger's allumnus Tiny Moore, Tiny Moore Music and Back To Back with Jethro Burns accompanied by two Jazz greats Ray Brown and Shelly Manne, as well as guest recording spots with Asleep at the Wheel, George Strait, Willie Nelson, Johnny Gimble and a host of others. Shamblin is noted for playing one of the first Fender Stratocaster electric guitars ever made which was a demonstrator model given to him personally by Leo Fender in March 1954. That same month Eldon used the guitar with the Texas Playboys in what became the final Bob Wills recording session for MGM Records. Eldon used this guitar and a borrowed Gibson Switchmaster loaned to him by Billy Strange took the guitar on the road with Bob Wills up through California on a month and half long tour of the great Northwest. The guitar is notable in that Eric Clapton called Eldon at his home in Tulsa and offered him $10,000 for it in the early 80's. It is in a collector's hands but has fetched even larger sums in the scant half dozen owners it has had since Eldon sold it in the early 90's.
By 1996 Shamblin was in ill health and retired from music except for a few of rare special appearances. He died in a nursing home in Sapulpa, OK on August 5, 1998. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 (along with Bob Wills and a select group of about a dozen the most active and productive of his Texas Playboys) and was also inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2006.

[[Hannan–Quinn information criterion]]

CATEGORIES: Regression variable selection

In statistics, the Hannan–Quinn information criterion (HQC) is a criterion for model selection.  It is an alternative to Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). It is given as
where k is the number of parameters, n is the number of observations, and RSS is the residual sum of squares that results from linear regression or other statistical model. 
Burnham & Anderson (2002) say that HQC, "while often cited, seems to have seen little use in practice" (p. 287).  They also note that HQC, like BIC, but unlike AIC, is not an estimator of Kullback–Leibler divergence.  Claeskens & Hjort (2008) note that HQC, like BIC, but unlike AIC, is not asymptotically efficient (Ch. 4), and further point out that whatever method is being used for fine-tuning the criterion will be more important in practice than the term log log n, since this latter number is small even for very large n.

Jennifer Joyce (born September 25, 1980 in Vancouver, British Columbia) is a Canadian hammer thrower. 
While growing up outside of Vancouver, Joyce excelled in multiple sports as a child. In addition to athletics, she participated in soccer and volleyball, earning a spot on the British Columbia soccer provincial team in 1994. However, her greatest success came in hammer throw, in which she won three national junior titles from 1997 to 1999. As a freshman at the University of California, Berkeley, Joyce continued her success and set a Canadian junior national record of 58.90m. Through the course of her successful career as a Golden Bear, Joyce became a Pac-10 Champion and two NCAA All-American. She also was a four-time qualifier for the NCAA Championships, placing as high as fourth in 2000.
In 2003, her first year as a post-collegiate athlete, Joyce continued to train in California and won her first Canadian senior title. She successfully defended her title in 2004 and 2005 and earned a spot on the Canadian team for the 2005 World Championships. Joyce also set a national record of 68.48 meters that season. She then followed up her successful 2005 season with a silver medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games.
In 2009, Joyce won her fourth national title and improved her personal best to 70.35m, becoming just the second Canadian to surpass 70 meters.
In addition to throwing, Joyce served as an assistant coach for the University of California's track and field team from 2003 until 2007. During her tenure, she coached several NCAA All-Americans and guided Kelechi Anyanwu to the first NCAA women's discus title in school history. She also coached Amin Nikfar to gold at the 2004 Asian Indoor Championships. Since 2008, she has lived in Kamloops, British Columbia, where she continues to train and also works as a personal trainer.

Monte Cristi Pipe Wreck is a submerged archaeological site located on the north coast of Hispaniola in the Dominican Republic near the border of Haiti, part of the Greater Antilles in the Caribbean. The site is one of the hundreds of historic shipwrecks that lie on the ocean floor between Monte Cristi and Puerto Plata.
Archaeological evidence indicates that the shipwreck is one of a merchant trader probably sinking in the second half of the 17th century. Hispanola, together with Jamaica, was originally settled by  adventurous men seeking the life of a buccaneer and these islands thrived through piracy rather than through growing sugar until the 18th century.  The historical and geological information together indicates  that the ship was likely to have been a buccaneer vessel headed to the Americas most likely for the Upper Hudson River Valley.

[[Office 2004 for Mac]]
CATEGORIES: Microsoft Office, OS X-only software, 2004 software

Office 2004 for Mac is a version of Microsoft Office developed for Mac OS X. The software was originally written for PowerPC Macs, so Macs with Intel CPUs must run the program under Mac OS X's Rosetta emulation layer. For this reason, it is not compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 and newer.
Office 2004 was replaced by its successor, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, which was developed as a universal binary to run natively on Intel Macs. However, Office 2008 did not include support for Visual Basic for Applications, which made Microsoft extend the support period by an additional 27 months for their older Office 2004.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.officeformac.com/blog/Office-2004-Mainstream-Support-Has-Been-Extended |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20091017111327/http://www.officeformac.com/blog/Office-2004-Mainstream-Support-Has-Been-Extended |archivedate=October 17, 2009 | title=Office 2004 Mainstream Support Has Been Extended | publisher=Microsoft | work=Mactopia | date=October 12, 2009 | accessdate=October 12, 2009 | last=Tedesco | first=Mike[/tpl] Microsoft ultimately shipped support for Visual Basic in Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac, which also dropped PowerPC support altogether.
As of January 10, 2012, support for Office 2004 for Mac has ended: no further updates or support will be provided from Microsoft.[tpl]cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=2490 |title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle |publisher=Microsoft |work=Support |accessdate=April 28, 2013[/tpl]

Chauncey Wendell Bailey, Jr.  (October 20, 1949 – August 2, 2007) was an American journalist, noted for his work primarily on issues of the African American community. He served as editor-in-chief of The Oakland Post in Oakland, California from June 2007 until his death. His 37-year career in journalism included lengthy periods as a reporter at The Detroit News and  The Oakland Tribune. He was shot dead on a Downtown Oakland street on August 2, 2007.[tpl]cite news | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/02/BAGGCRBL8A6.DTL&tsp=1 | title=Hit man kills newspaper editor on Oakland street | author=Christopher Heredia, Leslie Fulbright and Marisa Lagos | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=2007-08-02[/tpl] His death outraged fellow journalists, who joined together to create the Chauncey Bailey Project dedicated to continuing his work and uncovering the facts of his murder. In June 2011 Yusuf Bey IV, a local bakery owner, and his associate Antoine Mackey were convicted of ordering Bailey's murder. A third man, bakery handyman Devaughndre Brousard, had earlier confessed to being the triggerman. Bailey had been doing investigative reporting about Bey and his business; Bailey was the first American journalist killed for domestic reporting since 1976.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/10/local/la-me-bailey-20110610|title=Two convicted of murder in shooting of Oakland journalist|last=Romney|first=Lee|date=June 10, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 August 2013[/tpl]

[[Shock and Vibration Information Analysis Center]]
CATEGORIES: Engineering societies, Earthquake engineering

The Shock and Vibration Information Analysis Center (SAVIAC) is a U.S. Government organization established by the U.S. Navy Office of Naval Research on 20 December 1946.  SAVIAC's purpose is to promulgate information on the transient and vibratory response of structures and materials.  This broad field includes such technical areas as the testing, analysis and design of structural or mechanical systems subjected to dynamic conditions and loading such as vibration, blast, impact, and shock for various agencies in the U. S. Government including NASA, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Defense (DOD).  The organization sponsored the professional journal Shock and Vibration Journal and currently sponsors and publishes the professional journal Journal of Critical Technology in Shock and Vibration.  SAVIAC also sponsored and published a series of monograms addressing different aspects of shock and vibration.  In 2012 SAVIAC became inactive as a result of new Department of Defense cost-cutting regulations limiting DoD sponsorship and participation of conferences and workshops.  SAVIAC has been succeeded by an industrially-funded and managed "Shock and Vibration Exchange" SAVE.
SAVIAC assembled and promoted a yearly symposium. The annual Shock and Vibration Symposium was the leading forum for the structural dynamics and vibration community to present and discuss new developments and on-going research. The Symposium, established in 1947, includes both classified and unclassified sessions. The classified sessions allow critical technology and classified (up to secret level) research to be presented in closed forums of cleared U.S. government and government contractor researchers. Topics covered at the symposium include shock-ship testing, water shock, weapons effects (air blast, ground shock, cratering, penetration), shock physics, earthquake engineering, structural dynamics, and shock and vibration instrumentation and experiment techniques. Over 200 technical papers were typically presented. Panel discussions addressed topics such as new software developments or accelerometer isolation problems. Tutorials provide up-to-date technology overviews by leading specialists.  Since 2012 the Shock and Vibration Symposium has continued under the management and sponsorship of SAVE.

The Sorlie Memorial Bridge, also known as the Red River Bridge was built in 1929 by the Minneapolis Bridge Company to connect the cities of Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand Forks, Minnesota. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
The Sorlie Memorial Bridge replaced a swing bridge on the same site that was constructed in 1889.  It is a Parker through truss bridge with two truss spans and rides on rails to accommodate the everchanging banks of the Red River of the North. The Sorlie Memorial Bridge was named for North Dakota's 14th governor, Arthur G. Sorlie.  Plaques on either end identify Sorlie as "a true friend of better roads and bridges."  At the time, the bridge was the only vehicular crossing in the area, and was important for carrying U.S. Route 2, a transcontinental route.  It is the oldest documented Parker truss design in the state, and its two spans of [tpl]convert|283|ft[/tpl] are the longest riveted Parker through trusses in the state.

The site consists of approximately [tpl]convert|2.2|acre|m2[/tpl]. From about 1897 to 2007, the site contained three low-rise mercantile buildings called the Russia, Graphic Arts, and Tufts Buildings. The office tower is being constructed on the site of the Graphic Arts and Tufts Buildings. As of 2009, Boston Properties has begun to refer to the building as Atlantic Wharf. 
The project was controversial because of the historic nature of the buildings and their prominent position on the edge of Fort Point Channel. The end result was that the "Russia Building" fronting on Atlantic Avenue was retained in its entirety and the south and east facing historic brick facades of the Graphic Arts and Tufts Buildings were retained and restored. The interiors of these two buildings were destroyed and a new tower was built, rising [tpl]convert|300|ft|m[/tpl] above the old facades.  The building rises 32 stories above the street and extends 6 stories below.
In the fall of 2009, the project created additional controversy when its developer, Boston Properties, was accused by The Boston Harbor Association of reneging on public space requirements which Boston Properties agreed to in exchange for being allowed to exceed height restrictions.[tpl]cite news|url = http://boston.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2009/09/14/daily44.html|title = Boston Properties recasting Russia Wharf plan amid outcry | publisher = The Boston Business Journal | date = Fall 2009 | accessdate = 2009-09-29 | first=MIchelle | last=Hillman[/tpl]   The building opened in January 2011 and boasts multiple ground floor restaurants, an art gallery, multi-media center, channel concierges and is the new home of the Boston Society of Architect's Center for Architecture and Design, all available to the public. This is the first LEED platinum high-rise in Boston.

Meatcake, or meatloaf cake, is a cake or other dessert look-alike that is made with meat in a meatloaf style, and not a pastry.
The term is used in a sketch by comedian George Carlin, in which he describes finding an unidentifiable item in the refrigerator.  "Could be meat, could be cake....  It looks like... meatcake!"  However, meatcake itself has occurred as a delicacy for quite some time before George Carlin.  Also, meatcake (like beefcake) has been used as a term to refer to strong men who pose as models in club venues, for heterosexual women or homosexual men.
Meatcake can also refer to an Asian dish similar to meatloaf.  Ground meat (e.g. pork, fish, etc.) can be mixed with other ingredients (e.g. pickled greens), and steamed.  Often served with rice or congee.

[[Three-player chess]]
CATEGORIES: Chess variants

Three-player chess (also known as Three-handed, Three-man, or Three-way chess) is a family of chess variants specially designed for three players.[ref]
</ref> Many variations of three-player chess have been devised. They usually use a non-standard [[Board game|board]], for example, a [[hexagon]]al or three-sided board that connects the center cells (board "squares") in a special way. The three armies are differentiated usually by color.
Three-player chess variants (as well as other three-player games) are the hardest to design fairly, since the imbalance created when two players gang up against one is usually too great for the defending player to withstand. Some versions attempt to avoid this "petty diplomacy"[ref]
</ref> problem by determining the victor as the player who first delivers [[checkmate]] (with the third player losing in addition to the checkmated player). Other solutions have been tried as well.

[[Alton Junction]]
CATEGORIES: Transportation in Chicago, Illinois, Rail junctions in the United States

The Alton Junction, more commonly known as the 21st Street Crossing, is a historically significant rail location in Chicago, Illinois. The junction can be found just east of Canal Street and north of Cermak Road near Chicago's Chinatown. It is located just south of a massive vertical lift bridge that spans the South Branch of the Chicago River and "guards" the entrance to Chicago's Union Station. While a significant amount of rail traffic still traverses this interlock everyday, it has been greatly reduced from using 26 diamonds to control over 150 trains using the crossing.
The north-south line is the former Pennsylvania Railroad (Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago) mainline, which is now owned and operated by Amtrak as the southern gateway to the Union Station complex. The Norfolk Southern's Chicago Line terminates at the southern entrance to the interlocking, but both NS and Burlington Northern Santa Fe trains have trackage rights over the bridge to access the BNSF east-west main line.  All of Amtrak's East Coast bound and Michigan trains use this track. The east-west line now belongs to the Canadian National Railway. It at one time was owned by Illinois Central and was the carrier's route out of its Central Station to Iowa.
Alton Junction was controlled by a manned interlocking tower until 2005 when Amtrak transferred control to its new Chicago Terminal control center.  Known as 21st Street tower, its operators handled movements through the busy plant using a US&S Model 14 electro-pneumatic interlocking machine.  In its final years 21st St took remote control of the closed Amtrak Clara St tower in New Orleans.  In 2006 the closed brick tower was demolished.

Aonghas Mór (Anglicized: "Angus the Elder" or "Great"), also known as Aonghas a Íle ("Angus of Islay") and Aonghas mac Domhnaill (Modern: Aonghas MacDhòmhnaill; Anglicized: "Angus MacDonald" or "Angus, Donald's son"), was the son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, eponymous progenitor of Clan Donald.
Aonghas Mór has been called "the first MacDonald" by one historian,Sellar, "Hebridean Sea-Kings", p. 207. namely because he was the first of the dynasty created by his father to rule Islay. Islay was the centre of the lordship of both Aonghas and his father; and according to a contemporary praise-poem, the realm Aonghas inherited from Domhnall included "every house from Mull to Kintyre" (gach teach ò Mhuile go Maoil).Text and translation, Wilson & Bateman, Duanaire Na Sracaire, p. 83.

Lieutenant Commander Shepard is the player character in BioWare's Mass Effect game trilogy: Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3. A veteran soldier of the Systems Alliance Navy military and N7-graduate of the Interplanetary Combatives Training (ICT) program, and the first human Citadel Council Spectre, Shepard works to stop "the Reapers", a sentient synthetic-machine race dedicated to wiping out all organic life. Shepard's gender, class, first name and general appearance are chosen and customised by the player. Mark Meer provides the voice for male Shepards, while Jennifer Hale voices females.
Alan Shepard was the source of the character's name. Shepard's armour developed over the series, and was originally intended to be red-and-white. Though both genders were given equal importance during development, marketing felt there was a need for a single identifiable hero for promotion of the game. Various merchandise has been made, including several figurines. Shepard has appeared in cameo appearances in other Electronic Arts games, though they will not be appearing in any future Mass Effect ones.
The character has received generally positive reception; the commander has been included on several "top character" lists, and Joe Juba of Game Informer titled them their favourite RPG protagonist of 2012. However, Maxim has criticised their armor and IGN's Andrew Goldfarb felt the character should not have been revisited through Mass Effect 3 downloadable content. Heavy focus was given to the female Shepard, nicknamed "FemShep", by the fans and critical sources.

Hans Kurath (13 December 1891 – 2 January 1992) was an American linguist of Austrian origin. He was full professor for English and Linguistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The many varieties of regional English he encountered during these trips convinced Kurath of the necessity of completing a systematic study of American English. In 1926 he convinced the Modern Language Association to begin planning for the project and in 1931 a pilot study of the New England region was initiated under his direction. It soon became clear, however, that the undertaking was too complex to be completed by a single team of linguists and the project was expanded to eight additional regional operations. Kurath guided the vision and goals of the regional projects for three decades and oversaw the publication of a series of volumes that are known collectively as the Linguistic Atlas of the United States.http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/17
He is predominantly known for publishing the first linguistic atlas of the US, the Linguistic Atlas of New England, for which he received the Loubat Prize, and for being the first main editor of the Middle English Dictionary. Together with Raven I. McDavid, Jr. he also published a linguistic atlas of the eastern United States, The Pronunciation of English in the Atlantic States.

[[Look See Proof]]

CATEGORIES: English indie rock groups, Musical groups established in 2006, Musical groups disestablished in 2009

Look See Proof were a five-piece indie pop-rock band from Hertfordshire.
Founded in 2006, Look See Proof played in venues across the UK supporting bands like The Fratellis, The Rifles, Foals, The Dykeenies, Breaks Co-Op, Good Shoes, The Twang, and The Holloways.
High profile appearances include playing Club NME at KOKO, Glastonbury Festival, Camden Crawl, The Great Escape and Guilfest.
The band released two singles on Tigertrap Records ('Tell Me Tell Me Tell Me'/'Start Again' and 'Discussions'/'Singles The New Together') and were asked to perform live for Steve Lamacq's show on Radio 1 at Maida Vale. First single 'Tell Me Tell Me Tell Me' was awarded "single of the week" on Steve Lamacq's BBC6 Music show and sold out within a week of its release date. The two singles were also played by Fearne Cotton, John Kennedy, Marc Riley, and Chris Moyles.
Third single 'Casualty' was released on Weekender Records, and won Rebel Playlist on Steve Lamacq's show and received a warm reception from NME, with the video directed by Barry Sells (brother of David and Lee) receiving airtime on MTV2.
The fourth single 'Local Hero' was released on Weekender Records, to whom Look See Proof had been signed. The video received air time on MTV2. 
The band also played "Casualty" on Lily Allen's talk show, Lily Allen and Friends, after being voted to play by viewers. 
Having parted ways with Weekender, Look See Proof finished the year with a successful European tour and returned to the studio to begin demoing for a second album. In the second half of 2008 they enlisted guitar tech Jaime Randall to play tambourine and keyboards. 
On July 31, 2009, they played their last gig in Hitchin, Hertfordshire before splitting.
Since splitting, former members and brothers Lee Sells and David Sells have formed a new band called Burial Club which includes 2 new members.

Ahöla is one of the important chief kachinas for the First and Second Mesas because he opens the mid-winter Powamu ceremony, sometimes called the bean planting festival. On the first night of the festival, he performs inside a kiva, a ceremonial room, before going with the Powamu chief to give prayer feathers to Kachina Spring at dawn. Afterwards, Ahöla and the Powamu Chief visit all of the kivas and ceremonial houses, giving bean and corn plants and marking the doorways with stripes of meal. At the end of the ceremony, Ahöla descends to a shrine, bows four times to the Sun, and asks for health, happiness, long life, and good crops.

[[George Shadbolt]]

CATEGORIES: Pioneers of photography, British photographers, Botanists with author abbreviations

George Shadbolt (1817 - 1901) was a British writer, editor, student of optics and photographer with a strong interest in innovative techniques, who was active during the 1850s–60s. Reported to have made the first microphotograph, he was also an early advocate of photographic enlargement, as well as compound and combination printing. Shadbolt's dislike of the glare of albumen printing paper led him to forsake it for salted paper. His technical interests probably motivated his praise of Henry Peach Robinson, whose combination prints were highly controversial. For seven years Shadbolt was editor of the publication that later became the British Journal of Photography. One of his sons, Cecil V. S. Shadbolt, is remembered as a contributor to balloon photography.
After 1864, Shadbolt's success as a mahogany dealer forced him to retire from photography, although he maintained his professional affiliations. One of the founders of the Photographic Society of London (later the Royal Photographic Society), he also was active in the Amateur Photographic Association and the Photographic Exchange Club.

Jan Lavezzari (January 3, 1876 – May 11, 1947) was a gifted painter, born in Paris, France from a well known architect: Emile Lavezzari.
Jan studied engineering and then moved to Berck-sur-Mer, northern France in 1900, where he decided to become a professional painter instead, and settled there. Jan Lavezzari produced several oil paintings that are seemingly valuable today. He also painted murals in a few local public buildings such as 'Le Casino de la Forêt' in Touquet-Paris-Plage, the local hospital 'L'Hôpital Maritime' -built by his father- and the town hall.
Biographers record that Jan Lavezzari liked the outdoor, adventure and that he preferred the company of fishermen, who often took him out to sea. Jan Lavezzari is best known for his paintings, which generally portray sailboats. His engineering education in this maritime environment probably prompted him to realize that if a sail is placed horizontally, it could become a flying wing, so on February 15, 1904 at the age of 27 years, he tested a double lateen sail hang glider from the Berck beach sand dunes.

In chemistry a water cluster is a discrete hydrogen bonded assembly or cluster of molecules of water.[tpl]cite journal | title = Water: From Clusters to the Bulk | author = Ralf Ludwig | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  | year = 2001 | volume = 40 | pages = 1808–1827 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20010518)40:103.0.CO;2-1 | pmid=11385651 | issue = 10[/tpl] These clusters have been found experimentally or predicted in silico in various forms of water; in ice, in crystal lattices and in bulk liquid water, the simplest one being the water dimer (H2O)2 . Ongoing academic research is important because the realization that water manifests itself as clusters rather than an isotropic collection may help explain many anomalous water characteristics such as its highly unusual density temperature dependence. Water clusters are also implicated in the stabilization of certain supramolecular structures.  So little is understood about water clusters in bulk water that it is considered one of the unsolved problems in chemistry.

[[Konica F]]

CATEGORIES: SLR cameras, Konica F-mount cameras

The Konica F was the first 35 mm SLR camera produced by Konishiroku, released in February, 1960. It featured a built-in light metering system to set the correct exposure. The meter utilized a large selenium cell panel on the front of the viewfinder prism to detect light levels. This type sensor cell generates its own small electrical current, so the metering system does not require a battery. On the other hand, selenium cells are known to degrade over time, losing accuracy or eventually failing. Many cameras and handheld meters relied upon selenium cells at one time, but they were gradually replaced by CdS and other types of cells that require a battery, but tend to give long-term reliability. Between 600 and 1500 total Konica Fs were produced, making it a highly sought-after camera.[tpl]Fact|date=September 2007[/tpl] 
Prior to the Konica F's introduction, a prototype of the camera was displayed at a photo show in Japan. At that time it was called the Koniflex 35. The Koniflex name had been used in the mid-1950s on medium format twin lens reflex cameras. A low cost Konilette 35 camera was introduced in 1959.

Summers graduated from Duncanville High School in 1957 and attended Arlington State College, now known as the University of Texas at Arlington. That same year, he formed the rockabilly band The Rebels and performed on Joe Bill's Country Picnic on KRLD-TV where they were spotted by songwriter Jed Tarver. This led to the band being signed by newly found Jan Records. Their first record was released on February 1, 1958, under the name of Gene Summers & His Rebels.Gene Summers discography from Rockin' Country Style USAGene Summers discography from Rocky Productions FranceGene Summers discography from Wangdangdula Finland

[[Gibson ES-325]]

CATEGORIES: Gibson electric guitars

The Gibson ES-325 is a thinline hollowbody electric guitar model produced by the Gibson Guitar Corporation from 1972 to 1979. 
Although similar in appearance to the popular Gibson ES-335 semi-hollow guitar, the ES-325 was a significantly different guitar in construction and sound. Whereas the ES-335 was a semi-hollow guitar (having a hollow body with a solid block of maple running through the center) with standard humbucking pickups, the ES-325 was fully hollow, featured Gibson mini-humbucking pickups, had only one f-hole, and had a half-moon shaped plastic control plate supporting the electronics (input jack, volume and tone controls, and pickup selector switch). The 325's mini-humbucking pickups had non-adjustable poles, and were similar to those used on the Gibson Firebird. The instrument is also known for its slim neck profile.
The guitar was introduced in 1972 and was available in walnut and cherry (later changed to "cherry wine") finishes. Trapeze Tailpieces were standard, as on other fully hollow Gibsons. Due to its lack of popularity compared to the other Gibson thinline guitars (such as the ES-335, ES-345, and ES-355), the ES-325 was discontinued by Gibson in 1979.

[[Prenyltransferase]]

CATEGORIES: Peripheral membrane proteins, Protein domains

Prenyltransferases are a class of enzymes that transfer allylic prenyl groups to acceptor molecules.  Prenyl transferases commonly refer to prenyl diphosphate synthases.[tpl]cite journal | author = Takahashi S, Koyama T | title = Structure and function of cis-prenyl chain elongating enzymes | journal = Chem Rec | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 194–205 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16900467 | doi = 10.1002/tcr.20083 | url =  [/tpl]
Prenyltransferases are commonly divided into two classes, cis (or Z) and trans (or E), depending upon the stereochemistry of the resulting products.  Examples of trans-prenyltranferases include dimethylallyltranstransferase, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase. Cis-prenyltransferases include dehydrodolichol diphosphate synthase (involved in the production of a precursor to dolichol).
The beta subunit of the farnesyltransferases is responsible for peptide binding. Squalene-hopene cyclase is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the cyclization of squalene into hopene, a key step in hopanoid (triterpenoid) metabolism.[tpl]cite journal |author=Schulz GE, Wendt KU, Poralla K |title=Structure and function of a squalene cyclase |journal=Science |volume=277 |issue=5333 |pages=1811–1815 |year=1997 |pmid=9295270 |doi=10.1126/science.277.5333.1811[/tpl] Lanosterol synthase ([tpl]EC number|5.4.99.7[/tpl]) (oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase) catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene to lanosterol, the initial precursor of cholesterol, steroid hormones and vitamin D in vertebrates and of ergosterol in fungi.[tpl]cite journal |author=Prestwich GD, Poralla K, Hewelt A, Abe I, Reipen I, Sprenger G |title=A specific amino acid repeat in squalene and oxidosqualene cyclases |journal=Trends Biochem.

The St. Peter's Church was listed the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
The first resident Catholic priest came to Columbia in 1820. St. Peter's first church, designed by the South Carolina architect Robert Mills, was completed in 1824. This church was demolished in the early 1900s to build the new sanctuary. 
The new church was designed by Frank Pierce Milburn, a Southern architect. The planning and fundraising was done largely by Father Thomas J. Hegarty. Construction started in 1906 and was completed in 1908. The dedication was in January 1909. 
The Gothic Revival church was built with dark red brick with Bedford limestone and dull glazed terra cotta trim. The roof was Buckingham Slate. The spire is topped with a cross and is 163 ft (49.7 m) above grade. 
The church has a cruciform plan with a high nave. It is 131 ft (40 m) long and 79 ft (24.1 m) wide. The nave is 64 ft (19.5 m) long and 51 ft (15.6 m) tall.  The 3,500 lb (1,591 kg), 55 in (1.4 m) diameter bell was cast in 1911 by McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore, Maryland. 
The church graveyard is to the rear of the church.

Chilean passports are issued to citizens of Chile to facilitate international travel. They are valid for worldwide travel, unless a visa is required by the country the passport holder intends to visit.
Citizens of Chile do not need a passport when traveling to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. For these countries, they may use just their domestic identification cards called Cédula de Identidad.
Chilean passports are valid for a period of 5 years from the date of issue, and the validity may not be extended. Since the introduction of machine-readable passports, family passports are no longer issued.
Since September 2013, new biometric passports are being issued. The redesign was part of a program organized by the Ministry of Justice, where Chileans chose the passport's graphic identity and symbols through an online poll in 2012.

Cuban passports are issued to citizens of Cuba to facilitate international travel. They are valid for 6 years from the date of issuance, but have to be propagated every 2 years.Services and Consular Procedures, Embassy of Cuba in Suriname   
The cost of this passport is about US$200 (CUC 200) for every two years if one person lives in US.Cuban Interest Section in USA  
Until January 2013, the Cuban government required that all citizens desiring to leave the country would have to obtain an exit permit. This requirement was eased on 14 January 2013. The abolition of the hated requirement led to long lines at passport offices filled with citizens desiring to legally travel abroad; however, the lines were partly attributed to the fact that the cost of obtaining a passport was going to double the next day to the equivalent of US$100 (CUC 100), the equivalent of 5 months of average state salary. Now the passport is the only document required to leave the country, apart from a visa from the destination country. Previously the cost of a passport, exit permit, and associated paperwork added up to around  US$300 (CUC 300), the equivalent of 15 months of average state salary.[tpl]cite news|last=Rainsford|first=Sarah|title=Cubans set for foreign travel as exit permits abolished|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21008571|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 January 2013[/tpl]

Steve Linsdell, (born 1955, in Westoning, Bedfordshire), is a British motorcycle road racer, known mainly for his achievements aboard unlikely machines and in the Isle of Man TT. He started racing in 1977 on a hand-built 350cc Royal Enfield Bullet - a machine not commonly recognized as a race bike. However, he soon silenced sceptics after coming second in his first ever race. After this he had a virtual clean sweep over the next two seasons - adding a 700cc Royal Enfield as a second ride in 1978. 
His early results had him club champion at the Vintage Racing Motorcycle Club aboard his Royal Enfields. For several years he was said, in documents such as the Motor Cycle News, to be almost unbeatable.

Ryers is a neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia. Ryers is bounded by Cottman Avenue (Rt. 73) on the southwest, Fillmore Street on the northwest.http://www.phila.gov/phils/Docs/otherinfo/pname3.htm Both of these highways separate Philadelphia from Cheltenham and Rockledge, Montgomery County.  The Fox Chase Line separates Ryers from Burholme and Fox Chase borders it via Hartel St. on the northeast.
The name Ryers comes from the Ryerss Estate which is located in Burholme Park along Central Avenue.http://www.ryerssmuseum.org/donation%20form.pdf The Estate was owned by Joseph Waln Ryerss who left it to his son Robert, a lawyer. Eight months before he died at the age of 65, Robert shocked Philadelphia society by marrying his housekeeper of many years, Mary Ann Reed. The will stipulated that upon Mary Ann’s death the estate was to be turned over to the city of Philadelphia to be used as a park, library, and museum “free to the public.” Before she died, Mary Ann Ryerss turned the property over to the city of Philadelphia in 1905. The Ryerss Museum and Library was opened to the public in 1910 under the administration of the Fairmount Park Commission.http://ryerssmuseum.org/history1.htmlhttp://hiddencityphila.org/2013festival/2013prospectivesites/dossierryerss/ Who later left it to the Free Library of Philadelphia.

[[Priscilla Beach Theatre]]
CATEGORIES: Theatres in Massachusetts, Buildings and structures in Plymouth, Massachusetts, Visitor attractions in Plymouth County, Massachusetts

Priscilla Beach Theatre ("PBT"), located in the Manomet section of Plymouth at Priscilla Beach, was one of the original (and oldest) "barn" theatres in America. It was founded in 1937 by Dr. Franklin Trask. His wife, Agnes, became PBT's first artistic director. In addition to the 200-seat barn theatre, the original complex included several cottages, residences, dormitories, a mansion, carriage house and athletic field. The unique "learn-by-doing" training at PBT offered thousands of young acting students the opportunity to learn nearly every aspect of theatre training from fencing, dance and directing to make-up, lighting and set design.
During the 1940s and 1950s, PBT featured well-known guest stars in student productions. These luminaries included Edward Everett Horton, Veronica Lake, Charlie Ruggles and Gloria Swanson. During this era, as many as 150 actors and actresses were in residence, usually performing in one play during the evening, while rehearsing another play during the day. Also, many famous students grew from a rising crop of young talent, including Paul Newman, Robert MacNeil, Estelle Parsons, Pat Carroll, Sandy Dennis, Mike Todd, Jr., Dan Blocker, Jean Seberg, poet Daisy Aldan and Jan Scott, Emmy Award-winning art director.
During the 1960s, James Lonigro (stage name Geronimo Sands), replaced Mrs. Trask, becoming PBT's new artistic director, a position he still holds today. During his tenure, a new breed of talent emerged from the rigorous summer-stock training ground at the famous theatre school. This group includes Rob Reiner, Al Brooks, Andre Bishop (founder of Playwrights Horizons and Artistic Director of Theatres at Lincoln Center), news legend Andy Lack (former president of NBC News, producer of "60 Minutes", former CEO of Sony BMG and current CEO of the Bloomberg LP multimedia group), Curtis Sliwa (founder of the Guardian Angels), Jennifer Coolidge, Kitty Winn and Corey Carrier. During the 1970s, PBT was leased to Tufts University and, under the direction of Tony Award-winning producer Mitch Maxwell, saw Peter Gallagher on the barn stage.
Author and composer Rick Besoyan wrote "Little Mary Sunshine" while at PBT. Entertainer Mickey Rooney cited PBT as being the inspiration for the story and motion picture of "Babes in Arms", in which he starred alongside Judy Garland. Robert MacNeil praises Priscilla Beach Theatre on the popular PBS program, "Do You Speak American?" for helping him manage his Canadian accent.
PBT alumni have won (at least): four Academy Awards (Oscars), nine Tony Awards, three SAG Awards, four Golden Globes, six Golden Laurel Awards, a People's Choice Award, three New York Film Critics' Circle Awards, two Cannes Film Festival Awards, 15 Emmy Awards and, is represented by five stars on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.
The barn theatre at PBT is no longer used, as major renovations and repairs are necessary to bring it into operable condition. In the large main house, what was once the actor's dining hall has been converted into a small black box theatre. It is in this space where the tradition of stagecraft training continues to this day. For several years, PBT has focused its educational drive toward an even younger group of acting students, including children. In addition to on-site workshops and events, Priscilla Beach Theatre often brings directors, educators, performances and performers to several off-site facilities such as local schools and art centers.
Priscilla Beach Theatre is a non-profit school of drama.

I Count is a campaign of the Stop Climate Chaos coalition of UK NGOs.
The campaign aims to ensure that world leaders act on rising global greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep average global temperature increase to under 2°C (3.6°F) and so avoiding the more serious consequences of global warming.
In 2006 the campaign focused on the lead up to the Queen's speech, urging the Government to introduce a Climate Change Bill in the forthcoming Parliamentary session - including legally binding cuts  in emissions (3% per year and 50% by 2050), and an annual carbon budget.
The coalition organised the iCount Climate Change Rally on the 4th of November 2006 to coincide with the Stern Report.

[[Reptiles (magazine)]]

CATEGORIES: Animal and pet magazines, American magazines

Based in Irvine, California, REPTILES magazine is a North American consumer magazine dedicated to the reptile and amphibian pet hobby, specializing in the keeping and breeding of these animals.
Fancy Publications, later BowTie Inc., launched the magazine in October 1993.Spadafori, Gina (23 October 1993). Reptiles slither into the animal magazine kingdom, The Baltimore Sun After a year of publishing bimonthly, REPTILES went monthly in December 1994 due to the more widespread keeping of reptiles and amphibians as pets and the resulting increasing popularity of the magazine.
Tips and information on keeping and breeding different herps usually make up the bulk of an issue’s feature articles, but other article topics frequently include field herping, reptile and amphibian health, conservation, and current trends in the hobby. Many contests are held for readers, as well, sponsored by a variety of reptile product manufacturers who provide prizes.
Although popular pet animals, such as bearded dragons, corn snakes, red-eared sliders, leopard geckos, crested geckos, Pac Man frogs, ball pythons, red-footed tortoises and many other common species often appear in the magazine, REPTILES also publishes articles about less commonly kept animals, such as Asian box turtles, Aldabra giant tortoises, various types of chameleons, black headed pythons, and occasionally venomous snakes and crocodilians.
REPTILES' articles are written for a broad range of reptile enthusiasts, from the novice hobbyist to the veteran herpetoculturist. Highly respected reptile experts and breeders in the industry have written, and continue to write, for the magazine. Past authors include Bob Applegate, Brian Barczyk, Dave and Tracy Barker, R.D. (Dick) Bartlett, Bob Clark, Tom Crutchfield, Linda Davison, Philippe de Vosjoli, Dante Fenolio, Jerry and Richard Fife, Ken Foose, Russ Gurley, Bert Langerwerf, Jeff Lemm, Bill and Kathy Love (Bill Love's column, "Herpetocultural Queries," has been in the magazine since the first issue), Kimberly Kay Lucas, Dr. Douglas Mader (this well-known reptile veterinarian has been writing the magazine's vet column since the first issue), Bob Mailloux, Kevin McCurley, Sean McKeown, Gerold Merker, John Murphy, Patrick Nabors, Terry Phillip, Louis Porras, Peter Pritchard, Philip Purser, Allen Repashy, Don Soderberg, Robert Sprackland, Jeremy Stone, Ron Tremper, Ernie Wagner, Rico Walder, Trooper Walsh and Romulus Whitaker.
Usually a reptile or amphibian species is featured on the cover, though Slash (musician) (February 1995) and Mark O'Shea (February 2003) were both cover subjects due to interviews they provided. A two-part interview with Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter, appeared in the October and November 1999 issues.
In March 2013, BowTie's magazine titles, including REPTILES, were purchased by I-5 Publishing, LLC. Other magazines previously published by BowTie that are now being published by I-5 include Cat Fancy, Dog Fancy and Horse Illustrated.

In the chaos that surrounded the dethronement of Michael VII, Nikephoros Basilakes, at the time doux of Dyrrhachium decided that his time had arrived. Moving into position at Thessalonica, he waited for the outcome of the clash between two other claimants to the throne, Nikephoros III and Nikephoros Bryennios, in order that he might quickly crush the exhausted victor.Finlay, pg. 58
His forces consisted of veteran Frankish, Sclavenian, Albanian and Greek soldiers,Finlay, pg. 58 and his confidence in his own abilities and courage convinced him that victory would easily be his. Nikephoros III sent his best general, Alexios Komnenos to deal with him, and Alexios managed to entrap Basilakes in a night attack on the imperial camp, on the banks of the Vardar River, some eighteen miles distant from Thessalonica.Finlay, pg. 58 Defeated, Basilakes fled to Thessalonica where he attempted to defend the city, but was seized by his own soldiers and delivered to Nikephoros III who ordered that Basilakes be blinded.

[[Patriarch Cosmas I of Constantinople]]
CATEGORIES: Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople, 11th-century Byzantine bishops, Year of birth unknown, Year of death unknown, People from Antioch

Cosmas I of Jerusalem ([tpl]lang-el|Κοσμάς Α΄ Ιεροσολυμίτης[/tpl]) was Patriarch of Constantinople from 2 August 1075 to 8 May 1081. Originally from Antioch, he was educated and resided in Jerusalem for a large part of his life, earning his geographic epithet. He may have been appointed to the patriarchate out of a monastery near or in Jerusalem.Buckler, p. 290, note 5.
He crowned the Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates. He disapproved of Nikephoros' marriage to the ex-wife of the previous Emperor Michael VII but took no further action than degrading the priest who performed the service.Hussey, p. 140. Later he used his influence to try to convince him to resign as his popularity declined and the empire entered a period of instability. 
Cosmas likewise crowned Alexios I Komnenos in 1081. When Alexios attempted to repudiate his wife Irene Doukaina to marry the ex-empress Maria of Alania, Cosmas successfully blocked the move as she had already been twice married.  Cosmas resigned or was forced out soon after, as Alexios' mother, Anna Dalassene, disliked Irene's link to the Doukas family and resented this interference.Hussey, p. 140. She further pressed for the resignation as she wished to place her favourite on the patriarchal throne, which she achieved with the appointment of the ill-educated Eustratius Garidas.Magdalino, p. 268. According to Anna Komnene, Cosmas resigned voluntarily on the condition that he be allowed to crown Irene empress first, which he did and then left.Hussey, p. 140.
The most important synodal action taken by Cosmas was the condemnation, in 1076-1077, of certain heretical views taken by John Italos, a scholar connected to the Doukas family.Hussey, p. 140.  In a more general sense, Cosmas' retirement is said to mark a period where, between Alexios I and the emperor Manuel I Komnenos, the Church was moved to a position of dependence on, identification with, and subservience to the state, reversing the greater self-determination the Church had exercised through the eleventh century.Magdalino, p. 303. The historian John Skylitzes (continuatus) speaks poorly of Cosmas, suggesting that the emperor selected him for his lack of greatness, writing that after the death of the previous patriarch, Michael VII "chose another, not from those of the senate, nor from those of the Great Church, nor any other of the Byzantines famed for word and deed, but a certain monk Cosmas sprung from the Holy City, and honoured by the Emperor... although he was without wisdom or taste...."Buckler, p. 290, note. 5.
He was proclaimed a saint by the Orthodox Church, with his feast day on 2 January (new calendar).

[[MacLennan-Hookham suspension]]
CATEGORIES: Australian academics, Queensland University of Technology

Dr Gary MacLennan and Dr John Hookham are senior lecturers at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) who were suspended for six months in 2007 after publicly criticising a PhD thesis-in-progress by film-maker and sessional lecturer Michael Noonan entitled "Laughing at the Disabled".
In April 2007 MacLennan and Hookham published an attack on the thesis in the Higher Education section of the national daily newspaper The Australianhttp://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21534652-12332,00.html. In their article ("Philistines of relativism at the gates") they said they could "no longer put up with the misanthropic and amoral trash produced under the rubric of postmodernist, post-structuralist thought", and the "last straw" was the Noonan thesis presentation. MacLennan and Hookham took offence at a film exhibited as part of the thesis, showing two intellectually disabled young men performing interviewing tasks where they became figures of fun, both for those they were interviewing and for the audience of academics and students at the screening. MacLennan and Hookham wrote: "For us, it was a moment of great shame and a burning testimony to the power of post-structuralist thought to corrupt." MacLennan angrily confronted Noonan after the screening, saying "I have a handicapped child and I pray to God that my child never comes into contact with someone like you."
QUT suspended the lecturers for six months without pay on misconduct charges following complaints from a student and an academic,http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21882944-952,00.htmlhttp://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21912810-12332,00.html a
decision which has provoked debate on various blog sites http://blogs.news.com.au/couriermail/vitalinterest/index.php/couriermail/comments/academic_suspensions_a_disgrace/P120/http://www.abc.net.au/news/opinion/items/200706/s1952125.htmhttp://bushtelegraph.wordpress.com/2007/05/08/philistines-no-longer-at-the-gates-of-queensland-university-of-technology/ QUT defended its decision, asserting that MacLennan and Hookham had breached the university's code of conduct.http://www.abc.net.au/news/opinion/items/200706/s1953217.htm Subsequently, interviews with critics and participants filmed by postgraduate student Adrian Strong were posted on YouTube http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21804473-12332,00.htmlhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEucGUEQFwA.
MacLennan and Hookham have initiated legal action against QUT, with a trial scheduled for October 2007.http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/suspended-academics-take-qut-to-court/2007/07/12/1183833645496.htmlhttp://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,22104648-12332,00.html?from=public_rss
In the interim they have had their pay reinstated.http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22062063-952,00.html. The pair have also taken their case to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which has accepted a complaint of "discrimination on the basis of political opinion"http://www.news.com.au/sundaymail/story/0,23739,22187930-3102,00.html. The legal affairs writer of "The Australian" newspaper, Bernard Lane, has suggested that the issue could turn into a "postmodern test case".http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22215137-12332,00.html
Professor Stuart Cunningham, Director of the ARC Centre for Excellence in Creative Industries, wrote a piece in defense of QUT and Noonan in the Courier Mail called 'Taking Arts into the Digital Era http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21944194-27197,00.html.
Michael Noonan posted an extended response in the Australian on 5 September 2007, entitled 'I am the one who has been humiliated' http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22363115-25192,00.html. The article counters many of the claims made by Hookham and Maclennan.
Noonan wrote, "Hookham and MacLennan have claimed that their concerns about my work were ignored by me and the internal channels within the university. This is untrue. Their outburst at my confirmation was unsettling and abusive, but I sought to address their concerns...On the night following my confirmation seminar, I emailed Hookham and MacLennan to discuss their concerns: 'I'd really appreciate talking more to you both about your thoughts about my PhD project'. I was met with condescension and rejection. MacLennan's email finished with the line: 'When you start trying to offend the rich and the powerful I might be interested in a conversation'...Hookham and MacLennan's behaviour since my confirmation has not been a spontaneous overreaction; it has been a deliberate and premeditated assault on my PhD candidacy and my career. Based on their false description of my footage, Hookham and MacLennan emailed undergraduate students, inciting them to rally against me, to condemn my work and all those associated with me. These attacks have continued to this day"

Nikephoros Melissenos ([tpl]lang-el|Νικηφόρος Μελισσηνός[/tpl], ca. 1045 – 17 November 1104), Latinized as Nicephorus Melissenus, was a Byzantine general and aristocrat. Of distinguished lineage, he served as a governor and general in the Balkans and Asia Minor in the 1060s. In the turbulent period after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, when several generals tried to seize the throne for themselves, Melissenos remained loyal to Michael VII Doukas and was exiled by his successor Nikephoros III Botaneiates. In 1080–1081, with Turkish aid, he seized control of what remained of Byzantine Asia Minor and proclaimed himself emperor against Botaneiates. After the revolt of his brother-in-law Alexios I Komnenos, however, which succeeded in taking Constantinople, he submitted to him, accepting the rank of Caesar and the governance of Thessalonica. He remained loyal to Alexios thereafter, participating in most Byzantine campaigns of the period 1081–1095 in the Balkans at the emperor's side. He died on 17 November 1104.

The dance is similar to a Sta Tria dance - but during the chorus - the men dancing begin to do squats and move around in the circle doing up to 20 squats at a time. The dance sometimes finishes off with the men breaking off from the circle and end up pushing each other to see who will "fall, as the song refers to it.

CATEGORIES: 2007 American television series debuts, 2008 American television series endings, American television talk shows, TruTV shows, 2000s American television series, English-language television programming

Star Jones is a talk show hosted by former prosecutor Star Jones. A guest-driven live broadcast (with taped segments) covering recent stories from the worlds of pop culture, entertainment, crime, and justice, it premiered on August 20, 2007 on Court TV. On January 31, 2008 TruTV announced the show would be canceled. The last episode aired on February 1, 2008.
The premiere included a discussion of the pros and cons of the CBS reality series Kid Nation and an interview with actor Isaiah Washington. Geraldo Rivera, Shaun Robinson of Access Hollywood, Dr. Marc Lamont Hill, and former CBS morning host Rene Syler were additional guests. Jones ended the program with an "open letter," a regular segment in which she addresses the audience with a closing statement a la Jerry Springer.
In his review in Variety, Brian Lowry described Jones as "utterly off-putting . . . delivering yet another reminder that Oprah Winfrey's skills aren’t easily cloned." He referred to her "scant facility for moderating but an unerring knack for uttering non sequiturs" and added, "It's possible, of course, that Jones and her team will gradually revise the formula to better suit her limitations, but at this point, what she cloyingly refers to as "the Star treatment" is, in reality, strictly a third-class affair . . . Jones appears poorly cast and will need a TV makeover to linger beyond Court's name switch to TruTV in January."
The one-hour program aired weekdays at 3:00pm ET/PT.

Archibald J. McLean (1860–1933) was a cattleman and politician from Alberta, Canada. He was one of the Big Four who help found the Calgary Stampede in 1912.
Born in southwestern Ontario in 1860, McLean moved to what is now Alberta to work as a ranch hand; soon becoming the manager of the large CY Ranch near what is now Taber, Alberta.[tpl]cite book |first=Brian|last=Brennan|title=Alberta Originals: Stories of Albertans Who Made a Difference|year=2001 |publisher= Fifth House |pages= 26–27 |isbn= 1-894004-76-0[/tpl]
Archie McLean was first elected as an Independent Liberal MLA for the Lethbridge constituency in the 1909 Alberta general election. His election to the legislature made him one of the first two independents elected in Alberta history, the other being Edward Michener.
On June 1, 1910 he accepted an appointment by Premier Arthur Lewis Sifton to cross the floor to the government and join the cabinet to become the new Provincial Secretary.  He was acclaimed in a ministerial by-election on June 22, 1910 and officially took over the position.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/law/gazettes/gek/gekb0306.jpg | title = Alberta Gazette: Notice of Ministerial Appointments | date = June 1, 1910 | publisher = Government of Alberta | accessdate = 2007-08-02[/tpl] He served as minister of municipal affairs, and as minister of public works.[tpl]cite book |first=Brian|last=Brennan|title=Alberta Originals: Stories of Albertans Who Made a Difference|year=2001 |publisher= Fifth House |pages= 27|isbn= 1-894004-76-0[/tpl]
McLean was re-elected to a second term, this time in the new Taber provincial electoral district in the 1913 Alberta general election. He defeated two other candidates in a landslide victory.
McLean would be re-elected to his third and final term in the 1917 Alberta general election. The election was hotly contested but with Conservative candidate Thomas King providing a strong showing, but McLean still won with an 800 vote plurality.
In the 1921 Alberta general election he would run again attempting to win a fourth term in office and a fifth straight election, but was defeated by candidate Lawrence Peterson from the United Farmers of Alberta in a tight race. McLean left politics to return to ranching. He lived to the age of 73. The Macleod Gazette newspaper described his memorial service as being “probably the largest funeral ever held in southern Alberta”.[tpl]cite book |first=Brian|last=Brennan|title=Alberta Originals: Stories of Albertans Who Made a Difference|year=2001 |publisher= Fifth House |pages= 28 |isbn= 1-894004-76-0[/tpl]

[[Buzz Fazio]]
CATEGORIES: American bowling players, 1908 births, 1993 deaths

Basil "Buzz" Fazio (February 7, 1908 – February 15, 1993) nicknamed the "Buzzer" was a pioneer and early American bowling star during the mid-20th century.
Known equally for his fierce competitiveness and audience pleasing theatrics, Fazio’s professional career spanned from the early 1940s to the late 1960s.
The six-time ABC (American Bowling Congress) and two-time PBA (Professional Bowlers Association) champion began his career during bowling’s golden era of "Team" play.
Born in Aultman, Ohio, near Akron, Fazio was brought to Detroit in 1947 to join the fabled Stroh’s Beer bowling team. The diminutive Fazio, who stood but 5’ 6" and weighed near 140, captained Stroh’s for nine seasons and continued the team’s tradition for success started by his predecessor and fellow Hall-of-Famer Joe Norris.
During the 1950s, the Fazio led Stroh’s Beer squad, featuring Lee Jouglard, Tom Hennessy, Pete Carter, Tony Lindeman, and Ed Lubanski, captured numerous tournaments including the BPAA Team Championships in 1952, 1953 and 1954.bowl.com - Official Web Site of the United States Bowling Congress
In 1955, at age 47, Fazio won the ABC Masters Singles Championship. Incredibly, he converted two 7-10 splits on his way to that victory.Buzz Fazio at rtbot.net http://www.rtbot.net/buzz_fazio. He nearly duplicated his Masters championship 13 years later in 1968 when, at age 60, he was runner-up to Pete Tountas. Fazio also teamed up with Stroh’s teammate Tony Lindeman to win the BPAA Doubles Championship three times (1951, 1952 and 1954).
During the 1950s, before the formation of the PBA, Fazio and his contemporaries competed on TV shows like Make that Spare, Bowling for Dollars and Championship Bowling, the latter of which was hosted by Detroit legend Fred Wolf. Among the many bowling highlights in his career, Fazio was the first to roll an 800 series on live TV (802),PBA.com - Official site of the Professional Bowlers Association and was the first-ever to roll a 300 game in the finals of the BPAA All-Star (predecessor to the U.S. Open).  He also won seven consecutive televised matches in Chicago in 1955.
In 1957, Fazio left the Stroh’s team and moved to St. Louis to become captain of the restructured  Falstaff Beer team.
During the 1958 ABC Tournament held in Syracuse, NY, Fazio attended a meeting at the Hotel Syracuse. Sixty men including Don Carter, Frank Esposito, Dick Weber, Carmen Salvino, Billy Welu, Steve Nagy, Harry Smith, Ray Bluth, Dick Hoover, and Junie McMahon attended. They were there to listen to an Akron attorney named Eddie Elias speak about starting a Professional Bowlers Association. After listening to his proposal, thirty-three of the men, including the “Buzzer” each contributed $1,650 to start the organization and the PBA was then formed.Syracuse Bowling Association
Fazio captured a pair of PBA titles, both in 1964. His win in Sacramento, California in December 1964, at the age of 56, made him at the time the oldest man to capture a PBA Tour championship.PBA Seasons at www.pba.com That record stood until 1995, when PBA star John Handegard eclipsed the mark by winning the PBA Northwest Classic at age 57 years, 139 days.
Fazio's bowling accomplishments earned him enshrinement in both the ABC and PBA Halls-of-Fame. A five-time All-American, in 1999 he was ranked #31 bowler of the 20th Century by Bowlers Journal.
After retiring from competition, Fazio continued to represent the Brunswick Corporation as he had for many years as a player. He hosted the PBA Buzz Fazio Open in Battle Creek, MI and in 1973, served as PBA President.
Though slowed by injuries related to an auto accident and subsequent surgeries, Fazio remained involved in the bowling community during retirement. He often participated in local bowling leagues and served as coach and instructor throughout the 1980s and up until his death at age 85 in 1993.

This list of tallest buildings in Philadelphia ranks skyscrapers in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by height. The tallest building in the city is currently the 57-story Comcast Center, which at 975 feet (297 meters)[tpl]cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=4894|title=Comcast Center|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=SkyscraperPage.com[/tpl] is currently the 14th-tallest building in the United States.

Six of the ten tallest buildings in Pennsylvania are in Philadelphia, with the remainder being in Pittsburgh.
Philadelphia's history of tall buildings is generally thought to begin with the 1754 addition of the steeple to Christ Church, which was one of America's first high-rise structures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emporis.info/en/wm/bu/?id=christchurch-philadelphia-pa-usa|title=Christ Church|accessdate=2007-08-17|publisher=Emporis.com[/tpl] Through most of the 20th century, a "gentlemen's agreement" prevented buildings from rising higher than the 548-ft (167-m) Philadelphia City Hall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://phillyskyline.com/bldgs/cityhall/index.htm|title=City Hall|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=PhillySkyline.com[/tpl] Despite this, Philadelphia amassed a large collection of high-rise buildings. The completion of One Liberty Place in 1987 broke the agreement, and Philadelphia has since seen the construction of eight skyscrapers that eclipse City Hall in height.
Philadelphia has twice held the tallest habitable building in North America, first with Christ Church, then with City Hall.

Sir Walter Henry Medhurst, born in Batavia in 1822, died in Torquay in 1885, was a British diplomat in China.
Being the son of the prominent British missionary Walter Henry Medhurst, the younger Medhurst was educated at Blundell's School and in Macau. There he acquired a good command of Chinese, Dutch and Malay. In October 1840, he was appointed Chinese secretary to the British superintendent of trade in China.  During the Opium War, he worked under Rear-Admiral George Elliot and Sir Henry Pottinger.
In the following years, he held a number of important consular positions in Chinese treaty ports such as Fuzhou, Shanghai (as H.M. Consul), Hangzhou and Hankou. Medhurst distinguished himself as a prominent advocate of gunboat diplomacy to defend what he considered being British interests in China. In 1868, Rutherford Alcock sent him to resolve the Yangzhou riot. He was criticized in Britain for his efforts.
Retired from consular service in 1877 and was knighted the same year. In the 1881, he took part in founding the British North Borneo Company and the following years, he organized coolie trade to Borneo on behalf of the company.

[[AS.34 Kormoran]]
CATEGORIES: Anti-ship missiles of Germany, Cold War weapons of Germany

The AS.34 Kormoran is a German-produced Anti-ship missile. The Kormoran (cormorant) uses an inertial guidance system for the midcourse phase, switching to active radar homing during the terminal attack phase. It carries a 165 kg (363 lb) delay-fused warhead, designed for 90mm of penetration prior to detonation. The maximum range is 23 km (~14 miles).
Development of the Kormoran started in 1962, being taken over by Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (now a part of EADS) in 1967. The missile was originally designed for anti-shipping roles in coastal waters, although it retains a secondary land-attack capability as well. It is currently deployed on the Panavia Tornado. 350 Kormoran 1s were produced.
The AS.34 Kormoran 2 is an improved version of the AS.34 Kormoran 1. Development was started in 1983, with first flight and firing trials taking place in early 1986. The missile features an improved warhead, all-digital electronics, improved active radar seeker, increased ECM-resistance, a stronger booster rocket, a longer range, improved automated target selection, multiple launch capability, and an increased resistance to countermeasures.
While still using the same basic airframe as Kormoran 1, the Kormoran 2 has a greater range of 35 km (21.7 miles) and a heavier 220 kg (485 lb) warhead.
Testing ended in 1987, and the missile entered service with the German Navy in 1991. Approximately 140 missiles were produced for Germany. The missile is now in service with the German Luftwaffe and Italian Air Force.

Policy of 3 was an American emocore quartet from New Jersey that existed from 1989 to 1995. They existed in the early days of the genre, and were among the many bands that helped to define its sound, blending the raw energy of punk rock with left-wing politics and the more varied tempos and introspection characteristic of emo. Their sound has often been compared to those of Moss Icon, Still Life, and Hoover.
The band's name was inspired by modern Chinese history. According to liner notes for the band's posthumous Anthology CD, the term "Policy of 3" refers to the ideas of a group of three farmers from China during the late 1930s who, through various nonviolent means, espoused increased power for peasants and independence from the wealthy landowning class.Gervasi, Bull.

The building, designed by Philadelphia-based architecture firm Agoos/Lovera, would rise near the city's Delaware River waterfront. It is being developed by Marc Stien with the support of the Ironworker's Union Local 401.  The scope of the project includes 794 high-end condominium units, a 200 to 300 room boutique hotel and an enclosed shopping plaza. There are 'green' components to the buildings, such as a rooftop garden.
If completed, Bridgman's View Tower would be much larger than other buildings in its immediate vicinity.  The Northern Liberties neighborhood is well removed physically from the core of skyscrapers that exist in Center City although the area has, over the past few years, become a popular locale for developers and several large scale projects are proposed in addition to Bridgman's View.
The project's original completion date of 2010 is now in doubt as the land for the project was recently placed up for auction.

General Jack Joseph Catton (February 5, 1920 – December 5, 1990) was a United States Air Force four-star general and was commander of the Air Force Logistics Command with headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and of the Military Airlift Command.
General Catton was born in Berkeley, California, in 1920. He attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, Santa Monica Junior College and Loyola University in Los Angeles, California.
He entered the Army Air Corps in 1940 as a flying cadet and received pilot training at Santa Maria, California, and Randolph and Kelly Fields in Texas. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps in February 1941.
Early in World War II, General Catton served as an instructor pilot at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, and Hendricks Field, Florida, and as a squadron commander at Lockbourne Field, Ohio. He flew the first B-29 bomber across the Pacific to the Mariana Islands in 1944. While serving with the XXI Bomber Command he was awarded the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters and the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster for extraordinary achievement during combat missions against Japan.
In 1946 and 1947 General Catton took part in the first two atomic weapons tests in the Pacific. During this period, he also commanded the 65th Bombardment Squadron. In June 1948 he was assigned as chief of the Policy Branch, Directorate of Plans, at Strategic Air Command headquarters, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. He moved with the command to Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, as chief of the Requirements Branch, Directorate of Plans. After a successful bout with polio, he went to March Air Force Base, California, in 1950 and served as director of operations for the 22d Bombardment Wing and later for the 12th Air Division until November 1951.
After flying combat missions against North Korea out of Japan for 90 days, General Catton went to Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, in February 1952 as deputy commander of the 92d Bombardment Wing. As commander, he later led the wing from Fairchild to Guam in the first test of B-36 aircraft capabilities in sustained oversea operations. He then went to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, to command the 43d Bombardment Wing for a year. In June 1956 he returned to SAC headquarters for a tour of duty in the Directorate of Operations.
In November 1958 General Catton was selected chief of staff for the Eighth Air Force, Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts. When he assumed command of the 817th Air Division at Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire, in July 1959, he was the youngest brigadier general in the Air Force. Two years later he took command of the 822d Air Division, Turner Air Force Base, Georgia, where he served one year prior to becoming commander of the 823d Air Division at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. In August 1963 he was named commander of the 821st Strategic Aerospace Division at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota.
In February 1964 he was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force as director of operational requirements, deputy chief of staff for programs and requirements (later reorganized as Operational Requirements and Development Plans, Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Development). During this period, he served as the Department of Defense representative and chairman of the National Committee for Clear Air Turbulence. In July 1966 he was transferred to the Office of the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs and Resources as the director of Aerospace Programs, with additional duties as chairman of the Air Staff Board. In August 1967 he became deputy chief of staff for programs and resources.
Catton took command of Fifteenth Air Force at March Air Force Base, California, in August 1968, and of the Military Airlift Command at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois the following August. In September 1972 he became the commander of the Air Force Logistics Command with headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.
He was a command pilot and qualified in the C-5 Galaxy, C-141 Starlifter, C-9 Nightingale, all bombers from the B-17 Flying Fortress through the B-52 Stratofortress, KC-97 Stratotanker and KC-135 Stratotanker, the F-4 Phantom II fighter bomber and the HH-53 helicopter. In addition he has limited experience in many of the century series fighters, and has logged nearly 14,000 flying hours.

Major General Charles Trelawny (1653 – 24 September 1731) was a British Army officer of Cornish descent, the fourth son of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 2nd Baronet.
Trelawny entered the army in 1672, receiving a commission in the Royal English Regiment of Foot, raised by the Duke of Monmouth, which served in the French Army in the Third Anglo-Dutch War. He was present at the invasion of the Dutch Republic and the Siege of Maastricht (1673), transferring as captain into the second battalion of the regiment, under Bevil Skelton, on 16 March 1674. He probably fought at Enzheim that year, and was at Altenheim the next, returning to England in 1677.
Trelawny was commissioned captain-lieutenant of the Duke of Monmouth's Regiment of Foot in 1678 and was promoted major on 1 November 1677. On 13 July 1680, he was appointed major of the Earl of Plymouth's Regiment of Foot, raised as part of the Tangier Garrison. (Trelawny's eldest brother, John, a captain, was killed at Tangier in May of that year.) He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the regiment on 27 November 1680, succeeding Percy Kirke, and succeeded Kirke as colonel on 23 April 1682. He returned to England upon the evacuation of Tangier in 1684, where part of the regiment fought at Sedgemoor the following year. Trelawny was also returned to the House of Commons that year, as Tory Member of Parliament for East Looe, a seat he retained until 1699.
One of the army conspirators against James II, Trelawny, with his lieutenant-colonel Charles Churchill, and part of his officers and men, deserted to William of Orange in November 1688 from Warminster. Dismissed by James, he was re-appointed by William on 31 December 1688 and the regiment renamed The Queen Consort's Regiment of Foot. Trelawney was promoted brigadier-general on 6 March 1689, and led a brigade in Ireland, crossing at Slanebridge to attack the Jacobite left wing at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. He served under Marlborough that September during his campaigns, and was promoted major-general on 2 December 1690. However, he resigned the command of his regiment (which went to his brother Henry) in 1692 to protest William's preferential treatment of foreign officers.
By this time, Trelawny had obtained an estate at Hengar by marriage (1 May 1690) to the heiress and widow Anne Morice (d. 1691). He was considered for appointment as colonel of the Coldstream Guards in 1694, but was thought too obnoxious to Whig sensibilities; it went instead to John Cutts. He was made Governor of Plymouth in 1696, and was returned as member for Plymouth in 1698, holding the seat until 1713. He married again on 25 June 1699, to Elizabeth Mitchell, by whom he had one daughter. Trelawny left the governorship of Plymouth in 1722 and died at Hengar on 24 September 1731.

[[RX J0852.0-4622]]
CATEGORIES: Supernova remnants, Vela (constellation), ROSAT objects

RX J0852.0-4622 (also known as G266.2−1.2) is a supernova remnant. The remnant is located in the southern sky in the constellation Vela ("sail"), and sits (in projection) inside the much larger and older Vela Supernova Remnant. For this reason, RX J0852.0-4622 is often referred to as Vela Junior.
It was found in 1998[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/24106 |title=Emission from 44Ti associated with a previously unknown Galactic supernova IGNORED edit template in Reference section[/tpl] when gamma ray emissions from the decay of 44Ti nuclei were discovered using the Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL).
The distance to this object is controversial, but some scientists argue that the supernova remnant is only 650-700 light-years away, and exploded comparatively recently (as seen from Earth), perhaps within the last 800 years. 
If the remnant is indeed young and nearby, its corresponding supernova should have been visible from the Earth in about the year 1250. One difficulty with this interpretation is that there are no contemporary written reports of any supernova at that time or in that part of the sky. 
Curiously, analysis of Antarctic ice cores suggest a supernova around the year 1070http://www.universetoday.com/26102/evidence-of-supernovae-found-in-ice-core-sample/ which was not recorded by any contemporary astronomers. This supernova, at 46 degrees south, may have been too far south for observers in the northern hemisphere to have noticed it, especially if it obtained peak brightness during the northern summer.
The central compact object (CCO) was discovered in 2001.[tpl]cite doi|10.1086/323975[/tpl] In the initial Chandra X-ray image and deeper images thereafter, no pulsations were detected from the compact remnant which is believed to be a neutron star.

[[William Bell Montgomery]]
CATEGORIES: 1829 births, 1904 deaths, Erskine College alumni

William Bell Montgomery was an American farmer, businessman, and editor of farming periodicals.[tpl]cite book|last=Bailey|first=Liberty Hyde|title=Cyclopedia of American Agriculture: Farm and community|year=1910|publisher=Macmillan|pages=597[/tpl]
He was born in Fairfield District, South Carolina on August 21, 1829, the son of Hugh and Isabella Montgomery.  When he was six years old his family and a number of their relatives and friends moved to Oktibbeha County, Mississippi near Starkville.
His father was a pioneer surveyor as well as farmer.  Both his parents' families were Associate Reformed Presbyterians, and when the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church was organized in Starkville in 1840, David Montgomery was one of the first two elders in the church.
Around 1846 Montgomery returned to South Carolina to attend Erskine College, and left that institution circa 1848.  He completed his college training at the College of New Jersey where he graduated in 1850.
After some years in agriculture in Mississippi, he became a cotton broker in Mobile, Alabama, where he lived until after the American Civil War.  Although he had been opposed to the war and took no active part in it, he was loyal to the South.
In 1865, his health forced him to return to Mississippi where his mother and many of his relatives lived, and he became a model farmer. He introduced new grasses, as well as introducing a herd of Jersey cattle from the Isle of Jersey in the English Channel, and for over three decades was an agricultural leader in Oktibbeha County and northern Mississippi.  Montgomery is credited with revolutionizing agriculture in northern Mississippi.
After a fire swept through Starkville on April 25, 1875, destroying 52 buildings, Montgomery proved to be one of the area's strongest promoters.
In 1870, he founded the Starkville Female Institute which was later taken over by the city of Starkville as the public school. In 1875, he founded the Livestock Journal as its editor, publisher, and owner. The following year he began the publication of the Southern Livestock Journal which was edited by his son, and for a time it ranked as a leading agricultural magazine in the South.  The Southern Livestock Journal later became the Southern Farm Gazette and eventually merged with the Progressive Farmer.
When the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Mississippi (now known as Mississippi State University) was established in 1878, Montgomery was a leader in securing it for Starkville, and for 26 years  he served as the local trustee for the college. Montgomery Hall on the campus of Mississippi State is named for Montgomery.[tpl]cite book|last=Kempe|first=Helen Kerr|title=The Pelican Guide to Old Homes of Mississippi: Columbus and the North|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SYlolIkYCHsC&lpg=PA43&dq=%22William%20Bell%20Montgomery%22&pg=PA43#v=onepage&q=%22William%20Bell%20Montgomery%22&f=false|page=43[/tpl]
Montgomery died September 25, 1904 in Starkville, Mississippi.
A portrait of him by Arthur L. Bairnsfather was included in the Hall of Fame in the Mississippi Capitol established in 1903.[tpl]cite book|last=Black|first=Patti Carr|title=Art in Mississippi, 1720-1980|pages=137-139|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iPfA5Ha8wf4C&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=%22William+Bell+Montgomery%22&source=bl&ots=Ffv5SDSh5L&sig=j77LKv7qsy4e5_aY0jszWmaaj-o&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BNr3UJvSHMemtAbW0oG4DQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22William%20Bell%20Montgomery%22&f=false[/tpl]

Albert Julius Aber (July 31, 1927 – May 20, 1993), nicknamed Lefty, was a left-handed Major League Baseball pitcher who played six years in the Major Leagues with the Cleveland Indians ([tpl]By|1950[/tpl], [tpl]By|1953[/tpl]), Detroit Tigers (1953-[tpl]By|1957[/tpl]), and Kansas City Athletics (1957).

He did not play another game in the big leagues until 1953, spending the 1951 and 1952 seasons in the minor leagues. He appeared in six games for the Indians in 1953, winning one and losing one, before being traded on June 15 to the Tigers with Ray Boone and Dick Weik for Art Houtteman, Owen Friend, Bill Wight, and Joe Ginsberg. Aber spent the next five years with the Tigers, where he went 22–24 in five years. His best statistical season was 1955, in which Aber appeared in 39 games and won six, lost three, and had an earned run average of 3.38. He was then waived by the Tigers, and was picked up by the Kansas City Athletics, for whom he pitched in three games, his final appearance coming on September 11, 1957.
In an interview in Sport magazine in June [tpl]By|1956[/tpl], Tigers catcher Frank House complimented Aber for his "heavy" ball: "I could catch (Billy) Hoeft with a fielder's glove. Although he's fast, he throws a 'light' ball that makes it easy on the catcher. Al Aber, another leftie sic on our staff, is tough to catch because he throws a 'heavy' ball." Aber died in 1993 at the age of 65 in Garfield Heights, Ohio.

[[FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand]]
CATEGORIES: Enzymes

FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3l) is a small molecule that acts as a growth factor that increases the number of immune cells (lymphocytes (B cells and T cells)) by activating the hematopoietic progenitors. 
It acts by binding to FLT3 aka CD135 which is found on what (in mice) are called multipotent progenitor (MPP) and common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells.
It also induces the mobilization of the hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells in vivo which may help the system to kill cancer cells. 
FLT3L is crucial for steady-state plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) and classical dendritic cell (cDC) development.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Shortman |first1=Ken |last2=Naik |first2=Shalin H. |title=Steady-state and inflammatory dendritic-cell development |journal=Nature Reviews Immunology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=19–30 |year=2006 |pmid=17170756 |doi=10.1038/nri1996[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Rahman |first1=Adeeb H. |last2=Aloman |first2=Costica |title=Dendritic cells and liver fibrosis |journal=Biochimica et biophysica acta |volume=1832 |issue=7 |pages=998–1004 |year=2013 |pmid=23313573 |doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.01.005[/tpl] A lack of FLT3L results in low levels of dendritic cells.
Flt3l in parasite clearance
Flt3l and its receptor are involved in the mammalian immune response to malaria. In strains of plasmodium, Flt3l was shown to be released from mast cells and cause the expansion of dendritic cells, leading to the activation of CD8+ T cells. The same paper suggested that Flt3L release was caused by stimulation of mast cells with uric acid, produced from a precursor secreted by the plasmodium parasite. .[tpl]cite journal |last1=Guermonprez |first1=Pierre |last2=Helft |first2=Julie |title=Inflammatory Flt3l is essential to mobilize dendritic cells and for T cell responses during Plasmodium infection |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=730-738 |year=2013 |doi=10.1038/nm.3197[/tpl]

Lobar the Wolf was the leader of a troupe of Brabançon mercenaries which had fought in numerous battles all across Europe in the latter half of the twelfth century. He is a shadowy historical figure. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, mercenary bands were commonly known by their nationality, though there were many exceptions. The Brabançons were initially the most successful of these national mercenary troops.
Lobar was active in southern France serving Raymond V of Toulouse and his allies and was consequently labelled a heretic by Catholic authorities. He succeeded William of Cambrai after the latter's death in the Battle of Malemort in 1177. On the same day as Cambrai died, Lobar and the viscount of Turenne led an assault on the town of Ségur and sacked it.

Lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF), also called lanthanum strontium cobaltite ferrite is a ceramic material of the ferrite group. It is a mixture of lanthanum(III) oxide, strontium oxide, cobalt oxide and iron oxide (cobalt iron oxide).
It is black in color and crystallizes in a skewed perovskite structure. LSCF undergoes phase transformations at various temperatures depending on the composition. This material is considered a mixed ionic electronic conductor with transference number close to 1. It can become non-stoichiometric at low oxygen partial pressures and high temperature. 
LSCF is being investigated as a material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,
LSCF is also investigated as a membrane material for separation of oxygen from air, for use in e.g. cleaner burning power plants. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070802201909.htm

[[American Episcopal Church]]
CATEGORIES: Religious organizations established in 1968, Religious organizations disestablished in 1991, Anglican denominations in North America, Continuing Anglican denominations

The American Episcopal Church (AEC) was a conservative Anglican denomination that existed in the USA between 1968 and 1991. 
Its growth was temporarily slowed by the relative success of the Continuing Anglican movement of 1977 and 1978 which culminated in the creation of its own version of an alternative to the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Following the 1976 General Convention of the Episcopal Church, one in which the ordination of women to the priesthood and a new Prayer Book were approved, traditionalist clergy and laypersons unwilling to accept the recent changes met in St. Louis, Missouri and founded the new "Anglican Church in North America (Episcopal)". That provisional name was formally changed to Anglican Catholic Church at the new church's first convention held the next year.
Those who organized the Congress of St. Louis were departing members of the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada, both of which are member provinces of the Anglican Communion headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The American Episcopal Church, which had no such recognition, was not invited to participate in the Congress. Carroll Eugene Simcox, editor of The Living Church, joined the AEC in 1982.
The AEC continued to grow, however, and for a while gained new members and parishes from the Anglican Catholic Church as new disputes afflicted the ACC. The AEC and ACC ultimately negotiated a merger in hopes of unifying the conservative Anglican cause in the United States. 
The 1991 merger took in all of the former AEC parishes but divided the Anglican Catholic Church, owing to last-minute opposition from some of the ACC's bishops. As a result, the American Episcopal Church was absorbed into the new Anglican Church in America but was joined by less than half of the ACC dioceses, with the others deciding to reject the union agreement and continue the existence of the Anglican Catholic Church.

[[Timeline of Mary Wollstonecraft]]
CATEGORIES: Literature timelines, Personal timelines, 18th-century people

The lifetime of British writer, philosopher, and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797) encompassed most of the second half of the eighteenth century, a time of great political and social upheaval throughout Europe and America: political reform movements in Britain gained strength, the American colonists successfully rebelled, and the French revolution erupted. Wollstonecraft experienced only the headiest of these days, not living to see the end of the democratic revolution when Napoleon crowned himself emperor. Although Britain was still revelling in its mid-century imperial conquests and its triumph in the Seven Years' War, it was the French revolution that defined Wollstonecraft's generation. As poet Robert Southey later wrote: "few persons but those who have lived in it can conceive or comprehend what the memory of the French Revolution was, nor what a visionary world seemed to open upon those who were just entering it. Old things seemed passing away, and nothing was dreamt of but the regeneration of the human race."Southey, Robert. The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles, ed. Edward Dowden. Norton Anthology of English Literature: Norton Topics Online. Retrieved 27 August 2007.
Part of what made reform possible in Britain in the second half of the eighteenth century was the dramatic increase in publishing; books, periodicals, and pamphlets became much more widely available than they had been just a few decades earlier.Kelly, Gary. English Fiction of the Romantic Period, 1789–1830. London: Longman (1989), 2. This increase in available printed material helped facilitate the rise of the British middle class. Reacting against what they viewed as aristocratic decadence, the new professional middle classes (made prosperous through British manufacturing and trade), offered their own ethical code: reason, meritocracy, self-reliance, religious toleration, free inquiry, free enterprise, and hard work.Kelly, 10. They set these values against what they perceived as the superstition and unreason of the poor and the prejudices, censorship, and self-indulgence of the rich. They also helped establish what has come to be called the "cult of domesticity", which solidified gender roles for men and women.Kelly, 10-11. This new vision of society rested on the writings of Scottish Enlightenment philosophers such as Adam Smith, who had developed a theory of social progress founded on sympathy and sensibility. A partial critique of the rationalist Enlightenment, these theories promoted a combination of reason and feeling that enabled women to enter the public sphere because of their keen moral sense.Kelly, 13. Wollstonecraft's writings stand at the nexus of all of these changes. Her educational works, such as her children's book Original Stories from Real Life (1788), helped inculcate middle-class values, and her two Vindications, A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), argue for the value of an educated, rational populace, specifically one that includes women. In her two novels, Mary: A Fiction and Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman, she explores the ramifications of sensibility for women.
The end of the eighteenth century was a time of great hope for progressive reformers such as Wollstonecraft. Like the revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine and others, Wollstonecraft was not content to remain on the sidelines. She sought out intellectual debate at the home of her publisher Joseph Johnson, who gathered leading thinkers and artists for weekly dinners,Todd, Janet. Mary Wollstonecraft: A Revolutionary Life. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson (2000), 152-53 and she traveled extensively, first to be a part of the French revolution and later to seek a lost treasure ship for her lover in what was then exotic Scandinavia, turning her journey into a travel book, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. After two complicated and heart-rending affairs with the artist Henry Fuseli and the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay (with whom she had an illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement.Todd, 417ff. Together, they had one daughter: Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 due to complications from this birth, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts.Todd, 452ff. Today, she is most often remembered for her political treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and is considered a foundational feminist philosopher.Kaplan, Cora.

Edward Jones Borom Red (October 30, 1915 – January 7, 2011) was a Major League Baseball player who played two seasons and won a World Series ring with the Detroit Tigers in [tpl]By|1945[/tpl].  Born in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Borom was 28 years old before he made it to the big leagues.  He only played one full season in the major leagues, and that season was spent with the 1945 World Series champion Detroit Tigers.  Borom also played professional and semi-pro baseball for over 15 years from the mid-30s into the 1950s.
Borom served in the U.S. Army briefly in 1943, but was released because of migraine headaches.  "Two days after getting home, I got a call from Jack Zeller, general manager of Detroit ... Four days after getting out of the service, I was in training camp with Detroit in Evansville, Indiana. I realized it was wartime, but there were some good players still in the majors."Edward "Red" Borom - From Semipro Ball to the Big Leagues, Jim Sargent, Baseball Almanac, February 23, 2002, retrieved October 22, 2013
In 1945, Borom played the entire season with Detroit.  Playing in place of injured second baseman Eddie Mayo, Borom batted over .300 during the September pennant drive.
Borom played in 55 games for the Tigers in 1945, batting .269 with a .307 on-base percentage.  He played in two games of the 1945 World Series. Describing his appearance in the World Series, Borom said: "I hit a ground ball up the middle, off the glove of pitcher Hank Borowy.  The shortstop, Roy Hughes, threw me out on an extremely close play. I thought I had a base hit."[tpl]sabrbio|d57881fb|Jim Sargent|October 22, 2013[/tpl] Borom also pinch-ran for catcher Bob Swift in game three.
When asked about his biggest thrill in baseball, Borom responded: "When Hank Greenberg hit the bases-loaded home run against the Browns September 1945 and we were behind 3-2 at the time. I was the runner on third, and when I saw the ball headed for the seats and knew we were in the World Series. Nothing could surpass that."
In 1946, as veteran players returned from World War II, Borom did not make Detroit's roster. Borom played several more years of minor league and semipro ball.  Borom was involved with two NBC tournament titlists – Wichita’s Boeing Bombers in 1942 as player and Sinton, Texas, in 1951 as manager.Kansas Baseball Hall of Fame Inductees, retrieved October 22, 2013 Reflecting on his career, Red observed, "I guess a career that looked like it was headed nowhere for so long turned out pretty well."
Borom was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978 and the Kansas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996.
After retiring from baseball, Borom worked 25 years for a freight company in Dallas. He died on Jan. 7, 2011, in Dallas as one of the oldest living former Major Leaguers. He attended Society for American Baseball Research meetings in the DFW area (Hall-Ruggles Chapter) for many years.

[[Our God, Our Help in Ages Past]]

CATEGORIES: Christian hymns, 18th-century Christian texts, Hymns by Isaac Watts

Our God, Our Help in Ages Past is a hymn by Isaac Watts and paraphrases Psalm 90. It originally consisted of nine stanzas. In present usage, however, the hymn is usually limited to stanzas one, two, three, five, seven and nine. In 1738, John Wesley in his hymnal, Psalms and Hymns, changed the first line of the text from "Our God" to "O God." Both Watts' wording and Wesley's rewording remain in current use.
The hymn was originally part of The Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, published by Watts in 1719. In this book he paraphrased in Christian verse the entire psalter with the exception of twelve Psalms which he felt were unsuited for Christian usage.
The hymn is often sung as part of the remembrance day service in Canada and festive occasions in England.
The hymn tune "St. Anne" (common metre 86.86) to which the text is most often sung was composed by William Croft in 1708 whilst he was the organist of the church of St Anne, Soho: hence the name of the tune. It first appeared anonymously in the Supplement to the New Version of the Psalms, 6th edition in 1708. It was originally intended to be used with a version of Psalm 62. It was not until sometime later when set to Watts' text that the tune gained recognition.
Later composers subsequently incorporated the tune in their own works. For example, George Handel used the tune in an anthem entitled, "O Praise the Lord". J. S. Bach's Fugue in E-flat major BWV 552 is often called the "St. Anne" in the English speaking world, because of the similarity of its subject to the first line of the hymn tune, though there is some debate as to whether Bach used the actual tune after hearing it, or coincidentally created himself the very similar tune used as the fugual theme.  The American composer Carl Ruggles (1876–1971) used the text in his last composition, "Exaltation" (for Brass, Chorus, and Organ) in 1958, in memory of his wife Charlotte who had died the previous year. The hymn and words are also featured in Vaughan Williams's anthem "Lord, thou hast been our refuge", using both the Book of Common Prayer's words and those of Watts.

[[List of gaited horse breeds]]

CATEGORIES: Types of horse

Gaited horses are horse breeds that have selective breeding for natural gaited tendencies, that is, the ability to perform one of the smooth-to-ride, intermediate speed, four-beat horse gaits, collectively referred to as ambling gaits.
Such breeds include the following:
In most "gaited" breeds, an ambling gait is a hereditary trait.  However, some representatives of these breeds may not always gait.  Conversely, some naturally trotting breeds not listed above may have ambling or "gaited" ability, particularly with specialized training. Many horses can both trot and amble, and some horses pace in addition to the amble, instead of trotting.  However, pacing in gaited horses is often, though not always, discouraged.  Some horses do not naturally trot or pace easily, they prefer their ambling gait for their standard intermediate speed.Breeds that Gait." Equus, issue 359, August, 2007, pp. 52-54
A 2012 DNA study of movement in Icelandic horses, harness racing horse breeds, and mice, determined that a mutation on the gene DMRT3, which controls the spinal neurological circuits related to limb movement and motion, causes a "premature 'stop codon'" in horses with lateral ambling gaits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=20594|title='Gaited' Gene Mutation and Related Motion Examined  |author=Agricultural Communications, Texas A&M University System|date=5 September 2012|work=The Horse|publisher=Blood-Horse Publications|accessdate=6 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Lisa S|author2=et al.|date=30 August 2012|title=Mutations in DMRT3 affect locomotion in horses and spinal circuit function in mice|journal=Nature|volume=488|pages=642–646|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7413/full/nature11399.html|accessdate=19 September 2012|doi=10.1038/nature11399[/tpl]  This mutation may be a dominant gene, in that even one copy of the mutated allele will produce gaitedness.

Manius Pomponius M.f. M.n. Matho (fl. 236 BC; d 211 BC) was a Roman consul and general who was elected consul for the year 233 BC with Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosses, later called Cunctator. He was also the maternal grandfather of the general and statesman Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major.
During his consulship, Matho carried on war against the Sardinians, and was granted a triumph for his victory over them. However, this victory was incomplete, because the war was carried on by his brother Marcus, who was a consul in 231 BC.
In 217 BC, he was apparently chosen magister equitum to the dictator, Lucius Veturius Philo, and was elected praetor for the following year, 216 BC. There seems no reason for believing that the Matho, praetor of this year, was a different person from the consul of 233 BC, as the Romans were now at war with Hannibal, and were therefore anxious to appoint to the great offices of the state generals who had had experience in war. The lot, however, did not give any military command to Matho, but the jurisdictio inter ewes Romanos et peregrines. After news had been received of the fatal battle of Cannae, Matho and his colleague, the praetor urbanus, summoned the senate to the curia Hostilia to deliberate on what steps were to be taken. (Liv. xxii. 33, 35, 55, xxiii. 20, 24.) At the expiration of his office, Matho received as propraetor the province of Cisalpine Gaul, in 215 BC; for Livy says (xxiv. 10), in the next year, b. c. 214, that the province of Gaul was continued to him. Livy, however, not only makes no mention of Matho's appointment in 215 BC, but expressly states (xxiii. 25) that in that year no army was sent into Gaul on account of the want of soldiers. We can only reconcile these statements by supposing that Matho was appointed to the province but did not obtain any troops that year. He died in 211 BC, at which time he was one of the pontifices.

The Battle of Xiakou was a battle fought between the warlords Sun Quan and Liu Biao in 203 in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. Sun Quan's forces attempted to conquer Jiangxia Commandery (present-day Yunmeng County, Hubei), which was defended by Liu Biao's general Huang Zu. The battle was inconclusive as Sun Quan's forces were unable to capture Jiangxia even when Huang Zu retreated. The battle is not to be confused with the Battle of Jiangxia that took place five years later, which concluded with victory for Sun Quan over Huang Zu.

The Agate Bowl ([tpl]lang-de|Achatschale[/tpl]) is a bowl cut out of a single piece of agate in the fourth century at the court of Constantine, and now displayed in the Imperial Treasury at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Austria.Leithe-Jasper 2004, p. 36. For centuries it was widely regarded as the "greatest masterpiece" and the "best and most important piece" in the collection.Kunsthistorisches Museum 1991, pp. 111–14. In 1564, Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II and his brothers declared it by deed to be an "inalienable heirloom of the house of Austria". They valued this ancient precious stone carving, not just for its craftsmanship, but for a "natural miracle" in the stone itself that reveals a mysterious inscription—the name XRISTO (Christ) at the bottom of the bowl within the grain of the stone. It is now generally believed that the inscription inspired the legend that the bowl was the Holy Grail. The Agate Bowl is the largest carved stone bowl in the world.

The Byron Shire Echo is a free weekly independent tabloid newspaper which is published in the Byron Shire, New South Wales, Australia.
The Brunswick Valley Echo, as the newspaper was first known, was founded in 1986 as a result of marijuana raids by the NSW Police in the valleys behind Mullumbimby. Despite reports that the police acted aggressively and illegally, news media refused to cover the story, so local resident Nicholas Shand founded the paper as a civil rights watchdog.Fiona Martin & Rhonda Ellis Dropping in, not out: the evolution of the alternative press in Byron Shire 1970-2001 http://www.transformationsjournal.org/journal/issue_02/pdf/MartinEllis.pdf Co-founder David Lovejoy has continued that policy since Shand’s death in 1996.David Lovejoy Between Dark and Dark: a Memoir (2005) http://www.worldcat.org/title/between-dark-and-dark-a-memoir/oclc/224469870&referer=brief_
Over the last 25 years The Echo has grown steadily and currently distributes 23,200 copies every Tuesday.Circulation Audit Bureau http://auditbureau.org.au
In 1991 Shand, Lovejoy and photographer Jeff Dawson ventured south of Byron Shire to create the Lismore Echo. This paper was subsequently sold to its employees and renamed the Northern Rivers Echo. It was purchased by Australian Provincial Newspapers in December, 2008.Northern Rivers Echo http://www.echonews.com.au/news/24480-apn-buys-echo/686190/
The Echo launched another publication, this time to the north, in August, 2008. The Tweed Shire Echo, similar in format and outlook to its sister paper, did not attract enough income and was closed early in 2012.
However, August 2011 saw the launch of an online newspaper, Echonetdaily, which is a weekday news service, edited by Chris Dobney, covering the northern rivers region. The video editor is Sharon Shostak,Echonet's video library: http://www.youtube.com/user/echonetvideo who has also directed a documentary about The Echo.The Echo Doco - Born to be Trouble http://www.sharonshostak.com/the-echo-doco.html The successful digital publication was suggested by Eric Beecher, owner of Private Media crikey.com.au, who since 2004 has been a minor shareholder in the company.

CATEGORIES: Rockabilly music groups, Musical groups from Dallas, Texas, American rhythm and blues musical groups, Musical groups established in 1959, Chess Records artists, Jamie Records artists

Tommy & The Tom Toms (later known as The Bill Smith Combo) first started with two guitars and drums, Eddie Wayne Hill on lead guitar, Leonard Walters on rhythm guitar and Joel Colbert on drums. The three fledgling  musicians from Arlington, Texas began jamming in an old barn in 1959 and evolved to playing around town for private parties. This exposure led to regular Friday night appearances at a small, local lounge. Bass guitarist David (Dave) Martin joined the group a few months later.  The owner of the Guthrey Club in Dallas heard the band and hired them for an indefinite engagement. At Guthrey’s, one of the largest rhythm and blues clubs in city, the band completed their personnel by adding Joe Donnell on sax and Tommy Brown as vocalist. The band was now complete and decided to change their name to Tommy & The Tom Toms. They soon became one of the top, and most imitated, dance bands in the DFW area and recorded numerous singles for noted Fort Worth producer Major Bill Smith.
One of their best-selling records was an instrumental version of “Heartbreak Hotel” issued by Chess Records (#1773)  http://koti.mbnet.fi/wdd/chess.htm in 1960 under the pseudonym of the Bill Smith Combo http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/s/smit1600.htm. More Tom Toms recordings were soon released, including “Raunchy”/”Loco” issued by Chess (#1780) as the Bill Smith Combo, “Ptomaine”/”Snookie” issued by LeBill (#306) as the Bill Smith Combo, "Ptomaine"/"Heartbreak Hotel" issued by Sparton Records Canada (#4-857) as the Bill Smith Combo, “Anastasia”/”Tough” issued by LeBill (#303) as the Bill Smith Combo, “Souix”/”Are You Lonesome Tonight” issued by LeCamp (#1900) as Mr. Saks & The Blue Strings, “Tomahawk”/“Kentucky Waltz” issued by Jaro International (#77023) as Tom Brown and The Tom Toms, “Tippin’ In”/”Saints” issued by Duncan (#1003) as Tommy And The Tom Toms, “That Cat”/”Tell Me” issued by K&B (#101) as Tommy Brown, “Corsicana”/”The Den” issued by Rodeo Canada (#247) as  The Tom Toms and "The Waltz You Saved For Me"/"Big Blue Diamonds" issued by Maridene (#106) as Gene Summers & Platinum Fog. During this time frame they also backed up Freddy Fender on his Argo release “A Man Can Cry” b/w “You’re Something Else For Me” (Argo No. 5375) plus several other Freddy Fender recordings including the much later Fender release of “Since I Met You Baby”.
After a successful years’ stay at Guthrey’s, the club owner, K.K. Hayles, signed the band to a personal management contract. For the next year the band backed-up numerous recording stars including Roy Orbison, Jimmy Reed, Jerry Lee Lewis, Mark Denning, Jack Scott, Big Joe Turner, Bobby Hendricks, Gene Summers, Skip & Flip, Freddy Fender, Scotty McKay http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/l/lips5000.htm, The Carlos Brothers, Chuck Berry, The Original Drifters and once staged a battle of the bands with The Champs of “Tequila” fame.  Due to the popularity of their recording of  “Heartbreak Hotel” they officially changed the band’s name to the Bill Smith Combo http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artists/s/smit1600.htm in 1960.

Remote Audio Output Protocol (RAOP) is an Internet streaming protocol based on RTSP / RTP authored by Apple Inc.  It powers the AirPlay technology built into AirPort Express wireless (802.11b/g/n) access point as well as the Apple TV.

CATEGORIES: 1965 births, Living people, British archaeologists, People from Macclesfield, Alumni of the University of Glasgow

Tony Pollard is an archaeologist specialising in the archaeology of conflict. He is Director of the Centre for Battlefield Archaeology at Glasgow University. He is the co-presenter of the BBC series Two Men in a Trench and co-founder of the Journal of Conflict Archaeology.
Tony was born in Macclesfield in the north of England in 1965, though he moved to Oban on the West coast of Scotland in the late 1970s. He studied archaeology at Glasgow University and after graduating stayed on to do a PhD on prehistoric hunter gatherers. After obtaining his PhD in 1995 he spent two years living in Brighton while working for the field archaeology unit of University College London. In 1997 he returned to Glasgow to work for Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division (GUARD). Following a first visit to South Africa in 1999 he carried out a project investigating battlefields from the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. In 2000 he co-organised, with Phil Freeman of Liverpool University, the first ever international conference on Battlefield Archaeology. He then went on to make two series of Two Men in a Trench which introduced the public to the archaeology of British battlefields.
The Centre for Battlefield Archaeology was founded in 2006 and Tony appointed its Director. Since then the Centre has gone on to offer the world's first post-graduate course in Battlefield and Conflict Archaeology. The Centre has carried out various projects which include the examination of Jacobite battlefields in Scotland (including Culloden) and most recently the investigation of British and Australian mass graves from World War I at Fromelles in France.
He has written numerous papers and articles on archaeology and military history and edited several books on subjects as diverse as the early prehistory of Scotland and the archaeology of death. Along with Neil Oliver he wrote the two books accompanying the Two Men in a Trench programmes.
In 2008 his first novel The Minutes of the Lazarus Club, a thriller based on the life of the famous engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was published by Michael Joseph. It was published in 2009 by Penguin under the title of The Secrets of the Lazarus Club.

[[Vandal Love]]
CATEGORIES: 2006 novels, Canadian novels, Novels about boxing

Vandal Love is a novel by American-Canadian author D. Y. Béchard. It was first published in 2006 by Doubleday Canada.
The novel follows generations of an unusual French-Canadian family across North America, and through the twentieth century, as they struggle to find their place in the world. A family curse – a genetic trick resulting from centuries of hardship – causes the Hervé children to be born either giants or runts.
Book I of Vandal Love follows the giants’ line, exploring Jude Hervé’s career as a boxer in Georgia and Louisiana in the 1960s, his escape from that brutal life alone with his baby daughter Isa, and her eventual decision to enter into a strange, chaste marriage with a much older man. 
Book II traces a different kind of life entirely, as the runts of the family discover that their power lies in a kind of unifying love. François searches for years for his missing father; his own son, Harvey, flees from modern society into spiritual quests. But none of the Hervés can abandon their longing for a place where they might find others like themselves.

The most important programming on an RSN consists of live broadcasts of professional and college sporting events, as those games generate an overwhelming percentage of an RSN's advertising income.  During the rest of the day, these stations show other sports and recreation programming.  These channels are often the source content for out-of-market packages.
Most regional sports networks in the United States are either affiliated with Fox Sports or NBC Sports, with supplemental programming from networks such as America One, AMGTV or ESPNEWS.

[[Greenhouse gas accounting]]
CATEGORIES: Greenhouse gas inventories

Greenhouse gas accounting describes the way to inventory and audit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A corporate or organisational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assessment quantifies the total greenhouse gases produced directly and indirectly from a business or organisation’s activities. Also known as a carbon footprint, it is a business tool that provides information with a basis for understanding and managing climate change impacts.
The drivers for corporate GHG accounting include mandatory GHG reporting in directors’ reports, investment due diligence, shareholder and stakeholder communication, staff engagement, green messaging, and tender requirements for business and government contracts.About GHG Accounting Accounting for greenhouse gas emissions is increasingly seen as a standard requirement for business. For example, in June 2012, the UK coalition government announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting,UK Mandatory Carbon Reporting requiring around 1,100 of the UK’s largest listed companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions every year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from April 2013 in his piece for The Guardian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines|title=Rio's reprise must set hard deadlines for development|publisher=The Guardian|date=2012-06-19|accessdate=2012-07-30 |archiveurl = http://liveweb.archive.org/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines |archivedate = July 30, 2012[/tpl]

[[Xu Yushi]]

CATEGORIES: Chancellors under Emperor Gaozong of Tang, 679 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Xu Yushi (許圉師) (died 679), formally Duke Jian of Ping'en (平恩簡公), was briefly a chancellor of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong.
Xu Yushi was a son of Xu Shao (許紹), a Sui Dynasty official who, after Tang was founded in 618, submitted to Tang, along with a substantial amount of territory in modern Hubei and Chongqing, and was rewarded for his ability to fend off attacks from two other rebel rulers who also claimed imperial titles -- Xiao Xi the Emperor of Liang and Wang Shichong the Emperor of Zheng and who was greatly praised by Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu for his contributions to Tang's eventual takeover of the entire realm.  (In this, Xu Shao was assisted by Xu Yushi's brother-in-law Hao Xianggui (郝相貴), whose son (Xu Yushi's nephew) Hao Chujun later also served as a chancellor.)  Xu Yushi was himself described to be capable in literature and arts, and was also said to had been a top finisher in the imperial examination, but not much is known of his early career as an imperial official.
In 659, Xu was promoted to the post of deputy head of the examination bureau of government, and was also made a chancellor de facto.Xu's biography in the Book of Tang dated this promotion as occurring in 657, but the Zizhi Tongjian, which generally had more exact dating, dated it in 659, and that date is thus used here.  Compare Book of Tang, vol. 59http://ef.cdpa.nsysu.edu.tw/ccw/02/tan07.htm, with Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 200.  Late that year, he was made acting Shizhong (侍中) -- the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor by itself.  In 662, he was formally made the head of the examination bureau (but the title, by that point, was changed to Zuoxiang (左相), as part of a major reorganization of office titles earlier that year).  At some point, for the fact that he participated in editing imperial historical records, he was created the Duke of Ping'en.
Late that year, an incident involving Xu Yushi's son Xu Ziran (許自然) would lead to Xu Yushi's removal.  Xu Ziran, who was in charge of imperial wagons, had gone out on a hunt, and during the hunt, he had damaged a farmer's crops.  When the farmer became angry, Xu Ziran fired arrows toward the farmer.  Xu Yushi caned Xu Ziran 100 times, but did not report this to the emperor.  When the farmer submitted a formal accusation, the accusation was initially put aside by the official Yang Deyi (楊德裔), but another official, Yuan Gongyu (袁公瑜), then resubmitted the accusation directly to the emperor under a pseudonym.  Emperor Gaozong, in anger, stated, "Xu Yushi is a chancellor, but when the people's lives and properties were interfered with, he did not report to me.  Is this not an abuse of power?"  Xu responded, "I serve in a key position of the government, and I serve Your Imperial Majesty with honesty and fairness, and I could not please everyone.  That is why I am being attacked.  As for abusing power, only someone who commands strong troops or is stationed at a key military post can do so.  I am but a civilian who serves the emperor, and I only know how to perfect myself behind closed doors.  How can I abuse power?"  This caused Emperor Gaozong to be angrier, and he stated, "Are you displeased that you do not command troops?"  Another chancellor, Xu Jingzong, who happened to be present, stated, "For an imperial subject to have this kind of attitude, death would be too good of a treatment for him!"  Emperor Gaozong ordered that Xu Yushi be expelled from his presence and removed from his post.
At a later point, Xu was made the prefect of Qian Prefecture (虔州, roughly modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi), and eventually the prefect of the more important Xiang Prefecture (相州, roughly modern Handan, Hebei).  It was said that Xu governed Xiang Prefecture so well that both the people and his subordinates carved stone monuments to praise him.  It was also mentioned in history that on one occasion, when one of his subordinates was revealed to have received bribes, he did not punish the subordinate, but rather sent him poems discussing honest officials.  The subordinate receiving bribes became ashamed and thereafter served honestly.  During Emperor Gaozong's Shangyuan era (674-676), he was recalled to the capital to serve as minister of census. 
After his retirement, Xu Yushi's granddaughter married the soon-to-be famous poet Li Bo and one of his descendents was the poet Xu Hun.
Xu Yushi died in 679.

Doreen Patterson Reitsma (December 12, 1927 – April 30, 2000) was the first woman from British Columbia to enter Canada's newly created Postwar Women's Division of the Royal Canadian Navy. She began her basic training on October 2, 1951, at [tpl]HMCS|Cornwallis[/tpl] in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia. She was trained as an elite radio intelligence operator for the wireless communications base at HMC NRS Coverdale. Coverdale was located near the city of Moncton, New Brunswick and was part of the Canada-USA Atlantic High Frequency Direction Finding Network responsible for the collection of military intelligence. Ms. Patterson was chosen to serve a term at the Naval Radio Station at Churchill, Manitoba in 1953-54. Here, she was part of a special force of eleven Wrens trained to live and work in extreme weather conditions. These Wrens are recognized as the only women in the Royal Canadian Navy's history to have ever served at the base in Churchill.
On January 26, 1955, Doreen Patterson helped inspire Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent and his cabinet to create a permanent and fully integrated regular force for women in the Royal Canadian Navy. This date not only marked an important milestone for women, but was considered to be an historic "first" in the British Commonwealth of Nations. It also helped open the door for thousands of Canadian women to follow in her footsteps. Ms. Patterson, in part, credited Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt with giving her the inspiration to achieve her accomplishment after a meeting with the former First Lady at the Hotel Vancouver, where Doreen had worked in the 1940s.
Doreen Patterson was born and raised in Vancouver. She attended Lord Kitchener Elementary School, Point Grey Secondary School, and Lord Byng Secondary School. She was a member of the Elgar Choir of British Columbia throughout her youth, and was a member of the Daughters of Rebekah for nearly 40 years. She was married twice, adopted two children, was a daughter of Charles Bruce Patterson and Elva Eleanore (Elliott) Patterson of Vancouver, British Columbia, and was a granddaughter of Dugald Campbell Patterson and Frances Mabel (Webb) Patterson, of Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. At retirement, Patterson Reitsma moved to Ladner, British Columbia, a suburb of Vancouver.

The International Young Publisher of the Year is a British Council award programme, which has been developed with the support of the London Book Fair. It is targeted at publishers aged 25 to 35 from emerging economies. The winner receives a free exhibition stand at the next London Book Fair and a financial award. The winner then goes on to develop a publishing project between the UK and their country.
The final of the international competition with eight to ten participants is held every year to coincide with the London Book Fair. Finalists are selected in national competitions organised locally by the British Council's overseas offices.
The finalists take part in an industry tour, which familiarises them with the dynamics of the UK publishing sector and introduces them to leading players in the industry. The finalists develop a network between themselves and with their peers in the UK sector. The finalists are also asked to select works from their country, which they then present at a book pitch to an expert jury and the general public.
All the finalists have now formed an alumni network which pioneers the importance of business networking internationally for young entrepreneurs in the publishing business.
In 2007, the award was renamed International Young Publishing Entrepreneur, as part of a rebranding which coincided with the launch of the final awards in the programme. The British Council's Young Creative Entrepreneur programme now has nine international awards: communications, design, fashion, interactive, music, performing arts, publishing, screen and visual arts.

[[Self-limiting (biology)]]
CATEGORIES: Parasitology

In biology, a self-limiting organism or colony of organisms limits its own growth by its actions. For example, a single organism may have a maximum size determined by genetics, or a colony of organisms may release waste which is ultimately toxic to the colony once it exceeds a certain population. In some cases, the self-limiting nature of a colony may be advantageous to the continued survival of the colony, such as in the case of parasites.  If their numbers became too high, they would kill the host, and thus themselves.
In medicine, the term may imply that the condition would run its course without the need of external influence, especially any medical treatment. However, the fact that a condition may be self-limiting does not mean that medical treatment would not bring the condition or its symptoms to an end more quickly, or that such medical attention would be unnecessary in the most vulnerable affected.

The ship was completed a few months before the start of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904 and was assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron sent to the Far East six months later to break the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur. The Japanese captured the port while the squadron was in transit and their destination was changed to Vladivostok. During the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905, Imperator Alexandr III was sunk by Japanese gunfire with the loss of her entire crew.

CATEGORIES: Pyrrhura, Birds of Brazil, Birds of the Caatinga, Endemic fauna of Brazil, Animals described in 1900

The Grey-breasted Parakeet (Pyrrhura griseipectus) is a species of parrot in the family Psittacidae. It is endemic to Ceará in north-eastern Brazil and restricted to a few mountains with relatively humid forest and woodland in a region otherwise dominated by arid Caatinga.
Until recently, it was considered a subspecies of the White-eared Parakeet, as Pyrrhura leucotis griseipectus. The split was based on their widely disjunct distributions, differences in measurement of bill, and subtle differences in colour of crown, ear-coverts and chest. A recent study based on mtDNA has failed to confirm the status of the Grey-breasted Parakeet as a species distinct from the White-eared Parakeet, while confirming the species status of Pfrimer's Parakeet.
This parrot is classified as Critically Endangered by BirdLife International. It has an extremely small population and occupies a very small known range. The population is estimated to be less than 250 adult birds.

The Pernambuco Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium mooreorum) is a species of owl in the Strigidae family. This recently described species is endemic to Pernambuco in Brazil. It has been argued that it actually should be referred to as G. minutissimum (a name typically used for the East Brazilian Pygmy Owl), but this has not gained widespread recognition.South American Classification Committee (2008). Change the name of Least Pygmy-Owl to Glaucidium sicki. Accessed 21-11-2008.
This owl is classified as critically endangered by BirdLife International. It is assumed to have a tiny and declining population within an extremely small known range. The population is estimated at less than fifty adult birds. 
The Pernambuco Pygmy Owl was first described in December 2002 when two study skins were examined in Pernambuco, Brazil. The skins were originally collected in 1980 and thought to be subspecies of the Least Pygmy Owl Glaucidium minutissimum or Amazonian Pygmy Owl Glaucidium hardyi. Upon closer examination of the skins, and vocalisations of the birds also obtained in 1980, it was concluded that this was a new species

The film is about three Aboriginal Australians, Botj (Sean Mununggurr), Lorrpu (John Sebastian) and Milika (Nathan Daniels), that trek through Australia's Top End after Botj, recently released from prison, commits arson and vandalism while high from sniffing petrol. The three flee from the police who threaten to send Botj back to jail, and head to Darwin by coast. However, soon after their arrival, they are discovered by the police, sleeping in a hotel room. Botj leaves before the other two wake, and has been breathing petrol fumes for their hallucinogenic effects, which leads him to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. His body is discovered by Lorrpu and Milika later that day.  Lorrpu and Milika return to their original home and their old lives. For Lorrpu, the journey has been a rite of passage, and his aboriginal tribe, the Yolngu have accepted him. The film has many social issues like the problems of youth sniffing petrol.

Zirkus Rosarius (also known as the Wanderzirkus Rosarius) was an Erprobungskommando-style special test unit of the Luftwaffe, specifically of the Luftwaffe High Command, tasked with testing captured British and American aircraft, all of which were repainted in German markings. 
The purpose of testing allied aircraft was to discover any strengths or vulnerabilities in their design or performance. This information was highly useful in enabling German service personnel to develop tactics designed to counter strengths and exploit any vulnerabilities.
The unit was formed by Theodor Rosarius in 1943 and was part of the 2./Versuchsverband Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe. The Zirkus also toured operational airfields showing Luftwaffe pilots the captured aircraft and training them in techniques to counter these aircraft. The Zirkus Rosarius seemed to have merited the use of its own Geschwaderkennung ("Geschwader code") of "T9", with a few of the unit's aircraft coming from KG 200, which already used the "A3" identification code of that wing.

Richard Harris studied composition and orchestration at the University of Edinburgh, where his tutors included Kenneth Leighton. At Edinburgh he co-founded the contemporary classical ensemble Piano Circus, with whom he was a member until 2002, commissioning and performing works by Arvo Pärt, Brian Eno, Philip Glass and Steve Reich. The ensemble was signed to Decca/Argo, producing five CDs. Compositions by Harris feature on the Argo CD Loopholes, and in full on the ensemble's own CD Landscapes Of The Heart; he also produced successful arrangements of works by Terry Riley and Thomas Ades. His work Hexada was featured in the UK television programme The Score.
In 1992 Harris began teaching piano, theory and A-level music at Westminster School, where he himself had been a pupil.
In 1994 Harris became a published author with Faber Music, and in 1997 was chosen by the film composer Carl Davis to be his personal music arranger. Harris's books range from his own compositions and educational tutors to film, jazz and pop arrangements, and include collaborations with Evelyn Glennie and Joanna MacGregor.
In 1999 Harris's arrangement of Terry Riley's Keyboard Study No.2 was chosen by Pete Townshend as the supporting music for Townshend's Lifehouse concert at Sadler's Wells.
In 2000, Piano Circus collaborated with the German composer Heiner Goebbels, and the resulting piece Scutigeras, entirely written by Harris and based on Goebbels' existing works, received a live premiere on BBC radio.
In 2004, Harris composed the music to Warriors, a successful show at the London Planetarium.
In 2005, Harris created a website allowing users to request personalised sheet music, in the form of bespoke arrangements and transcriptions. The site has featured in many newspapers and magazines, including The Daily Telegraph and Classical Music Magazine.
In 2009, Harris composed a big band piece for the Cardinal Vaughan Big Band entitled 'Addison Blues', which gave its world premiere performance at St. John's, Smith Square Concert Hall, for a concert in aid of the British Heart Foundation.

The appearances of former Australian cricketer Don Bradman in popular culture are many and varied. As a player, he first came to prominence during the 1928-29 season.  His record-breaking performances on the 1930 tour of England made him a national hero in Australia. 
Ironically, Bradman was a private person who did not enjoy the adulation associated with his fame. In cricket, a batsman who enjoys an exceptional run of form over an extended period is sometimes called Bradmanesque.The Times of IndiaYorkshire PostPakistan News Service 
Bradman's name has become a generic term for outstanding excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world.  The mathematician, G. H. Hardy, an avid cricket fan, once declared the German mathematician David Hilbert "the Don Bradman of mathematics".

CATEGORIES: 1948 births, Living people, American diplomats, Ambassadors of the United States to Qatar, Ambassadors of the United States to Lebanon

Mark Gregory Hambley (born February 12, 1948, in Boise, Idaho) is an American diplomat.
A veteran of more than 30 years in the U.S. diplomatic service, Ambassador Mark Hambley served in eleven postings in nine Middle Eastern countries, including as U.S. Ambassador in Qatar and, later, in Lebanon and as the U.S. Consul General in both Alexandria, Egypt, and in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Recently information has come to light regarding Ambassador Hambley's remarkable role in the siege of Mecca.http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119007965327330717.html
Ambassador Hambley's service in multilateral diplomacy included his designation as the Special Representative to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, as the U.S. Representative to the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests, and as the Special Negotiator on Climate Change during the Clinton and early months of the current Bush administration.
Following the September 11 attacks, Ambassador Hambley served as the Political Advisor to the commander of the U.S. Air Force deployment in the Middle East during the conflict against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan throughout the fall of that year. He was then appointed as director of the Media Outreach Center in London in March 2003. This is a specialized unit established under the authority of the U.S. Congress in early 2003. The goal of this center is to improve dialog with the pan-Arab media and to monitor the programming and coverage of various pan-Arab newspapers and satellite television.
Ambassador Hambley left full-time service with the government of the United States of America in 2005. He still undertakes special commissions on an ad hoc basis for his government.
In early 2005 Ambassador Hambley became a senior trustee of the Next Century Foundation. In this capacity he has undertaken two missions to date, one to Red Zone Baghdad to facilitate negotiations with Abdul Aziz al Hakim, the other to Jerusalem during the Summer War, during which he discussed matters relating to the Syrian track. He also hold the position of Senior Managing Director for International Matters at Apollo Security, a Massachusetts-based security, investigative, and consulting service company.

[[Overcapitalisation]]
CATEGORIES: Economic problems

Overcapitalisation refers to an economic phenomenon whereby the valuation/ price of an asset is superior to its ‘real’ value – however difficult to define - therefore putting a strain on attempts to obtain a reasonable return on investment. This is especially the case when capital goods are at stake which are necessary to engage in the production of goods or delivery of services (e.g. agricultural holdings, industrial plants, etc.). It is less the case with those contemporary financial instruments that are valued not for their returns, but for their potential earnings upon resale. 
Overcapitalisation is closely related (in causes and consequences) to assets inflation. As the financialisation of the economy has led to the monetisation (also called ‘securitisation’) of many non-financial assets, such as real estate, infrastructures, etc., overcapitalisation has become rife, with deleterious consequences at the level of firms (struggling to achieve an unrealisticly high level of profitability), households (struggling to pay their inflated mortgage), and individuals (whose equity holding, and hence borrowing and repayment potential, may be vastly over-valued).

The 1985 Castrol 500 was an endurance race for "Group A" Touring Cars staged at the Sandown International Motor Racing Circuit in Victoria on 15 September 1985. Race distance was 129 laps of the 3.878 km (1.928 mi) circuit, totaling 500.262 km.
The field was divided into three classes according to engine displacement. 
The event was Round 3 of both the 1985 Australian Endurance Championship and the 1985 Australian Manufacturers' Championship. There were 36 starters, of whom 18 were classified as finishers.
The race was won by the JPS Team BMW 635 CSi of Australian Touring Car Champion Jim Richards, and his co-driver Tony Longhurst. It was Longhurst's first major win in Australian touring car racing. JPS Team BMW made it a 1-2 finish when their second car, driven by Neville Crichton and on-loan Nissan team driver George Fury finished only a few seconds behind. Finishing in third place was the surprising Toyota Supra of Peter Williamson and 1985 Formula Ford Driver to Europe champion Tomas Mezera.
The 1985 Castrol 500 was the first time since 1972 that neither Peter Brock or Allan Moffat had won the Sandown enduro. 1984 Castrol 500 winner Brock, who claimed pole position with a time of 1:52.3 in his Mobil Holden Dealer Team VK Commodore, suffered engine failure after 41 laps, while Moffat, who was without a drive in 1985 due to Mazda not racing in Group A, was part of the ABC television commentary team.
Before his retirement, Brock set the fastest lap of the race with a 1:53.7.

Howard, as well as that of the Conan earlier depicted in the various Conan comic book series by Marvel Comics. The TV character is based on the version in the 1980s films, but there is no continuity between the films and TV series.

[[Ashdown's medium]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiological media

Ashdown's medium is a selective culture medium for the isolation and characterisation of Burkholderia pseudomallei (the bacterium that causes melioidosis).
Ashdown's medium was first described by LR Ashdown in 1979.
It is used for the selective isolation of B. pseudomallei from clinical specimens taken from non-sterile sites (e.g., sputum) as well as to produce the characteristic morphology of B. pseudomallei.
The medium contains crystal violet and gentamicin as selective agents to suppress the growth of other bacteria.  Colonies of B. pseudomallei also take up neutral red which is present in the medium, and this further helps to distinguish it from other bacteria.  Gentamicin slightly inhibits the growth of B. pseudomallei and so specimens inoculated onto Ashdown's agar needs to be incubated for a minimum of 96 hours instead of 48 hours.  The medium is also enriched with 4% glycerol, which is required by some strains of B. pseudomallei to grow.  B. pseudomallei usually produces flat wrinkled purple colonies on Ashdown's agar.
Ashdown's medium has the advantage of being extremely cheap to produce: the cost of each plate is only US$0.04.

Richard Baron (born 1958) is a philosopher living in London. He was educated at Aylesbury Grammar School and at Selwyn College, Cambridge.
His first book, Projects and Values, argues for a foundationalist virtue ethic, against the background of a structured approach to the cultural relativity of value-concepts and a conception of the human subject that is inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein.
His second book, Deliberation and Reason, analyses our processes of deliberation. He argues that we have to see ourselves as enjoying a freedom that is incompatible with determinism, in order to support our self-conception as self-directed subjects. He then argues that we can see ourselves as having that kind of freedom if we overlook the causal closure of the physical, and that this vision of ourselves can sit alongside the scientific account of ourselves.
He has published articles in Philosophy Now (February 2006 and May 2012) and in Ethical Record (July 2005, May 2006, March 2011 and October 2013).
He has also had a career as an adviser on tax policy, both for the British Government and for the Institute of Directors.

Conan the Adventurer is an American-French-Canadian animated television series adaptation of Conan the Barbarian, the literary character created by Robert E. Howard in the 1930s. Produced by Jetlag Productions and Sunbow Productions, the series debuted on September 12, 1992, ran for 65 episodes and concluded on November 22, 1993. The series was developed by Christy Marx who served as the sole story editor. The episode "A Needle in a Haystack",http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1YS7aRbwik written by Jean Chalopin, is considered a lost episode, as it was never released on the complete DVD set for Australia which only included 64 episodes. " A Needle in a Haystack" was the show's 33rd episode when it originally aired. It is unclear why this episode was left out of the collectionhttp://conancompletist.forumactif.com/t1775-conan-the-adventurer-animated-series or why this episode is not even listed in most online sources at this time.http://www.canistream.it/tv/series/79716/conan-the-adventurer
The series was produced in association with Graz Entertainment for the first 13-episode season; AB Productions and Jean Chalopin's Créativité et Développement for the remaining episodes. The series also spawned a small toyline in 1992 created by Hasbro. This first incarnation of Conan in cartoon form performed much better than its follow-up cartoon, Conan and the Young Warriors, which lasted only 13 episodes.

Vice-Admiral Sir Joshua Rowley (1734–1790) was the fourth son of Admiral Sir William Rowley. Sir Joshua was from an ancient English family, originating in Staffordshire (England) and was born on 1 May 1734 in Dublin  Rowley served with distinction in a number of battles throughout his career and was highly praised by his contemporaries. Unfortunately whilst his career was often active he did not have the opportunity to command any significant engagements and always followed rather than led. His achievements have therefore been eclipsed by his contemporaries such as Keppel, Hawke, Howe and Rodney. Rowley however remains one of the stalwart commanders of the wooden walls that kept Britain safe for so long.

The site guarded a crossing-point of the River Ribble. The first known Roman activity was the building of a timber fort, believed to have been constructed during the campaigns of Petillius Cerialis around AD 72/3. This was replaced by a stone fort in the 2nd century.[tpl]cite book|last=Shotter|first=D.|title=Romans and Britons in north-west England|year=2004|publisher=University of Lancaster|location=Lancaster[/tpl] For most of its existence the fort was garrisoned by Sarmatian auxiliaries, first stationed in Britain by Marcus Aurelius in 175. Prior to that it is suggested that the fort was garrisoned by the Ala II Asturum from Spain, but there is some uncertainty about this. Pottery evidence indicates that the fort was occupied for most of the 4th century until the end of the Roman period.

Eight Songs for a Mad King is a monodrama by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies with a libretto by Randolph Stow, based on words of George III.  The work was written for the South-African actor Roy Hart and the composer's ensemble the Pierrot Players, and premiered on 22 April 1969. Lasting half an hour, it is scored for a baritone, with an extraordinary command of extended techniques covering more than five octaves, and six players:
The songs derive from tunes played by an extant mechanical organ owned by George III, tunes that he attempted to train bullfinches to sing: 
The action unfolds as a soliloquy by the king, the players being placed on stage (ideally) in large birdcages, and climaxes in his snatching and smashing the violin. 
The score is published by Boosey & Hawkes, and its cover shows a famous excerpt in which the staves are arranged like the bars of a birdcage.Cover of the score
Besides Hart, exponents of this work have included William Pearson, Michael Rippon, Thomas Meglioranza and Julius Eastman.  The Swedish baritone Olle Persson performed the work in Stockholm in the 1990s.  The British baritone Richard Suart has performed the piece in Gelsenkirchen‚ Milan‚ Helsinki‚ Strasbourg‚ Stavanger and Paris; in 1987 The Musical Times described Suart's take as "compelling from start to finish".The Musical Times, Vol. 128, No. 1736 (October 1987), p. 577 Welsh baritone Kelvin Thomas sang the role at Munich's Kammerspiele Schauspielhaus in 2011, and in a production by Music Theatre Wales in 2013.

CATEGORIES: 1877 births, 1921 deaths, English cricketers, Leicestershire cricketers, People from Rothley

Charles Agar (May 20, 1877 – November 10, 1921) was an English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Leicestershire. He was born in Rothley and died in Southfields, Leicester.
Agar made his debut during the 1898 County Championship season, making a highly credible debut innings of 26 before being bowled out by Foster Cunliffe. Thanks in part to this performance he was kept within the team and played on a regular basis throughout the 1898 season, scoring his best bowling figures of 4-80 during his debut season, though he scored a pair in the final match against Warwickshire.
Though Leicestershire finished joint-bottom of the County Championship table, faith was kept in Agar for the following season, though he would maintain his position in the lower order, playing more games during 1899 than in any other season. He also found himself bowling more during this season than any other, and taking his best season average of just over 40. Leicestershire started the season badly and ended in joint thirteenth place in the table.
1900 was Agar's final season in the side, in which he would make it up from the tailend into the position of a more credible lower-order batsman, finishing not out on a couple of occasions from around seventh in the batting order. In Agar's final game, a draw against Surrey, he scored just three runs, while being very expensive with the ball, with figures in the first innings of 0-105.

[[Autobus (cycling)]]
CATEGORIES: Road bicycle racing terminology

The autobus or the gruppetto is in bicycling terminology the name given to the group of cyclists in a road cycling race who form a large group behind the leading peloton.
The autobus forms on mountain stages when non-climbers fall off the back of the peloton during the climb. Gradually some riders fall off the back of the peloton and form a large group at the end of the race. These riders are generally sprinters or domestiques unconcerned about their finishing positions in the mountain stages. Their primary concern is beating the elimination time to ensure their survival in a multi-stage race such as the Tour de France.
If the autobus arrives outside the elimination time, the organisers may extend the elimination time if the autobus is larger than 20% of the riders. However if a rider is dropped from the autobus in this situation they will almost certainly be eliminated unless they have suffered an accident, in which case they may be exempted. The elimination time varies depending on the organisers; in the Tour de France there are differing coefficients depending on the difficulty of the stage. These coefficients are a percentage of the stage winner's time.Haake, Bjorn "Latest Cycling News for July 24, 2007" cyclingnews.com 24 July 2007. Retrieved 21 February 2010
Due to the common interest in survival, the mood in the autobus has a greater sense of camaraderie than in the main peloton. Riders often assist one another with food and drinks despite riding for separate teams. It is sometimes referred to as "the laughing group".

Sir Harry Philip Parnell Lane CBE MVO KPM (c.1870–24 April 1927), known as Philip Lane, was a British police officer who served as Chief Constable of Lancashire County Constabulary from April 1912 until his death in 1927.
Lane came from a military family. His father was a Major in the Royal Marine Light Infantry, his grandfather was an Army Captain, and his great-grandfather was a Royal Navy officer. All had at some point served as prison governors. Lane was also intended for the Army, but instead joined the Essex County Constabulary as a Constable in 1887, a very unusual career move for a gentleman at the time. He served as a clerk in the Chief Constable's office. In 1896 he transferred to the Devon County Constabulary as a Superintendent. He served as Deputy Chief Constable of Kent County Constabulary from 1900 to 1902, Assistant Head Constable of Liverpool City Police from 1902 to 1909, and Assistant Chief Constable of Lancashire from 1909 to 1912.
Lane was appointed Member of the Royal Victorian Order 4th Class (MVO) in 1913 for organising royal visits to Lancashire, Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1918 civilian war honours for policing the many munitions factories in the county during the First World War, and knighted in the 1925 New Year Honours. He was awarded the King's Police Medal (KPM) in the 1921 New Year Honours.
He was one of the first Chief Constables in the country to introduce motorcycle combination patrols and wireless communications. He was also one of the few county constabulary Chief Constables before the latter half of the 20th century to be a career policeman and not a military officer or lawyer.
Lane was taken ill suddenly after organising the policing of the 1927 Grand National, having only recently got over influenza. He was moved to a nursing home in Malvern, but died shortly afterwards.

Black Dog Halt was opened on 3 November 1863 by the Great Western Railway for Lord Lansdowne of Bowood House. Lord Lansdowne had a special compartment in one of the Calne line's autocoaches. Later he was persuaded to allow the halt to be used by the public.  After the British Rail takeover the halt was turned into a request stop.
In 1965 the halt was closed and soon the buildings were demolished. Today the site of the halt is being used as part of the national cycle route.

[[Scleromyositis]]
CATEGORIES: Autoimmune diseases, Rheumatology

Scleromyositis or the PM/Scl overlap syndrome is a complex autoimmune disease (a disease in which the immune system attacks the body). Patients with scleromyositis have symptoms of both systemic scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis, and is therefore considered an overlap syndrome. Although it is a rare disease, it is one of the more common overlap syndromes seen in scleroderma patients, together with MCTD and Antisynthetase syndrome. Autoantibodies often found in these patients are the anti-PM/Scl (anti-exosome) antibodies. 
The symptoms that are seen most often are typical symptoms of the individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, myositis and scleroderma. Treatment of these patients is therefore strongly dependent on the exact symptoms with which a patient reports to a physician and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs.

Calne railway station was opened on 3 November 1863 by the Great Western Railway as a terminus for the branch line from the Great Western mainline (with a junction at Chippenham).  It was situated a short distance from Calne town centre and was equipped with only one platform. The station, when first opened, had its own engine shed. 
In the early years of the station's history, the seven sidings were usually full due to the amount of traffic coming in from the nearby Chippenham railway station. Calne was the terminus of the 5 mi line from [tpl]stnlnk|Chippenham[/tpl]. 
The station was always for public use all the way from its beginning until its closure in 1965, as part of the nationwide Beeching Axe, as it was one of the least profitable lines in the entire country.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] It closed and the buildings were left to be vandalised but were eventually taken down. A few years later, the area was built on to become Station Road Industrial Estate and as of 2014 a small housing development is being built on the site.

[[Overlap syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Autoimmune diseases, Rheumatology, Syndromes

An overlap syndrome is an autoimmune disease of connective tissue in which a patient presents with symptoms of two or more diseases.
Examples of overlap syndromes include mixed connective tissue disease and scleromyositis. Diagnosis depends from which diseases the patient shows symptoms and has positive antibodies for in their lab serology.
In overlap syndrome, features of the following diseases are found (most common listed):

The treatment of overlap syndrome is mainly based on the use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Biologic drugs, i.e. anti-TNFα or anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, have been recently introduced as alternative treatments in refractory cases. There are some concerns with the use of anti-TNF agents in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases due to the risk of triggering disease exacerbations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Iaccarino|title=Overlap connective tissue disease syndromes.|journal=Autoimmune Rev|date=Jun 2012|pmid=22743033|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/|doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2012.06.004|volume=12|issue=3|pages=363–73[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: City, Economic development, Economic geography, Economics terminology, Organizational theory, Sustainable urban planning, Urban studies and planning, Urban studies and planning terminology, Public policy

Urban performance currently depends not only on the city's endowment of hard infrastructure ('physical capital'), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure ('intellectual capital and social capital').
The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. It is against this background that the concept of the smart city has been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and to highlight the growing importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), social and environmental capital in profiling the competitiveness of cities.[tpl]cite journal|author=Caragliu, A|coauthors=Del Bo, C. & Nijkamp, P|year=2009|title=Smart cities in Europe|journal=Serie Research Memoranda 0048|publisher=VU University Amsterdam, Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Econometrics|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/dgr/vuarem/2009-48.html[/tpl]
The significance of these two assets - social and environmental capital - itself goes a long way to distinguish smart cities from their more technology-laden counterparts, drawing a clear line between them and what goes under the name of either digital or intelligent cities.
Smart(er) cities have also been used as a marketing concept by companies and by cities.

CATEGORIES: Monitor classes, Canonicus-class monitors, Spanish–American War monitors of the United States

The ''Canonicus''-class monitor was a class of nine monitors built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War. They saw service in the Civil War and the Spanish-American War, although two of them were never commissioned.
They were basically improved Passaics, modified in accordance with war experience. The four ships not commissioned during the war were built on the Ohio river, three at Cincinnati and Manayunk as far up as South Pittsburgh.
The hull lines were improved and designed speed is given as 13  knots but there was no hope of getting near this. The 5 × 1 in side armour was backed by two iron stringers 6½ in deep and 6 in thick for 70 ft from the bows, but 4 in elsewhere, and the armour lower edge was 3 × 1 in. The turret, of 21 ft internal diameter, had 10 × 1 in plates as did the pilot house above, and the funnel base was also armoured. The turret skirt was protected by a 5 in thick and 15 in high ring fixed to the deck, and as in other later monitors the 15 in guns were longer than in the Passaic class and fired with their muzzles outside the turret.
Tecumseh was sunk in Mobile Bay by a mine that exploded under her turret, and went down in 25–30 seconds. Canonicus, the last survivor, was finally decommissioned 31 years before being sold.

The Battle of Deres was a fight between the Spartans and the Messenians, which occurred c. 640 BC, it was the first major military engagement of the Second Messenian War. The Spartans and Messenians didn't have any allies at the time of conflict and the outcome of the battle was highly disputed. After the battle, the Messenians offered Aristomenes the crown of Messenia. Aristomenes declined the offer, preferring instead to become general with absolute powers .In the first year after the revolt the Messenians engaged the Lacedaemonians at a place called Derae in Messenia, both sides being without their allies. Neither side won a clear victory, but Aristomenes is said to have achieved more than it seemed that one man could, so that, as he was of the race of the Aepytidae, they were for making him king after the battle. As he declined, they appointed him general with absolute power.
This battle did not take place at the Lakonian Dereion, but one would expect Derai to mean a 'small hill'. the place-name Dera occurs in a fragmentary late second century Messenian inscrption, which appears to have been a definition of the Messenian borders with Arkadia, otherwise, nothing else is known about this place.

The blend was infamous for its awful taste, but Austrians in their teens at that time are likely to have had an "Austria 3" as their first cigarette.  was a conglomerate of three Austrian quite individualist singer-songwriters Wolfgang Ambros, Georg Danzer and Rainhard Fendrich. 
The group was initiated by Fendrich in order to give one single charity concert in favour of homeless in 1997 (which collected more than ATS 2 million, almost USD 200,000). Their success as a group was overwhelming, and the three individualists showed up on stage as Austria3 from that day on, until they decided to stop that project, which they announced on 10 June 2006. Their last concert was given at Altusried, Germany, on 26 July 2006.

The sixth government of Israel ([tpl]lang-he-n|מֶמְשֶׁלֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל הַשִׁישִׁית[/tpl], translit. Memshelet Yisra'el HaShishit)  was formed by Moshe Sharett during the second Knesset on 29 June 1955. Sharett dropped the General Zionists and the Progressive Party from his coalition, which included Mapai, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Progress and Work and Agriculture and Development.
The only changes to the cabinet from the previous government were the dropping of General Zionist ministers Yosef Serlin, Israel Rokach and Yosef Sapir; instead of appointing new ministers to the cabinet to replace them, Sharett divided their portfolios out between existing ministers. Although his party departed from the coalition, Progressive Party MK Pinchas Rosen remained Minister of Justice. 
With the exception of Deputy Minister Kalman Kahana who resigned on 15 August, the government remained in place until 3 November 1955, more than three months after the July 1955 elections.

[[RNase PH]]
CATEGORIES: Ribonucleases, EC 2.7.7

RNase PH is a 3'-5' exoribonuclease and nucleotidyltransferase, present in archaea and bacteria, that is involved in tRNA processing. Contrary to hydrolytic enzymes, it is a phosphorolytic enzyme, meaning that it uses inorganic phosphate as a cofactor to cleave nucleotide-nucleotide bonds, releasing diphosphate nucleotides. The active structure of the proteins is actually a homohexameric complex, consisting of three ribonuclease (RNase) PH dimers. RNase PH has homologues in many other organisms, which are referred to as RNase PH-like proteins. The part of another larger protein with a domain that is very similar to RNase PH is called an RNase PH domain (RPD).

Established in 1979, Machalilla National Park near Puerto Lopéz rests along the Pacific coast. It incorporates beaches, fog forest, dry forest, small islands and two larger islands, Salango and Isla de la Plata, the latter named for a legendary hoard of silver left by Sir Francis Drake.Smith, Julian. Machalilla National Park and Vicinity. May 1998. Accessed August 2, 2007. 
In 1990 the park was named an internationally important wetland under the Ramsar Convention. Wildlife includes armadillos, two species of monkeys and birds of more than 270 species.Dry Tropical Forests of Ecuador. Accessed August 2, 2007 Many of the large mammals in Machalilla National Park are regionally and locally endangered. Machalilla National Park is the only habitat outside of the Galapagos Islands of waved albatross. The ocean regions of the park also provide a breeding ground for humpback whales. Vegetation includes opuntia cactus, palo santo trees, kapok trees and the algaroba tree. Most of the tropical scrub desert and forest of western Ecuador, once 25% but now only 1%, can be found in the park.
Machalilla National Park has been threatened by a number of factors, including deforestation, commercial fishing, poaching and the ecological impact of the tourist industry. In 1991, The Nature Conservancy, the United States Agency for International Development and a group of partner organizations across Latin America and the Caribbean began contributing funds for conservation as part of the Parks in Peril (PiP) program. Machalilla National Park opened an on-site center for educating visitors about the ecology of the park and conservation issues. The park also hired locals to serve as guards, increasing local awareness of the issues impacting the park.

Kunstnernes Hus (Norwegian for "Artists' House") is an art gallery in Oslo, Norway. It is Norway's largest gallery under the direction of artists, and has served as a major center for exhibits of Norwegian and international contemporary art. It is also a prominent example of Functionalist architecture and houses the Office for Contemporary Art Norway. The building is situated in Wergelandsveien 17, across the Royal palace park
After having raised funds and interest for several years, Bildende Kunstneres Styre (now Norwegian Visual Artists Association) acquired the site for its headquarters in 1927 and opened an architectural contest in 1928. Several important specifications were imposed on entries, among them natural light from the ceiling, limited building height, and a facade that blended with the surrounding architecture. Its architecture is noted as an important milestone in the transition from the legacy of 19th century Neoclassical architecture to 20th century Functionalism.
Over 60 proposals were submitted, and the winning proposal, named Felix, by Gudolf Blakstad and Herman Munthe-Kaas was simplified before construction began in 1929. The building opened on October 1, 1930 as an independent foundation with public support. In 1931 it won the Houen Prize for excellent architecture.
It was renovated in 2000/2001 at a cost of about NOK 20 million to improve the galleries, the general structural and aesthetic integrity, and bring safety infrastructure to modern standards.
Kunstnernes Hus is governed by a five-member board, of whom four are elected by the Norwegian Visual Artists Association, and one from the Ministry of Culture.
In addition to numerous shows throughout the year, it is one of two sites for the annual art show Høstutstillingen and also the annual fellowship application exhibit. Several pieces are on permanent display, including the bronze lion sculptures at the entrance by Ørnulf Bast, a relief by Niels Larsen Stevns, and pieces by Per Krogh and Lars Backer.
There are galleries on two floors. There is also an eating establishment on the ground floor.

Whooping Crane Summer Range is a 16,895 km² wetland complex in the boreal forests of northern Alberta and southwestern Northwest Territories in Canada. It is the only natural nesting habitat for the endangered whooping crane. On May 24, 1982 it was designated a Ramsar wetland of international importance,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/world_heritage.htm|title=Ramsar and World Heritage Sites|publisher=Ramsar Convention Secretariat|accessdate=2007-08-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070713033117/http://www.ramsar.org/world_heritage.htm  |archivedate = 2007-07-13[/tpl] one of two such sites in Wood Buffalo National Park (the other is Peace-Athabasca Delta). It is owned by the Government of Canada, and is administered by Parks Canada with some input from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. Encompassing the northeastern portion of Wood Buffalo National Park, approximately 2,300 km² (14%) of the wetland is external to the park, on Crown land in the Northwest Territories.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/woodbuff.html|title=Protected Areas and World Heritage - Wood Buffalo National Park|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=2007-08-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070705053141/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/woodbuff.html  |archivedate = 2007-07-05[/tpl] It is also classified an Important Bird Area.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bsc-eoc.org/iba/site.jsp?siteID=NT002|title=Whooping Crane Nesting Area and Summer Range|publisher=Important Bird Areas of Canada|accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl]
The range is a complex of contiguous water bodies, primarily lakes and various wetlands, such as marshes and bogs, but also includes streams and ponds. In addition to the whooping crane nesting area, the range includes two sites classified during the International Biological Program.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.mb.ec.gc.ca/nature/whp/ramsar/df02s07.en.html|title=Whooping Crane Summer Range, Alberta/Northwest Territories - Ramsar Site|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl]
Because the area developed through wildfires, "no natural forest fires in the area are extinguished unless they threaten structural facilities or...leave the boundaries of Wood Buffalo National Park".
A whooping crane census in 1941 counted only 15 migratory birds. There are currently 178 migratory birds which winter and breed in coastal Texas, primarily in the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Annual population surveys are conducted by the Canadian Wildlife Service. A few breeding pairs of the nationally endangered Peregrine Falcon also nest in the range. Due to the significant threat of extinction of whooping cranes, access to nesting sites is strictly controlled, limited only to researchers and park staff, and low-flying aircraft is prohibited in the area.

Henry H. Wells Middle School is a middle school located in Brewster, NY, Putnam County, approximately fifty miles north of New York City.  The Henry H. Wells Middle School was the second school building known to the Brewster Central School District.  Opening in 1957, it was known as Brewster High School.  At that time, it housed grades 6 - 12.  Garden Street School served as the lone elementary building in the district for grades K - 5.  Over time, as the district continued to grow, the "new" Brewster High School could not keep up with the needs of the school community.  In 1972, when Brewster High School was opened on Foggintown Road, the existing high school was rededicated as the Henry H. Wells Middle School - a school designed to work with the unique characteristics of the middle school child, grades 6 - 8.  As the Brewster community continued to grow and prosper, the Middle School was called upon to assist by taking the fifth graders into their midst.  From September 1990 - January 1998, the Middle School served grades 5 - 8.  With the opening of C.V. Starr Intermediate School in January 1998, the building went back to grades 6 - 8.

[[Viking runestones]]

CATEGORIES: Runestones in Uppland, Runestones in Östergötland, Runestones in Södermanland, Runestones in memory of Viking warriors

The Viking Runestones are runestones that mention Scandinavians who participated in Viking expeditions. This article treats the runestone that refer to people who took part in voyages abroad, in western Europe, and stones that mention men who were Viking warriors and/or died while travelling in the West. However, it is likely that all of them do not mention men who took part in pillaging. The inscriptions were all engraved in Old Norse with the Younger Futhark.
The largest group consists of 30 stones that mention England, and they are treated separately in the article England Runestones. The runestones that talk of voyages to eastern Europe, the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East are treated separately in the article Varangian Runestones and its subarticles.
The most notable of the Viking runestones is the Kjula Runestone and it contains a poem in Old Norse in the metre fornyrðislag that refers to the extensive warfare of a man called "Spear":The poem for Sö 106 at Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages.
Below follows a presentation of the runestones based on the Rundata project. The transcriptions into Old Norse are in the Swedish and Danish dialect to facilitate comparison with the inscriptions, while the English translation provided by Rundata gives the names in the de facto standard dialect (the Icelandic and Norwegian dialect):

Karl Herxheimer (June 26, 1861 - December 6, 1942) was a German-Jewish dermatologist who was a native of Wiesbaden. 
In 1885 he received his doctorate at Würzburg, and later worked with his brother, Salomon Herxheimer (1841-1899) in Frankfurt-am-Main. In 1894 he became director of the dermatology clinic in Frankfurt, and with Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915), was instrumental in founding the University of Frankfurt. In 1914 he became professor for skin and venereal diseases at the new university. In late 1942, at the age of 81, Karl Herxheimer was taken to the Theresienstadt concentration camp where he died.
Herxheimer is credited with providing an early description of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (diffuse idiopathic cutaneous atrophy), which is a dermatological disorder associated the latter stages of Lyme disease. This condition is sometimes referred to as Pick-Herxheimer disease, named along with co-discoverer Philipp Josef Pick (1834-1910). With Austrian dermatologist Adolf Jarisch (1850-1902), the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is named, which is an inflammatory reaction to Salvarsan, antibiotics or mercury, when using these agents to treat syphilis.

A cross-in-square or crossed-dome plan was the dominant architectural form of middle- and late-period Byzantine churches, featuring a square centre with an internal structure shaped like a cross, topped by a dome.
The first cross-in-square churches were probably built in the late 8th century, and the form has remained in use throughout the Orthodox world until the present day. In the West, Donato Bramante's first design (1506) for St. Peter's Basilica was a centrally-planned cross-in-square under a dome and four subsidiary domes.
In German, such a church is a [tpl]lang|de|Kreuzkuppelkirche[/tpl], or ‘cross-dome church’. In French, it is an [tpl]lang|fr|église à croix inscrite[/tpl], ‘church with an inscribed cross’.

Normally the term refers to the mainland communities around the bay and excludes Galveston as well as most of Houston.
Originally part of the pirate kingdom of Jean Lafitte, this area played a role in the early history of Texas having been the site of some early rebellions against Mexican rule and the site of the victory of the Texas army over the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution. Ranching interests became early economic drivers around the bay. As the nearby cities of Galveston and Houston developed as commercial centers, the Bay Area communities became part of a principal commercial corridor between the cities.
The Bay Area is also the location of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center which houses the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center.  The City of Houston's official nickname as "Space City" is derived from this.  In addition, a large tourist attraction for area visitors is Space Center Houston.
The landscape around the bay features a mix of swamps, beaches, industrial facilities, tourist attractions, and historic sites. The area's developing population is ethnically diverse with a growing international community. The communities host cultural events ranging from ballet and musical theater to fairs and rodeos. The bay itself supports a commercial fishing industry and features one of the highest concentrations of marinas in the nation. On land the area holds numerous historic sites such as the San Jacinto Monument, and many parks and nature preserves such as the Armand Bayou Nature Center.

[[Historic desertification]]
CATEGORIES: Desertification, Deserts

The Mediterranean and its transition zones to the deserts are characterized by impressive Roman and Byzantine ruins, which are subject of discussion how these magnificent cities could be deserted. It was assumed that population growth or conquest by nomadic tribes led to over-exploitation of the land, leading to soil erosion and irreversible degradation. Reduced soil and vegetation cover led to reduced precipitation and advancing deserts. [ref] 
</ref>
However, failure of development aid projects raised doubts about the validity of the historic desertification issue. For example, a project aiming to reduce sedimentation and erosion at the King-Talal-dam close to Jerash in Jordan could not achieve its goals, which became clear when a heavy rainstorm led to massive sedimentation into the dam despite the newly constructed soil conservation devices. As well, the expected positive effects of the reforestation could not be observed. On the contrary, a high fire risk emerged since pine trees are easily flammable, and the grazing pressure was moved towards more sensitive areas in the desert belt. The evergreen trees also reduced groundwater recharge. [ref] 
 </ref>
A number of running research projects in Jordan found that the erosion of the main agricultural soil, the Terra Rossa, took place at the end of the last Ice Age and during the Younger Dryas. It seems therefore that erosion of the today intensively used soils was limited during historical periods, and not connected with desertification. [ref]
 </ref>
The discussion about the impact of climate change on desertification focuses on drought. While some authors argue that periods of decline in the Levant were synchronous with reduced rainfall, others point to the non-linear development of settlement. However, a focus on [annual precipitation allows only for limited conclusions about the productivity of agriculture. In this context, soils and colluvia point to an increased frequency of extreme rainfall events in the Levant at the end of the Byzantine period. As far as such events could be observed today, their associated damage was always enormous and could have had much more serious consequences than drought. The decline of settlement in the desert belt at the end of antiquity could be connected with an increase of extreme events. [ref]

CATEGORIES: Ribonucleases, EC 3.1.13

RNase D is one of the seven exoribonucleases identified in E. coli. It is a 3'-5' exoribonuclease which has been shown to be involved in the 3' processing of various stable RNA molecules. It is known to add the 3' CCA sequence to tRNA in prokaryotic tRNA processing.  RNase D has homologues in many other organisms. When a part of another larger protein has a domain that is very similar to RNase D, this is called an RNase D domain.

[[Deva Soye]]
CATEGORIES: Calendars

Deva Soye is an Indian calendar period during which the beginning of auspicious works are prohibited. According to Indian philosophy during this period all the gods (Deva) are sleeping (Soye) and so they can not bless the beginning of any work. This period generally starts at the end of July and ends by the 3rd week of November. There is a way out for the people who don't strictly follow Deva Soye. According to another belief during 'Navratri', a festival of Durga, for 9 days doors of the heaven are open and so even if the gods are sleeping all the pending works can be completed. Navratri is traditionally an auspicious time for starting new ventures. 'Deva Soye' is a largely followed philosophy in the north India and considered a taboo by the intelligentsia.

[[Thermowell]]

CATEGORIES: Temperature

Thermowells are tubular fittings used to protect temperature sensors installed in industrial processes. A thermowell consists of a tube closed at one end and mounted in the process stream. A temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the tube, which is usually in the open air outside the process piping or vessel and any thermal insulation. The process fluid transfers heat to the thermowell wall, which in turn transfer heat to the sensor. Since more mass is present, the sensor's response to process temperature changes is delayed. If the sensor fails, it can be easily replaced without draining the vessel or piping. To be representative of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel.H. M. Hashemian (ed), Sensor Performance and Reliability, ISA 2005 ISBN 1-55617-897-2, page 16 
A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a .260" bore matching a .250" sensor).  A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or flanged process connection. The temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.
Thermodynamically, the process fluid transfers heat to the thermowell wall, which in turn transfer heat to the sensor. Since more mass is present with a sensor-well assembly than with a probe directly immersed into the process, the sensor's response to process temperature change is slowed by the addition of the well. Since the mass of the thermowell must be heated to the process temperature, and since the walls of the thermowell conduct heat out of the process, sensor accuracy and responsiveness is negatively impacted by the addition of a thermowell.[tpl]cite book|last=Thomas W. Kerlin & Mitchell P. Johnson|title=Practical Thermocouple Thermometry (2nd Ed.)|year=2012|publisher=ISA|location=Research Triangle Park|isbn=978-1-937560-27-0|pages=79–85|url=http://www.isa.org/Template.cfm?Section=Books3&Template=/Ecommerce/ProductDisplay.cfm&ProductID=12178[/tpl]

Hashemian (ed), Sensor Performance and Reliability, ISA 2005 ISBN 1-55617-897-2,   page 16  A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (apx. 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element.  So, for a grounded thermocouple spring loaded into a thermowell with a 1 inch diameter shank and a tip thickness of .25" a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1" OD x 5 + .25" well tip thickness +.25" sensor wall thickness = 5.5").J.V.

 Designed for infants and toddlers (1 to 36 months), Baby Bach is a nicely produced video that features recognizable, familiar toys and colorful objects, moving to the complexly beautiful music of Johann Sebastian Bach. According to the video producers, "Bach's music has shown to enhance creativity, improve academic achievement, reduce anxiety and heighten mental awareness." Any parent will embrace this theory. Not only did this video completely captivate a 22-month-old for its entire 30-minute run-time, but it's easy on the parents, too. The images are lively, clean, and sharp, and producers The Baby Einstein Company have a firm handle on what interests babies and toddlers. The extraneous segments with two pretty little blonde girls is silly, but forgivable. Given that most children elect to watch a video repeatedly, this is one that parents won't mind in the slightest. The music, available on CD, is simply lovely. --N.F. Mendoza 
Product Description
BABY BACH(TM) is a whimsical, playful music video that will delight and fascinate your child. It introduces little ears to the expressive complex music of J.S. Bach in a baby-friendly way. Music therapy research has shown that listening to classical music can produce positive effects on health and well-being. Lovely images of toys, kinetic art, and real-world objects also offer parents the opportunity to teach words and concepts, while the stimulating music and silly sound effects are certain to captivate and engage infants and toddlers

Renewable energy can be divided into generation of renewable electricity and the generation of renewable heat.
From the mid-1990s renewable energy began to contribute to the electricity generated in the United Kingdom, adding to a small hydroelectricity generating capacity. The total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 11.3% of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom in 2012,[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewable-sources-of-energy-chapter-6-digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes|title=Department of Energy and Climate Change: Annual tables: ‘Digest of UK energy statistics’ (DUKES) - Chapter 6: Renewable Sources of energy|accessdate=1 September 2013[/tpl] reaching 41.3 TWh of electricity generated. Renewable energy contributions to meeting the UK's 15% target reduction in energy consumption by 2020, in accordance with the 2009 EU Renewable Directive, was 3.94% in 2012 as measured in accordance with the methodology set out in the Directive
Interest in renewable energy in the UK has increased in recent years due to new UK and EU targets for reductions in carbon emissions and the promotion of renewable electricity power generation through commercial incentives such as the Renewable Obligation Certificate scheme (ROCs) and Feed in tariffs (FITs) and the promotion of renewable heat through the Renewable Heat Incentive. Historically hydroelectric schemes were the largest producers of renewable electricity in the UK, but these have now been surpassed by wind power schemes, for which the UK has large potential resources.

[[Caisa (instrument)]]
CATEGORIES: Pitched percussion

The caisa is a musical instrument made of steel and wood. The steel section resembles the top of a steelpan and the wooden base section resembles a horn-like stand. The steel and wood are held together with a stretchy rope material; there is no direct contact between the steel and the wood. Sound is emitted from the gap between the steel and the wood and not from the horn at the base. The tone areas are hammered by hand and are usually in a pentatonic scale comprising ten to twelve notes. The central note is much deeper.
The latest version of the caisa consists solely of metal.
The instrument can be played either on the lap with the horn held between the legs or can be stood on its wooden base. The caisa is played with the hands in manner similar to that of the Hang, but it sounds more like a meditation pan. From the side, the instrument resembles a mushroom.
The caisa is made in Germany by Bill Brown.

Distant Journey ([tpl]lang-cs|Daleká cesta[/tpl]) is a Czech Holocaust film directed by Alfréd Radok and released in March 1949, immediately after World War II. Radok uses experimental cinematography, blending historic footage of the Nazis with a fictional love story between a Jewish woman and her Gentile husband. 
Soon after the film's release, Stalinist censorship was implemented in Czechoslovakia. Radok fled to Sweden and Czech filmmakers began their long struggle against strict communist censors. Film production declined, and Distant Journey was banned from audiences only to reemerge over forty years later.

[[Culture change]]

CATEGORIES: Culture, Policy

Culture change is a term used in public policy making that emphasises the influence of cultural capital on individual and community behavior. It places stress on the social and cultural capital determinants of decision making and the manner in which these interact with other factors like the availability of information or the financial incentives facing individuals to drive behavior.
These cultural capital influences include the role of parenting, families and close associates; organisations such as schools and workplaces; communities and neighbourhoods; and wider social influences such as the media. It is argued that this cultural capital manifests into specific values, attitudes or social norms which in turn guide the behavioural intentions that individuals adopt in regard to particular decisions or courses of action. These behavioural intentions interact with other factors driving behaviour such as financial incentives, regulation and legislation, or levels of information, to drive actual behaviour and ultimately feed back into underlying cultural capital.
The term is used by Knott et al. of the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit in the publication: Achieving Culture Change: A Policy Frameworkhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100125070726/http://cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/achieving_culture_change.pdf (Knott et al., 2008). The paper sets out how public policy can achieve social and cultural change through 'downstream' interventions including fiscal incentives, legislation, regulation and information provision and also 'upstream' interventions such as parenting, peer and mentoring programmes, or development of social and community networks.
The key concepts the paper is based on include:
Knott et al. use examples from a range of policy areas to demonstrate how the culture change framework can be applied to policymaking. For example:

Alfred Street Baptist Church was founded in 1818 in Alexandria, Virginia, USA and located in the city’s oldest African American neighborhood, the Bottoms.  Three members of the First Baptist Church, Jesse Henderson and two others, bought some land on Alfred Street and built the church. In 1820, it started a Sabbath School for educating all ages.  Alfred Street Baptist Church had a white minister until 1863, when it called its first black minister, Rev. Samuel Madden.  Later, in the 1920s, Rev. Andrew Adkins of the church created the first high school curriculum for black students in the area. For decades the church has served as a place of education.
Architectural improvements were implemented in the 1880s and in 1994, when a new sanctuary was built. The exterior of the building was preserved, but the interior was greatly improved. Alfred Street Baptist Church is located at 313 South Alfred Street in Alexandria, Virginia. Virginia African Heritage Program

[[Ravenstone (band)]]

Ravenstone is an American rock band formed in Athens, Georgia in 1971 by Butch Blasingame (lead guitar, vocals), Dwight Brown, (bass, acoustic guitar, vocals), Michael A. Simpson, (vocals, harmonica, percussion, air raid siren), Ralph Towler (guitar, mandolin, keyboards, vocals) and Bill Wilson (drums, saxophone, clarinet, vocals). A popular group in the southeastern United States during the early 70s, the band is considered one of the godfathers of the internationally acclaimed Athens rock scene. 
Blasingame, Simpson, and Wilson (the only Athens native) created the group after meeting in a University of Georgia (UGA) drama class.[tpl]cite news | last =Lamb| first =Gordon| title =Have You Been Ravenstoned| work =Flagpole Magazine| date =2005-08-24[/tpl] The band’s name is a literary reference to a field where witches are executed in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust, a play the three were studying at the time. Blasingame recruited Brown and Towler, two university students from his hometown of Monroe, Georgia, with whom he had previously performed with in the group Edifice Wrecks. 
From the beginning, the band’s original music was credited to all five members, listing them in alphabetic order. Although Simpson is the group's lyricist, all members provide input in songwriting. The band’s early music was muscular and lyrically intense, combining prototype punk elements with roots rock, British invasion and soul influences. Their sound was characterized by Blasingame’s blistering guitar style, the tight rhythm section of Brown and Towler anchored on the jazz inflections of Wilson’s drumming, and Simpson’s distinctive baritone, falsetto flourishes and topical lyrics. Simpson used a World War II-era air raid siren as an instrument during concerts.'''  
During the band’s early period, Ravenstone's concerts and club performances were notable for the band’s wit, stage antics and political activism as much as their music. Known to their fans as the Ravesters, the group’s mix of humor and politics was illustrated in an early band photograph that featured Brown in a bow tie and a gas mask, Wilson dressed in a military uniform hanging on a granite cross, and Simpson wearing a tee shirt printed with the logo of a well-known comic book superhero. 
The group is noted for its support of social issues, which predated and foreshadowed the activism of later Athens music groups such as R.E.M. In March 1972 Ravenstone played at a gay rights dance, reportedly the first ever openly held in the southeast United States, in the Memorial Ballroom on the UGA campus.[tpl]cite news | author=Roger| title =Now That I Can Dance| work =The Great Speckled Bird| date =1972-03-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last =Fulton| first =Fran| title =Courts Lets Gays Dance| work =The Red and Black| date =1972-03-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web| last =Klyza| first =John| title =Interview With Michael Simpson (Ravenstone - 2002)| work =SleepawayCampfilms.com| url =http://www.sleepawaycampfilms.com/inter_simpson3.htm| accessdate =2007-09-11[/tpl] A court injunction was required for the campus concert to occur after the university refused to allow it on grounds that it would be “aiding and abetting” sodomy – a felony under Georgia law at the time that carried a penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment. The Ku Klux Klan reportedly harassed the band after their performance.

Despite objections from administration officials, a full-page photograph of Simpson wearing the tee, angled as to not fully reveal the last initial, was subsequently printed in the university’s 1973 student yearbook.[tpl]cite web| last =Burel| first =Charles| title =Present at the Creation: Ravenstone & the Birth of Athens Rock| work =AthensMusic.net| date =2005-08-21| url =http://athensmusic.net/newsdesk_info.php?newsdesk_id=103| format=excerpt| accessdate =2007-09-11[/tpl] An article written about the group in an Atlanta counterculture underground newspaper noted the band’s blend of politics and original music. 
At an outdoor voter registration rally near the UGA administration building in May 1972, they were threatened with arrest after the band performed "Off A Pig", which advocated veganism, not violence against the police. (Police were widely known as "pigs" in American slang at the time.) The band responded to the police threat by playing louder. Plainclothes policemen were stationed outside of the university president's office, reportedly out of concern that the band’s confrontational attitude and politically charged music would incite the several hundred students attending the show to riot.[tpl]cite news | last =Shields| first =Mitchell| title =Students Rally, Register To Vote |work =The Red and Black| date =1972-05-05[/tpl]
In the spring of 1972, Ravenstone began recording More Love, their first album, at Atlanta's Web IV Studios. After several tracks were completed the band broke up. A version of the album's title track was subsequently included as a bonus feature for the DVD release of the cult horror film Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers, which Simpson directed in 1987. The track was also on the band's EP release in 2003. Other songs from the Web IV recording sessions have not been released to date. 
After the departure of Wilson, Towler and Brown from the group, Blasingame and Simpson continued to perform and tour regionally as Ravenstone with other musicians including drummer Randy Delay, whose later work included the Georgia Satellites' "Keep Your Hands To Yourself,” and bassist Greg Veale, who subsequently became a founding member of the Athens group Normaltown Flyers. Ravenstone disbanded entirely in 1974.

Beulah Baptist Church (Alexandria, Virginia) was established in 1863 in an African American neighborhood ("the Bottoms") in Alexandria, Virginia, USA.  Rev. Clem Robinson, graduate of Ashmun Institute (now Lincoln University) and supported by the American Baptist Free Mission Society worked with his wife, Rev. George Washington Parker, and Miss Amanda Borden to establish "The First Select Colored School," as  a school for African- Americans at the site in 1862, which preceded later Freedman Bureau schools in town.   The church was founded the next year.  In the first year, 715 students attended classes there. Robinson also taught upper level students at the church in the "Beulah Normal and Theological Institute," which had over 80 students in a few years, and which preceded similar schools in the South, like Howard Normal and Theological Institute (1867, later Howard University) and the Hampton Institute (1868).M.

ramm.x (RDFa-deployed Multimedia Metadata) is an initiative to deploy multimedia metadata on the Semantic Web using RDFa.
Many multimedia metadata formats (as ID3, Exif, MPEG-7, etc.) are available to describe, on various levels, what a multimedia asset is about, who has produced it and so on. With the dissemination of User Generated Content, a need for deploying these metadata in (conventional) HTML pages found in blogs, wikis and so forth arises. To enable the deployment of multimedia metadata on the web, one valid approach is to use the RDF data model for a generic deployment (description) of an arbitrary multimedia metadata format. The step of RDFizing is called 'formalisation'. To actually deliver the metadata along with the content being served, a new W3C Semantic Web standard, RDFa,is utilised together with a light-weight vocabulary. This allows a Semantic Web agent to determine the formalisation steps in order to, for example perform a validation, or carry out inference.

[[Middle Powers Initiative]]
CATEGORIES: International security

The Middle Powers Initiative (MPI), a program of the Global Security Institute, is dedicated to the worldwide reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons, in a series of well-defined stages accompanied by increasing verification and control.
Through MPI, eight international non-governmental organizations are able to work primarily with "middle power" governments to encourage and educate the nuclear weapons states to take immediate practical steps that reduce nuclear dangers, and commence negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons.
Middle power countries are politically and economically significant, internationally respected countries that have renounced the nuclear arms race, a standing that gives them significant political credibility.
The campaign is guided by an International Steering Committee, chaired by Senator Douglas Roche, O.C., former Canadian Disarmament Ambassador.
Currently, the efforts of the Middle Powers Initiative are focused through the Article VI Forum, a new and creative initiative intended to stimulate and shape effective responses to the crisis of the non-proliferation / disarmament regime manifested by the breakdown of the 2005 NPT Review Conference. The Article VI Forum takes its name from the article of the NPT in which the nuclear states commit themselves to the elimination of their nuclear weapons.
The Forum is conducting high-level meetings with key diplomats and leaders to examine the political, legal, and technical elements required for a nuclear weapons-free world.
The Forum will continue its work of advancing the imperative to uphold the core bargain of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty relating to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and ensuring steady progress toward their global elimination.

Bruin's Slave Jail is a two-story brick building in Alexandria, Virginia, United States from which slave trader Joseph Bruin imprisoned slaves.  Bruin's company, called Bruin and Hill, transported blacks to slave markets in the Southern United States.  
At the start of the American Civil War, Joseph Bruin was captured himself and imprisoned in Washington, D.C.  His property, including the slave jail, was confiscated by the U.S. Marshall and used as the Fairfax County Courthouse until 1865.
All that remains today of the entire compound is a brick, two-storey structure that housed the slaves.  Bruin’s home, kitchen, and wash-house no longer remain.  The jail can be found at 1707 Duke Street in Alexandria.

Carlyle House is a historic mansion in Alexandria, Virginia, United States, built by Scottish merchant John Carlyle in 1751-53.  It is situated in the city’s Old Town on North Fairfax Street between Cameron and King Streets.
When the lots for the new town of Alexandria were auctioned in July 1749, Carlyle purchased lots 41 and 42, situated between the Potomac River and the town's market square, ideal for his merchant business.  He began construction of a house in 1751, using indentured and slave labor.  The home was built in mid-Georgian Palladian style with space for entertaining and private family and servant use. He also built a number of outbuildings for both household and business needs. Carlyle and his wife, Sarah née Fairfax, moved into the house on 1 August 1753, the day Sarah gave birth to Carlyle's first son, William.  Carlyle is supposed to have sealed a cat within the house's walls, an old Scottish tradition to bring luck.
In 1755, the house was the initial headquarters for Major-General Edward Braddock in the Colony of Virginia during the French and Indian War. The Congress of Alexandria convened in the dining room of the house and here Braddock decided to make an expedition to Fort Duquesne which would result in his death. He was urged not to undertake the expedition by native Virginian George Washington who was then a volunteer aide-de-camp to Braddock. Braddock first suggested the idea of levying additional new taxes on the colonists to help with the cost of the war at the house.
Carlyle was a slaveholder.  Carlyle’s slaves lived and worked in his Alexandria home, on three plantations and in a foundry located on the same lot as the house.  When he died, there were nine slaves living at Carlyle House: Moses, Nanny, Jerry, Joe, Cate, Sibreia, Cook, Charles, and Penny.
Following Carlyle's death in 1780, his son George William Carlyle inherited the house.  However, he died one year after his father at the Battle of Eutaw Springs in South Carolina. The son of John Carlyle's eldest daughter Sarah Carlyle Herbert, John Carlyle Herbert, inherited the Carlyle House in 1781.  The house passed from the family's possession by 1827 when Sarah Carlyle Herbert died and John Carlyle Herbert sold it to pay off an uncle's gambling debt. He himself had moved to Maryland in the first decade of the 19th century.
In the mid-19th century, the Mansion House Hotel, which became called one of the best hotels on the East Coast, was built along Fairfax Street making Carlyle House no longer visible from the street.  The hotel and the house were seized by occupying Union forces during the American Civil War.
Significant restoration work to the house was undertaken in the early and mid 1970s and the hotel (also known as the Braddock Hotel) was torn down once again exposing Carlyle House to North Fairfax Street.
Since 1970, the Carlyle House Historic Park is owned and administered by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and includes the 18th century mansion and its gardens. On the National Register of Historic Places, it is architecturally unique as the only stone, 18th-century Palladian-style house in Alexandria.  The "Grandest Congress" is a reenactment celebrating Gen. Braddock's time at the house that takes place every year at the Carlyle House.

[[Simcha of Rome]]

CATEGORIES: 13th-century rabbis, People from Rome, Italian rabbis

Simcha of Rome was a Jewish scholar and rabbi who lived in Rome in the last quarter of the 13th century . He was given an open letter by the community and sent out to find Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah and bring it back with him. He traveled through Provence and Catalonia without meeting with any success. At Barcelona, he applied for assistance to Solomon ben Adret, who gave him a further letter of recommendation.  After a prolonged search, he found in Huesca the commentary on the first three orders, and shortly afterward the Arabic original of the commentary on the first five orders. The latter was thereupon translated into Hebrew by several scholars between 1296 and 1298, and Simcha returned with it to Rome, after having encountered various dangers on his journey.  He appears to have written some books also, although,with the exception of certain fragments in Shibbole ha-Lekhet, nothing written by him has been preserved.

[[Conflict epidemiology]]
CATEGORIES: Epidemiology, War casualties, War-related deaths

The emerging field of conflict epidemiology offers a more accurate method to measure deaths caused during violent conflicts or wars that can generate more reliable numbers than before to guide decision-makers.
In February 2001 the Carter Center and the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), in collaboration with CARE (relief), Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sponsored a meeting on "Violence and Health". The goals of the meeting were to determine the impact of violent conflict on public health and to advise public health training programs on means to enhance the work of public health professionals in working in violent conflicts.
Compiling or estimating the numbers of deaths caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a controversial subject.  Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed during historic conflicts.  What conflict epidemiology offers is a better methodology to more accurately estimate actual mortality rates during existing wars and conflict.

Tranby (Peninsula Farm) is an historic farmers cottage located on Johnson Road, in Maylands, Western Australia overlooking the Swan River, and is one of the oldest surviving buildings from the early settlement of the Swan River Colony.National Trust of Australia (WA) - Tranby Heritage Information. Accessed 3 August 2007   It is described as an English cottage-style farmhouse with loft bedrooms and wide verandahs and is associated with a group of devout Wesleyan Methodists, led by Joseph Hardey and other members of his family who arrived in Western Australia on the ship Tranby in February 1830.Heritage Council of Western Australia - Interim listing. Accessed 3 August 2007[tpl]cite AHD|10399|Tranby House, 2 Johnson Rd, Maylands, WA, Australia|accessdate=3 August 2007[/tpl]
The Tranby was a 26 metre long, 8 metre wide ship which left from the city of Hull in Yorkshire, England on 9 September 1829 and was captained by a John Story.'Tranby House in Maylands'. Accessed 3 August 2007  37 passengers and fourteen crew were on board as well as various livestock, farm equipment and building materials.
Joseph Hardey was a Wesleyan preacher from Lincolnshire.  He arrived with his wife Ann, his brother John and a large group which included a surgeon, preacher, bricklayer, blacksmith, shoemaker, surveyor, hatter, midshipman and several farmers.  They were given an initial grant of 41.5 hectares (102½ acres), 6 kilometres (4 mi) upstream along the Swan River from the newly established town of Perth on a peninsula on the left hand side of the river.   Subsequent grants of additional 73 hectares (180 acres) followed up to 1844.  The property was known as Peninsula Farm and now forms much of the current suburb of Maylands.
Hardey's first house was built in May 1830, probably from material brought out on the Tranby. It was located on the low land about 100 metres downstream from the location of the present house. This house was destroyed by flood in July, and Hardey built a new house of wattle and daub, with a thatched roof, the following year. It is not known where this second house was located although it also is believed to have been destroyed by flood.  By June 1839, construction of the current house was completed, making it one of the oldest brick houses in the State and the earliest domestic residence still extant in the inner metropolitan area.[tpl]cite book | author = Williamson, A. J. | title = Tranby House, Maylands Peninsula, Western Australia | publisher = The National Trust of Australia (W.A.)[/tpl]
After the property was divided in 1903, the existing lot which includes the house remained as the Hardy family home until 1913 when it was bought by Henry Baker.  It was named Trany House in 1923, the state's centenary year, in recognition of its historical significance.  In 1951 the property changed hands again and in 1967 was bought by Bond Corporation who demolished the barn and some small cottages with a view to a redevelopment on the site.  Following a public debate opposing the plans, the property was acquired by the National Trust of Australia in 1972, and after an extensive restoration, was opened to the public by Lady Kyle, wife of the Governor, Sir Wallace Kyle on 27 November 1977.National Trust visitors' information sign at the site It continues today as a popular tourist attraction and tearooms. 
Several oak, olive and mulberry trees believed to have been planted by the Hardey family remain and surround the house.   Two of the oak trees were listed on the National Trust's Register of Significant Trees in 1984. 
The house is furnished in the style of the first half of the 19th Century; all furniture is authentic, but has come from various sources. The only furniture known to have belonged to the Hardeys is a regency style brass four poster bed, which is on permanent loan from the Royal Western Australian Historical Society; a polished wooden medicine chest; and the timber lid of a packing case.

He became particularly powerful because of his support for Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) when her ascension was opposed by then-chancellors, and he had a reputation for treachery.  In 663, on account of corruption, he was removed from his post and exiled, and in 666, after Emperor Gaozong had declared a general pardon but excepted the long-term exiles from the pardon, Li Yifu died in anger.

Rahel la Fermosa (Ladino for "Rachel the Beautiful"; originally Rahel Esra; c. 1165, Toledo – 1195, Toledo) was a Jewish woman who lived in Toledo, Spain in the twelfth century. She was the paramour of King Alfonso VIII of Castile, husband of Leonora of England, for almost seven years. Under her influence a number of Spanish Jews were appointed to positions within the royal court. This led to discontent among the clergy and nobility. Rahel's enemies had her murdered, together with those of her coreligionists in the court, in the presence of the king himself. This love-story, which had been relegated to the realm of fable by the Marquis de Mondejar (Memorias Historicas, xxiii. 67 et seq.) and other Spanish literary historians, is related as a fact by Alfonso X, grandson of Alfonso VIII,  and by the latter's son Sancho IV.

The Monthly Magazine reported in May, 1808 that Wilkinson & Co. offered to the public "a New Patent, Cabinet Piano-forte", and described that its form was "as curious as convenient," occupying no more room than the smallest bookcase, while its tone was both brilliant and delicate, its touch "peculiarly facile and pleasant" and claimed the strength and simplicity of its construction would tend "to ensure its keeping in tune longer than most other instruments."The Monthly Magazine vol.XXV part 1, no.4 1 May 1808 p. 342 The Quarterly Musical Register described in early 1812 that by then these instruments were manufactured by other firms as well, and commented "whether they will be adopted as preferable to the square piano forte, time must shew."Retrospect of the State of Music in Great Britain, since the Year 1789.

Minesing Wetlands, previously known as Minesing Swamp, is a Ramsar boreal wetland in central Ontario, Canada stretching from the western periphery of Barrie to Georgian Bay.[tpl]sfn|Hock|1987|p=H19[/tpl] It was identified and classified through the International Biological Program. It is "the largest and best example of fen bog in southern Ontario",[tpl]sfn|Ministry of Natural Resources: IBP[/tpl] one of the "most diverse undisturbed wetland tracts in Canada"[tpl]sfn|Ministry of Natural Resources: RAM[/tpl] and is a provincially-significant Area of Natural and Scientific Interest.[tpl]sfn|Ministry of Natural Resources: ANSI[/tpl] The term minesing is of Ojibwe origin and means "island", referring to an island located within Lake Edenvale, which encompassed the present-day wetlands and surrounding areas.[tpl]sfn|Bowles|Laverty|Featherstone|2007[/tpl]
The swamp’s hydrology "provides for an interconnected network of swamps, fens, bogs and marshes".[tpl]sfn|Ramsar Convention Bureau: Annotated Ramsar List[/tpl] It acts as a reservoir that absorbs floodwater during spring thaw, from which a slow and steady flow is released throughout the summer into the Nottawasaga River system.[tpl]sfn|Hock|1987|p=H19[/tpl] This also prevents spring flooding of Wasaga Beach.[tpl]sfn|Hock|1987|p=H19[/tpl]

Erickson Retirement was in the midst of a major expansion in several metropolitan markets when the severe downturn in housing sales brought on by the financial crisis of 2008 made it impossible for the company to continue meeting all of its loan obligations. On October 20, 2009, after an unsuccessful search for alternative funding sources, Erickson Retirement Communities filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. The company emerged from bankruptcy within a few months of filing and has since been re-branded as Erickson Living.
In 2008, the company was identified as one of the best places to work in America.

The Hundred of Dewisland (often written "Dewsland") was a hundred in the north west of Pembrokeshire, Wales. It was formed by the Act of Union of 1536 and was essentially identical to the pre-Norman cantref of Pebidiog:Charles, B. G., The Placenames of Pembrokeshire, National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1992, ISBN 0-907158-58-7, p 197 one of the seven cantrefs of Dyfed.  
Named after Dewi Sant, the Welsh name for Saint David,William Owen Pughe, Cambrian register vol. 2 (1799), p. 79: "...it took the name ot Dewisland among the Englishmen, for that it was given to the bishop's see of St. Davids." Dewisland is in north-western Pembrokeshire, including the city of St David's and the peninsula on which it stands.Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the State of Education in Wales (1848), p. 39: "(Dewisland hundred): — This district embraces the north-west quarter of Pembrokeshire." Almost all of the hundred was within the Marcher Lordship of the Bishop of St David's, and St David's was its civil and ecclesiastical headquarters.  It was said to be divided into two commotes: Mynyw (Latin: Menevia) and Pencaer.W. Rees, An Historical Atlas of Wales, Faber & Faber, 1959, plate 28
Dewisland boasts of being the only part of Wales never conquered by a foreign invader. The English before the Conquest did not get so far, and the Normans respected Dewisland as a possession of the Church, so that it was spared the fierce fighting which took place everywhere else when they conquered Wales.Raphael Samuel, Alison Light, Theatres of Memory: Island stories : unravelling Britain (1997), p. 51 Nevertheless, it was occupied by the Normans in the 12th century, and made part of the March, but remained exclusively Welsh-speaking, except for small English plantations in the City of St David's and at Abercastle and Letterston.  These were extinct by the time of George Owen, who described the hundred as wholly Welsh-speaking.Owen, George, The Description of Pembrokeshire, Dillwyn Miles (Ed), Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1994, ISBN 185902-120-4

[[Characters of Carnivàle]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of American television series characters, Lists of drama television characters, Carnivàle

There are several main characters in ''Carnivàle'', an American television serial drama set in the United States Depression-era Dust Bowl between 1934 and 1935. It aired on HBO between 2003 and 2005. The show traces the disparate storylines of an ensemble of fictional characters revolving around two main characters: young Ben Hawkins working in a traveling carnival, and a California preacher named Brother Justin Crowe. 
Carnivàle has a large cast, amounting to eighteen main cast actors over its two-season run. Most characters are introduced in Ben's storyline: Samson, a dwarf co-running the carnival with Management; Jonesy, Samson's right-hand man with a crippling knee injury; Apollonia and Sofie, two fortunetellers working a mother-daughter act; Lodz, a blind mentalist, and his lover, Lila the Bearded Lady; the cootch (striptease) Dreifuss family; snake charmer Ruthie and her son Gabriel, a strongman; and many other sideshow performers. The supporting characters of Brother Justin's storyline are his sister Iris, his mentor Reverend Norman Balthus, radio show host Tommy Dolan, and convict Varlyn Stroud. Several characters appear in mysterious dreams and visions connecting the slowly converging storylines.
Show creator Daniel Knauf's original story pitch to HBO included elaborate character biographies, which he gave to the actors, the writers and the studio as an overview over the series' intended plot. These biographies were rewritten before the filming of the first season began. Receiving little to no mention in the series afterwards, the original character backgrounds were summarized on the official HBO website. After the show's cancellation, the writers revealed future character arcs and forwarded all original biographies to fans as part of the show's so-called "Pitch Document". Due to their nature, these sources do not offer canon information per se, but provide a frame for the characters' motivation throughout the series. 
The thematic and period setting of Carnivàle required an unusual casting approach. While some actors were hired for their genetic disabilities, most actors were specifically cast for their unique and distinct looks to fit the 1930s period. Award-winning costumes and make-up enhanced the illusion. Reviews generally lauded the actors and characters, and several actors received award recognition for their performances.

[[Ansel Bourne]]
CATEGORIES: People with amnesia

Ansel Bourne was a famous 19th-century psychology case due to his experience of a probable dissociative fugue. The case, among the first ever documented,Michael Kenny, The Passion of Ansel Bourne: Multiple Personality in American Culture. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1986. remains of interest as an example of multiple personality and amnesia. Among the doctors who treated Bourne was William James.
Bourne was an evangelical preacher living in Rhode Island. He had become known slightly for his 1857 partial amnesia in which he was seized with the idea of visiting a chapel. Up to that point he had been a carpenter. He published his experience in 1858.
On January 17, 1887, he went to Providence, Rhode Island, then continued on until he reached Norristown, Pennsylvania, where he set up shop as a stationer and confectioner using the name A. J. Brown. On Monday, March 14, he awakened in the morning not knowing where he was and with no memory of the preceding two months, still believing it was January.
After he was returned home with the assistance of his nephew, William James, then at Harvard University, and Richard Hodgson of the Society for Psychical Research traveled to study him. Under hypnosis, they found, he could be induced to assume the personality of either Bourne or Brown, and neither personality had any knowledge of the other.
The story of Ansel Bourne was "most likely" an inspiration for the name 'Bourne' in the movie and novel series The Bourne Identity.

It is native to South America with distributions in Brazil and Venezuela. Peter Taylor had reduced this species to a synonym under U. resupinata in 1967 because the only difference between the specimens he examined at the time was the smaller size of U. spruceana. Other collections were made of both species after that publication and Taylor reestablished U. spruceana based on these collections that displayed distinct differences between the species.Taylor, Peter.

CATEGORIES: History of Pembrokeshire, Hundreds of Wales

The Hundred of Dungleddy was a hundred in the centre of Pembrokeshire, Wales. It had its origins in the pre-Norman cantref of Deugleddyf.Charles, B. G., The Placenames of Pembrokeshire, National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1992, ISBN 0-907158-58-7, p 395  It derives its Welsh name from its position between the two branches of the River Cleddau (Cleddyf): the English form is a corruption of the Welsh.  The area of the cantref was around 185 km2: it was the smallest of the seven cantrefi of Dyfed.
The cantref was allegedly divided into two commotes.  The Red Book of Hergest calls these "Castell Hu" (= modern Cas-wis or Wiston) and "Llan y Hadein" (=Llanhuadain or Llawhaden).  These both appear to be post-Norman lordships and are not genuine native subdivisions.Charles ibid, p 395  The western part of the hundred was English-speaking from the time of the Norman conquest, and formed part of Little England beyond Wales: the eastern part was part of the Lordship of the Bishop of St David's, and George Owen described it as bilingual.Owen, George, The Description of Pembrokeshire, Dillwyn Miles (Ed), Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1994, ISBN 185902-120-4  The three northeastern parishes (Llys y Fran, New Moat and Bletherston) were solidly Welsh-speaking during the 20th century.
As their names imply, the civil headquarters of the commotes were at Wiston and Llawhaden, and the latter the cantref's ecclesiastical centre, perhaps the seat of a bishop during the Age of the SaintsWilliams, A. H., An Introduction to the History of Wales: Volume I: Prehistoric Times to 1063, UoWP, 1941, p 120
Dungleddy was formalised as a hundred by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542: a small part was transferred to the hundred of Dewisland, and various fragments of church land (Llandissilio, Llanfallteg, Llangan, Crinow, Henllan, Grondre and western Llawhaden) were acquired from Cantref Gwarthaf.

Hard to Swallow is the third studio album by American rapper Vanilla Ice. Released by Republic Records in 1998, the album was the first album the performer recorded after a four-year hiatus following the 1994 release of Mind Blowin. Vanilla Ice intended the new musical direction found on the album as an attempt to move away from hip hop music and discard his former pop image. Hard to Swallow instead featured what he described as "skate rock", a fusion of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. The album features appearances from Amen vocalist Casey Chaos, Bloodhound Gang vocalist Jimmy Pop, and Insane Poetry front man Cyco. Session musicians included drummer Shannon Larkin, keyboardist Scott Borland, and Snot guitarist Sonny Mayo.
Vanilla Ice took an interest in the musical style found on Hard to Swallow while performing as a member of a Miami grunge band, and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, with whom he shared an interest in motocross racing. Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with Vanilla Ice. The album's darker lyrical subject matter developed from conversations, in which Robinson encouraged him to write about his past. Subjects included Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood, drug addiction and struggles with fame. Although Republic Records believed that the album would revive Vanilla Ice's career, it received largely negative reviews and did not chart.
The song "S.N.A.F.U." was remade in Rhythm Party (Boom Boom Dance) as "BEFREE" with additional verses from Vanilla Ice himself and production from Konami in house artist Des-ROW.

The Islands of the Forth are a group of small islands located in the Firth of Forth and in the estuary of the River Forth on the east coast of Scotland. Most of the group lie in the open waters of the firth, between the Lothians and Fife, with the majority to the east of the city of Edinburgh. Two islands lie further west in the river estuary.
The islands have a varied geology and history and several have both ecclesiastical connections and were involved in military occupations throughout the centuries of recorded history. Various lighthouses and other aids to navigation have been erected on the islands and skerries, one dating to the 17th century, but only one of the islands is still permanently inhabited. The area has a diversity of bird and sea life and the scientific name for the Northern Gannet is derived from this bird's connection with the Bass Rock.
There are few islands off eastern Scotland and most of any size are in this group. Other east coast islands include Mugdrum in the Firth of Tay and Inchcape, a notorious reef off the Angus coast - for a full listing see List of outlying islands of Scotland.

[[History of the North Sea]]

CATEGORIES: History of the North Sea

The North Sea, though often an area of conflict, has an extensive history of maritime commerce and trade routes between its coastal nations whose economies and industries were also able to exploit its resources.  The earliest records of Roman explorations of the sea begin in 12 BC.  Southern Britain was formally invaded in 43 AD and gradually assimilated into the Roman Empire, beginning sustained trade across the North Sea and the English Channel. The Germanic Angles, Saxons, and Jutes began the next great migration across the North Sea during the Migration Period, conquering, displacing, and mixing with the native Celtic populations.  The Viking Age began in 793 and for the next two centuries the Vikings ruled the North Sea.
From the Middle Ages until the end of the 15th century, before the development of good roads, maritime trade on the North Sea connected the economies of northern Europe, Britain, and Scandinavia with each other as well as with the Baltic and the Mediterranean.
The Netherland low countries and German speaking lands were the central hub for English Channel and North Sea coastal trade and organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade, also became increasingly prominent.Dollinger 1999: 62
Important overseas colonies, a vast merchant marine, and a powerful navy made the Dutch the main rivals of growing England, which saw its future in these three spheres.  This conflict was at the root of the first three Anglo-Dutch Wars between 1652 and 1673. Scotland emerged as a prominent economic power during the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century. Between 1700 and 1815, the North Sea saw only 45 years of peace, and could be regarded as the most dangerous eras to sail the sea.  Tensions in the North Sea were again heightened in 1904 by the Dogger Bank incident.  However, the British did not face a challenge to their dominance of the North Sea until World War One broke out in 1914.  During the First World War the North Sea became the main theatre of the war for surface action.  The Second World War also saw action in the North Sea, though it was restricted more to submarines and smaller vessels such as minesweepers, and torpedo boats and similar vessels.
After the war, the North Sea lost much of its military significance because it is bordered only by NATO member-states.  However, it gained significant economic importance in the 1960s as the states on the North Sea coasts began full-scale exploitation of its oil and gas resources.  The North Sea continues to be an active trade route. The countries bordering the North Sea all claim the [tpl]convert|12|nmi[/tpl] of territorial waters within which they have exclusive fishing rights. Today, the North Sea is more important as a fishery and source of fossil fuel and renewable energy, since territorial expansion of the adjoining countries has ceased.

[[Pluto Fast Flyby]]

CATEGORIES: NASA space probes, Missions to Pluto, Cancelled spacecraft

The Pluto Fast Flyby was a space mission meant to perform a flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto. This spacecraft was meant to be launched by 2000 and reach Pluto by 2010, so it could examine Pluto's atmosphere before it froze to the ground as 'snow' as Pluto moves away from the Sun. It was proposed the instruments would be a visible camera, an infrared spectrometer, an ultraviolet spectrometer, and a radio transmitter to send its findings back to Earth. As Pluto takes several Earth days to rotate once, and any flyby of Pluto going at the speed it needed to reach Pluto quickly, two spacecraft would have been made to photograph both sides of Pluto and its moon Charon. 
The Pluto Fast Flyby was later cancelled due to a lack of funding, but it was replaced by the Pluto Kuiper Express. The Pluto Kuiper Express was cancelled for the same reasons. A mission to Pluto was eventually realized as New Horizons, and is currently on its way to the dwarf planet.

[[Competence-based management]]

CATEGORIES: Strategy, Management, Strategic management

Competence-based Strategic Management is a relatively new way of thinking about how organizations gain high performance for a significant period of time. Established as a theory in the early 1990s, competence-based strategic management theory explains how organizations can develop sustainable competitive advantage in a systematic and structural way. 
The theory of competence-based strategic management is an integrative strategy theory that incorporates economic, organizational and behavioural concerns in a framework that is dynamic, systemic, cognitive and holistic (Sanchez and Heene, 2004). This theory defines competence as: the ability to sustain the coordinated deployment of resources in ways that helps an organization achieve its goals (creating and distributing value to customers and stakeholders).Sanchez, R., Heene, A. (2004), The New Strategic Management: Organizations, Competition and Competence, John Wiley & Sons
Though simple, this definition embodies essential aspects of the ‘‘four cornerstones’’ of the theory of competence-based strategic management, which aspires to recognize and capture the dynamic, systemic, cognitive and holistic nature of organizational competences. Each of these four aspects of the nature of the competent organization deserves further comment.Sanchez, R., Heene, A.

The peso fuerte (Spanish "Strong Peso" sign: PF) was the currency of the Philippines and the entire Spanish East Indies during the later Spanish colonial period, issued by El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II (currently Bank of the Philippine Islands).  
It replaced the real at the rate of eight reales to one peso fuerte.  The colonial government at the time allowed El Banco Español-Filipino to issue pesos fuertes up to one-fourths of its subscribed capital, or a maximum of PF 100,000, which was subsequently raised to 300,000 in 1855.
El Banco Español-Filipino began issuing peso fuerte notes on May 1, 1852 and coins in 1861.  The currency subsequently decimalized in 1864, being subdivided into 100 céntimos.  The currency was replaced by the revolutionary peso in 1898 following the Philippine Revolution, and further by the modern peso in 1901.

Duncan MacKay (born 14 July 1937) is a former Scottish footballer who played for Celtic, Third Lanark, Melbourne Croatia, Perth Azzurri and the Scotland national team.
Born in Glasgow, Mackay turned professional when he joined Celtic from Maryhill Harp aged 17 in 1955. He developed rapidly, making his club debut within two years and earning the first of an eventual 14 caps for the Scottish national side four years later. However, Celtic were at this time in the shadow of rivals Rangers and he was destined not to win any honours with the Parkhead club. Celtic manager Jimmy McGrory's attempts to rejuvenate his side eventually resulted in MacKay's departure from Celtic Park after over 200 first team appearances, the fullback moving to south Glasgow side Third Lanark in November 1964. Thirds were relegated at the end of the 1964-65 season though, and MacKay was one of several players released.
MacKay opted to move to Australia at this juncture, joining Melbourne Croatia of the Victorian State League.  He helped the side to the State title in 1968 and several Dockerty Cup triumphs but left when Croatia were suspended following crowd disturbances in 1972. He returned to Scotland and joined junior club St Anthony's as a player-coach for two years before deciding upon a second stint in Australia. After playing for Perth Azzurri between 1974 and 1977 he coached with South Melbournehttp://www.smfc.com.au/history/1970-s/ and Essendon Lions.

The Morice River is the outflow of Morice Lake south west of Houston, British Columbia, Canada.  Morice Lake and Morice River are named after Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice Geographic Name details  The Morice has many small creeks joining it along its length, but retains the clear glacial hue for its length.  The Morice river continues on to the town of Houston at which point the river is joined by a small tributary river called "The Little Bulkley" and the two rivers joined become the Bulkley River. They become the Bulkley, not the Morice despite the fact the Morice is larger. This was done by Poudrier, a government cartographer whom, it is rumoured, never saw the region.

The 26 July 2007 Baghdad market bombing were a truck bomb and rocket attack on a market in the Karada district of Baghdad, the capital city of Iraq, on 26 July 2007, killing almost 100 people.
It was first reported that 25 people were only killed and 100 wounded. However, less than a week later the names of 92 dead and 127 wounded were posted on a list taped to a shuttered storefront; it was compiled by the rescue workers. Many Iraqis saw the discrepancy as an attempt by the Iraqi government to cover up the number of Iraqis being killed in the capital.

[[Triad (environmental science)]]
CATEGORIES: Environmental science

The Triad Triad Resource Center is an approach by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to decision-making for hazardous-waste site cleanup.pp.91-111, Crumbling, Griffith, Powell During the late 1990s, technology advocates from the environmental sector in the United States developed the approach by combining innovations in management and technology with ideas from hazardous-waste site cleanup experience. 
Their goal was to form a framework for real-time environmental sensors and tools, to improve decision-making at contaminated sites. This resulted in a more formalized set of ideas in 2001 that soon became known as the Triad approach. The ideas spawned a Community of Practice by 2005. 
The Triad Community of Practice includes representatives of federal, state, and private sector organizations in the U.S. and abroad. By 2008, a European CoP had been formed European CoP Info In 2008, a technical conference led largely by the CoP and covering the Triad Approach was held at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, "Triad Investigations: New Approaches and Innovative Strategies.2008 Triad Conference"
The term Triad represents three elements: systematic project planning (SPP), dynamic work strategies, and innovative rapid sampling and analytical technologies. While elements of the Triad have long been used for site cleanup, Triad packages these best management practices together with the guiding principles:
1. Use a planning process, which includes participation of all stakeholders (including a multidisciplinary project team, federal and state regulators, legal counsel, community members, and other environmental professionals), to determine the types of data required and to evaluate whether the site could benefit from real-time measurement technologies.
2. Discussion of uncertainty management, data representativeness, and site closure strategies.
3. Use of a site model that recognizes site characterization is an element used at all stages of remediation.   
4. Use of sampling, measurement, and data management technologies to support uncertainty management strategies.  
5. Project teams that have communication, trust, discussion of individual interests and goals, and expertise in the appropriate fields.
Triad is an open-marketplace idea that is not owned by one entity. There is considerable U.S. Multiagency support for Triad. Beginning in 2006, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation expressed support of Triad by requesting the cooperation of its regional managers to expand the use of Triad at Superfund sites, where appropriate.EPA Memo OSWER-9200.1-55

Live and let live is the spontaneous rise of non-aggressive co-operative behaviour that developed during the First World War particularly during prolonged periods of Trench Warfare on the Western Front. Perhaps one of the most famous examples of this is the Christmas Truce of 1914.
It is a process that can be characterised as the deliberate abstaining from the use of violence during war.  Sometimes it can take the form of overt truces or pacts negotiated locally by soldiers.  At other times it can be a tacit behaviour—sometimes characterised as "letting sleeping dogs lie"—whereby both sides refrain from firing or using their weapons, or deliberately discharge them in a ritualistic or routine way that signals their non-lethal intent.

"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie" is a popular song written by Vaughn Horton, Denver Darling, and Milt Gabler. The song was recorded in January 1946 by Louis Jordan & His Tympany Five. It topped the R&B charts for 18 weeks from August 1946, a record only equalled by one other hit, "The Honeydripper."  The record was one of Jordan's biggest ever hits with both black and white audiences, peaking at number seven on the national chart [tpl]cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=309[/tpl] and provided an important link between blues and country music, foreshadowing the development of "rock and roll" a few years later.
Alternating up and down strokes of the F and F6 chords on the guitar creates a relaxed shuffle beat feel. The song is essentially a three-chord, twelve bar blues.Swing Guitar. Fred Sokolow. Hal Leonard Corporation. p 42
Although "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie" is now seen as epitomising the style known as jump blues, it was written by white songwriters whose background was in country and western music.  The song is credited to Darling, Horton and Gabler. Denver Darling (1909–1981) was a "hillbilly" guitarist and songwriter,Richard Carlin, Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary, p. 96Denver Darling profile at Hillbilly-music.com as was his occasional songwriting partner Vaughn Horton (1911–1988).  Horton's first writing success was with "Mockin' Bird Hill," and as well as working with Darling on such songs as "Address Unknown," a 1939 hit for The Ink Spots, also worked with Gene Autry.  His other writing successes included "Dixie Cannonball" and "Muleskinner's Blues."Vaughn and Roy Horton at Country Music Hall of FameVaughn Horton at Find-a-grave.com  The third credited songwriter was Milt Gabler (1911-2001), then the vice-president of Decca Records and Louis Jordan's record producer.

[[Landscape design software]]

CATEGORIES: Landscape architecture

Landscape design software is used by Landscape architects, landscape designers and garden designers to create planting, softworks, groundworks and hardworks (see definitions below) plans before constructing a landscape.
There are two levels of software available, amateur and professional. The former is usually aimed at simple visualisation of a garden design whilst the latter provides tools that allow stylistic representations of a design to be accurately labelled and dimensioned for contractors to interpret and land authorities or local government to sight and approve or otherwise. Since the advent of the personal computer, several software packages have come into existence the main professional software being CS Design Software's CS Artisan, Idea Spectrum's Realtime Landscaping Architect, LANDWorksCAD, LandCADD, Landmark, PRO Landscape, Structure Studio's VizTerra, VisionScape's VirtualProperty Architect, and Visual Impact's Earthscapes.
Professional landscape design software requires detailed information to be output for contract documentation, which will usually constitute drawings, specifications and reports (schedules/bills of quantity). The more sophisticated landscape design software solutions automate the process of generating reports (schedules/bills of quantity) from intelligent data in the drawing; such intelligence is usually contained within labels (annotations) which include, in the case of planting, automatic calculation routines to determine the number of individual plants based on plant spacings (centres) per area or length. When labelled areas or lengths are modified (stretched or shrunk), associated labels are recalculated at the same time as reports (schedules/bills of quantity) contained in or associated with the same drawing.
Below is a list of some features provided by such software:

JeOS refers to a customized operating system that fits the needs of a particular application. It is not a generic, one-size-fits-all operating system so it only needs to include the pieces of an operating system (e.g., kernel) required to support a particular application and any other third-party components contained in the appliance.

[[Componential analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Semantics

Componential analysis, also called feature analysis or contrast analysis, refers to the description of the meaning of words through structured sets of semantic features, which are given as “present”, “absent” or “indifferent with reference to feature”. The method thus departs from the principle of compositionality. Componential analysis is a method typical of structural semantics which analyzes the structure of a word's meaning. Thus, it reveals the culturally important features by which speakers of the language distinguish different words in the domain (Ottenheimer, 2006, p. 20). This is a highly valuable approach to learning another language and understanding a specific semantic domain of an Ethnography.

Before becoming a CW affiliate, the station was a WB affiliate via The WB 100+ Station Group. The WB 100+ was a similar cable-only operation as the current CW Plus service. On September 18, 2006, KMHB switched its affiliation to The CW after Time Warner and CBS Corporation closed down The WB and UPN networks and merged them into the The CW Television Network.

The South Devon Banks are a series of steep inclines on the ex-GWR railway line linking Exeter and Plymouth in Devon, England. These two cities are separated by the rocky uplands of Dartmoor forcing the early railway surveyors to propose that the line skirt the difficult terrain of the comparatively sparsely populated moorland. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, in surveying the South Devon Railway, opted to push a line along a coastal strip between the Exe and Teign valleys, and then to climb the southern outliers of Dartmoor making for the head of the Plym estuary. From Newton Abbot, the line climbs Dainton Bank, and from Totnes it climbs Rattery Bank, reaches a peak at Wrangaton summit, and then descends Hemerdon Bank to reach Plymouth. These three are collectively known as the South Devon Banks.

The 2008 Rose Bowl featured the 7th-ranked USC Trojans hosting the 13th-ranked Illinois Fighting Illini. As with the previous year's game, the contest was a semi-traditional Rose Bowl in that while it was a Big Ten versus Pac-10 matchup, the Big Ten representative was an at-large team because the conference champion, Ohio State, which lost to Illinois earlier in the season, was selected to play in the BCS National Championship Game.
USC was making its third straight appearance in the Rose Bowl, while Illinois had not played in the game since 1984.  Though Illinois won the Big Ten Conference title in 2001, the then-rotating BCS title game moved them to the Sugar Bowl.

The 2008 FedEx Orange Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Kansas Jayhawks on January 3, 2008, at Dolphins Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Spread bettors favored Virginia Tech by three points, but in a game dominated by defensive and special teams play, Kansas defeated Virginia Tech 24–21. The game was part of the 2007–2008 Bowl Championship Series (BCS) of the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season and was the concluding game of the season for both teams. This 74th edition of the Orange Bowl was televised in the United States on FOX and was watched by more than eight million viewers.
The game between the third-ranked ACC champion Virginia Tech Hokies and the eighth-ranked Kansas Jayhawks from the Big 12 Conference (Big 12) was played at neutral-site Dolphins Stadium. Tech served as the home team in the contest. Virginia Tech automatically qualified for the Orange Bowl by virtue of the ACC's tie-in with the bowl, while Orange Bowl selected Kansas over West Virginia—which had been upset by then 4–7 Pittsburgh—and conference rival Missouri. Two weeks after Kansas's selection, controversy erupted when a deal was revealed to put 4th-ranked Oklahoma against Virginia Tech. The deal was vetoed by BCS commissioners, and the selection of Kansas was upheld.
The game marked the first time the Jayhawks had been to the Orange Bowl since the 1969 Orange Bowl and was their first bowl game since the 2005 Fort Worth Bowl, when they defeated Houston 41–13. Virginia Tech last played in the Orange Bowl game in December 1996, losing to Nebraska 21–41. The 2008 Orange Bowl was Virginia Tech's 15th consecutive season with a bowl game, a streak dating to the 1993 Independence Bowl.
Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing completed 20 of his 37 passes for 227 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. On the opposite side of the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon finished the game 13 for 28 passing, earning 160 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. Kansas cornerback Aqib Talib, whose 60-yard interception return for a touchdown gave Kansas its first lead of the game, won the game's Most Valuable Player award. After the game, Talib was one of several players from both teams to announce an intention to enter the 2008 NFL Draft.

Red Shoes was the son of Jean Baptiste Louis DeCourtel Marchand and his Muskogee wife Sehoy.  Since lineage among the Muskogee was traced matrilineally, Red Shoes, like his mother, was part of the Wind Clan. However, some sources say that Red Shoes was the son of Sehoy's second husband Red Shoes (Choctaw chief).Sehoy genealogy
His sister, also named Sehoy, was the mother of Alexander McGillivray.  In proper Muskogean tradition, Red Shoes raised Alexander in as if he were his own son.  However, since Red Shoes's own children were members of their mother's clan, Alexander was Red Shoes's heir.
Red Shoes died about 1783.

"Fort Decker" is a stone house built in 1793 from the remains of the fort of that name.[tpl]cite web |last=Osborne |first=Peter |url=http://www.minisink.org/forthist.html |title=Written In Stone: A History Of The Old Decker Stone House 1793-1993| accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl]  It is located on West Main Street in Port Jervis, New York, the oldest building in that city, which it predates by several decades.
The original Fort Decker was built by a Frederick Haynes, a Dutch settler, sometime before 1760, during the French and Indian War, as an unofficial defense and trading post. It was one and a half stories high, built of stone and overlapping logs. Haynes left the area for New Jersey around 1775, leaving the fort to his wife's family, the Deckers.
On July 19, 1779, during Revolutionary War, when the settlement was known as "Peenpack", the fort was burned during a raid by pro-British Indian leader Joseph Brant. When survivors brought news of the disaster to Goshen, the Patriot attempt to retaliate led to a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Minisink, the only major engagement of the war in the upper Delaware Valley.
The current house was built from the remains of the fort in 1793. In 1826, it would house engineers working on the Delaware and Hudson Canal, including John Jervis, whom the city would later be renamed for. It remained in private hands as a residence from then on. In 1903, newspapers reported that the original roof was being removed, and in 1924 the building suffered partial damage from a fire.
As early as the 1880s, there had been interest in using the structure as a museum. This did not become possible until 1970, when the historical society bought it for $1,000 and converted it into a museum. In 1974 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the first of three buildings in Port Jervis to attain that distinction, the others being the Erie Depot and the Post Office.

Hall began playing at 14 years of age in a soda shop in his home town. When local pool rooms would not let him enter because of his age, he used subterfuge to obtain a new birth certificate from a local judge which stated he was of legal age. He cut his teeth at Herbie Lynn's pool room and was soon dominating the regulars. It was not long before he hit the road to try his hand at a wider playing field. He first gained some prominence at the Johnson City tournaments.[tpl]cite journal | last = Forsyth | first = Jerry | title = Touching Base with Buddy Hall | journal = Pool & Billiard Magazine | volume =  16| issue =  9 | pages = 100–101| id = ISSN 1049-2852 | date = September 1998[/tpl] I went there to watch all the greats of the day play.

In the following years, Johnson City lost out as the hub of top tier tournament play to Dayton, Ohio. There, organizer Joe Burns instituted a similar all-around tournaments to the format that had been used in Johnosn City. Hall played in the Dayton Tournaments for many years.

Panton, Leslie & Company was a company of Scottish merchants active in trading in the Bahamas and with the Indians of what is now the Southeastern United States during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  
Panton, Leslie & Company was a partnership formed at St. Augustine, capital of British East Florida, by William Panton, John Leslie, Thomas Forbes, Charles McLatchy and William Alexander in 1783 for the purpose of trading with the Indians of Florida and adjacent territory claimed by Spain.[tpl]cite book|author=Lawrence A.

Having established themselves in Florida and the Bahamas, the company was able to continue operating in Florida after the colony's return to Spain in 1783 because there were no Spanish traders established in the trade with the region's Indians. Panton, Leslie & Company were granted a monopoly on this trade in East Florida, and eventually also dominated the Indian trade in West Florida. 
For many years Panton, Leslie & Company dominated trade with the Creeks and Seminoles. They eventually captured much of the trade with the Choctaws and Chickasaws, and were important in the trade with the Cherokees.[tpl]cite book|author=Merritt B.

Panton, Leslie & Company also operated as merchants in the Bahamas, organizing shipping of cotton and other local products, and acting as agents for merchants in Britain.Johnson:13
After the deaths of William Panton and John Leslie, the company was reorganized in 1804 as John Forbes & Company.

It is a necked-up version of the .243 WSSM,* The .25 WSSM by Chuck Hawks which is in turn a shortened .300 WSM (Winchester Short Magnum). The WSSM cartridges are based on ballistics design philosophies that are intended to produce a high level of efficiency.Browning WSSM info 
Like other WSSM cases, the .25 is short and fat, which is designed to be more efficient. However, short fat cases with an abruptly angled shoulder and have been criticized by some as being difficult to feed properly in some rifles.Benchrest.com Forums 
Unlike the other WSSM rounds, the .25 is a magnum in name only, based on the case it uses. Performance wise it is a clone of the .25-06 Remington, making it well suited for medium to large game.The Overlooked .25 Caliber Cartridges by Chuck Hawks The 25 WSSM provides the same performance as the 25-06 Remington, with the advantage of having lighter short action rifles. Having the short fat design, the cartridge loads burn at a more consistent rate, providing a higher level of accuracy.  Performance is far less than other .25 caliber magnum rounds as the .257 Weatherby Magnum. In fact, ballistically it's almost identical to the improved version of the .257 Roberts, which P.O. Ackley said was his favorite choice for an all-around cartridge.Handbook for Shooters & Reloaders vol I, Book by P.O. Ackley; Plaza Publishing, 1962, ISBN 978-99929-4-881-1

[[Gross domestic income]]

CATEGORIES: National accounts

The Gross Domestic Income (GDI) is the total income received by all sectors of an economy within a State. It includes the sum of all wages, profits, and taxes, minus subsidies. Since all income is derived from production (including the production of services), the gross domestic income of a country should exactly equal its gross domestic product (GDP). The GDP is a very commonly cited statistic measuring the economic activity of countries, and the GDI is quite uncommon. 
In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis produces figures for both the GDP and GDI. Although these should be equal, since they are calculated in different ways, in practice, the listed figures are different. This difference is known as the statistical discrepancy.[tpl]cite web | title = A Consistent Accounting of U.S. Productivity Growth | author = Eric J. Bartelsman and J.

Usually called simply the "Life Master Pairs" or "LM Pairs", this is a six-session pairs tournament open to all players without regard to age, sex, nationality, or membership. It is restricted to Life Masters, now a modest career record in ACBL sanctioned play, which leading players from overseas are able to achieve by attending a few NABC meets. If it remains the most prestigious competition for pairs, that may be because it is older than the parallel spring and fall events, the Norman Kay Platinum Pairs established 2010 and Edgar Kaplan Blue Ribbon Pairs established 1963.

The gig pole ranges in length from 8 to 14 feet for fish gigs and 5 to 8 feet for frog gigs. A gig typically has three or four barbed tines similar to a trident; however gigs can be made with any number of tines. In the past people would attach illuminated pine knots to the end of gigs at night to give them light.

The song was issued by Tear Drop Records in 1977 and became one of her most popular  compositions. The "Goodbye Priscilla" 45 is now a much sought-after collectible and has been issued on several Elvis "tribute" compilation albums and CDs. She later met with Priscilla Presley and personally presented her with a copy of the original 45rpm record. When "Goodbye Priscilla" was first released in 1977 there was some confusion about which Priscilla it was written for-Priscilla Presley or Priscilla Davis who was a main character in the famous Cullen Davis Murder Trials. In his book "Blood Will Tell-The Murder Trials Of Cullen Davis" author Gary Cartwright credits the song (page 199) as referring to Priscilla Davis. However, this song was written solely for Priscilla Presley as a tribute to Elvis.

Of the many reforms enacted through Sarbanes-Oxley, one major goal was to regain public confidence in the reliability of financial markets in the wake of corporate scandals such as Enron, WorldCom and Waste Management.  Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley mandated that public companies have an independent Audit of internal controls over financial reporting.  In essence, the intent of the U.S. Congress in passing the Sarbanes Oxley Act was attempting to proactively deter financial misrepresentation (Fraud) in order to ensure more accurate financial reporting to increase investor confidence.  This same concept is applied in the discussion of fraud deterrence.
Until recently, fraud deterrence has not been specifically identified under one common definition.  While it has been discussed by many authoritative sources such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Practice Aid Series, “Fraud Detection in a GAAS Audit: SAS No. 99 Implementation Guide,” (explicitly) The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), “Internal Control – Integrated Framework,” (implicitly) and the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts Certified Fraud Deterrence Analyst (CFD) designation (recently merged into the Certified Forensic Financial Analyst (CFFA) designation), an actual definition of the term “fraud deterrence” has been difficult to find.

It was the only film festival in socialist countries that attracted big Hollywood stars such as Jack Nicholson, Kirk Douglas, Robert De Niro, Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda and famous directors like Miloš Forman, Francis Ford Coppola, Roman Polanski, Sam Peckinpah, Pier Paolo Pasolini etc.
The festival's significance declined in the 1990s, mostly due to the international embargo FR Yugoslavia was under at the time. In 1993 and 1994, it was not even held and in 1997 it was interrupted in protest against police brutality taking place against student protesters.
However, FEST still attracts a large number of movie buffs. In 2007, 98,191 tickets were sold for around 80 films.Beogradski međunarodni filmski festival — FEST 2007.

[[Escharotomy]]
CATEGORIES: Plastic surgery

An escharotomy is a surgical procedure used to treat full thickness (third-degree) circumferential burns.  Since full thickness burns are characterized by tough, leathery eschar, an escharotomy is used primarily to combat compartment syndrome.  Following a full thickness burn, as the underlying tissues are rehydrated, they become constricted due to the eschar's loss of elasticity, leading to impaired circulation distal to the wound.
An escharotomy is performed by making an incision through the eschar to expose the fatty tissue below.  Due to the residual pressure, the incision will often widen substantially.

[[Roose Hundred]]

CATEGORIES: Cantrefs, History of Pembrokeshire, Hundreds of Wales

The Hundred of Roose (sometimes called Rowse) was a hundred in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It has its origins in the pre-Norman cantref of RhosCharles, B. G., The Placenames of Pembrokeshire, National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1992, ISBN 0-907158-58-7, p 570 and was formalised as a hundred by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542. It derives its Welsh name from its position nearly surrounded by water, bounded east by the tidal Western Cleddau, south by Milford Haven and west by St Brides Bay. Rhos locally means (among other things) "promontory".Charles, ibid, p 810 The English form is a corruption of the Welsh. Its area was around 264 km2.
The pre-Norman history of the cantref is uncertain, as is the site of its civil headquarters.: It had been popularly assumed that the chief town of Haverfordwest does not pre-date the Norman conquest. However archaeological discoveries in Pembrokeshire as early as the 1920s by Sir Mortimer Wheeler at Wolfscastle earlier Iron Age and Roman coinage and artefact discoveries, and recent excavations by the Dyfed Archaeological Trust under the direction of Heather James at Carmarthen (Maridunum) in the 1980s point convincingly to  Roman penetration to the westernmost parts of Wales. A Roman road running west of Carmarthen has been identified with the possibility of Roman Fortlets at Whitland and Haverfordwest. The strategic position of Haverfordwest with its defensive bluff overlooking the lowest fordable point on the Western Cleddau accessible to sea traffic suggest a Roman origin probably modest in scale for the town from about 96 AD. The ecclesiastical centre (perhaps the seat of a bishop in the Age of the Saints) was probably one of the several churches of the local St Ismael, most probably St. Ishmael's.Williams, A. H., An Introduction to the History of Wales: Volume I: Prehistoric Times to 1063, UoWP, 1941, p 120
The hundred, with its capital at Haverfordwest was the original centre of the Norman/English "plantation" in the 12th century, and it has been essentially English-speaking since then, forming the core of Little England beyond Wales.
The cantref was said in the post-Norman period to be divided into two or perhaps three commotes. The Red Book of Hergest mentions Hwlffordd (Haverfordwest) commote and Castell Gwalchmei (Walwyn's Castle) commote. The former is an English name, and the "commotes" correspond to the Norman lordships. The northern part of Hwlffordd commote was sometimes distinguished as Roch commote (a French name). None of these is likely to be a real native Welsh subdivision, and the small Cantref of Rhos was probably not actually divided into commotes.Charles ibid, p 570 The fragmentary Norman lordshipsHowells, B, Walker, R. F., Pembrokeshire County History: Vol II: Medieval Pembrokeshire, Pembrokeshire Historical Society, 2002, ISBN 0-903771-10-1, p 142 are shown in the map.

Lesser Goguryeo or Little Goguryeo (699-820) (소고구려, 小高句麗) was a state established by the refugees of Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.
The kingdom was originally called Goryeo, but later historians added "Lesser" for disambiguation from Goguryeo, which was also often called Goryeo. "Goryeo" is also the name of a later period of Korean history (see Goryeo), and the source of the English name Korea.
After the Korean Silla kingdom and the Chinese Tang Dynasty allied to destroy Goguryeo, the Liaodong Peninsula was briefly administered by Tang. Tang soon lost effective control due to rebellion by Goguryeo refugees, and the region became a buffer zone between Tang and the Korean kingdom of Balhae. Although Lesser Goguryeo declared itself an independent kingdom, it was soon absorbed into Balhae, which became the successor state to Goguryeo. http://kr.dic.yahoo.com/search/enc/result.html?pk=14973400 Yahoo Encyclopedia

[[Elmelunde Master]]
CATEGORIES: Danish artists, Fresco painting, Anonymous artists, Church frescos in Denmark, Møn

The Elmelunde Master, Danish Elmelundemesteren, is the designation given to the nameless 16th-century artist who painted the frescoes in the churches of Elmelunde, Fanefjord and Keldby on the island of Møn in south-eastern Denmark.
The naves of these three churches were furnished with Gothic cross vaults at the end of the 15th century providing an ideal surface for frescoes of the Biblia pauperum (or people's bible) based on popular stories from the richly illustrated medieval manuscripts of the Old and New Testaments.
The artist can be recognised from his distinctive emblem present in one or more of the frescoes in all three churches. His warm colours ranging from dark red and russet to pastel shades of yellow, green, grey and black are distinctive as are the faces of his figures who all have sleepy eyes whether in scenes of heaven or hell. Vines, flowers and tree branches complete the images.
In the 16th century, following the Reformation, the frescoes were covered with coats of whitewash which hid them from view until quite recently. It was in the 1880s that they were first rediscovered in the church at Elmelunde with the result that the artist became known as the Elmelunde Master. It is however the frescoes in Fanefjord Church uncovered in the 1930s which are considered to be the most interesting and comprehensive.
The Elmelunde Master's school is also credited with the frescoes in churches on the neighbouring island of Falster at Tingsted, Nørre Alslev, Kettinge and Åstrup.

The paper "covers a large variety of local, national, and international events, features, profiles, and has the following sections: arts, book review, restaurant review, Islam, money, legal, kids, travel, interfaith, commentary, and opinion."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infocusnews.net/content/view/400/16/|title=About InFocus|accessdate=2007-09-06|work=Southern California InFocus[/tpl]
The paper describes its mission as:
  "... serving to document the rich history of Muslims in the Southland – past and present. Through feature stories, mosque profiles, interviews of individuals who have made a difference, and in-depth coverage of news stories affecting Muslims, InFocus is the first localized effort in Southern California to record the American Muslim experience. For American Muslims, it is a platform which brings forth issues of their concern. For the larger community, it is a window into the Muslim world right here in California". 
Managing editor Ahmad describes the paper as, "an Islamic newspaper but not a publication about Islam," and says she wants, "In Focus to concentrate on issues important to Muslims, such as civil rights and discrimination, which she says are largely ignored by the mainstream media in the post-Sept. 11 world."  Ahmad said the community is committed to democracy. An editorial in the March issue offered qualified support for President Bush's Middle East policy and called for the democratization of Arab countries, urging Muslims to turn the "breeze of democracy into an unstoppable wind." More than anything, Ahmad said, she wants the newspaper to pull American Muslims into the mainstream. "We can keep our religion and not have an isolationist approach. We can do this in America," she said.

"Hallelujah I Love Her So" is a rhythm and blues single written by and released by American singer Ray Charles in 1956 on the Atlantic label. It would later appear on Ray Charles' self-titled first LP for Atlantic Records in 1957.
The song peaked at number five on the Billboard R&B chart and much like "I Got a Woman" and "This Little Girl of Mine", it was a song based on a gospel hymn with lyrics changed around to fit a secular blues format.
These songs predated the groundbreaking success Charles had near the end of the fifties with "What'd I Say" but they helped contribute to Charles' huge success with the R&B community at the time.
"Hallelujah I Love Her So" is a testament to the joyous release of love, featuring a sophisticated horn arrangement, and memorable tenor sax solo (by Don Wilkerson).

[[Miller Lake lamprey]]
CATEGORIES: Fauna of the United States, Petromyzontiformes

The Miller Lake lamprey (Entosphenus minimus) is a species of fish in the Petromyzontidae family. It is endemic to the United States.  Its natural habitat is the Miller Lake drainage.
This species is of special interest for two reasons: 1) it has an extremely limited distribution, with all known animals contained within a single small drainage system,http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/org_nws/nwsci%20journal%20articles/1981%20files/issue%201/v55%20p70%20kan%20and%20bond.pdf and 2) it is the smallest known parasitic lamprey in the world. The Miller lake lamprey was presumed extinct in 1958, after state fishery managers attempted to eradicate the lamprey from the lake because it was feeding on the introduced trout.Miller, R. R., J. D. Williams, and J. E. Williams. 1989. Extinctions of North American Fishes During the Past Century. Fisheries 14:22-38. The known larval streams for this lamprey were treated with lampricidehttp://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/CRP/miller_lake_lamprey_plan_complete.asp and a barrier was erected to prevent adults from entering to spawn.http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/CRP/docs/miller_lake_lamprey/miller_lake_conservation_plan_final_061005.pdf
The Miller Lake Lamprey was presumed to be extinct until 1992 when it was recollected. Continued collection efforts yielded more animals and in 2000 the group published a paper on the rediscription of this lamprey.Lorion, C. M., D. F. Markle, S. B. Reid, and M. F. Docker. 2000. Redescription of the Presumed-Extinct Miller Lake Lamprey, Lampetra minima. Copeia 2000:1019-1028. In an attempt to restore and protect the Miller lake lamprey, restoration efforts to remove the barrier originally have been carried out, and surveys are done regularly to establish an understanding of the population's health.http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/CRP/docs/miller_lake_lamprey/miller_lake_lamprey_surveys_0804.pdf Understanding how evolutionary forces could drive speciation of a dwarf parasitic species of lamprey is a potential new and exciting area of research for scientists.

This species belongs to a genus of poorly known deep-water catsharks. Very little is known of its biology. This species is known to occur in deep water (840 to 1,380 m) off New Zealand, sporadic sites around Tasmania, and a small area of Western Australia. Some concern exists for this species, as its distribution includes some heavily fished areas. Deep-water demersal trawl fisheries are expanding in the region, and assuming its biology is like other deep-water shark species, it may not be sufficiently fecund to withstand the exploitation pressure.

The pinocchio catshark, Apristurus australis, is a species of fish in the Scyliorhinidae family found in Australia and possibly New Zealand. Its natural habitat is open seas. It belongs to a  genus of poorly known deep-water sharks. Very little is known of its biology. Possibly a widely distributed deep-water catshark found along the Australian continental slope at depths of 590 to 1,000 m, it consists of several distinct populations which may be separate species. Although part of the distribution includes heavily fished areas, particularly off southeastern Australia, much of its range is in unfished areas. Given the taxonomic uncertainty of the separate populations, it is not possible to assess the conservation status of this species at this time. However, deep-water demersal trawl fisheries are expanding in the region, and the situation should be reassessed following taxonomic clarification.

CATEGORIES: Visual programming languages

The MST Workshop (short for Math Science and Technology Workshop') is an interactive computer programming language. It has hundreds of objects that can be dragged on to the workspace and connected by wires or snapping them together. The workspace immediately solves the equations created and displays the results. MST Workshop is useful for creating animation in 2D and 3D (using OpenGL).
MST Workshop uses components to process data. These components are connected when their terminals touch or when a virtual wire is connected between them. The interactive nature becomes apparent when components are connected. The color of the connected components changes from gray to a color specific to the value of the data passed through the connection. Components calculate in real time. Certain components that require a time frame can be started and stopped by buttons in the toolbar. Examples of time dependent components are the timer, oneshot, and the integration-over-time component.

[[Deepsea skate]]
CATEGORIES: Bathyraja, Animals described in 1896

The deepsea skate, Bathyraja abyssicola, is a species of softnose skate, family Rajidae, found in deep water from 362 to 2,906 m, usually on the continental slope. They are distributed from off northern Baja California around Coronado Island and Cortes Bank, north to the Bering Sea, and west to Japan. It is fairly common below 1,000 m, and is taken as by-catch in deepwater trawls and traps. The species name abyssicola comes from the Greek abyssos meaning "bottomless", and cola meaning "living at depths".[tpl]cite book |author=Ebert, D.A. |title=Sharks, Rays, and Chimaeras of California |publisher=University of California Press |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=0-520-23484-7[/tpl]
The pectoral fin disc of the deepsea skate has a moderately triangular anterior margin, a broadly rounded posterior margin, and rounded tips. The disc is slightly wider than it is long. There are 1-5 nuchal thorns (placed on the dorsal midline behind the eyes), separated from a continuous row of 21-32 median tail thorns. The tail is moderately long, narrow, and tapering, terminating in a small, low-set caudal fin. There are two close-set dorsal fins, usually with an interdorsal thorn. Its coloration is grayish purple to dark chocolate brown or black above, occasionally with scattered small darker spots, and slightly darker below except for a whitish area around the mouth. The anterior tip of the pelvic fins are whitish. Large males have irregular whitish blotches and numerous dark spots while females have reduced or absent blotches. Juveniles tend to be uniform in color.
The deepsea skate is oviparous. The egg cases are oblong capsules with stiff pointed horns at the corners, deposited on sandy or muddy flats. One egg case measured 105.8 mm long and 65.2 mm wide. The young may tend to follow large objects, such as their mother.[tpl]fishbase species |genus=Bathyraja |species=abyssicola |month=November |year=2008[/tpl] Males mature at 110-120 cm and grow at least as large as 135 cm, while females attain at leat 157 cm. The smallest known free-swimming specimens measured 34-36 cm. Deepwater skates feed on benthic organisms, including annelid worms, cephalopods, tanner crabs, shrimps, and bony fishes. Invertebrates comprise a greater proportion of the diet than fishes in juveniles below 1 m.

[tpl]Nofootnotes|article|date=March 2009[/tpl]Bernd Aldenhoff (14 June 1908 in Duisburg[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]8 October 1959 in München) was a German Heldentenor.
He was born in 1908 in Duisburg and was raised in an orphanage in the Rhineland. Despite his humble beginnings, he managed to secure an engagement in the Cologne Opera chorus. While in Cologne he continued his vocal studies with Professor Lenz and was eventually promoted to soloist in the Cologne theater.
After engagements in Darmstadt and Erfurt, he first came to national prominence at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, Düsseldorf, where he sang from 1938 to 1944. During this period he made several guest appearances at the Oper Frankfurt, where he made a strong impression in the Verdi spinto roles of Manrico and Riccardo.
During the war he sang in a number of German provincial houses, and from 1944 to 1952 he was a member of the Dresden Semperoper, where he developed into a Heldentenor. He first appeared at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in 1951 as Siegfried in "Der Ring des Nibelungen" under both Knappertsbusch and Karajan, and returned there to repeat the role several times until 1957.
He appeared in Bavarian State Opera Munich between 1950 and 1958 in operas by Weber and Verdi, and in Richard Strauss's Die ägyptische Helena, and sang Siegfried in Götterdämmerung at Covent Garden in 1957. He made his Met debut as Tannhäuser, and also appeared at La Scala, the Paris Opéra and the Opernhaus Zürich.
Bernd Aldenhoff was not only one of the last heldentenors, but also one of the most interesting. Knappertsbusch called him the most "human heldentenor" of his time.
As an interpreter, Aldenhoff was, without a doubt, the most precise and sensitive Wagner tenor of his generation.
He died in Munich on 8 October 1959 at the peak of his career from food poisoning.

[[Callorhinchidae]]
CATEGORIES: Callorhinchidae

The Callorhinchidae (sometimes spelled "Callorhynchidae"), or plough-nose chimaeras, are a family of marine fish containing one genus, Callorhinchus. They are similar in form and habits to other chimaeras, but are distinguished by the presence of an elongated, flexible, fleshy snout, with a vague resemblance to a ploughshare. The snout is used to probe the sea bottom in search of the invertebrates and small fishes on which it preys.[tpl]cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Stevens, J. & Last, P.R.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|page= 69|isbn= 0-12-547665-5[/tpl] The remainder of the body is flat and compressed, often described as elongated. The mouth is just under this snout and the eyes are located high on top of the head. The usual color is black or brown, and, often a mixture between the two. Phylogenetically, they are the oldest group of living jawed chondrichthyes. They possess the same cartilaginous skeleton seen in sharks but are considered holocephali to distinguish them from the shark and ray categorization. [tpl]cite web|title=Elephant Shark Genome Sequencing|url=http://esharkgenome.imcb.a-star.edu.sg/[/tpl] Because of this, they provide a useful research organism for studying the early development of the jawed characteristic. Among the Chondrichthyes genome, Callorhinchus has the smallest genome. Because of this, it has been proposed to be used for entire genome sequencing to represent the cartilaginous fish class. [tpl]cite web|title=Elephant Shark Genome Sequencing|url=http://esharkgenome.imcb.a-star.edu.sg/[/tpl] They are considered to be a cross between a shark and a ray or skate, but can be distinguished from sharks because they possess an operculum over their gill slits. Additionally, their skin is smooth, not covered in tough scales, characteristic of the shark. While the shark's jaw is loosely attached to the skull, the Callorhinchidae family differ in that their jaws are fused to their skulls. Many classify the Callorhinchidae as a chimeric species due to their shared characteristics of both the sharks and rays.[tpl]cite web|title=Chimaerids, elephant fish and ghost sharks|url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/enviro/fish/chimaeri.htm|publisher=Sea Friends|accessdate=8 October 2013[/tpl] They are found in muddy and sandy substrates of the ocean bottom, where they filter feed, with small shellfish making up the bulk of their diet. They have broad flat teeth that have adapted for this type of eating habit, two pair that reside in the upper jaw and one pair in the lower jaw.  In addition to its utilization for feeding, the trunk of the Callorhinchus fish can sense movement and electric fields, allowing them to locate their prey.[tpl]cite web|title=Elephant Fish: Callorhinchus Milii|url=http://fishindex.blogspot.com/2009/11/elephant-fish-callorhinchus-	milii.html|publisher=Fish Index|accessdate=8 October 2013[/tpl]  They possess large pectoral fins, believed to aid in moving swiftly through the water. They also have two dorsal fins spaced widely apart, which help identify the species in the open ocean.  The average length of the fish is estimated to be 70 cm with a maximum length of 130 cm. Average maturation time is 2–3 years, and the average lifespan is about 15 years. This is considered a long maturation span, relative to the Chondricthyes.[tpl]cite web|last=Luna|first=Susan|title=Callorhinchus callorynchus  (Linnaeus, 1758): Plownose chimaera|url=http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=8399|publisher=English Fish Base|accessdate=8 October 2013[/tpl]

Two years earlier, Sun Quan attempted to take control of Hefei fortress, but failed due to a sudden plague and the staunch resistance put up by Cao Cao's forces under Zhang Liao. Since then, Cao Cao had been making preparations for a counterattack on Sun Quan, and he personally led his navy to Ruxu to fight a decisive battle.

The sharpnose stingray (Dasyatis acutirostra) is a little-known species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, found off southern Japan and in the East China Sea. With a rounded pectoral fin disc and a long, projecting snout, D. acutirostra resembles (and was historically confused with) the smaller pale-edged stingray (D. zugei). A number of characteristics differentiate this species from D. zugei, including larger eyes and the absence of a dorsal fin fold on the tail. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as its restricted distribution renders it vulnerable to increases in fishing pressure.

CATEGORIES: Dasyatis, Animals described in 1841

The red stingray (Dasyatis akajei) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, found in the northwestern Pacific Ocean off Japan, Korea, and China, and possibly elsewhere. It primarily inhabits shallow, sandy habitats close to shore, and has been known to enter brackish water. The red stingray has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc and gains its common name from its bright orange-red underside; there may also be patches of orange at various spots on its upper surface. Most individuals are no more than [tpl]convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long.
Feeding mainly on crustaceans and bony fishes, the red stingray plays a key ecological role as an apex predator in its environment. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to 1 or up to 10 pups at a time. The red stingray is valued as food in Japan; large numbers are caught as bycatch and brought to market, which has seemingly led to a population decline in this unprolific species. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Near Threatened.

CATEGORIES: Fish of Australia, Neotrygon, Animals described in 1987

The plain maskray or brown stingray (Neotrygon annotata) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. It is found in shallow, soft-bottomed habitats off northern Australia. Reaching [tpl]convert|24|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in width, this species has a diamond-shaped, grayish green pectoral fin disc. Its short, whip-like tail has alternating black and white bands and fin folds above and below. There are short rows of thorns on the back and the base of the tail, but otherwise the skin is smooth. While this species possesses the dark mask-like pattern across its eyes common to its genus, it is not ornately patterned like other maskrays.
Benthic in nature, the plain maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, and to a lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females producing litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.

The Colares stingray, Dasyatis colarensis, is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, native to the shallow brackish waters of the Amazon River estuary in northern Brazil. This species inhabits inshore bays during the dry season and moves away from the coast in the rainy season. It is characterized by a rhomboid pectoral fin disk, elongated snout, and a dark band on the lower lip. A fairly large species, males and females attain disk widths of [tpl]convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|91|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] respectively. Females give birth to 1–4 young, possibly annually. Colares stingrays are both targeted and caught as bycatch by Brazilian artisanal and commercial fisheries; these pressures coupled with its small range and slow reproductive rate has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list this species as Vulnerable.

[[Lexical field theory]]
CATEGORIES: Lexicology, Semantics

Lexical field theory, or word-field theory, was introduced on March 12, 1931 by the German linguist Jost Trier. Trier argued that words acquired their meaning through their relationships to other words within the same word-field. An extension of the sense of one word narrows the meaning of neighbouring words, with the words in a field fitting neatly together like a mosaic. If a single word undergoes a semantic change, then the whole structure of the lexical field changes.
Trier's theory assumes that lexical fields are easily definable closed sets,David Kronenfeld and Gabriella Rundblad in Regine Eckardt, Klaus von Heusinger, Christoph Schwarze, Words in Time, Walter de Gruyter, 2003, p68. ISBN 3-11-017675-0 with no overlapping meanings or gaps. These assumptions have been questioned and the theory has been modified since its original formulation.Richard M.

[[Diamond stingray]]

CATEGORIES: Dasyatis, Fish of the Gulf of California, Western North American coastal fauna, Western Central American coastal fauna, Galápagos Islands coastal fauna, Animals described in 1880

The diamond stingray (Dasyatis dipterura) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. It is found in the coastal waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to northern Chile, and around the Galápagos and Hawaiian Islands. This bottom-dweller generally inhabits sandy or muddy flats near rocky reefs and kelp forests, to a depth of [tpl]convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], though off Hawaii it may range considerably deeper. As its common name suggests, this species has an angular, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc that is plain brown or gray above, with rows of tubercles along the midline and on the "shoulders". The long, whip-like tail has both dorsal and ventral fin folds, which distinguish this ray from the closely similar longtail stingray (D. longa). It typically grows to [tpl]convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] across.
When searching for food, diamond stingrays may form groups of up to hundreds of individuals. It is most active at night and preys mainly on burrowing invertebrates and small bony fishes, which are extracted from the bottom via suction or digging. This species is aplacental viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their yolk supply, they are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear 1–4 pups every summer in estuaries; mating is followed by a ten-month period of either sperm storage or arrested embryonic development, after which the embryos rapidly mature over 2–3 months. The slowest-growing stingray known, this species is not resilient against fishing pressure. It is caught for food by artisanal fishers in Latin America, particularly in Mexico where it is one of the most economically important rays. This has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in Mexico by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the species as a whole is listed as Data Deficient. Though innocuous towards humans, the diamond stingray's long, venomous tail spine is potentially dangerous.

[[Estuary stingray]]
CATEGORIES: Dasyatis, Fish of Australia, Animals described in 1908, Endemic fauna of Australia

The estuary stingray (Dasyatis fluviorum), also called the estuary stingaree or brown stingray, is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. Endemic to eastern Australia, it typically inhabits shallow, mangrove-lined tidal rivers, estuaries, and bays in southern Queensland and New South Wales. This yellow-brown to olive ray grows to at least [tpl]convert|93|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] across. It has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc and a mostly smooth, whip-like tail bearing both dorsal and ventral fin folds. It can additionally be identified by its long, narrow nostrils and the row of thorns along the midline of its back.
While the estuary stingray has gained infamy for consuming farmed shellfish such as oysters, it mainly feeds on crustaceans and polychaete worms. It is aplacental viviparous, with the unborn young sustained to term by maternal histotroph ("uterine milk"). Once common, this species has apparently declined across much of its range, likely from a combination of habitat degradation, mortality from commercial and recreational fishing, and persecution by shellfish farmers. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.

[[Niger stingray]]
CATEGORIES: Dasyatis, Animals described in 1962

The Niger stingray or smooth freshwater stingray, Dasyatis garouaensis, is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, native to rivers in Nigeria and Cameroon. Attaining a width of [tpl]convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], this species can be distinguished by its thin, almost circular pectoral fin disk, slightly projecting snout tip, and mostly smooth skin with small or absent dermal denticles. The Niger stingray feeds on aquatic insect larvae and is ovoviviparous. The long stinging spine on the tail of this ray can inflict a painful wound. It has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as its numbers are declining in some areas and it faces heavy fishing pressure and habitat degradation.

[[Sharpsnout stingray]]

CATEGORIES: Dasyatis, Animals described in 1948

The sharpsnout stingray or wingfin stingray, Dasyatis geijskesi, is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, found from off Venezuela to northern Brazil. It inhabits shallow, brackish water, shifting towards the coast in the dry season and away from it in the rainy season. Typically measuring [tpl]convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] across, this dark brown ray is easily identifiable by its long, projecting snout and elongated, acutely pointed pelvic fins. Its diet consists of bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females bearing 1–3 pups annually. Naturally uncommon and slow-reproducing, the sharpnose stingray is under pressure by both artisanal and commercial fisheries, leading the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Near Threatened.

Gardner Quincy Colton (February 17, 1814, Georgia, Vermont – August 9, 1898, Rotterdam) was an American showman, lecturer, and former medical student who pioneered the use of nitrous oxide in dentistry.
After making $535 from his first public demonstration of nitrous oxide, Colton left medical school to travel the country giving lectures and presentations.  On December 10, 1844, he gave a performance in Hartford, Connecticut, at which one of his audience volunteers injured his leg, but did not feel the pain because of the effects of the gas.  Connecticut dentist Horace Wells was in attendance, realized the possibilities of using nitrous oxide in dental surgery, and obtained a supply of the gas from Colton.
In 1849, Gardner Colton went to California, where his brother Walter Colton was alcalde of Monterey, to join the California Gold Rush.  He was unsuccessful in finding gold, and Colton returned to the East.  In partnership with two dentists, Colton set up the Colton Dental Association, which promoted the use of nitrous oxide in dental procedures and became a thriving business.  Between 1864 and 1897, Colton and his associates used nitrous oxide in tens of thousands of tooth extractions.

[[Longnose stingray]]
CATEGORIES: Dasyatis, Animals described in 1801

The longnose stingray, Dasyatis guttata, is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, native to the western Atlantic Ocean from the southern Gulf of Mexico to Brazil. Found in coastal waters no deeper than [tpl]convert|36|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], this demersal species favors muddy or sandy habitats. The longnose stingray is characterized by its angular, rhomboid pectoral fin disc, moderately projecting snout, and whip-like tail with a dorsal keel and ventral fin fold. It typically grows to [tpl]convert|1.25|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] across and is brownish above and light-colored below.
Longnose stingrays feed mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates and small bony fishes. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females bearing two litters of 1–2 pups per year. The young are born in relatively fresh water, move into saltier water as juveniles, and then back into fresher water as adults. This species is valued by commercial and recreational fishers in many parts of its range, and utilized for meat, gelatin, oil, and even the aquarium trade. However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough specific information on these activities to assess its conservation status.

The groovebelly stingray, Dasyatis hypostigma, called the butter stingray by fishery workers,[tpl]cite journal |author=Ribeiro, L., G. Rodrigues and G.W. Nunan |title=First record of a pregnant female of Dasyatis hypostigma, with description of the embryos |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |year=2006 |volume=75 |pages=219–221 |doi=10.1007/s10641-006-0007-3 |issue=2[/tpl] is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. It is found over sandy or muddy bottoms in shallow coastal waters off southern Brazil, and probably Uruguay and Argentina. The groovebelly stingray can be distinguished by a prominent "W"-shaped furrow on its underside behind the last pair of gill slits, as well as completely smooth skin in all but the largest individuals. It reaches a maximum known width of [tpl]convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. This species is aplacental viviparous, with one observed female gestating two young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the conservation status of the groovebelly stingray; the main threat to its population is likely bycatch mortality from shrimp trawlers, although habitat degradation is also a concern.
