CATEGORIES: Ancient Rome, Roman patricians, Social classes in ancient Rome, Social groups

The term patrician ([tpl]lang-la|patricius[/tpl], [tpl]lang-el|πατρίκιος[/tpl], patrikios) originally referred to a group of ruling class families in ancient Rome, including both their natural and adopted members. In the late Roman Empire, the class was broadened to include high administrative officials, and after the fall of the Western Empire it remained a high honorary title in the Byzantine Empire. Medieval patrician classes were once again formally defined groups of leading burgess families in many medieval Italian republics, such as  Venice and Genoa, and subsequently "patrician" became a vaguer term used for aristocrats and the higher bourgeoisie in many countries.

Moss Fotballklubb is a Norwegian football club, founded on August 28, 1906. They currently play in the Second Division, the third highest division in the Norwegian football league system. They played in the Norwegian Premier League between 1937-1939, 1953-1954, 1977-1985 (9 seasons), 1987-1990 (4 seasons), 1996 and 1998-2002. The club came close to earning promotion to the top flight in 2005, but lost the play-off against Molde.
Moss play their home games at Melløs stadion, which has a capacity of around 10 000. Because of national rules of professional license for top clubs in Norway, the stadium has only being certified for 3085 spectators. Built in 1939, it has remained the club's home ground ever since. The record attendance is 10,085, set in 2003 against rivals Fredrikstad. A higher attendance may have been achieved in 1976 in a match against Odd, but no precise figure exists for this match because the gates broke down after around 9500 spectators had shown up.

Mifepristone (or RU-486) is a synthetic steroid compound with both antiprogesterone and antiglucocorticoid properties. The compound is a 19-nor steroid with substitutions at positions C11 and C17 (17 beta-hydroxy-11 beta-phenyl 17 alpha-1-propynylestra-4,9-dien-3-one), which antagonizes cortisol action competitively at the receptor level.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gallagher P, Young AH | title = Mifepristone (RU-486) treatment for depression and psychosis: a review of the therapeutic implications | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–42 | date=March 2006 | pmid = 19412444 | pmc = 2671735 | doi = [/tpl]
Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist used as an abortifacient in the first months of pregnancy, and in smaller doses as an emergency contraceptive. Mifepristone is also a powerful glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, and has occasionally been used in refractory Cushing's Syndrome (due to ectopic/neoplastic ACTH/Cortisol secretion). During early trials, it was known as RU-38486 or simply RU-486, its designation at the Roussel Uclaf company, which designed the drug. The drug was initially made available in France, and other countries then followed—often amid controversy. It is marketed under tradenames Korlym and Mifeprex, according to FDA Orange Book.
Mifepristone was the first antiprogestin to be developed and it has been evaluated extensively for its use as an abortifacient. The original target for the research group, however, was the discovery and development of compounds with antiglucocorticoid properties.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hazra BG, Pore VS | title = Mifepristone (RU-486), the recently developed antiprogesterone drug and its analogues. | journal = J Indian Inst Sci. | year = 2001 | volume = 81 | pages = 287–98.[/tpl] It is these antiglucocorticoid properties that are of great interest in the treatment of severe mood disorders and psychosis.

[[Knaster–Tarski theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Order theory, Fixed points (mathematics), Fixed-point theorems, Theorems in the foundations of mathematics, Articles containing proofs

In the mathematical areas of order and lattice theory, the Knaster–Tarski theorem, named after Bronisław Knaster and Alfred Tarski, states the following:
It was Tarski who stated the result in its most general form,[tpl]cite journal | author=Alfred Tarski | url=http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1103044538 | title=A lattice-theoretical fixpoint theorem and its applications | journal = Pacific Journal of Mathematics | volume=5:2 | year=1955 | pages=285–309[/tpl] and so the theorem is often known as Tarski's fixed point theorem. Some time earlier, Knaster and Tarski established the result for the special case where L is the lattice of subsets of a set, the power set lattice.[tpl]cite journal | author=B. Knaster | title=Un théorème sur les fonctions d'ensembles | journal=Ann. Soc. Polon. Math. | year=1928 | volume=6 | pages=133–134[/tpl] With A. Tarski.
The theorem has important applications in formal semantics of programming languages and abstract interpretation.
A kind of converse of this theorem was proved by Anne C. Davis: If every order preserving function f : L → L on a lattice L has a fixed point, then L is a complete lattice.[tpl]cite journal | author=Anne C.

Guillaume de Machaut (sometimes spelled Machault) (c. 1300 – April 1377) was a medieval French poet and composer. He is one of the earliest composers on whom significant biographical information is available. According to Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, Machaut was "the last great poet who was also a composer". Well into the 15th century, Machaut's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including Geoffrey Chaucer.
Machaut  composed in a wide range of styles and forms. He is a part of the musical movement known as the ars nova. Machaut helped develop the motet and secular song forms (particularly the lai and the formes fixes: rondeau, virelai and ballade). Machaut wrote the Messe de Nostre Dame, the earliest known complete setting of the Ordinary of the Mass attributable to a single composer.

[[Oramics]]
CATEGORIES: Graphical sound

Oramics is a drawn sound technique designed in 1957 by musician Daphne Oram. The machine was further developed in 1962 after receiving a grant from the Gulbenkian Foundation.  The technique, similar to Yevgeny Sholpo's "Variophone", involves drawing on 35mm film strips to control the sound produced.
Oram's composition machine consisted of a large rectangular metal frame, providing a table-like surface traversed by ten synchronised strips of clear, sprocketed 35mm film.  The musician drew shapes on the film to create a mask, which modulated the light received by photocells.  Although the output from the machine was monophonic, the sounds could be added to multitrack tapes to provide more texture.
The original machine is exhibited at the Science Museum in London from 29 July 2011 to 31 December 2013.
The technique has similarities to that used by Scottish filmmaker Norman McLaren, some of whose films featured sounds created by drawing or printing various patterns, such as triangles and circles, along the optical soundtrack area of the film.
Oramics was also the name used by Oram to refer to her studio and business interests generally.

[[Biculturalism]]
CATEGORIES: Cross-cultural studies, Political terminology in Canada, Multiculturalism

Biculturalism in sociology involves two originally distinct cultures in some form of co-existence.
A policy recognizing, fostering or encouraging biculturalism typically emerges in countries that have emerged from a history of national or ethnic conflict in which neither side has gained complete victory.  This condition usually arises as a consequence of settlement by colonists.  Resulting conflicts may take place  either between colonisers and indigenous peoples (as in Fiji) and/or between rival groups of colonisers (note the case of South Africa).  A deliberate policy of biculturalism influences the structures and decisions of governments to ensure that they allocate political and economic power and influence equitably between people and/or groups identified with the opposite sides of the cultural divide. 
Examples include the conflicts between Anglophone and Francophone  Canadians, between Māori and Pākehā New Zealanders and between Anglophone White South Africans and Boers.
The term biculturalism was originally adopted in the Canadian context, most notably by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963-1969), which recommended that Canada become officially bilingual.  Because the word "biculturalism"  suggests, more or less explicitly, that only two cultures merit formal recognition, advocates of multiculturalism (for which it formed a precedent) may regard bicultural outlooks as inadequately progressive in comparison.  This was the case in Canada were Ukrainian Canadians activists such as Jaroslav Rudnyckyj and Paul Yuzyk and other "third force" successfully pressured the Canadian government to adopt multiculturalism as official policy in 1971.
In the context of relations between the cultures of deafness and non-deafness, people find the word "biculturalism" less controversial because the distinction (between spoken language and sign language) commonly seems like a genuine binary distinction – transcending the distinctions between various spoken languages.
In the context of the United States of America, bicultural distinctions have traditionally existed between America and Mexico, and between the White and the African American population of the United States.
As different cases of biculturalism with some sort of formal recognition, note:
Biculturalism can also refer to individuals, refer to bicultural identity.

[[Eadbald of Kent]]

Eadbald ([tpl]lang-ang|Ēadbald[/tpl]) was King of Kent from 616 until his death in 640. He was the son of King Æthelberht and his wife Bertha, a daughter of the Merovingian king Charibert.S. E. Kelly, Eadbald, Oxford Online Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 Æthelberht made Kent the dominant force in England during his reign and became the first Anglo-Saxon king to convert to Christianity from Anglo-Saxon paganism. Eadbald's accession was a significant setback for the growth of the church, since he retained his indigenous paganism and did not convert to Christianity for at least a year, and perhaps for as much as eight years. He was ultimately converted by either Laurentius or Justus, and separated from his first wife, who had been his stepmother, at the insistence of the church. Eadbald's second wife was Emma, who may have been a Frankish princess. She bore him two sons, Eormenred and Eorcenberht, and a daughter, Eanswith.
Eadbald's influence was less than his father's, but Kent was powerful enough to be omitted from the list of kingdoms dominated by Edwin of Northumbria. Edwin's marriage to Eadbald's sister, Æthelburg, established a good relationship between Kent and Northumbria which appears to have continued into Oswald's reign. When Æthelburg fled to Kent on Edwin's death in about 633, she sent her children to Francia for safety, fearing the intrigues of both Eadbald and Oswald. The Kentish royal line made several strong diplomatic marriages over the succeeding years, including the marriage of Eanflæd, Eadbald's niece, to Oswiu, and of Eorcenberht to Seaxburh, daughter of King Anna of East Anglia.
Eadbald died in 640, and was succeeded by Eorcenberht. Eormenred may have been his oldest son, but if he reigned at all it was only as a junior king.

Plautdietsch, or Mennonite Low German, was originally a Low Prussian variety of East Low German, with Dutch influence, that developed in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Vistula delta area of Royal Prussia. The word is the form, in that language, of Plattdeutsch (Low German). Plaut is the same word as German platt or Dutch plat, meaning 'flat' or 'low' (referring to the plains of northern Germany), and the name Dietsch corresponds etymologically to Dutch Duits and German Deutsch (both meaning "German"), which originally meant 'vernacular language' in all the continental West Germanic languages.
The language (or groups of dialects of Low German) is spoken by over 300,000 Mennonites (Russian Mennonites), most notably in the Latin American countries of Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay,[tpl]cite web|url=http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pdt |title=The Linguist List: Plautdietsch |publisher=Linguistlist.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-05[/tpl] Honduras, Belize, and Argentina, as well as in the United States and Canada (particularly Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario). They are members of a religious group that originally fled from the Netherlands and Belgium in the 16th century to escape persecution and eventually resettled in these areas. They introduced and developed their particular East Low German dialect, the so-called Weichselplatt, while they came to and lived in the Vistula (Weichsel) delta area, beginning in the early-to-mid 16th century. These colonists from the Low Countries were especially welcome there because of their experience with and knowledge of land reclaiming and making polders. As Mennonites they kept their own (primarily Dutch and Low-German) identity, using their Dutch/Low German language.Welschen (2000-2005), 49-50; De Smet 1983. Their East Low German dialect is still classified as Low Prussian, or simply Prussian. Mennonites, including Russian Mennonites, trace their roots to the Low Countries and north Germany, southern Germany and Switzerland.
Beginning in the late 18th century, the expanding Russian Empire invited Germans and many from the Kingdom of Prussia, including many Mennonites, left and created new colonies north of the Black Sea in an area that Russia had recently acquired in one of the Russo-Turkish Wars but which is now situated in present-day Ukraine as well as other countries. Many Mennonites migrated to Canada, the United States, and a great majority took to Latin America – especially southern Brazil, Mexico and Paraguay; most of them live as rural settlers and have added some Spanish and Portuguese words to their own language due to the strong influence of the cultures surrounding them in those regions.
Today Plautdietsch is spoken in two major dialects that trace their division to Ukraine. These two dialects are split between the New Colony and Old Colony Mennonites. Many younger Russian Mennonites in Canada and the United States today speak only English. For example, Homer Groening, the father of Matt Groening (creator of The Simpsons), spoke Plautdietsch as a child in Saskatchewan in the 1920s, but his son Matt never learned the language.
In 2007, Mexican filmmaker Carlos Reygadas directed the film Stellet Lijcht (Silent Light), set in a Mennonite community in Chihuahua, Mexico. Most of the film's dialogue is in Plautdietsch.

[[Culmination]]

CATEGORIES: Celestial mechanics, Spherical astronomy

In astronomy, the culmination of a planet, star, constellation, etc. is the altitude (or elevation angle) reached when the object transits over an observer's meridian[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl].
During a sidereal day, an astronomical object will cross the meridian twice: once at its upper culmination, when it is at its highest point as seen from the earth, and once at its lower culmination, its lowest point.  Often, culmination is used to mean upper culmination[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl].
The altitude of an object in degrees at its upper culmination is equal to (90 − L + D), where L is the observer's latitude and D is the object's declination.
Generally, the sun is visible at its upper culmination (at noon) and not visible at its lower culmination (at midnight). But during winter near the North Pole, the sun is below the horizon at both of its culminations.  In most of the northern hemisphere, Polaris, the "North Star", and the rest of the stars of the constellation Ursa Minor can be seen to rotate around the celestial pole and are all visible at both culminations, as long as the sky is dark enough.  Such stars, which never set at the observer's location, are described as being circumpolar.
These three examples illustrate all three cases, dependent on the latitude of the observer and the declination of the celestial body.
The third case applies for objects in a part of the full sky equal to the cosine of the latitude (at the equator it applies for all objects, the sky turns around the horizontal north-south line; at the poles it applies for none, the sky turns around the vertical line). The first and second case each apply for half of the remaining sky.
The time from one upper culmination to the next is approximately 24 hours, and from an upper to a lower culmination is approximately 12 hours. The movement of the Earth on its orbit and proper motion of the celestial body affect the time between successive upper culminations of the body.  Because of the proper and improper motions of the sun, one solar day (the time between two upper culminations of the sun) is longer than one sidereal day (the time between two like culminations of any fixed star)[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl]. The mean difference is 1/365.24219 because the Earth needs 365.24219 days for its orbit around the Sun. (see also sidereal day)

Prior to the twentieth century, leaders such as Prince Hall, Martin Delany, Edward Wilmot Blyden, and Henry Highland Garnet advocated the involvement of the African diaspora in African affairs. Garvey was unique in advancing a Pan-African philosophy to inspire a global mass movement and economic empowerment focusing on Africa known as Garveyism. Promoted by the UNIA as a movement of African Redemption, Garveyism would eventually inspire others, ranging from the Nation of Islam to the Rastafari movement (which proclaims Garvey as a prophet).
Garveyism intended persons of African ancestry in the diaspora to "redeem" the nations of Africa and for the European colonial powers to leave the continent. His essential ideas about Africa were stated in an editorial in the Negro World entitled "African Fundamentalism", where he wrote: "Our union must know no clime, boundary, or nationality… to let us hold together under all climes and in every country…"[tpl]cite book|title=The philosophy and opinions of Marcus Garvey or Africa for the Africans|last=Garvey|first=Marcus|authorlink=|coauthors=Jacques-Garvey, Amy (ed.)|year=1986|publisher=Majority Press|location=Dover (Massachusetts)|isbn=0-912469-24-2|page=163[/tpl]

NMEA 0183 is a combined electrical and data specification for communication between marine electronics such as echo sounder, sonars, anemometer, gyrocompass, autopilot, GPS receivers and many other types of instruments. It has been defined by, and is controlled by, the National Marine Electronics Association. It replaces the earlier NMEA 0180 and NMEA 0182 standards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kh-gps.de/nmea.faq |title=The NMEA FAQ |author=Peter Bennett |date=Sep 15, 1997 |accessdate=2013-10-21[/tpl] In marine applications, it is slowly being phased out in favor of the newer NMEA 2000 standard.
The electrical standard that is used is EIA-422, although most hardware with NMEA-0183 outputs are also able to drive a single EIA-232 port. Although the standard calls for isolated inputs and outputs, there are various series of hardware that do not adhere to this requirement.
The NMEA 0183 standard uses a simple ASCII, serial communications protocol that defines how data are transmitted in a "sentence" from one "talker" to multiple "listeners" at a time.  Through the use of intermediate expanders, a talker can have a unidirectional conversation with a nearly unlimited number of listeners, and using multiplexers, multiple sensors can talk to a single computer port.
At the application layer, the standard also defines the contents of each sentence (message) type, so that all listeners can parse messages accurately.

Dom Duarte Pio, Prince Royal of Portugal, Duke of Braganza (born 15 May 1945), is the pretender to the former Portuguese throne, as the head of the House of Braganza. The Miguelist Braganzas, to whom Duarte Pio belongs as great-grandson of King Miguel I, were originally just a cadet branch of the House of Braganza. With the extinction of male-line dynasts descended from Queen Maria II in 1932, King Miguel's descendants became the only Braganzas left (the Brazilian branch having gone extinct in 1921) and the closest heirs to the Portuguese throne.
The Duke often represents Portugal in cultural matters outside of the country, and has been received by foreign heads of state. Duarte Pio is also a figure within the European network of royal houses, often being invited to various foreign royal events. Despite his support for a monarchical government and widespread recognition as heir to the throne, there are no serious movements or parties that support restoration of the monarchy.
In 1995, the Duke married Isabel Inês de Castro Curvelo de Herédia, a Portuguese businesswoman and descendant of lesser Portuguese nobility. Their marriage was the first marriage of a Portuguese royal to happen in Portuguese territory since the marriage of King Carlos I, Duarte Pio's second cousin once removed, and Princess Amélie of Orléans, in 1886. The Duke and Duchess have three children, thus continuing the line of the Braganzas, as neither of the Duke's brothers have married or had children.

Adolphe Niel (4 October 1802 – 13 August 1869) was a French Army general and statesman, also Marshal of France.
He was born at Muret, Haute-Garonne and entered the École Polytechnique in 1821. Niel entered the engineer school at Metz, became lieutenant in the Engineers Corps in 1827, and captain in 1833. At the storming of Constantine, Algeria, Niel led the engineer detachment with one of the storming parties, and his conduct gained for him the rank of chef de bataillon in 1837. Niel was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1840 and to colonel in 1846. His next war service was as Chief of Staff to General Vaillant during the 1849 siege of Rome, after which he was made general of brigade and director of engineer services at headquarters.
In 1851, Niel became a member of the Committee of Fortifications. He became a member of the council of state in 1852 and in 1853 was promoted to general of the division. In the first part of the Crimean War, Niel was employed in the expedition to the Baltic Sea and directed engineering operations against Bomarsund. Early in 1855 Niel was sent to the Crimea, where he succeeded General Bizot as chief of engineers. For some years Niel had been the most trusted military adviser of Napoleon III, and he was now empowered to advise the generals on the spot in accordance with the wishes of the sovereign and the home government.
Niel managed to carry out this delicate and difficult task with as much success as could be expected, and he directed siege operations at the Battle of Malakoff.  His reward was the grand cross of the Légion d'honneur. From 1855 to 1859 Niel was employed at headquarters and also served in the French Senate. In the war against the Austrians, Niel commanded the IV Corps and took part in the Battle of Magenta and the Battle of Solferino. Niel was made a marshal of France on the field at Solferino.
After he served for some years in a home command, Niel became minister of war and held the position from 1867 to 1869. In this capacity he drafted and began to carry out a far-reaching scheme of army reform, based on universal service and the automatic creation of large reserves which needed only time to mature. Under his system, those men who had purchased exemption from conscription into the army would nonetheless be called up into a new service, the Garde Mobile. He also was able to rearm the whole of the army with the chassepot rifle, but not the Garde Mobile. He did not live to complete the development of his system.
Niel died in Paris during an operation for a bladder stone, and a year later the Franco-Prussian War destroyed the old imperial army upon which the new formations were to have been grafted.

[[Dao (sword)]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese swords, Chinese swordsmanship, Single-edged swords, Chinese inventions

Dao is a category of single-edge Chinese sword primarily used for slashing and chopping (sabers), often called a broadsword in English translation because some varieties have wide blades. In China, the dao is known as one of the four major weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword), and referred to as "The General of All Weapons". Dao is actually a generic word used to denote any single-edged, bladed cutting or slicing tools, but in common, everyday usage means knife. The weapon, also known as dan dao (單刀, "single knife") when just one is used, is thereby thought to be an adaptation of the kitchen knives common to Chinese cuisine.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] Dao also appears in the names of such polearms as the pudao and guan dao, due to them being single edged blades.

John Pierpont "J. P." Morgan (April 17, 1837 – March 31, 1913) was an American financier, banker, philanthropist and art collector who dominated corporate finance and industrial consolidation during his time. In 1892 Morgan arranged the merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric. After financing the creation of the Federal Steel Company, he merged in 1901 with the Carnegie Steel Company and several other steel and iron businesses, including Consolidated Steel and Wire Company owned by William Edenborn, to form the United States Steel Corporation.
Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont "Jack" Morgan, Jr., and bequeathing his mansion and large book collections to The Morgan Library & Museum in New York.
At the height of Morgan's career during the early 1900s, he and his partners had financial investments in many large corporations and had significant influence over the nation's high finance. He directed the banking coalition that stopped the Panic of 1907.  He was the leading financier of the Progressive Era, and his dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform American business.

Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is a species of pine native to Europe and Asia, ranging from Scotland, Ireland and Portugal in the west, east to eastern Siberia, south to the Caucasus Mountains, and north to well inside the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia. In the north of its range, it occurs from sea level to 1,000 m, while in the south of its range it is a high altitude mountain tree, growing at 1,200–2,600 m altitude. It is readily identified by its combination of fairly short, blue-green leaves and orange-red bark.Farjon, A. (2005). Pines Drawings and Descriptions of the Genus Pinus 2nd ed.

[[Service (economics)]]

CATEGORIES: Economics terminology, Goods, Services management and marketing, Marketing, Supply chain management terms, Services (economics)

In economics, a service is an intangible commodity. That is, services are an example of intangible economic goods.
Service provision is often an economic activity where the buyer does not generally, except by exclusive contract, obtain exclusive ownership of the thing purchased. The benefits of such a service, if priced, are held to be self-evident in the buyer's willingness to pay for it. Public services are those, that society (nation state, fiscal union, regional) as a whole pays for, through taxes and other means.
By composing and orchestrating the appropriate level of resources, skill, ingenuity, and experience for effecting specific benefits for service consumers, service providers participate in an economy without the restrictions of carrying inventory (stock) or the need to concern themselves with bulky raw materials. On the other hand, their investment in expertise does require consistent service marketing and upgrading in the face of competition.

[[Tiamat]]
CATEGORIES: Mesopotamian goddesses, Enûma Eliš, Sea and river goddesses, Creator goddesses

In Mesopotamian Religion (Sumerian, Assyrian, Akkadian and Babylonian), Tiamat is a chaos monster, a primordial goddess of the ocean, mating with Abzû (the god of fresh water) to produce younger gods. It is suggested that there are  two parts to the Tiamat mythos, the first in which Tiamat is 'creatrix', through a "Sacred marriage" between salt and fresh water, peacefully creating the cosmos through successive generations.  In the second "Chaoskampf" Tiamat is considered the monstrous embodiment of primordial chaos.[tpl]cite book |first=Stephanie |last=Dalley |title=Myths from Mesopotamia |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1987 |pages=329 [/tpl]  Although there are no early precedents for it, some sources identify her with images of a sea serpent or dragon.Such as [tpl]cite journal |first=Thorkild |last=Jacobsen |title=The Battle between Marduk and Tiamat |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=88 |issue=1 |year=1968 |pages=104–108 |jstor=597902 [/tpl] In the Enûma Elish, the Babylonian epic of creation, she gives birth to the first generation of deities; her husband, Aspu, later makes war upon them and is killed.  When she, too, wars upon her husband's murderers, she is then slain by Ea's son, the storm-god Marduk. The heavens and the earth are formed from her divided body.
Tiamat was later known as Thalattē (as a variant of thalassa, the Greek word for "sea") in the Hellenistic Babylonian Berossus' first volume of universal history. It is thought that the name of Tiamat was dropped in secondary translations of the original religious texts (written in the East Semitic Akkadian language) because some Akkadian copyists of Enûma Elish substituted the ordinary word for "sea" for Tiamat, since the two names had become essentially the same due to association.Jacobsen 1968:105.

[[Competition]]

CATEGORIES: Competition, Social events

Competition in biology, ecology, and sociology, is a contest between organisms, animals, individuals, groups, etc., for territory, a niche, or a location of resources, for resources and goods, mates, for prestige, recognition, awards, or group or social status, for leadership. Competition is the opposite of cooperation.competition, Encyclopædia Britannica Online edition. Retrieved March 6, 2012.Competition, Sociology guide It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared or which is desired individually but not in sharing and cooperation. Competition occurs naturally between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment.[ref]Keddy, P.A. 2001.
 Competition (2 nd edition) Kluwer, Dordrecht. 552 p.</ref> For example, animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other [[biological resources]]. Humans compete usually for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of [[wealth]], prestige, and [[celebrity|fame]]. Competition is also a major tenet of [[market economies]] and business is often associated with competition as most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers, and also competition inside a company is usually stimulated for meeting and reaching higher quality of services or products that the company produce or develop.

[[Closed class]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar

In linguistics, a closed class (or closed word class) is a word class to which no new items can normally be added, and that usually contains a relatively small number of items. Typical closed classes found in many languages are adpositions (prepositions and postpositions), determiners, conjunctions, and pronouns.http://strazny.com/encyclopedia/sample-function-words.html Closed class words
The concept of closed and open classes is related to the idea of functional and lexical categories of speech. An open class of speech, like a lexical category, is generally composed of the meaningful "'content' of the sentence"[tpl]cite book|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-470-65531-3|pages=51-52[/tpl]  such as a noun or verb, while a closed class, like a functional category, consists of the functional content of the sentence and provides grammatical information. 
Contrastingly, an open class offers possibilities for expansion. Typical open classes such as nouns and verbs can and do get new words often, through the usual means such as compounding, derivation, coining, borrowing, etc.
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/wordclas/wordclas.htm Both open and closed class words 
A closed class may get new items through these same processes, but the change takes much more time. The closed class is normally viewed as part of the core language and is not expected to change. Most readers can undoubtedly think of new nouns or verbs entering their lexicon, but it's very unlikely that they can recall any new prepositions or pronouns appearing in the same fashion.
Different languages have different word classes as open class and closed class – for example, in English, pronouns are closed class and verbs are open class (see for example the contentious topic of gender-neutral pronouns in English and how common verbing is), while in Japanese, pronouns are open class, while verbs are closed class – to form a new verb, one suffixes 〜する (-suru, "to do") to a noun – for example, "to exercise" is 運動する – "to do exercise".

[[Open class (linguistics)]]
CATEGORIES: Grammar

In linguistics, a word class may be either an open class or a closed class. Open classes accept the addition of new morphemes (words), through such processes as compounding, derivation, inflection, coining, and borrowing; closed classes generally do not.
Content words, or lexical words, (including nouns, verbs, adjectives, and most adverbs) are words that carry the content or the meaning of a sentence and are open-class words. Newly invented nouns, verbs, and adjectives are considered open-class words, and are always able to be used grammatically in a sentence.[tpl]cite book|last=Hoff|first=Erika|title=Language Development|year=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-133-93909-2|page=171[/tpl]  They contrast with function words, such as articles, prepositions, conjunctions, auxiliary verbs, and pronouns, which can be found in almost any utterance, no matter what it is about. Words in open classes (content/lexical words) carry the primary communicative force of an utterance. These words are usually variable in form (inflected), especially in inflecting languages. Their distribution is not definable by the grammar.
Typical open classes are the class of nouns, the class of verbs, the class of adjectives,http://strazny.com/encyclopedia/sample-function-words.html Open class words and the class of adverbs.http://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/wordclas/open.htm Open and Closed Word Classes However, this varies between languages; for example, in Japanese, pronouns form an open class (the distinction between nouns and pronouns is not always clear in Japanese), while verbs form a closed class. With a few exceptions, such as サボる (saboru, "to ditch class") and ぐぐる (guguru, "to google"), new "verbs" in Japanese are formed by appending する (suru, "to do") to a noun.
Open-class words are not considered part of the core language[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] and as such they can be changed, replaced or dropped from the common lexicon, which can encompass many thousands of them. For living languages, this change is noticeable within an individual lifespan, and usually faster. Closed-class words, on the other hand, are always relatively few and resistant to change. They are unproductively and are generally invariable in form (except demonstratives, modals and some pronouns).

[[Hammer Film Productions]]

Hammer Films is a film production company based in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1934, the company is best known for a series of Gothic "Hammer Horror" films made from the mid-1950s until the 1970s. Hammer also produced science fiction, thrillers, film noir and comedies[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]and in later years, television series. During its most successful years, Hammer dominated the horror film market, enjoying worldwide distribution and considerable financial success. This success was due, in part, to distribution partnerships with major United States studios, such as Warner Bros.
During the late 1960s and 1970s the saturation of the horror film market by competitors and the loss of American funding forced changes to the previously lucrative Hammer-formula, with varying degrees of success. The company eventually ceased production in the mid-1980s. In 2000, the studio  was bought by a consortium including advertising executive and art collector Charles Saatchi and publishing millionaires Neil Mendoza and William Sieghart.[tpl]cite news|first=John-Paul|last=Flintoff|title=The horror, the horror|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6886151.ece|work=The Sunday Times|accessdate=21 August 2010 | location=London | date=25 October 2009[/tpl] The company announced plans to begin making films again after this, but none were produced. 
In May 2007, the company behind the movies was sold again, this time to a consortium headed by Dutch media tycoon John de Mol, who announced plans to spend some $50m (£25m) on new horror films. The new owners also acquired the Hammer group's film library, consisting of 295 movies. Simon Oakes, who took over as CEO of Hammer, said: "Hammer is a great British brand - we intend to take it back into production and develop its global potential. The brand is still alive but no one has invested in it for a long time."[tpl]cite news|title=De Mol sinks fangs into Dracula|last=Fletcher|first=Richard|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2808756/De-Mol-sinks-fangs-into-Dracula.html|accessdate=3 November 2013|location=London|date=11 May 2007|page=3[/tpl] Since then it has produced the feature films Let Me In (2010), The Resident (2011), and The Woman In Black (2012).

Berryhill is a small unincorporated community  in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, west of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and about four square miles (10 km²) in area.  It is located south of the Arkansas River and north of West 41st Street South, and between South 71st West Avenue and South 47th West Avenue.
Berryhill has nine or ten churches, a store, businesses, creeks, and hills. The creeks tend to flow into Berryhill Creek before emptying into the Arkansas River near the railroad tracks off West 21st Street near South 57th West Avenue, in an area which will soon become part of the Gilcrease Expressway.  Most of the homes directly east of South 57th West Avenue and west of South 55th W. Avenue have already been demolished and the first phase, the Gilcrease Expressway Extension, has been finished for several years.
The most recognizable hill in the valley is Victory Hill, located just east and towering over the Berryhill Football Field. This hill is said to have significance to the earliest inhabitants of Berryhill. Cowbell Hill has been the scene of  repeated fatal car accidents for travellers on South 49th West Avenue. The most famous hill in Berryhill is Chandler Park. Located in Berryhill and next to Chandler Park was a Superfund clean-up site.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency set up monitors to record exposure atop school buildings at Berryhill.  The old refinery and the trash-to-energy plant between downtown Tulsa and Berryhill contribute as sources of pollution, although improved technologies promise less destruction to the environment of Berryhill than in the past.

Located on the eastern shore of Halifax Harbour, Dartmouth has been nicknamed the City of Lakes, after the large number of lakes located in the city.
On April 1, 1996, the provincial government amalgamated all the municipalities within the boundaries of Halifax County into a single-tier regional government named Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). While Dartmouth and its neighbouring city of Halifax, the town of Bedford and the Municipality of the County of Halifax were dissolved at this time, the former city forms part of the urban core of the larger regional municipality and is officially labelled the "capital district" by the HRM government. At the time that the City of Dartmouth was dissolved, the provincial government altered its status to a separate community to Halifax; however, its status as part of the metropolitan "Halifax" urban core existed prior to municipal reorganisation in 1996. Dartmouth is still the geographic name that is used by all levels of government for  mapping,  9-1-1, planning, and is recognised by the Halifax Regional Municipality as a place-name for civic addressing. The official place name did not change, due to the confusion with similar street names, planning set out by the "City of Dartmouth" and public pressure. Today the same development planning for Downtown Dartmouth and the rest of the community is still in force, as well as specific bylaws created prior to April 1, 1996.

Fort George (named after King George II of Great Britain) is the fortified summit of Citadel Hill, a National Historic Site of Canada in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. First established in 1749, as a counterbalance to the French stronghold of Louisbourg, which the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) returned to France, Halifax played a pivotal role over the next decade in the Anglo-French rivalry in the region.[tpl]cite book|last=Johnston|first=A.J.B.|title=Louisbourg: Past, Present, Future|year=2013|publisher=Nimbus Publishing[/tpl]  One historian calls that era Father Le Loutre's War. The various fortifications at Halifax were to protect the Protestant settlers against raids by the French, Acadians, and Wabanaki Confederacy (primarily the Mi'kmaq). Those fortifications, including the one at the summit of the hill, were successively rebuilt to defend the town from various enemies.
A series of four different defensive fortifications have occupied the summit of Citadel Hill since this time, with the construction and levelling resulting in the summit of the hill being dropped by ten to twelve metres. Whilst never attacked, the Citadel was long the keystone to the defence of the strategically important Halifax Harbour and its Royal Navy Dockyard.
Today the fort is operated by Parks Canada and is restored to the Victorian period. There are re-enactors of the famed 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot and the 78th Highlanders (Halifax Citadel) Pipe Band who were stationed at Halifax for almost three years (1869-1871).

[[Histrionic personality disorder]]

CATEGORIES: Cluster B personality disorders, Personality disorders, Psychiatric diagnosis, Women and psychology

Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is defined by the American Psychiatric Association as a personality disorder characterized by a pattern of excessive emotions and attention-seeking, including inappropriately seductive behavior and an excessive need for approval, usually beginning in early adulthood. People affected by HPD are lively, dramatic, vivacious, enthusiastic, and flirtatious. HPD affects four times as many women as men.[ref]
</ref> It has a [[prevalence]] of 2–3% in the general population and 10–15% in inpatient and outpatient mental health institutions.<ref name=dsmiv>[tpl]cite book|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=22&sectionid=1892638#4017|chapter=Chapter 16: Personality Disorders|title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2000[/tpl]</ref>
HPD lies in the dramatic cluster of personality disorders. People with HPD have a high need for attention, make loud and inappropriate appearances, exaggerate their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation. They may exhibit sexually provocative behavior, express strong emotions with an impressionistic style, and can be easily influenced by others. Associated features include egocentrism, self-indulgence, continuous longing for appreciation, and persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own needs.

A monastic grange was a manor or other centre of an outlying farming estate belonging to a monastery and used for food production in Great Britain, Ireland, or Austria. In France such a supporting satellite farm, often a replica on a reduced scale of the mother house, was a doyenné,Charles de la Roncière, "The aristocratic households of feudal France", in Georges Duby, ed. A History of Private Life: II. Revelations of the Medieval World 1988:42. which is to say, a "deanery" under the local guidance of a dean.

Joseph Beuys ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈjoːzɛf ˈbɔʏs[/tpl]; 12 May 1921 – 23 January 1986) was a German Fluxus, happening and performance artist as well as a sculptor, installation artist, graphic artist, art theorist and pedagogue of art.
His extensive work is grounded in concepts of humanism, social philosophy and anthroposophy; it culminates in his "extended definition of art" and the idea of social sculpture as a gesamtkunstwerk, for which he claimed a creative, participatory role in shaping society and politics. His career was characterized by passionate, even acrimonious public debate, but he is now regarded as one of the most influential artists of the second half of the 20th century.[tpl]cite book |last=Hopper |first=Kenneth |last2=Hopper |first2=William |title=The Puritan gift: triumph, collapse, and the revival of an American dream |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2007 |isbn=1-85043-419-0 |page=334[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Hughes |first=Robert |title=The Shock of the New |edition=revised |publisher=Alfred A.

He was the posthumous son of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany and Constance, Duchess of Brittany. As Geoffrey's son and heir he also was Earl of Richmond. Geoffrey was a son of Henry II of England, younger than Richard I but older than John. In 1190 Arthur was designated heir to the throne of England and its French territory by his uncle, Richard I,MP, Vol. II, 1190, p. 364. the intent being that Arthur would succeed Richard in preference to Richard's younger brother John.

The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was a proposal developed by the United Nations, which recommended a partition with Economic Union of Mandatory Palestine to follow the termination of the British Mandate. On 29 November 1947, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of the Plan as Resolution 181(II).[tpl]cite web |url= http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |title=A/RES/181(II) of 29 November 1947 |publisher=United Nations |year=1947  |accessdate=11 January 2012[/tpl]
The resolution recommended the creation of independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem. The Partition Plan, a four-part document attached to the resolution, provided for the termination of the Mandate, the progressive withdrawal of British armed forces and the delineation of boundaries between the two States and Jerusalem. Part I of the Plan stipulated that the Mandate would be terminated as soon as possible and the United Kingdom would withdraw no later than 1 August 1948. The new states would come into existence two months after the withdrawal, but no later than 1 October 1948. The Plan sought to address the conflicting objectives and claims of two competing movements: Arab nationalism in Palestine and Jewish nationalism, known as Zionism.[ref]William B. Quandt, Paul Jabber, Ann Mosely Lesch
The Politics of Palestinian Nationalism,University of California Press, 1973 p.7.[/ref]Part II. – Boundaries recommended in UNGA Res 181 Molinaro, Enrico The Holy Places of Jerusalem in Middle East Peace Agreements Page 78 The Plan also called for Economic Union between the proposed states, and for the protection of religious and minority rights.
The Plan was accepted by the Jewish public, except for its fringes, and by the Jewish Agency  despite its perceived limitations. With a few exceptions, the Arab leaders and governments rejected the plan of partition in the resolution and indicated an unwillingness to accept any form of territorial division. Their reason was that it violated the principles of national self-determination in the UN charter which  granted people the right to decide their own destiny.Sami Hadawi,Bitter Harvest: A Modern History of Palestine, Olive Branch Press, (1989)1991 p.76.
Immediately after adoption of the Resolution by the General Assembly, the civil war broke out. The partition plan was not implemented.

The United Nations established supervising and reporting agencies to monitor the established armistice lines.   In addition, discussions related to the armistice enforcement, led to the signing of the separate Tripartite Declaration of 1950 between the United States, Britain, and France. In it, they pledged to take action within and outside the United Nations to prevent violations of the frontiers or armistice lines. It also outlined their commitment to peace and stability in the area, their opposition to the use or threat of force, and reiterated their opposition to the development of an arms race. These lines held until the 1967 Six-Day War.

[[Autograph Records]]

CATEGORIES: American record labels, Record labels established in 1921, Record labels disestablished in 1926, Jazz record labels

Autograph Records was a United States record label of the 1920s.
Autograph was a small label, owned by Marsh Laboratories Incorporated of Chicago, Illinois. Marsh Laboratories in turn was owned by electrical engineer Orlando R. Marsh. Marsh made recordings by his own experimental methods, and therefore Autograph was the first US record label to release recordings made electrically with microphones, as opposed to the acoustical or mechanical method then still universally used.[tpl]cite book|last=Holmes|first=Thom|title=The Routledge guide to music technology|year= 2006|publisher=CRC Press|page=97[/tpl] Columbia Graphophone marketed electrical 12-inch in early 20s. According to Rust, Marsh's first electrical records were made in 1924, but it actually could have been earlier.Rust, Brian. "Autograph, a glimpse into the past." Storyville 1972; 40: 124-126.
It was reported in Time Magazine on April 28, 1923 that a device invented by Orlando R. Marsh was successfully used to make a recording of organ music, hitherto considered impossible. The article stated that Pietro Yon from New York City played his organ composition "Jesu Bambino" in Marsh's Chicago laboratory and that the reproduction was described as excellent. The article went on to say that this accomplishment appeared to open a new area for the phonograph."Music: Chicago". Time, Apr. 28, 1923
Brian Rust also reported that there was a note in the Talking Machine Journal for October 1924 indicating that "Orlando B. Marsh" had just moved to 78 East Jackson Boulevard. Marsh Laboratories became established on the seventh floor of the Lyon & Healy Building. This location attracted customers. In those days Lyon & Healy was a major music store selling sheet music, records, and musical instruments.Powell, James R., Jr., Randall G. Stehle, and Jonathan D. Powell. "Vintage microphones and the restoration of early Marsh Laboratories electrical 78-rpm recordings." ARSC Journal 2006; 37 (1): 36-47.
Today Autograph is best known for some of the fine jazz by artists in Chicago which was recorded on the label. The most famous of all are the duets by King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton. Autograph's best selling records, however, were the series of pipe organ solos by Jesse Crawford. Marsh's electrical process was the first to be able to capture an approximation of the range of the organ but it lacked bass in the tone mix.Sounds of American Organs
About the time that the Autograph records of Crawford were made, Jesse Crawford accepted an offer to be organist at the Paramount Theater (New York City). Once there, Victor Talking Machine Company became interested in having Crawford make recordings for them, first by the acoustical process. Later, Victor recorded Crawford by the Western Electric licensed process first used by them in 1925.
Milton Charles succeeded Jesse Crawford as organist at the Chicago Theatre and also as the organist used by Orlando Marsh. Charles was recorded by Marsh Laboratories at the Tivoli Theatre (Chicago) with releases on the Paramount label. The Paramount recordings were technically superior to those made at the Chicago Theatre.
The last Autograph records seem to have been recorded in 1926.
Although no longer releasing sides under his own label, Orlando Marsh continued to make recordings in Chicago for other labels (including Paramount, Gennett, and Black Patti) through the end of the 1920s.
Amos 'n' Andy was the very first radio program to be distributed by recorded syndication and Marsh Laboratories played a role in this. Elizabeth McLeod indicated in an e-mail of December 27, 2002 that recordings by Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll were made in advance of the live airing of the Amos 'n' Andy radio shows on WMAQ (AM), Chicago, in the 1928–1929 period at Marsh Laboratories. These were pressed for distribution to other radio stations as 12” shellac 78 rpm discs. She indicated that a speed around 80 rpm was sometimes more accurate. On April 29, 1929, the recording contract went to Brunswick-Balke-Collender (Brunswick Corporation) and the audio quality of the discs improved substantially.McLeod, Elizabeth. A & A Recordings; December 27, 2002.
Occasionally, specialty recordings by Marsh Laboratories from the late 1920s to the early 1940s are found.

[[Cameo Records]]

CATEGORIES: American record labels, Record labels established in 1922, Record labels disestablished in 1930, Jazz record labels

Cameo was a USA based budget record label, first flourishing in the 1920s, not connected with a later record label of the same name which was active in the 1950s and 1960s.
The Cameo Record Company was based in Manhattan, New York.  Cameo records were introduced in February 1922, selling for 50 cents each, and soon Cameo became one of the more popular budget labels.
Cameo Records are noted for a wealth of jazz-influenced 1920s dance music.  While there is little of outstanding importance on Cameo, a high percentage of Cameo Records have fairly good hot music.  New York based musicians such as Red Nichols, Miff Mole, Adrian Rollini, and Frank Signorelli made many trips to the Cameo studios.  Cameo also featured a series of recordings by noted early blues singer Lucille Hegamin.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.mainspringpress.com/cameo.html|title= The Cameo Discography|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= November 24, 2009|work= The Mainspring Online Discography Project|publisher= Mainspring Press|accessdate=February 3, 2010[/tpl]  In 1926, Cameo started recording using a microphone-electrical process. An interesting blues number is 583, "Crazy Blues", by Salt & Pepper. Listen to the podcast at 26:46, where the disc is mentioned as an "early electric".
Cameo also owned the Lincoln Records and Romeo Records labels, as well as a subsidiary for making records for children, Cameo-Kid.  Cameo was purchased by Pathé Records in 1928; the label continued in use until 1930. Pathé was in turn acquired by the American Record Corporation.

The Mid-Atlantic, also called Middle Atlantic states or the Mid-Atlantic states, form a region of 
the United States generally located between New England and the South Atlantic States. Its exact definition differs upon source, but the region often includes Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., New York, Virginia, and West Virginia. When discussing climate, Connecticut (especially southern Connecticut) is often included with the mid Atlantic region.
The Mid-Atlantic has played an important role in the development of American culture, commerce, trade, and industry.[tpl]cite web | url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-77992| title=United States. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica.| accessdate=2009-04-09[/tpl]  
It has been called "the typically American" region by Frederick Jackson Turner.  Religious pluralism and ethnic diversity have been important elements of Mid-Atlantic society from its settlement by Dutch, Swedes, English Catholics, and Quakers through to the period of English rule, and beyond.  After the American Revolution, the Mid-Atlantic region hosted each of the historic capitals of the United States, including the current federal capital, Washington D.C.
In the early part of the 19th century, New York and Pennsylvania overtook Virginia as the most populous states and the New England states as the country's most important trading and industrial centers.  Large numbers of German, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Polish, and other immigrants transformed the region, especially coastal cities such as New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., and Baltimore, but also interior cities such as Pittsburgh, Albany, and Buffalo.
New York City, with its skyscrapers, subways, and headquarters of the United Nations, emerged in the 20th century as an icon of modernity and American economic and cultural power. By the 21st century, the coastal areas of the Mid-Atlantic were thoroughly urbanized.  
The Northeast Corridor and Interstate 95 link an almost contiguous sprawl of suburbs and large and small cities, forming the Mid-Atlantic portion of the Northeast megalopolis, one of the world's most important concentrations of finance, media, communications, education, medicine, and technology.
The Mid-Atlantic is a relatively affluent region of the nation, having 43 of the 100 highest-income counties in the nation based on median household income and 33 of the top 100 based on per capita income. Most of the Mid-Atlantic states rank among the 15 highest-income states in the nation by median household income and per capita income.

The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722 (experiencing a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736) and at their height, they controlled all of modern Iran, Azerbaijan and Armenia, most of Georgia, the North Caucasus, Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, as well as parts of Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Safavid Iran was one of the Islamic "gunpowder empires", along with its neighbours, its arch rival the Ottoman Empire, and Mughal Empire.
The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safaviyya Sufi order, which was established in the city of Ardabil in the Azerbaijan region.

From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Greater Iran and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region,Why is there such confusion about the origins of this important dynasty, which reasserted Iranian identity and established an independent Iranian state after eight and a half centuries of rule by foreign dynasties?

The name "Iran" disappeared from official records of the Saffarids, Samanids, Buyids, Saljuqs and their successor.  But one unofficially used the name Iran, Eranshahr, and similar national designations, particularly Mamalek-e Iran or "Iranian lands", which exactly translated the old Avestan term Ariyanam Daihunam.  On the other hand, when the Safavids (not Reza Shah, as is popularly assumed) revived a national state officially known as Iran, bureaucratic usage in the Ottoman empire and even Iran itself could still refer to it by other descriptive and traditional appellations".
Despite their demise in 1736, the legacy that they left behind was the revival of Persia as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy based upon "checks and balances", their architectural innovations and their patronage for fine arts. The Safavids have also left their mark down to the present era by spreading Shi'a Islam in Iran, as well as major parts of the Caucasus, Anatolia, Central Asia, and South Asia.

He is nicknamed "the Archer" because of the many arrowheads that were among the artefacts buried with him.Wessex Archaeology The Amesbury Archer: Background The calibrated radiocarbon dates for his grave and dating of Stonehenge suggest the sarsens and trilithons at Stonehenge may have been raised by the time he was born,Pearson et al, p. 627 although a new bluestone circle may have been raised at the same time as his birth.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7625145.stm|title=BBC News: Dig Pinpoints Stonehenge Origins|date=21 September 2008|accessdate=15 June 2009|first=James|last=Morgan[/tpl]

This is the list of cities and towns in Montenegro. According to the statistic criteria of Monstat (Montenegrin Statistical Office), the following settlements are classified as "urban" (i.e. cities and towns), as opposed to "rural" (villages). These criteria are not limited to settlement size, but also include the percentage of residents engaged in agriculture, population density etc. Thus, not all towns in statistical sense are greater than villages.

From both social and medical perspectives, it is often considered the central event of female puberty, as it signals the possibility of fertility. 
Girls experience menarche at different ages. The timing of menarche is influenced by female biology, as well as genetic and environmental factors, especially nutritional factors. The average age of menarche has declined over the last century, but the magnitude of the decline and the factors responsible remain subjects of contention. The worldwide average age of menarche is very difficult to estimate accurately, and it varies significantly by geographical region, race, ethnicity and other characteristics. Various estimates have placed it at 13.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://rmohamed.kau.edu.sa/Files/140/Researches/59054_29400.pdf |title=Early teenage marriage and subsequent pregnancy outcome |journal=Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2000 |author=Shawky, S. |coauthors=Milaat, W.[/tpl] Some estimates suggest that the median age of menarche worldwide is 14, and that there is a later age of onset in Asian populations compared to the West.[tpl]cite web|url=http://indox.org.uk/node/34 |title=Risk Factors for Breast Cancer in India: an INDOX Case-Control Study |publisher=INDOX Cancer Research Network |accessdate=2013-05-20[/tpl] The average age of menarche is about 12.5 years in the United States,[tpl]cite journal |author=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title=Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=844–50 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12671122 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.844[/tpl] 12.72 in Canada,[tpl]cite journal|title=Age at menarche in Canada: results from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children & Youth |journal=BMC Public Health |date=November 2010 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-736 |pmid=21110899 |volume=10 |pmc=3001737 |author=Al-Sahab B, Ardern CI, Hamadeh MJ, Tamim H |page=736[/tpl] 12.9 in the UK[tpl]cite book|url=http://vstudentworld.yolasite.com/resources/final_yr/gynae_obs/Hamilton%20Fairley%20Obstetrics%20and%20Gynaecology%20Lecture%20Notes%202%20Ed.pdf |format=PDF |page=29 |title=Obstetrics and Gynaecology |author=Hamilton-Fairley, Diana |edition=2nd |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=1-4051-2066-5 |accessdate=2013-11-09 [/tpl] and 13.06 ± 0.10 years in Iceland.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330480410 |date=May 1978 |author=Magnússon, T.E. |title=Age at menarche in Iceland. |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=511–4 |issn=0002-9483 |pmid=655271 |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology[/tpl] A study on girls in Istanbul, Turkey, found the  median age at menarche to be 12.74 years.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Atay|first1=Z.|last2=Turan|first2=S.|last3=Guran|first3=T.|last4=Furman|first4=A.|last5=Bereket|first5=A|title=Puberty and Influencing Factors in Schoolgirls Living in Istanbul: End of the Secular Trend? |journal=Pediatrics |volume=128|issue=1|pages=e40–5|date=2011-06-13 |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-2267|pmid=21669888[/tpl]

The M6 motorway runs from junction 19 of the M1 at the Catthorpe Interchange, near Rugby via Birmingham then heads north, passing Stoke-on-Trent, Liverpool, Manchester, Preston, Lancaster, Carlisle and terminating at the Gretna junction (J45). Here, just short of the Scottish border it becomes the A74(M) which continues to Glasgow as the M74.
The M6 is the longest motorway in the United Kingdom and one of the busiest. It incorporated the Preston By-pass, the first length of motorway opened in the UK and forms part of a motorway "Backbone of Britain", running north−south between London and Glasgow via the industrial North of England. It is also part of the east−west route between the Midlands and the east-coast ports. The section from the M1 to the M6 Toll split near Birmingham forms part of the unsigned E-road E 24 and the section from the M6 Toll and the M42 forms part of E 05.

Watling Street is the name given to an ancient trackway in England and Wales that was first used by the Britons mainly between the modern cities of Canterbury and St Albans. The Romans later paved the route, part of which is identified on the Antonine Itinerary as Iter III: "Item a Londinio ad portum Dubris" – from London to the port of Dover. Its route is now covered by the A2 road from Dover to London, and the A5 road from London to Wroxeter.
The name derives from the Old English Wæcelinga Stræt.  Originally the word "street" simply meant a paved road (from Latin: "via strata"), and did not have the modern English-language association with populated areas.

[/ref][ref]

"For decades now, Arab terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon have staged raids and fired mortar shells into northern Israel, denying the Israelis peace of mind. In the early 1980s, the terrorists operating out of Lebanon were controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (P.L.O.). After Israel's ambassador to Britain, Shlomo Argov, was shot in cold blood and seriously wounded by the Palestinian terror group Abu Nidal in London in 1982, fed-up Israelis sent tanks and troops rolling into Lebanon to disperse the guerrillas." (pp. 44–45)[/ref] The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had been launching guerrilla attacks against Israel since the 1960s (see Palestine Liberation Organization). After the PLO was driven from Jordan in 1971, the organization established bases in southern Lebanon, from which it continued to attack Israel. In 1981 heavy PLO rocket fire on Israeli settlements led Israel to conduct air strikes in Lebanon. The Israelis also destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Daura near Baghdad.
In an attempt to destroy the PLO forces, Israel began bombing southern Lebanon and Beirut on 5 June 1982."Israel – War in Lebanon". Britannica Student Encyclopedia. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved on 13 April 2007."Israel 1982 Invasion of Lebanon", The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook via Photius Coutsoukis. "Since 1970, Israeli settlements near the southern border of Lebanon had been exposed to harassing attacks from forces of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had been driven out of Jordan. On three occasions, in 1970, 1972, and 1978, Israel had retaliated by ground operations carried out up to Lebanon's Litani River. ... Meanwhile Israel had conducted preemptive shelling and air strikes to deter PLO terrorist attacks on settlements in Galilee in northern Israel."Israel, Infoplease.

The 1982 Lebanon War ([tpl]lang-ar|الاجتياح[/tpl], Al-ijtiyāḥ, "the invasion"), ([tpl]lang-he|מלחמת לבנון הראשונה[/tpl], Milhemet Levanon Harishona, "the first Lebanon war"), called Operation Peace for Galilee ([tpl]lang-he|מבצע שלום הגליל, or מבצע של"ג[/tpl] Mivtsa Shlom HaGalil or Mivtsa Sheleg) by Israel, and later known in Israel as the Lebanon War and First Lebanon War, began on 6 June 1982, when the Israel Defense Forces invaded southern Lebanon. The Government of Israel launched the military operation after the Abu Nidal Organization's assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shlomo Argov, which was used by Israel's prime minister Menachem Begin as justification for the invasion.Kahalani, A Warriors Way, Shapolsky Publishers (1994) pp. 299–301Harvey W. Kushner, Encyclopedia of terrorism Sage Publications (2003), p.13 This justification for the Lebanon invasion by Israel has been criticized, given the 1974 split between the Abu Nidal Organisation and Arafat's PLO, that Abu Nidal was Arafat's mortal Palestinian enemy, that at the time its agents were also seeking to assassinate Fatah officials, and that it was based in Syria and not in Lebanon.US embassy cableCouncil on Foreign RelationsThe Guardian, 25 February 2003: Shlomo Argov orbituaryAbu Nidal, The Economist
By expelling the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), removing Syrian influence over Lebanon, and installing a pro-Israeli Christian government led by Bachir Gemayel, Israel hoped to sign a treaty which Menachem Begin promised would give Israel "forty years of peace".Friedman, p. 157 However, the long occupation that followed Israel's 1982 invasion had repercussions for Israel with Hezbollah being conceived to fight the Israeli occupation.
After attacking the PLO – as well as Syrian, leftist, and Muslim Lebanese forces – Israel occupied southern Lebanon, eventually surrounding the PLO and elements of the Syrian army. Surrounded in West Beirut and subjected to heavy bombardment, the PLO forces and their allies negotiated passage from Lebanon with the aid of United States Special Envoy Philip Habib and the protection of international peacekeepers. The PLO, under the chairmanship of Yasser Arafat, had relocated its headquarters to Tripoli in June 1982.
However, following the assassination of Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel, Israel's position in Beirut became untenable and the signing of a peace treaty became increasingly unlikely. Outrage following Israel's role in the Phalangist-perpetrated Sabra and Shatila massacre, of mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, and Israeli popular disillusionment with the war would lead to a gradual withdrawal from Beirut to southern Lebanon, which was initiated following the 17 May Agreement and Syria's change of attitude towards the PLO. After Israel had left most of Lebanon, the War of the Camps broke out between Lebanese factions, the PLO and Syria, in which Syria fought its former Palestinian allies. At the same time, Shi'a militant groups began consolidating and waging a low-intensity guerrilla war over the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, leading to 18 years of low-scale armed conflict. The Lebanese Civil War would continue until 1990, at which point Syria had established complete dominance over Lebanon.

[[Turbojet]]
CATEGORIES: Jet engines, Gas turbines, Research and development in Nazi Germany, British inventions

The turbojet is a jet engine, usually used in aircraft. It consists of a gas turbine with a propelling nozzle. The gas turbine has an air inlet, a compressor, a combustion chamber, and a turbine (that drives the compressor). The compressed air from the compressor, is heated by the fuel in the combustion chamber and then allowed to expand through the turbine. The turbine exhaust is then expanded in the propelling nozzle where it is accelerated to high speed to provide thrust. Two engineers, Frank Whittle in the United Kingdom and Hans von Ohain in Germany , developed the concept independently into practical engines during the late 1930s.
Turbojets have been replaced in slower aircraft by turboprops which use less fuel. At higher speeds, where the propeller is no longer efficient, they have been replaced by turbofans. The turbofan is quieter and uses less fuel than the turbojet. Turbojets are still common in medium range cruise missiles, due to their high exhaust speed, small frontal area, and relative simplicity.
The jet engine is only efficient at high vehicle speeds, which limits their usefulness apart from aircraft. Turbojet engines have been used in isolated cases to power vehicles other than aircraft, typically for attempts on land speed records. Where vehicles are 'turbine powered' this is more commonly by use of a turboshaft engine, a development of the gas turbine engine where an additional turbine is used to drive a rotating output shaft. These are common in helicopters and hovercraft. Turbojets  have also been used experimentally to clear snow from switches in railyards.

The War of Attrition ([tpl]lang-ar|حرب الاستنزاف|links=no[/tpl] Ḥarb al-Istinzāf, [tpl]lang-he|מלחמת ההתשה|links=no[/tpl] Milhemet haHatashah) involved fighting between Israel and Egypt from 1967 to 1970.
Following the 1967 Six-Day War, no serious diplomatic efforts tried to resolve the issues at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict. In September 1967, Arab states formulated the "Three No's" policy, barring peace, recognition or negotiations with Israel. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser believed that only military initiative would compel Israel or the international community to facilitate a full Israeli withdrawal from Sinai,[tpl]Cite journal |title = Egypt Will Fight, Nasser Shouts|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=November 24, 1967|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19671124&id=iy4NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mmwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7156,4781952|page=2 |postscript = [/tpl] and hostilities soon resumed along the Suez Canal.
These initially took the form of limited artillery duels and small-scale incursions into Sinai, but by 1969 the Egyptian Army judged itself prepared for larger-scale operations. On March 8, 1969, Nasser proclaimed the official launch of the War of Attrition, characterized by large-scale shelling along the Suez Canal, extensive aerial warfare and commando raids.[tpl]cite book|last=Aloni|first=Shlomo|title=Israeli Mirage and Nesher Aces|publisher=Osprey|year=2004|pages=46–53[/tpl] Hostilities continued until August 1970 and ended with a ceasefire, the frontiers remaining the same as when the war began, with no real commitment to serious peace negotiations.

The Millennium Star is a famous diamond owned by De Beers. At 203.04 carats (40.608 g), it is the world's second largest known top-color (D), internally and externally flawless, pear-shaped diamond.
The diamond was discovered in the Mbuji-Mayi district of Zaire (Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1990 in alluvial deposits; uncut, it was 777 carats (155.4 g). It was purchased by De Beers during the height of the country's Civil War that took place in the early to mid-nineties. It took over three years for workers of the Steinmetz Diamond Group to produce the classic pear form. The actual cutting was done using lasers.
It was first displayed in October 1999 as the centerpiece of the De Beers Millennium diamond collection. The collection also includes eleven blue diamonds totaling 118 carats (23.6 g) and The Heart of Eternity. They were displayed at London’s Millennium Dome over 2000. There was an attempt on 7 November 2000 to steal the collection (see Millennium Dome raid), but the Metropolitan Police discovered the plot and arrested the robbers before their escape.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1010974.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Great Dome robbery foiled | date=7 November 2000 | accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl] Crime journalist Kris Hollington wrote a book called Diamond Geezers (ISBN 1843171228) about the attempted theft.

Rauma is a river that runs through the Romsdalen valley in Møre og Romsdal and Oppland counties in Norway.  It runs for [tpl]convert|68|km[/tpl] from the lake Lesjaskogsvatnet in Lesja Municipality to the town of Åndalsnes in Rauma Municipality. The river was once famous for its salmon-fishing, but since an infection with Gyrodactylus salaris, only 5-10% of the original stock survives. The salmon runs up to the "Slettafoss", a [tpl]convert|16|m[/tpl] high combination of waterfalls and rapids more than [tpl]convert|42|km[/tpl] upriver from the estuary.
The Romsdalen valley and Rauma river are regarded as one of the most beautiful river valleys in Norway. The river runs very clear with a green tint and the mountains tower some [tpl]convert|1500|to|1800|m[/tpl] above the river in the lower and middle parts of the valley.  The Reinheimen National Park and the Trollveggen cliff are both located along the southwestern shores of the river through Rauma municipality.  The Romsdalsalpene mountains surround the river and the valley, including the mountains Store Trolltind, Store Venjetinden, Trollryggen, and Romsdalshornet.  The Rauma Line railroad follows the river through the valley on its way north to Åndalsnes.  The railroad crosses the river on the Kylling Bridge at the village of Verma.
Rauma was classified as a protected watercourse in 1992, and the only main tributary affected by hydroelectric power is the river Verma with the more than [tpl]convert|300|m|adj=on[/tpl] tall Verma waterfalls. The biggest tributaries are Ulvåa and Istra.

As the Second Songhua River, it joins the Amur at Tongjiang, Heilongjiang. It is then interrupted by the Baishan, Hongshi and Fengman Dams, which are used for hydroelectricity production. Fengman Dam forms a lake that stretches 62 km upstream. Below the dam, the Second Songhua flows northwest until its largest tributary, the Nen River, joins it near Da'an and creates the Songhua. The Nen River drains the northern Manchurian Plain. The river travels east until it joins the Hulan River near Harbin. Then it passes between the northern end of the eastern Manchurian mountain system and the Lesser Khingan Range. The river then flows into the Amur River valley. The river freezes from late November until March. It has its highest flows when the mountain snow melts during the spring thaw. The river is navigable up to Harbin by medium-sized ships. Smaller craft can navigate the Songhua up to Jilin and the Nen River up to Qiqihar.
The extreme flatness of the Manchurian Plain has caused the river to meander widely over time. The result of the meandering is that the river is surrounded by a wide plain that is filled with swirls and curves, showing paths the river once took.

A Treaty of friendship and alliance between the Government of Mongolia and Tibet was signed on February 2,Udo B. Barkmann, Geschichte der Mongolei, Bonn 1999, p.119-122,380f 1913, at Urga (now Ulaanbaatar). However, there have been doubts about the authority of the Tibetan signatories to conclude such a treaty, and therefore about whether it constitutes a valid contract.Smith, Warren, "Tibetan Nation", p186:"The validity is often questioned, mainly on grounds of the authority of Dorjiev to negotiate on behalf of Tibet...the fact that Dorjief was a Russian citizen while ethnically Tibetan somewhat compromises his role; the treaty had some advantages to Russia in that it could be interpreted as extending Russia's protectorate over Mongolia to encompass Tibet." 
Occasionally, the mere existence of the treaty has been put into doubt, but its text in Mongolian language has been published by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in 1982,Udo B. Barkmann, Geschichte der Mongolei, Bonn 1999, p. 380f and in 2007 an original copy in Tibetan language and script surfaced from Mongolian archives.

It is about 50 km south-east of Trieste, Italy, located on the road Trieste — Koper — Učka Tunnel (B8) — Rijeka. Its other names are Rus (quoted as such in a document of 1064), Ronz and Rozzo. Together with Roč, they all derive from the Celtic name Roz: the related name Roc is very common in wide areas under Celts influence. The Romans called it Castrum Rotium or Rocium.  
Roč is considered a town rather than a village due to its rich cultural heritage. The local Church of St. Anthony holds the precious Roč Glagolitic Abecedarium from the 13th century. The first Croatian printed book, the 1483 Missale Romanum Glagolitice, was prepared in Roč by one Juri Žakan.
The town of Roč is declared by the authorities as an important cultural monument, as it has a well preserved city walls from the Middle Ages with two entrances, a Roman lapidarium, a Venetian bombarda cannon and a functional watchtower. Furthermore, it has the church of St. Anton from the 12th, St. Rok from the 14th and St. Bertol from the 15th century, and numerous other smaller artifacts preserved in the ancient buildings.
Seven kilometers from Roč is Hum, with a population of only 22 people often called the smallest town in the world. Along the road from Roč to Hum is Glagolitic avenue, a memorial avenue of ten monuments from the history of the Glagolitic alphabet.

Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano (born March 12, 1945) is a former underboss of the Gambino crime family. He is known as the man who helped bring down John Gotti, the family's boss, by agreeing to become a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) government witness.
Originally a mobster for the Colombo crime family, and later for the Brooklyn faction of the Gambinos, Gravano participated in the conspiracy to murder Gambino boss Paul Castellano. Gravano played a key role in planning and executing Castellano's murder; other conspirators included John Gotti, Angelo Ruggiero, Frank DeCicco, and Joseph Armone. After Castellano's death, Gotti elevated Gravano to underboss, a position he held at the time he became a government witness.  At the time, Gravano was the highest-ranking member of the Five Families to break his Cosa Nostra oath and cooperate with the government. His testimony drew a wave of Cosa Nostra members to also become government witnesses.

[[A Devil's Chaplain]]

CATEGORIES: 2003 books, Books critical of religion, Books by Richard Dawkins, Essay collections

A Devil's Chaplain, subtitled Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love  is a 2003 book of selected essays and other writings by Richard Dawkins. Published five years after his previous book Unweaving the Rainbow, it contains 32 essays covering subjects including pseudoscience, genetic determinism, memetics, terrorism, religion and creationism. A section of the book is devoted to Dawkins' late adversary Stephen Jay Gould.
The book's title is a reference to a quotation of Charles Darwin, made in reference to Darwin's lack of belief in how "a perfect world" was designed by God:
"What a book a devil's chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low and horridly cruel works of nature!"This was written in 1857 as Darwin worked towards the publication of his theory, and has been related to his memories of his time at university when an "Infidel home missionary tour" by the Reverend Robert Taylor warned Darwin of the dangers of dissent from church doctrine. While Taylor was subsequently nicknamed "the devil's chaplain," the term goes back further, and Geoffrey Chaucer has his Parson say "Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns, that syngen evere placebo" in a reference to Placebo (at funeral).""Darwin's child", profile by Simon Hattenstone, The Guardian, 10 February 2003.

[[Ribaldry]]

CATEGORIES: Comedy, Sex, Humour, Entertainment, Off-color humor

Ribaldry is humorous entertainment that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross indecency. It is also referred to as "bawdiness", "gaminess" or "bawdry".
Sex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in human sexuality, rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a metaphor to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of satire.
Like any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or subversive. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its comedy generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.
The ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of censorship. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is not "merely" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.

CATEGORIES: Consolidated aircraft, United States bomber aircraft 1930–1939, World War II bombers of the United States, Four-engined tractor aircraft, High-wing aircraft

The Consolidated B-24 Liberator was an American heavy bomber, designed by Consolidated Aircraft of San Diego, California. It was known within the company as the Model 32, and a small number of early models were sold under the name LB-30, for Land Bomber. The B-24 was used in World War II by several Allied air forces and navies, and by every branch of the American armed forces during the war, attaining a distinguished war record with its operations in the Western European, Pacific, Mediterranean, and China-Burma-India Theaters.
Often compared with the better-known Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, the B-24 was a more modern design with a higher top speed, greater range, and a heavier bomb load; it was also more difficult to fly, with heavy control forces and poor formation-flying characteristics. Popular opinion among aircrews and general staffs tended to favor the B-17's rugged qualities above all other considerations in the European Theater.Birdsall 1968, p. 3. The placement of the B-24's fuel tanks throughout the upper fuselage and its lightweight construction, designed to increase range and optimize assembly line production, made the aircraft vulnerable to battle damage.Winchester 2004, p. 56. The B-24 was notorious among American aircrews for its tendency to catch fire. Its high fuselage-mounted "Davis wing" also meant it was dangerous to ditch or belly land, since the fuselage tended  to break apart.Ethell 1995, p. 215. Nevertheless, the B-24 provided excellent service in a variety of roles thanks to its large payload and long range and was the only bomber to operationally deploy the United States' first forerunner to precision-guided munitions during the war, the 1,000 lb. Azon guided bomb.
The B-24's most costly mission was the low-level strike against the Ploiești oil fields, in Romania on 1 August 1943, which turned into a disaster because the defense was underestimated, fully alerted and attackers disorganized.
The B-24 ended World War II as the most produced heavy bomber in history. At over 18,400 units,Ethell 1995, p. 214. half by Ford Motor Company, it still holds the distinction as the most-produced American military aircraft.

Night vision is the ability to see in low light conditions. Whether by biological or technological means, night vision is made possible by a combination of two approaches: sufficient spectral range, and sufficient intensity range. Humans have poor night vision compared to many animals, in part because the human eye lacks a tapetum lucidum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k1t44v5003v6hhm3/|title=Histological study of choroidal melanocytes in animals with tapetum lucidum cellulosum (abstract)[/tpl]

The Battle of Edgehill (or Edge Hill) was the first pitched battle of the First English Civil War. It was fought near Edge Hill and Kineton in southern Warwickshire on Sunday, 23 October 1642.
All attempts at constitutional compromise between King Charles and Parliament broke down early in 1642. Both King and Parliament raised large armies to gain their way by force of arms. In October, at his temporary base near Shrewsbury, King Charles decided to march on London in order to force a decisive confrontation with Parliament's main army, commanded by the Earl of Essex.
Late on 22 October, both armies unexpectedly found the enemy to be close by. The next day, the Royalist army descended from Edge Hill to force battle. After the Parliamentary artillery opened a cannonade, the Royalists attacked. Both armies consisted mostly of inexperienced and sometimes ill-equipped troops. Many men from both sides fled or fell out to loot enemy baggage, and neither army was able to gain a decisive advantage.
After the battle, King Charles resumed his march on London, but was not strong enough to overcome the defending militia before Essex's army could reinforce them. The inconclusive result of the Battle of Edgehill prevented either faction gaining a quick victory in the war, which eventually lasted four years.

Alan, Abbot of Tewkesbury (date of birth unknown) is said by Gervase of Canterbury (contemporary chronicler) to be of English (i.e. non-Norman) descent. He probably spent some time at Benevento (Italy). Became a monk at Canterbury, rising to prior in 1179. In the struggle between Thomas of Canterbury and Henry II, he was a strong supporter of Thomas. As a result, he went to Tewkesbury as abbot where he was out of Henry's way.
His works are written about in Life of St. Thomas printed (as Life of Becket) in the second volume of Materials for the History of Thomas Becket, edited by the Rev. J. C. Robertson (Rolls Series, London,; 1875–85; Part I, CXC, 1475–88).

[[Cliff]]

CATEGORIES: Cliffs, Coastal geography, Erosion landforms, Slope landforms, Fluvial landforms, Coastal and oceanic landforms

In geography and geology, a cliff is a vertical, or near vertical, rock exposure. Cliffs are formed as erosion landforms due to the processes of erosion and weathering that produce them. Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, escarpments and along rivers. Cliffs are usually formed by rock that is resistant to erosion and weathering. Sedimentary rocks most likely to form cliffs include sandstone, limestone, chalk, and dolomite. Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs.
An escarpment (or scarp) is a type of cliff, formed by the movement of a geologic fault, or a landslide.
Most cliffs have some form of scree slope at their base. In arid areas or under high cliffs, these are generally exposed jumbles of fallen rock. In areas of higher moisture, a soil slope may obscure the talus. Many cliffs also feature tributary waterfalls or rock shelters. Sometimes a cliff peters out at the end of a ridge, with tea tables or other types of rock columns remaining. Coastal erosion may lead to the formation of sea cliffs along a receding coastline.
The Ordnance Survey distinguishes between cliffs (continuous line along the top edge with projections down the face) and outcrops (continuous lines along lower edge).

[[Infrared cut-off filter]]

CATEGORIES: Optical filters

Infrared cut-off filters, sometimes called IR filters or heat-absorbing filters, are designed to reflect or block mid-infrared wavelengths while passing visible light. They are often used in devices with bright incandescent light bulbs (such as slide and overhead projectors) to prevent unwanted heating. There are also filters which are used in solid state (CCD or CMOS) video cameras to block IR due to the high sensitivity of many camera sensors to near-infrared light. These filters typically have a blue hue to them as they also sometimes block some of the light from the longer red wavelengths.

[[Tea table]]

CATEGORIES: Erosion landforms

Geologically speaking, a tea table is a rock formation that is a remnant of newer strata that have eroded away.  A tea table is a type of rock column comprising discrete layers, usually of sedimentary rock, with the top layers being wider than the base due to greater resistance to erosion and weathering.  Sometimes these occur just beyond bluffs or cliffs at the end of a ridge; sometimes they are the only rock formation remnant on top of a ridge or even in fairly level ground. Tea tables are a variety of hoodoos.
Tea Tables are one of southern Illinois' Shawnee National Forest's claims to fame.

Bear Island ([tpl]lang-no|Bjørnøya[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sv|ˈbjøːɳøja|pron[/tpl]) is the southernmost island of the Norwegian Svalbard archipelago. The island is located in the western part of the Barents Sea, approximately halfway between Spitsbergen and the North Cape.
Bear Island was discovered by the Dutch explorers Willem Barents and Jacob van Heemskerk on June 10, 1596. It was named after a polar bear that was seen swimming nearby. The island was considered terra nullius until the Spitsbergen Treaty of 1920 placed it under Norwegian sovereignty.
Despite its remote location and barren nature, the island has seen commercial activities in past centuries, such as coal mining, fishing and whaling. However, no settlements have lasted more than a few years, and Bear Island is now uninhabited except for personnel working at the island's meteorological station Herwighamna. Along with the adjacent waters, it was declared a nature reserve in 2002.

Paul Mares (June 15, 1900 – August 18, 1949), was an American early dixieland jazz cornet & trumpet player, and leader of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings.
Mares was born in New Orleans.  His father, Joseph E. Mares, played cornet with the military band at the New Orleans lakefront and ran a fur and hide business.
Like many New Orleans cornetists of his generation, Joe Mares's main influence was "King" Joe Oliver.
About 1919 cornetist Abbie Brunies was offered a job playing in Chicago, and passed the offer on to Mares. (Brunies thought his New Orleans position of doubling driving a taxi-cab and playing music was more secure than prospects in Chicago.)
Mares established himself as a respected band leader over a group of wild and strong willed musicians, as The New Orleans Rhythm Kings (N.O.R.K.) became one of the best regarded bands in Chicago in the early 1920s.[tpl]cite book | last=Berendt|first=Joachim| title=The Jazz Book | publisher=Paladin| year=1976|pages=131[/tpl]
In late 1924 Mares returned to New Orleans.  He decided to play music on the side while taking over the running of his family fur & hide business. He ran the business well and with his prosperity purchased 3 homes for himself and his relatives in New Orleans' new suburb of Metairie, Louisiana. Mares's Metairie home was the site of a legendary jam-session in 1929 where Bix Beiderbecke and the other jazz playing members of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra jammed with the local New Orleans jazz musicians. 
Mares also ran a restaurant in New Orleans called "The Chicago Bar-B-Q". In the early 1930s he returned to Chicago where he opened up his "New Orleans Bar-B-Q" there. The "P.M. New Orleans Bar-B-Q" became a gathering place for Chicago jazz musicians and home to numerous jam sessions, which Mares occasionally joined in.

Leon Joseph Roppolo (March 16, 1902 – October 5, 1943) was a prominent early jazz clarinetist, best known for his playing with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings.  He also played saxophone and guitar. Roppolo married Mabel Alice Branchard on 17 May 1920 in New Orleans. They had one child, Epifanio Leon Roppolo Sr.
Leon Roppolo (nicknamed "Rap" and sometimes misspelled as 'Rappolo') was born in Lutcher, Louisiana, upriver from New Orleans.   His family, of Sicilian origin, moved to the Uptown neighborhood of New Orleans about 1912. Young Leon's first instrument was the violin. He was a fan of the marching bands he heard in the streets of New Orleans, and wanted to play clarinet. An older relative with the same name played that instrument in Papa Jack Laine's Reliance Brass Band. 
Roppolo soon excelled at the clarinet, and played youthful jobs with his friends Paul Mares and George Brunies for parades, parties, and at Milneburg on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain.  In his teens he decided to leave home to travel with the band of Bee Palmer, which soon became the nucleus for the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. The Rhythm Kings became (along with King Oliver's band) one of the best regarded hot jazz bands in Chicago in the early 1920s. Many considered Roppolo to be the star. His style influenced many younger Chicago musicians, most famously Benny Goodman. Some critics have called Roppolo's work on the Rhythm Kings Gennett Records the first recorded jazz solos. 
After the breakup of the Rhythm Kings in Chicago, Roppolo and Paul Mares headed east to try their luck on the New York City jazz scene. Contemporary musicians recalled Roppolo making some recordings with Original Memphis Five and California Ramblers musicians in New York in 1924. These sides were presumably unissued, or if issued unidentified.
Roppolo and Mares then returned home to New Orleans where they briefly reformed the Rhythm Kings and made some more recordings.  After this Roppolo worked with other New Orleans bands such as the Halfway House Orchestra, with which he recorded on saxophone.
Roppolo exhibited ever more eccentric behavior and violent temper. This was  finally too much for his family to take, and Leon was committed to the state mental hospital. Some writers have speculated that he was suffering from tertiary syphilis. 
In his later life, Roppolo, looking old and feeble far beyond his age, would come home for periods when a relative or friend could look after him, and he would sit in with local bands on saxophone or clarinet. 
Leon Roppolo died in New Orleans at the age of 41, and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, within sight of the old Halfway House building where he played for years.
Leon Roppolo's compositions include the jazz standards "Farewell Blues" and "Milenberg Joys", "Gold Leaf Strut" or "Golden Leaf Strut", "Tin Roof Blues" (1923), and "Make Love to Me", which was a pop song using Leon Roppolo's music (from "Tin Roof Blues"), recorded by Jo Stafford in 1954, and by Anne Murray and B. B. King. Jo Stafford's recording of "Make Love to Me" was no. 1 for three weeks on the Billboard charts and no. 2 on Cashbox.

[[Don Murray (clarinetist)]]

Don Murray (June 7, 1904 - June 2, 1929) was an early jazz clarinet and saxophone player.
Don Murray was born in Joliet, Illinois, and attended high school in Chicago.  In his teens he made a name for himself as one of the best young jazz clarinetists and saxophonists in the city. In 1923 he recorded with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings; according to Rhythm Kings leader Paul Mares, Murray was not a regular member of the band, but was a friend who sometimes sat in with them.  Murray also made early recordings with Muggsy Spanier.  He then joined the Detroit, Michigan based band of Jean Goldkette, with whom he remained until 1927.  It was here that he mentored the young Jimmy Dorsey.
After a brief stint with Adrian Rollini's band, during which he contributed to several highly regarded recordings by Bix Beiderbecke, Murray was hired by Ted Lewis. Ted Lewis said that Murray was the greatest clarinetist he ever had in his band—high praise indeed since Jimmy Dorsey and Benny Goodman had also been in Lewis's band. Murray can be heard in the Ted Lewis film Is Everybody Happy? (1929), which is considered a "lost film," although Vitaphone disks are available.
Don Murray died in 1929 at a Los Angeles hospital after injuries sustained in a freak automobile accident.  Apparently, he was standing on the running board of a moving roadster and fell; he struck the back of his head on the pavement and was then hospitalized with serious head injury.
Donald L. Murray is buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Skokie, IL.   He was 24 at the time of his death.

Emmett Louis Hardy (June 12, 1903 – June 16, 1925) was an early jazz cornet player and one of the best-regarded New Orleans musicians of his generation.
Emmett Louis Hardy was born in the New Orleans suburb of Gretna, Louisiana, and lived much of his life in the Algiers neighborhood on the west bank of New Orleans.  Hardy was a child prodigy, described as already playing marvelously in his early teens. Some New Orleans musicians remembered as a musical highlight of their lives a 1919 cutting contest where, after long and intense struggle, Hardy succeeded in outplaying Louis Armstrong. (It is likely that Armstrong, although 2 years older than Hardy, had not yet hit his full stride at that time.)
Emmett Hardy was in the original incarnation of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings (or NORK) under the direction of Bee Palmer. For a time during its Friar's Inn residency the NORK used a two-cornet format -- Paul Mares, leader and first cornet, and Emmett Hardy as second. (Note that, as with other New Orleans jazz bands of that time (such as King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band and The Original Tuxedo Orchestra), the more creative player played the second part, with the first cornet staying closer to the lead line. Hardy did not appear on any of the Rhythm Kings recording sessions, never making any commercial recordings before his early death.
Back in New Orleans Hardy lead his own band and played in the band of Norman Brownlee.
Hardy's playing is described as being more lyrical than many of his New Orleans contemporaries, but with a driving rhythm. His tone was much admired. Hardy was an important influence on Bix Beiderbecke; Monk Hazel said that Bix on the Wolverines records sounds very much like Hardy.
Hardy also did metal work, made his own mouthpieces for his horn, and modified his cornet to add an additional spit-valve.
A relative remembered Hardy as being somewhat shy and unassuming, with a good dry sense of humor; that he was easily frightened by sudden loud noises, and superstitious about passing by graveyards.
When advancing tuberculosis started to make his breathing difficult, Hardy taught himself banjo so he could continue playing music.
Hardy and some of his musician friends made some home recordings on wax phonograph cylinders for their own amusement. As Hardy's tuberculosis worsened and his death seemed inevitable, the friends decided to preserve the cylinders as a memento of Hardy's playing. At least one cylinder survived to the start of the 1950s; the relative who heard it then said Hardy's playing reminded him of Sharkey Bonano. When Tulane University's Jazz Archive was established in the late 1950s, however, a diligent search failed to turn up any of these recordings, which are, alas, presumed lost forever.
Hardy died in New Orleans shortly after his 22nd birthday and was buried in Gretna.

Yad Vashem (Hebrew: יָד וַשֵׁם) is Israel's official memorial to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, established in 1953 through the Yad Vashem Law passed by the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
Yad Vashem is located on the western slope of Mount Herzl on the Mount of Remembrance in Jerusalem, [tpl]convert|804|m|ft|0|sp=us[/tpl] above sea level and adjacent to the Jerusalem Forest. The memorial consists of a [tpl]convert|180|dunam|ha acre|adj=on|sigfig=3[/tpl] complex containing the Holocaust History Museum, memorial sites such as the Children's Memorial and the Hall of Remembrance, The Museum of Holocaust Art, sculptures, outdoor commemorative sites such as the Valley of the Communities, a synagogue, a research institute with archives, a library, a publishing house, and an educational center named The International School for Holocaust Studies.
When Yad Vashem came into being, a core goal of its founding visionaries was to recognize gentiles who, at personal risk, and without a financial or evangelistic motive, chose to save their Jewish brethren from the ongoing genocide during the Holocaust. Those recognized by the State of Israel as Righteous Among the Nations are honored in a section of Yad Vashem known as the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations.
Yad Vashem is the second most-visited tourist site in Israel, after the Western Wall. Its curators charge no fee for admission and welcome approximately one million visitors a year.

[[Fermi gas]]
CATEGORIES: Ideal gas, Fermi–Dirac statistics

A Fermi gas is an ensemble of a large number of fermions. Fermions, named after Enrico Fermi, are particles that obey Fermi–Dirac statistics. These statistics determine the energy distribution of fermions in a Fermi gas in thermal equilibrium, and is characterized by their number density, temperature, and the set of available energy states.
By the Pauli exclusion principle, no quantum state can be occupied by more than one fermion with an identical set of quantum numbers. Thus a noninteracting Fermi gas, unlike a Bose gas, is prohibited from condensing into a Bose–Einstein condensate, although interacting Fermi gases might.http://www.conferences.uiuc.edu/bcs50/PDF/Jin.pdf The total energy of the Fermi gas at absolute zero is larger than the sum of the single-particle ground states because the Pauli principle implies a sort of interaction or pressure that keeps fermions separated and moving. For this reason, the pressure of a Fermi gas is non-zero even at zero temperature, in contrast to that of a classical ideal gas. This so-called degeneracy pressure stabilizes a neutron star (a Fermi gas of neutrons) or a white dwarf star (a Fermi gas of electrons) against the inward pull of gravity, which would ostensibly collapse the star into a Black Hole. Only when a star is sufficiently massive to overcome the degeneracy pressure can it collapse into a singularity.
It is possible to define a Fermi temperature below which the gas can be considered degenerate (its pressure derives almost exclusively from the Pauli principle). This temperature depends on the mass of the fermions and the density of energy states. For metals, the electron gas's Fermi temperature is generally many thousands of kelvins, so in human applications they can be considered degenerate. The maximum energy of the fermions at zero temperature is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi energy surface in momentum space is known as the Fermi surface.

Leroy Eldridge Cleaver (August 31, 1935 – May 1, 1998), better known as Eldridge Cleaver,  was a writer, political activist, and confessed rapist who became an early leader of the Black Panther Party. His book Soul On Ice is a collection of essays praised by The New York Times Book Review at the time of its publication as "brilliant and revealing".Patterson, Lindsay (April 27, 1969). "Eldridge Cleaver; Post-Prison Writings and Speeches." The New York Times. Retrieved June 10, 2013.
Cleaver went on to become a prominent member of the Black Panthers, having the titles Minister of Information and Head of the International Section of the Panthers while a fugitive from the United States criminal justice system in Cuba and Algeria. As editor of the official Panther's newspaper, Cleaver's influence on the direction of the Party was rivaled only by founders Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. Cleaver and Newton eventually fell out with each other, resulting in a split that weakened the party.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the Coalition, the biggest coalition since World War II. The great majority of the Coalition's military forces were from the U.S., with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order.

The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial bombardment on 17 January 1991. This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February. This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory. The Coalition ceased its advance, and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia's border. Iraq launched Scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel.
United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 passed in April 1991 established formal cease-fire terms. The controversies over enforcing this and subsequent resolutions would lead to the outbreak of another war 12 years later.

The Holy Roman Empire was a highly decentralized state for most of its history, composed of hundreds of smaller states, most of which operated with some degree of independent sovereignty.  Although in the earlier part of the Middle Ages, under the Salian and Hohenstaufen emperors, it was relatively centralized, as time went on the Emperor lost more and more power to the Princes.  The membership of the Imperial Diet in 1792, late in the Empire's history but before the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars, gives some insight as to the composition of the Holy Roman Empire at that time.

[[Public library]]

CATEGORIES: Types of library, Library science, Public libraries, Book promotion

A public library is a library that is accessible by the general public and is generally funded from public sources, such as taxes. It is operated by librarians and library paraprofessionals, who are also civil servants. In the United States there are a fair number of public libraries that are 501(c)(3) organizations, not tax-supported and whose employees are not civil servants.
There are five fundamental characteristics shared by public libraries. The first is that they are generally supported by taxes (usually local, though any level of government can and may contribute); they are governed by a board to serve the public interest; they are open to all and every community member can access the collection; they are entirely voluntary in that no one is ever forced to use the services provided; and public libraries provide basic services without charge.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science (3rd ed). 2010. Neal-Schuman Publishers: New York.
Public libraries exist in many countries across the world and are often considered an essential part of having an educated and literate population. Public libraries are distinct from research libraries, school libraries, and other special libraries in that their mandate is to serve the general public's information needs (rather than the needs of a particular school, institution, or research population). Public libraries also provide free services such as preschool story times to encourage early literacy, quiet study and work areas for students and professionals, or book clubs to encourage appreciation of literature in adults. Public libraries typically allow users to take books and other materials off the premises temporarily; they also have non-circulating reference collections and provide computer and Internet access to patrons.

Mayan languages are spoken by at least 6 million indigenous Maya, primarily in Guatemala, Mexico, Belize and Honduras. In 1996, Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name,Spence, et al. (1998). and Mexico recognizes eight more.Achi' is counted as a variant of K'iche' by the Guatemalan government. Counting Achi' there are 30 living Mayan languages.
The Mayan language family is one of the best documented and most studied in the Americas.Campbell (1997), p.165. Modern Mayan languages descend from Proto-Mayan, a language thought to have been spoken at least 5,000 years ago; it has been partially reconstructed using the comparative method.
Mayan languages form part of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area, an area of linguistic convergence developed throughout millennia of interaction between the peoples of Mesoamerica. All Mayan languages display the basic diagnostic traits of this linguistic area. For example, all use relational nouns instead of prepositions to indicate spatial relationships. They also possess grammatical and typological features that set them apart from other languages of Mesoamerica, such as the use of ergativity in the grammatical treatment of verbs and their subjects and objects, specific inflectional categories on verbs, and a special word class of "positionals" which is typical of all Mayan languages.
During the pre-Columbian era of Mesoamerican history, some Mayan languages were written in the Mayan hieroglyphic script. Its use was particularly widespread during the Classic period of Maya civilization (c. 250–900 AD). The surviving corpus of over 10,000 known individual Maya inscriptions on buildings, monuments, pottery and bark-paper codices,Kettunen and Helmke (2005), p.6. combined with the rich postcolonial literature in Mayan languages written in the Latin script, provides a basis for the modern understanding of pre-Columbian history unparalleled in the Americas.

The Slim Shady LP is the second studio album and first major release from the American rapper Eminem. It was released on February 23, 1999, under Interscope Records and Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan. following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself.  The majority of the record's lyrical content is written from the perspective of the rapper's alter ego Slim Shady, whom the rapper created on Slim Shady EP (1997). The lyrics are noted for their over-the-top depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity.
The album was met with both critical and commercial success; critics praised Eminem for his unique lyrical style, and the record debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart behind TLC's FanMail with 283,000 copies sold in its opening week. The first official single, "My Name Is", peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Slim Shady LP went on to be certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and in 2003, the album was ranked number 273 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
The Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an unknown rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records, and he embarked on an extensive touring schedule to promote the album.  In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the Vans Warped Tour and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on American youth. The rapper was also sued multiple times following the release of the album for reasons including slander and unauthorized sampling.

[[Cave painting]]

CATEGORIES: Rock art, Prehistoric art, Pre-Columbian art, Native American art, Indigenous art, Murals, Media technology, Art of the Upper Paleolithic, Caves containing pictograms

Cave paintings are paintings found on cave walls and ceilings, and especially refer to those of prehistoric origin. The earliest such rock art in Europe dates back to the Aurignacian period, approximately 40,000 years ago, and is found in the El Castillo cave in Cantabria, Spain. The exact purpose of the paleolithic cave paintings is not known. Evidence suggests that they were not merely decorations of living areas since the caves in which they have been found do not have signs of ongoing habitation. They are also often located in areas of caves that are not easily accessible. Some theories hold that cave paintings may have been a way of communicating with others, while other theories ascribe a religious or ceremonial purpose to them.

The cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) was a species of bear that lived in Europe during the Pleistocene and became extinct at the beginning of the Last Glacial Maximum, about 27,500 years ago.
Both the name "cave" and the scientific name spelaeus derive from the fact that fossils of this species were mostly found in caves, indicating this species spent more time in caves than the brown bear, which only uses caves for hibernation. Consequently, in the course of time, whole layers of bones, almost entire skeletons, were found in many caves.

Field Marshal FitzRoy James Henry Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan, [tpl]post-nominals|country=GBR|GCB|PC[/tpl] (30 September 1788 – 29 June 1855), known before 1852 as Lord FitzRoy Somerset, was a British Army officer. As a junior officer he served in the Peninsular War and the Hundred Days, latterly as military secretary to the Duke of Wellington. He also took part in politics as  Tory Member of Parliament for Truro before becoming Master-General of the Ordnance. He became commander of the British troops sent to the Crimea in 1854: while his primary objective was to defend Constantinople he was ordered to besiege the Russian Port of Sevastopol. After an early success at the Battle of Alma, a failure to deliver orders with sufficient clarity caused the fateful Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. Despite further success at the Battle of Inkerman, a piecemeal allied assault on Sevastopol in June 1855 was a complete failure. Somerset died later that month from a mixture of dysentery and clinical depression.

CATEGORIES: 1866 disestablishments, States and territories established in 1567, House of Hesse-Kassel, History of Hesse, Royal families of Sweden, States of the German Confederation, States of the Holy Roman Empire

The history of Hesse  began when the cultural area known as Hesse came into existence in 1568, as the portion granted to George, youngest of the four sons of Landgrave Philip I of Hesse.  With the extinction of the Hesse-Marburg and Hesse-Rheinfels lines by 1604, Hesse-Darmstadt, along with Hesse-Kassel, became one of the two Hessian states.  While Hesse-Kassel converted to Calvinism and became one of the most zealous exponents of the Protestant cause in the Thirty Years' War, Landgrave George II remained a strict Lutheran and maintained a close alliance with Saxony, which resulted in a pro-Habsburg policy after 1642.
Hesse-Darmstadt gained a great deal of territory by the secularizations and mediatizations authorized by the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803.  Most notable was the acquisition of the Duchy of Westphalia, formerly owned by the Archbishop of Cologne, as well as territories from the Archbishop of Mainz and the Bishop of Worms.  In 1806, upon the dissolution of the Reich and the dispossession of his cousin, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel, the Landgrave took the title of Grand Duke of Hesse.
At the Congress of Vienna, the Grand Duke was forced to cede Westphalia to Prussia, in exchange for which he received a piece of territory on the Left Bank of the Rhine, including the important federal fortress at Mainz.  The Grand Duchy changed its name to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine in 1816.
In 1867, the northern half of the Grand Duchy (Upper Hesse) became a part of the North German Confederation, while the half of the Grand Duchy south of the Main (Starkenburg and Rhenish Hesse) remained outside.  In 1871, it became a constituent state of the German Empire.  The last Grand Duke, Ernst Ludwig (a grandson of Queen Victoria and brother to Empress Alexandra of Russia), was forced from his throne at the end of World War I.The state was then renamed the Volksstaat Hessen (People's State of Hesse).
The majority of the state combined with Frankfurt am Main, the Waldeck area (Rhine-Province) and the old Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau to form the new state of Hesse following the Second World War. Excepted was the Montabaur district from Hessen-Nassau and that part of Hessen-Darmstadt on the left bank of the Rhine (Rhenish Hesse) became part of the Rhineland-Palatinate state. (Bad) Wimpfen - an exclave of Hessen-Darmstadt - became part of Baden-Württemberg, district of Sinsheim.

[[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]]

CATEGORIES: Academy Awards, Film sound production, Best Sound Editing Academy Award winners

The Academy Award for Best Sound Editing is an Academy Award granted yearly to a film exhibiting the finest or most aesthetic sound editing or sound design. The award is usually received by the Supervising Sound Editors of the film, perhaps accompanied by the Sound Designers.
The Sound Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, until 2006 would use a "bake-off" of the best films from the previous year to decide which films should be referred to the full Academy as nominations for the award. In a rule change on June 30, 2006, the bake-off for the Sound Branch was eliminated, and the usual process of a "preferential ballot" submission was instituted.
During certain years, the highest award given for this category may be a "Special Achievement Award", not an Oscar.  Academy rules require that a minimum number of films must be nominated in a category for an Academy Award to be granted; when the number of qualifying nominees is insufficient, a Special Achievement Award is granted instead.
This is a list of films that have won or been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Effects (1963–1967, 1975), Sound Effects Editing (1977, 1981–1999), or Sound Editing (1979, 2000–present). See Academy Award for Sound for a corresponding list of winners for Best Sound.

Born in the town of Bsharri in the north of modern-day Lebanon (then part of Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Ottoman Empire), as a young man he immigrated with his family to the United States, where he studied art and began his literary career, writing in both English and Arabic. In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero.Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet: Why is it so loved?, BBC News, May 12, 2012, Retrieved May 12, 2012.
He is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book The Prophet, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture.Acocella, Joan (January 7, 2008). "Prophet Motive". The New Yorker. Retrieved March 9, 2009. Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.

Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás, known as George Santayana (December 16, 1863[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]September 26, 1952), was a philosopher, essayist, poet, and novelist. A lifelong Spanish citizen, Santayana was raised and educated in the United States and identified himself as an American, although he always kept a valid Spanish passport.George Santayana, "Apologia Pro Mente Sua," in P. A. Schilpp, The Philosophy of George Santayana, (1940), 603. He wrote in English and is generally considered an American man of letters. At the age of forty-eight, Santayana left his position at Harvard and returned to Europe permanently, never to return to the United States. His last wish was to be buried in the Spanish pantheon in Rome.
Santayana is known for famous sayings, such as "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it",George Santayana (1905) Reason in Common Sense, p. 284, volume 1 of The Life of Reason and "Only the dead have seen the end of war." (a quote often wrongly attributed to Plato).George Santayana (1922) Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies, number 25 Santayana is broadly included among the pragmatists with Harvard University colleagues William James and Josiah Royce.

[tpl]legend|green|Parliamentary republics with an executive president elected by and responsible to a parliament.[/tpl]]]
A parliamentary system is a system of democratic governance of a state in which the executive branch derives its democratic legitimacy from, and is held accountable to, the legislature (parliament); the executive and legislative branches are thus interconnected. In a parliamentary system, the head of state is normally a different person from the head of government. This is in contrast to a presidential system in a democracy, where the head of state often is also the head of government, and most importantly: the executive branch does not derive its democratic legitimacy from the legislature.
Countries with parliamentary systems may be constitutional monarchies, where a monarch is the ceremonial head of state while the head of government is almost always a member of the legislature (such as United Kingdom, Sweden and Japan), or parliamentary republics, where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state while the head of government is regularly from the legislature (such as Ireland, Germany, Pakistan, India and Italy). In a few parliamentary republics, such as South Africa and Botswana, the head of government is also head of state, but is elected by and is answerable to the legislature.

[[Social conflict theory]]

CATEGORIES: Sociological theories, Marxist theory, Identity politics, Conflict

Social conflict theory is a Marxist-based social theory which argues that individuals and groups (social classes) within society have differing amounts of material and non-material resources (such as the wealthy vs. the poor) and that the more powerful groups use their power in order to exploit groups with less power.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
The two methods by which this exploitation is done are through brute force usually done by police and the army and economics. Earlier social conflict theorists argue that money is the mechanism which creates social disorder. The theory further states that society is created from ongoing social conflict between various groups. There are other theories of deviance, such as the functionalist theory, the control theory and the strain theory. It also refers to various types of positive social interaction that may occur within social relationships.
"Consider paying rent towards housing. The conflict theorist argues that this relationship is unequal and favors the owners. Renters may pay rent for 50 years and still gain absolutely no right or economic interest with the property. It is this type of relationship which the conflict theorist will use to show that social relationships are about power and exploitation."  Padgitt continues, "Marx argued that through a dialectic process, social evolution was directed by the result of class conflict. Marxism argues that human history is all about this conflict, a result of the strong-rich exploiting the poor-weak. From such a perspective, money is made through the exploitation of the worker. It is argued thus, that in order for a factory owner to make money, he must pay his workers less than they deserve."[tpl]Citation needed|reason=In which book did Padgitt write this?|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Thus, the social conflict theory states that groups within a capitalist society tend to interact in a destructive way, that allows no mutual benefit and little cooperation.  The solution Marxism proposes to this problem is that of a workers' revolution to break the political and economic domination of the capitalist class with the aim of reorganising society along the lines of collective ownership and mass democratic control.

Several of the themes touched upon in the book were previously glimpsed in The Sandman graphic novels.
The book was published in 2001 by Headline in the United Kingdom and by William Morrow in the United States. A special 10th Anniversary edition, with the "author's preferred text", which includes an additional 12,000 words was published by William Morrow in June 2011.

CATEGORIES: Japanese cuisine

Tentsuyu (Japanese: てんつゆ/天汁) is Japanese tempura dip. 
The recipe for tentsuyu depends on the seasons and on the ingredients for which tentsuyu is being prepared. A general, all-purpose, tentsuyu might consist of three parts dashi, one part mirin, and one part soy sauce. For ingredients with strong odors or flavors, however, sake and sugar might be used instead of mirin, or more or less shoyu might be used.
Similar ingredients make up the simmering sauce for donburi and the broth for dishes like agedashi tofu (deep-fried tofu in broth) and soba (buckwheat noodles).
Tentsuyu in concentrated form is commonly sold in a small bottles in supermarkets and grocery stores throughout Japan—and also in Asian grocery stores in the US. 
When used for tempura, tentsuyu is commonly served with grated daikon white radish.

[[Orbital mechanics]]

CATEGORIES: Astrodynamics

Orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft.  The motion of these objects is usually calculated from Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation.  It is a core discipline within space mission design and control.  Celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity, including both spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, planets, moons, and comets.  Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories, including orbital maneuvers, orbit plane changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers.  General relativity is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calculating orbits, and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (such as orbits close to the Sun).

Doctor John Dolittle is the central character of a series of children's books by Hugh Lofting starting with the 1920 The Story of Doctor Dolittle. He is a doctor who shuns human patients in favour of animals, with whom he can speak in their own languages. He later becomes a naturalist, using his abilities to speak with animals to better understand nature and the history of the world.Schmidt, G.D.(1992). Hugh Lofting. New York: Twayne Publishing
Doctor Dolittle first saw light in the author's illustrated letters to children, written from the trenches during World War I when actual news, he later said, was either too horrible or too dull. The stories are set in early Victorian England, where Doctor John Dolittle lives in the fictional village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh in the West Country.
Doctor Dolittle has a few close human friends, including Tommy Stubbins and Matthew Mugg, the Cats'-Meat Man. The animal team includes Polynesia (a parrot), Gub-Gub (a pig), Jip (a dog), Dab-Dab (a duck), Chee-Chee (a monkey), Too-Too (an owl), the Pushmi-pullyu, and a White Mouse later named simply "Whitey".

[[Gentile]]
CATEGORIES: Bible, Christian terms, Ethno-cultural designations, Christianity and Judaism, Latin words and phrases, Latter Day Saint doctrines, beliefs, and practices

The term Gentile (from Latin [tpl]lang|la|gentilis[/tpl], by the French "gentil", feminine: "gentille", meaning of or belonging to a clan or tribe) is used by English translators for the Hebrew [tpl]lang|he|גוי[/tpl] ([tpl]transl|he|goy[/tpl]) and [tpl]lang|he|נכרי[/tpl] ([tpl]transl|he|nokhri[/tpl]) in the Hebrew Bible and the Greek word [tpl]lang|grc|ἔθνη[/tpl] ([tpl]transl|grc|éthnē[/tpl]) in the New Testament.
The term gentiles is derived from Latin, used for contextual translation, and not an original Hebrew or Greek word from the Bible. The original words Goy and Ethnos refer to "peoples" or "nations". Latin and later English translators selectively used the term gentiles when the context for the base term "peoples" or "nations" referred to non-Israelite peoples or nations in English translations of the Bible.
Following Christianization of the Roman Empire, the general implication of the word gentile became "non-Jew".

The Volkswagen Golf is a compact car produced by the German manufacturer Volkswagen since 1974, marketed worldwide across seven generations, in various body configurations and under various nameplates – as the Volkswagen Rabbit in the United States and Canada (Mk1 and Mk5), and as the Volkswagen Caribe in Mexico (Mk1).
The original Golf Mk1 was a front-wheel drive, front-engined replacement for the air-cooled, rear-engined, rear-wheel drive Volkswagen Beetle. Historically, the Golf is Volkswagen's best-selling model and the world's second best-selling model, with more than 29 million built by 2012.[tpl]cite news |author=Gareth Kent |title=VW Golf build passes 25 million |work=carmagazine.co.uk |date=30 March 2007 |url= http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/Industry-News/VW-Golf-build-passes-25-million-/?&R=EPI-3666 |accessdate=11 March 2008[/tpl]
Most production of the Golf was initially in the 3-door hatchback style.Figures for 1974 to 1987: 4.7 million 3-door models, 2.55 million 5-doors, according to: [tpl]cite book|title=Deutsche Autos 1945–1990, vol.3|last=Oswald |first=Werner|year=2001|publisher=Motorbuch Verlag|location= Stuttgart|isbn=3-613-02116-1|pages=86–87[/tpl] Other variants include a 5-door hatchback, estate/wagon (Variant, from 1993), convertible (Cabriolet and Cabrio, 1979–2002, 2011–present), and a Golf-derived notchback saloon/sedan, variously called Volkswagen Jetta, Volkswagen Vento (from 1992) or Volkswagen Bora (from 1999). The cars have filled many market segments, from basic personal cars, to high-performance hot hatches.
The Volkswagen Golf has won many awards throughout its history. The Volkswagen Golf won the World Car of the Year in 2009 with the Volkswagen Golf Mk6 and in 2013 with the Volkswagen Golf Mk7. Every generation of Golf has been a runner-up in the European Car of the Year awards and two have been winners, the Golf Mk3 in 1992 and the Golf Mk7 in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1992_1/coty |title=Previous Winners |language=[tpl]es icon[/tpl] |publisher=Car of the Year |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09[/tpl] The Volkswagen Golf has made the Car and Driver annual 10Best list multiple times.

Vézelay Abbey (now known as Basilique Sainte-Marie-Madeleine) was a Benedictine and Cluniac monastery in Vézelay in the Yonne department in northern Burgundy, France. The Benedictine abbey church of Ste-Marie-Madeleine (or Basilica of St. Mary Magdalene), with its complicated program of imagery in sculpted capitals and portals, is one of the outstanding masterpieces of Burgundian Romanesque art and architecture. Sacked by the Huguenots in 1569,  the building suffered neglect in the 17th and the 18th centuries  and some further damage during the period of the French Revolution.Charles Porée, L’abbayede Vézelay, Paris 1930, pp. 18-19.  
The church and hill at Vézelay were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1979.

[[Differential heat treatment]]
CATEGORIES: Metal heat treatments

Differential heat treatment (also called selective heat treatment or local heat treatment) is a technique used during heat treating to harden or soften certain areas of a steel object, creating a difference in hardness between these areas. There are many techniques for creating a difference in properties, but most can be defined as either differential hardening or differential tempering.
Differential hardening consists of either two methods. It can involve heating the metal evenly to a red-hot temperature and then cooling it at different rates, turning part of the object into very hard martensite while the rest cools slower and becomes softer pearlite. It may also consist of heating only a part of the object very quickly to red-hot and then rapidly cooling (quenching), turning only part of it into hard martensite but leaving the rest unchanged. Conversely, differential tempering methods consist of heating the object evenly to red-hot and then quenching the entire object, turning the whole thing into martensite. The object is then heated to a much lower temperature to soften it (tempering), but is only heated in a localized area, softening only a part of it.

CATEGORIES: Metal forming

Forging is a manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: "cold", "warm", or "hot" forging. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to 580 metric tons.Degarmo, p. 389 Forged parts usually require further processing to achieve a finished part. Forging as an art form started with the desire to produce decorative objects from precious metals. Today, forging is a major world-wide industry that has significantly contributed to humanity's development.[tpl]cite web|title=Forging: The Early Years|url=http://www.steelforge.com/literature/history-of-forgings/|publisher=All Metals & Forge Group|accessdate=1 October 2013[/tpl]

[[Heat treating]]

CATEGORIES: Metal heat treatments

Heat treating is a group of industrial and metalworking processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material. The most common application is metallurgical. Heat treatments are also used in the manufacture of many other materials, such as glass. Heat treatment involves the use of heating or chilling, normally to extreme temperatures, to achieve a desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. Heat treatment techniques include annealing, case hardening, precipitation strengthening, tempering and quenching. It is noteworthy that while the term heat treatment applies only to processes where the heating and cooling are done for the specific purpose of altering properties intentionally, heating and cooling often occur incidentally during other manufacturing processes such as hot forming or welding.

Salford ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|l|f|ɚ|d[/tpl] [tpl]respell|SOL|fərd[/tpl]) lies at the heart of the City of Salford, a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, in North West England. Salford is sited in a meander of the River Irwell, which forms in part its boundary with the city of Manchester to the east. The Salford wards of Broughton and Kersal are on the other side of the river. Together with its neighbouring towns to the west, Salford forms the local government district of the City of Salford, which is administered from Swinton. The former County Borough of Salford, which included Broughton, Pendleton and Kersal, was granted honorific city status in 1926; it has a resident population of 72,750 and occupies an area of [tpl]convert|8.1|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl].

Historically in Lancashire, Salford's early history is marked by its status as a Royal caput and the judicial seat of the ancient hundred of Salfordshire, to which it lent its name. It was granted a charter by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, in about 1230, making Salford a free borough. During the early stages of its growth, Salford was of greater cultural and commercial importance than its neighbour Manchester,[tpl]Harvnb|Frangopulo|1977|pp=135–138[/tpl]. although most contemporary sources agree that since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries that position has been reversed.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/December 06-consultation-summary-final-doc-3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Salford West Strategic Regeneration Framework and Action Plan|author=Salford City Council |date=December 2006 |accessdate=11 November 2007 |publisher=salford.gov.uk[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Salford became a major factory town and inland port during the 18th and 19th centuries. Cotton and silk spinning and weaving in local mills attracted an influx of families and provided Salford with a strong economy. Salford Docks was a principal dockyard of the Manchester Ship Canal. By the end of the 19th century Salford had an enlarged working class community and suffered from chronic overpopulation. Industrial activities declined during the 20th century however, causing a local economic depression. Salford subsequently became one of contrasts, with regenerated inner-city areas like Salford Quays next to some of the most socially deprived and violent areas in England.[tpl]Harvnb|Cooper|2005|p=47[/tpl].

[[Sex differences in medicine]]

CATEGORIES: Health, Sex

Sex differences in medicine include sex-specific diseases, which are diseases that occur only in people of one sex; and sex-related diseases, which are diseases that are more common to one sex, or which manifest differently in each sex.  For example, certain autoimmune diseases may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of primary biliary cirrhosis cases are women, whereas primary sclerosing cholangitis is more common in  men. Gender-based medicine, also called "gender medicine", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients. More recently, medical research has started to understand the importance of taking the sex in to count as the symptoms and responses to medical treatment may be very different between sexes.

Nelson Algren (March 28, 1909 – May 9, 1981) was an American writer. He may be best known for The Man with the Golden Arm, a 1949 novel that won the National Book Award and was adapted as a 1955 film of the same name.
According to Harold Augenbraum, "in the late 1940s and early 1950s he was one of the best known literary writers in America." The lover of French writer Simone de Beauvoir, he was featured as the hero of her novel The Mandarins, set in Paris and Chicago. 
He is considered "a bard of the down-and-outer", based on this book and his novel A Walk on the Wild Side (1956). The latter was adapted as a play by the same name, produced in 195x on Broadway. Its fame increased with Lou Reed's song of the same name. title.[ref]"1950". Harold Augenbraum and staff. 60 Years of Honoring Great American Books (book-a-day blog), June 18, 2009.

The international name for the body of water which is bordered by Japan, North Korea, Russia, and South Korea is disputed. In 1992, objections to the name Sea of Japan were first raised by North Korea and South Korea at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/maritime/japan/index.html|title=The Issue of the Name of the Sea of Japan|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan[/tpl]  The Japanese government supports the use of the name "Sea of Japan", while South Korea supports the name "East Sea", and North Korea supports the name "East Sea of Korea".  Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or equivalent translation) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea, often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name.  The International Hydrographic Organization, the international governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world, in 2012 decided not to change the current single name "Sea of Japan" rejecting the South Korea's request to use "East Sea" together with "Sea of Japan"."IHO rejects Japan's proposal to rule out East Sea name", YONHAP NEWS AGENCY, 26 April 2012. Retrieved 26 July 2013.Kyodo News, "Sea of Japan name dispute rolls on", Japan Times, 3 May 2012, p. 3; Kyodo News, "IHO nixes 'East Sea' name bid", Japan Times, 28 April 2012, p. 2; Rabiroff, Jon, and Yoo Kyong Chang, "Agency rejects South Korea's request to rename Sea of Japan", Stars and Stripes, 28 April 2012, p. 5."IHO delays decision on Korea’s request for East Sea name to 2017", The Korea Herald, 26 April 2012, Retrieved 26 July 2013."IHO Puts Off East Sea Decision Until 2017", The Chosun Ilbo, 26 April 2012, Retrieved 26 July 2013.
The involved countries (especially Japan and South Korea) have advanced a variety of arguments to support their preferred name(s).  Many of the arguments revolve around determining when the name Sea of Japan became the common name.  South Korea argues that historically the more common name was East Sea, Sea of Korea, or another similar variant.  South Korea further argues that the name Sea of Japan did not become common until Korea was under Japanese rule, at which time it had no ability to influence international affairs.  Japan argues that the name Sea of Japan has been the most common international name since at least the beginning of the 19th century, long before its annexation of Korea.  Both sides have conducted studies of antiquarian maps, but the two countries have produced divergent research results.  Additional arguments have been raised regarding the underlying geography of the sea as well as potential problems regarding the ambiguity of one name or the other.

[[Bishōnen]]

CATEGORIES: Androgyny, Japanese culture, Japanese words and phrases, Stock characters in anime and manga, Japanese sex terms

[tpl]nihongo|Bishōnen|美少年|extra=also transliterated [tpl]Audio|ja-bishonen.ogg|bishounen[/tpl][/tpl] is a Japanese term literally meaning "beautiful youth (boy)". Though cross-gender appeal, ambiguous sexuality, or even gender ambiguity are often played up in fiction, both realistically and just for comedy, note that any linguistic similarity to "bisexual" or derivatives thereof are wholly coincidental. The "bi" (pronounced as bee) prefix to "shounen" (boy) is a purely Japanese play on words, suggesting a beauty more in line with feminine appeal in one who is most definitely a young male. 
The term describes an aesthetic that can be found in disparate areas in East Asia: a young man whose beauty (and sexual appeal) transcends the boundary of gender or sexual orientation. It has always shown the strongest manifestation in Japanese pop culture, gaining in popularity due to the androgynous glam rock bands of the 1970s,[tpl]cite book | last = Orbaugh | first =Sharalyn | editor = Sandra Buckley | title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 2002 | location = | pages = 45–56 | isbn = 0-415-14344-6 [/tpl] but it has roots in ancient Japanese literature, the homosocial and homoerotic ideals of the medieval Chinese imperial court and intellectuals, and Indian aesthetic concepts carried over from Hinduism, imported with Buddhism to China.[tpl]cite book | last = Buckley | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 2002 | location = | pages = 188, 522, 553 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-14344-6 [/tpl]
Also note that said alternative charisma is by no means unspeakable, taboo, or even open secret; young women make no attempt to hide their attraction, while more masculine heterosexual peers take no issue with recognizing bishounen as potentially fearsome rivals with enviable traits. Unlike in certain Western cultures, such admissions are no-risk, devoid of social stigma, and not normally expected to cast any doubts over one's own sexuality.
Today, bishōnen are very popular among girls and women in Japan.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tan|first=Caroline S.L.|year=2008|title=Of Senses and Men's Cosmetics: Sensory Branding in Men's Cosmetics in Japan|journal=European Journal of Social Sciences|volume=6|issue=1|pages=7–25|url=http://www.eurojournals.com/ejss_6_1.pdf[/tpl] Reasons for this social phenomenon may include the unique male and female social relationships found within the genre. Some have theorized that bishōnen provide a non-traditional outlet for gender relations. Moreover, it breaks down stereotypes surrounding feminine male characters. These are often depicted with very strong martial arts abilities, sports talent, high intelligence, or comedic flair, traits that are usually assigned to the hero/protagonist.[tpl]cite book|last=Pflugfelder|first=Gregory M.|title=Cartographies of desire: male-male sexuality in Japanese discourse, 1600-1950|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|pages=221–234|isbn=0-520-20909-5[/tpl]

[[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptographic algorithms, Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators, Cryptographic primitives

A cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) is a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) with properties that make it suitable for use in cryptography.
Many aspects of cryptography require random numbers, for example:
The "quality" of the randomness required for these applications varies.
For example creating a nonce in some protocols needs only uniqueness.
On the other hand, generation of a master key requires a higher quality, such as more entropy. And in the case of one-time pads, the information-theoretic guarantee of perfect secrecy only holds if the key material comes from a true random source with high entropy.
Ideally, the generation of random numbers in CSPRNGs uses entropy obtained from a high-quality source, which might be a hardware random number generator or perhaps unpredictable system processes — though unexpected correlations have been found in several such ostensibly independent processes. From an information-theoretic point-of-view, the amount of randomness, the entropy that can be generated, is equal to the entropy provided by the system. But sometimes, in practical situations, more random numbers are needed than there is entropy available. Also the processes to extract randomness from a running system are slow in actual practice.  In such instances, a CSPRNG can sometimes be used. A CSPRNG can "stretch" the available entropy over more bits.
Note also the usage CPRNG (cryptographic pseudo-random number generator).

CATEGORIES: Cuts (earthmoving), Construction, Physical infrastructure

A trench is a type of excavation or depression in the ground that is generally deeper than it is wide (as opposed to a wider gully or ditch), and narrow compared to its length (as opposed to a simple hole).Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Volume 8, Page 374 (Code revised as of July 1, 2003, via Compliance Magazine website)[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] 
In geology, trenches are created as a result of erosion by rivers or by geological movement of tectonic plates. In the civil engineering field of construction or maintenance of infrastructure, trenches are created to install underground infrastructure or utilities (such as gas mains, water mains or telephone lines), or later to search for these installations.  Trenches have often been dug for military defensive purposes. In archaeology, the "trench method" is used for searching and excavating ancient ruins or to dig into strata of sedimented material.

[[Trench warfare]]

CATEGORIES: Military doctrines, Military strategy, Subterranea (geography), Warfare by type, Trench warfare

Trench warfare is a form of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most prominent case of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate,  attrition and futility in conflict.
Trench warfare occurred when a revolution in firepower was not matched by similar advances in mobility, resulting in a grueling form of warfare in which the defender held the advantage. In World War I, both sides constructed elaborate trench and dugout systems opposing each other along a front, protected from assault by barbed wire. The area between opposing trench lines (known as "no man's land") was fully exposed to artillery fire from both sides. Attacks, even if successful, often sustained severe casualties.

The Boston Marathon is an annual marathon hosted by several cities in Greater Boston in eastern Massachusetts. It is always held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April. Begun in 1897, inspired by the success of the first modern-day marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics, the Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors.
Since 1897, the Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has managed this event. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly New England terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.
The event attracts 500,000 spectators each year, making it New England's most widely viewed sporting event. Though starting with 18 participants in 1897, the event now attracts an average of about 30,000 registered participants each year, with 26,839 people entering in 2013.  The Centennial Boston Marathon in 1996 established a record as the world's largest marathon with 38,708 entrants, 36,748 starters, and 35,868 finishers.

The Dewoitine D.520 was French fighter aircraft that entered service in early 1940, shortly after the beginning of World War II. Unlike the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, which was at that time the most numerous fighter in the French Air Force, the Dewoitine D.520 came close to being a match for the latest German types, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109. It was slower than the Bf 109E but superior in manoeuvrability.Angelucci and Matricardi  1978, p. 262. Because of a delayed production cycle, only a small number were available for combat with the Luftwaffe.
The D.520 was designed in response to a 1936 requirement from the French Air Force for a fast, modern fighter with a good climbing speed and an armament centred on a 20 mm cannon. At the time the most powerful V 12 liquid cooled engine available in France was the Hispano-Suiza 12Y, which was less powerful, but lighter, than contemporary engines such as the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Daimler-Benz DB 601. Other fighters were designed to meet the specifications but none of them entered service, or entered service in small numbers and too late to play a significant role during the Battle of France.

[[List of winners of the Boston Marathon]]

CATEGORIES: Boston Marathon winners, Lists of marathon winners

This page lists the winners of the Boston Marathon, which has been running continuously since 1897 and is the oldest annual marathon in the world. The first race, run in 1897, included only 15 runners, all of whom were men. Women were only officially allowed to run the race beginning in 1972, though female runners had unofficially participated beginning in 1966 despite the opposition of the Boston Athletic Association, the race sponsor. The Boston Marathon became the first major marathon to include a wheelchair division in 1975 for men, and added a wheelchair division for women in 1977.
Many marathon champions have repeated their feats in following years. The record for most repeated championships stands at 9, held by Ernst van Dyk in the Men's Wheelchair division. In the Men's Open division, Clarence DeMar holds the distinction of most wins with 7, and Catherine Ndereba tops the Women's Open division with 4. The United States has had more winners than any other country, followed by Kenya and Canada. The United States and Canada dominated the early years of the race, and it wasn't until the 36th race, in 1932, that someone from outside North America, Paul de Bruyn of Germany, won the race. During the period from World War II through the 1980s, there was much more national diversity among Boston Marathon champions, but the last two decades have seen Kenya emerge as the dominant nationality, especially in the Men's Open division, which (as of 2013) has been won by Kenyans in 19 of the past 23 years. 
The [tpl]convert|42.195|km|mi[/tpl] length of the marathon was not fixed before the 1924 Paris Olympics, and the Boston course varied as well. Prior to 1924 the course distance was approximately [tpl]convert|24.5|mi|km[/tpl]. Even after the standardization of marathon lengths, the Boston course was off by nearly 200 yards from the correct distance until the mistake was discovered and corrected in 1927. The course grew gradually shorter in the 1950s as road re-construction straightened  curves.  This time, upon remeasurement the course was found to lack nearly 1200 yards, and was corrected beginning with the 1957 race.  Due to these changes, the marathon recognizes several course records that are slower than previous records due to being run on longer courses. 26 world records have been set on the Boston Marathon course, one in the Men's Open Division, two in the Women's Open, 13 in the Men's Wheelchair, and 10 in the Women's Wheelchair.

[[Food energy]]
CATEGORIES: Nutrition

Food energy is energy that animals (including humans) derive from their food, through the process of cellular respiration, the process of joining oxygen with the molecules of food (aerobic respiration) or of reorganizing the atoms within the molecules for anaerobic respiration.
Humans and other animals need a minimum intake of food energy to sustain their metabolism and drive their muscles.  Foods are composed chiefly of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals.  Carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water represent virtually all the weight of food, with vitamins and minerals making up only a small percentage of the weight.  Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins comprise ninety percent of the dry weight of foods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec12/ch152/ch152b.html |title=Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Fats: Overview of Nutrition|work=  The Merck Manual[/tpl]  Food energy is derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins as well as organic acids, polyols, and ethanol present in the diet.Ross, K. A. (2000c) Energy and fuel, in Littledyke M., Ross K. A. and Lakin E. (eds), Science Knowledge and the Environment. London: David Fulton Publishers.  Some diet components that provide little or no food energy, such as water, minerals, vitamins, cholesterol, and fibre, may still be necessary to health and survival for other reasons.  Water, minerals, vitamins, and cholesterol are not broken down (they are used by the body in the form in which they are absorbed) and so cannot be used for energy.  Fiber, a type of carbohydrate, cannot be completely digested by the human body.  Ruminants can extract food energy from the respiration of cellulose thanks to bacteria in their rumens.
In the International System of Units, energy is measured in joules (J) or its multiples; the kilojoule (kJ) is most often used for food-related quantities.  An older metric system unit of energy, still widely used in food-related contexts, is the calorie; more precisely, the "food calorie", "large calorie" or kilocalorie (kcal or Cal), equal to 4.184 kilojoules. (It should not be confused with the "small calorie" (cal) that is often used in chemistry and physics, equal to 1/1000 of a food calorie.)  Within the European Union, both the kilocalorie ("kcal") and kilojoule ("kJ") appear on nutrition labels. In many countries, only one of the units is displayed; in the US and Canada the unit is spelled out as "calorie" or "Calorie".
Fats and ethanol have the greatest amount of food energy per mass, 37 and 29 kJ/g (8.8 and 6.9 kcal/g), respectively. Proteins and most carbohydrates have about [tpl]convert|17|kJ/g|kcal/g|abbr=on[/tpl]. The differing energy density of foods (fat, alcohols, carbohydrates and proteins) lies mainly in their varying proportions of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates that are not easily absorbed, such as fiber, or lactose in lactose-intolerant individuals, contribute less food energy. Polyols (including sugar alcohols) and organic acids contribute [tpl]convert|10|kJ/g|kcal/g|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|13|kJ/g|kcal/g|abbr=on[/tpl] respectively.  The amount of water, fat, and fiber in foods determines their energy density.
Theoretically, food energy could be measured in different ways, such as Gibbs free energy of combustion, or the amount of ATP generated by metabolizing the food. However, the convention is to use the heat of the oxidation reaction, with the water substance produced being in the liquid phase. Conventional food energy is based on heats of combustion in a bomb calorimeter and corrections that take into consideration the efficiency of digestion and absorption and the production of urea and other substances in the urine. These were worked out in the late 19th century by the American chemist Wilbur Atwater."Why food labels are wrong" by Bijal Trivedi, New Scientist, 18 July 2009, pp. 30-3. See Atwater system for more detail.
Each food item has a specific metabolizable energy intake (MEI). This value can be approximated by multiplying the total amount of energy associated with a food item by 85%, which is the typical amount of energy actually obtained by a human after respiration has been completed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]  In animal nutrition where energy is a critical element of the economics of meat production, a specific metabolizable energy may be determined for each component (protein, fat, etc.) of each ingredient of the feed.

The Victoria Bridge is a vehicular and pedestrian bridge over the Brisbane River. The current bridge, opened in 1969, is the third permanent crossing erected at this location. It is shared by vehicular traffic, pedestrians and cyclists.
Victoria Bridge connects South Brisbane near the South Bank Parklands and Queensland Cultural Centre to the Brisbane central business district (CBD) at North Quay.
Half of the road space on the bridge is now given over to the South-East Busway. In the Brisbane City Centre Draft Masterplan, a new crossing immediately adjacent to the Victoria Bridge, tentatively named the Adelaide Street Bridge (the name of the connecting street in the CBD), will carry pedestrian, cyclist, bus and possibly light-rail traffic, freeing up the Victoria Bridge for general road traffic as it was before.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]

The Centenary Bridge is a motorway crossing of the Brisbane River.  
As it forms part of Brisbane's Centenary Motorway it is used primarily by vehicular traffic, although it includes footpaths for pedestrian traffic.
Built to service the new "Centenary" suburbs of Jindalee, Mount Ommaney and Westlake, the original two lane bridge opened in 1964.http://waywewere.couriermail.com.au/image-detail.php?search_field=%20new%20suburb%20of%20Jindalee&offset=0&return=L3NlYXJjaC1yZXN1bHRzLnBocD9zZWFyY2hfZmllbGQ9K25ldytzdWJ1cmIrb2YrSmluZGFsZWU=http://queenslandplaces.com.au/jindalee
The bridge was duplicated as part of an upgrade of the Centenary Highway and Western Freeway south of Mount Cootha Road. The works were officially opened by Russell Hinze, Minister for Main Roads, on 27 March 1987.http://cshsoc.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cbridge-duplication-plaque-2010-cdh-rrpark-010.jpg
During the 1974 floods, the bridge was badly damaged when a barge rammed into its upstream side.  The barge blocked the flow of floodwaters under the bridge and there were real fears that the bridge would collapse.  The barge was deliberately holed using explosives and allowed to sink to reduce the floodwater pressure on the bridge.   When the floodwater receded the barge was refloated and beached downstream near Fig Tree Pocket to be cut up for scrap.  The damage sustained by the bridge required its partial closure for repairs.  For two years after the floods, the bridge was reduced to a single lane, with one way traffic controlled by traffic lights at each end of the bridge.

[[Small sword]]

CATEGORIES: Early Modern European swords, English Civil War weapons, 18th-century weapons, Victorian-era weapons of the United Kingdom

The small sword or smallsword (also court sword, fr: épée de cour or dress sword) is a light one-handed sword designed for thrusting which evolved out of the longer and heavier rapier of the late Renaissance. The height of the small sword's popularity was between mid 17th and late 18th century. It is thought to have appeared in France and spread quickly across the rest of Europe. The small sword was the immediate predecessor of the French duelling sword (from which the épée developed) and its method of use—as typified in the works of such authors as Sieur de Liancour, Domenico Angelo, Monsieur J. Olivier, and Monsieur L'Abbat—developed into the techniques of the French classical school of fencing. Small swords were also used as status symbols and fashion accessories; for most of the 18th century anyone, civilian or military, with pretensions to gentlemanly status would have worn a small sword on a daily basis.
The small sword could be a highly effective duelling weapon, and some systems for the use of the bayonet were developed using the method of the smallsword as their foundation, (including perhaps most notably, that of Alfred Hutton).
Militarily, small swords continued to be used as a standard sidearm for infantry officers. In some branches with strong traditions, this practice continues to the modern day, albeit for ceremonial and formal dress only. The carrying of swords by officers in combat conditions was frequent in World War I and still saw some practice in World War II. The 1913 U.S. Army Manual of Bayonet Drill[tpl]cite book | title=Infantry Drill Regulations, U.S. Army |publisher= Military Publishing Co |location= New York | year= 1911 With Text Corrections to February 12, 1917, changes No. 18 |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/infantrydrillreg00uswauoft/infantrydrillreg00uswauoft_djvu.txt[/tpl] includes instructions for how to fight a man on foot with a small sword. Small swords are still featured on parade uniforms of some corps.
As a rule, the blade of a small sword is comparatively short at around [tpl]convert|0.6|to|0.85|m|in[/tpl], though some reach over [tpl]convert|0.9|m|in[/tpl]. It usually tapers to a sharp point but may lack a cutting edge. It is typically triangular in cross-section, although some of the early examples still have the rhombic and spindle-shaped cross-sections inherited from older weapons, like the rapier. This triangular cross-section may be hollow ground for additional lightness. Many small swords of the period between the 17th and 18th centuries were found with colichemarde blades.

The Carte du Ciel (literally, 'Map of the Sky') and the Astrographic Catalogue (or Astrographic Chart) were two distinct but connected components of a massive international astronomical project, initiated in the late 19th century, to catalogue and map the positions of millions of stars as faint as 11th or 12th magnitude. Twenty observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 (glass) photographic plates in an enormous observing programme extending over several decades. Despite, or because of, its vast scale, the project was only ever partially successful – the Carte du Ciel component was never completed, and for almost half a century the Astrographic Catalogue part was largely ignored. However, the appearance of the Hipparcos Catalogue in 1997 has led to an important development in the use of this historical plate material.

The cubit is an archaic unit of length based on the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. Cubits of various lengths were employed in many parts of the world in antiquity, during the Middle Ages and as recently as Early Modern Times. The term is still used in hedge laying, the length of the forearm being frequently used to determine the interval between stakes placed within the hedge.http://www.shropshirehedgelaying.co.uk/hedgelaying_article_3.php

The instrumental temperature record shows fluctuations of the temperature of earth's climate system.  Initially the instrumental temperature record only documented land and sea surface temperature, but in recent decades instruments have also begun recording sub-surface ocean temperature.  This data is collected from several thousand meteorological stations, Antarctic research stations, satellite observations of sea-surface temperature, and subsurface ocean sensors.  The longest-running temperature record is the Central England temperature data series, that starts in 1659. The longest-running quasi-global record starts in 1850.[tpl]cite journal |author=Brohan, P., J.J. Kennedy, I. Harris, S.F.B. Tett, P.D.

[[George Brunies]]
CATEGORIES: 1902 births, 1974 deaths, Dixieland jazz musicians, Jazz musicians from New Orleans, Louisiana, American jazz trombonists

George Brunies, aka Georg Brunis, (February 6, 1902 – November 19, 1974) was a jazz trombonist who came to fame in the 1930s, and was part of the Dixieland revival. He was known as the "King of the Tailgate Trombone".Stetler, Susan L. (editor) (1987) "Brunis, George" Biography Almanac (3rd edition) Gale Research Company, Detroit, page 257, ISBN 0-8103-2142-4 (set)
George Clarence Brunies was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 6, 1902 into a very musical family.  His father led a family band, and his brothers Henry, Merritt, Richard, and Albert ("Abbie") all became noted professional musicians. By the age of 8 young George was already playing alto horn professionally in Papa Jack Laine's band.  A few years later he switched to trombone. He played with many jazz, dance, and parade bands in New Orleans.  He never learned to read music, but could quickly pick up tunes and invent a part for his instrument.
He first went to Chicago in 1919 with a band led by Ragbaby Stevens, then worked on riverboats going up and down the Mississippi River. In 1921 he returned to Chicago and joined a band of his New Orleans friends playing at the Friar's Inn; this was the band that became famous as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings.  Brunies's trombone style was influential to the young Chicago players, and his records were much copied. In this era Brunies was never bested; he could play anything any other trombonist could play as well or better.  He would often end battles of the bands or "cutting contests" by outplaying other trombonists while operating the slide with his foot!
After the Rhythm Kings broke up in Chicago in 1924, Brunies joined the nationally famous Ted Lewis band, which he played with through 1934.
After some time with Louis Prima's band he landed a steady gig at the famous 
New York City jazz club Nick's through 1938.  In 1939 he joined Muggsy Spanier's band, with whom he made some of his most famous recordings.
The following year he returned to Nick's, where he remained through 1946. Brunies then worked with Eddie Condon.
In 1949 Brunies moved back to Chicago to lead his own band.  Brunies often showed off his unusual technical abilities and bizarre sense of humor at the same time; for example he would lie on the floor and invite the largest person in the audience to sit on his chest while he played trombone.
On the advice of a numerologist, he changed his name to Georg Brunis in the 1960s in the belief that this would increase his good luck.
Georg Brunis died in Chicago on November 19, 1974.

[[Droop quota]]

CATEGORIES: Single transferable vote, Voting system quotas

The Droop quota is the quota most commonly used in elections held under the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system. It is also sometimes used in elections held under the largest remainder method of party-list proportional representation (list PR). In an STV election the quota is the minimum number of votes a candidate must receive in order to be elected. Any votes a candidate receives above the quota are transferred to another candidate. The Droop quota was devised in 1868 by the English lawyer and mathematician Henry Richmond Droop (1831–1884) as a replacement for the earlier Hare quota.
Today the Droop quota is used in almost all STV elections, including the forms of STV used in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Malta and Australia, among other places. The Droop quota is very similar to the simpler Hagenbach-Bischoff quota, which is also sometimes loosely referred to as the 'Droop quota'.

[[Thermoplastic]]

CATEGORIES: Plastics

A thermoplastic, also called a thermosoftening plastic, is a polymer which becomes pliable or moldable above a specific temperature and returns to a solid state upon cooling.http://www.lgschemistry.org.uk/PDF/Thermosoftening_and_thermosetting_plastics.pdf[tpl]cite journal | author= Baeurle SA, Hotta A, Gusev AA | title= On the glassy state of multiphase and pure polymer materials| journal=Polymer | year=2006 | volume=47 | pages=6243–6253 | doi=10.1016/j.polymer.2006.05.076[/tpl]
Most thermoplastics have a high molecular weight. The polymer chains associate through intermolecular forces,  which permits thermoplastics to be remolded because the intermolecular interactions increase upon cooling and restore the bulk properties. In this way, thermoplastics differ from thermosetting polymers, which form irreversible chemical bonds during the curing process. Thermosets often do not melt, but break down and do not reform upon cooling.
Above its glass transition temperature, Tg, and below its melting point, Tm, the physical properties of a thermoplastic change drastically without an associated phase change. Within this temperature range, most thermoplastics are rubbery due to alternating rigid crystalline and elastic amorphous regions, approximating random coils. [tpl]citation needed|reason=This is also on the random coil page, not cited on either, but is also sort of common sense chemistry|date=June 2012[/tpl]
Some thermoplastics do not fully crystallize above glass transition temperature Tg, retaining some, or all of their amorphous characteristics. Amorphous and semi-amorphous plastics are used when high optical clarity is necessary, as light is scattered strongly by crystallites larger than its wavelength. Amorphous and semi-amorphous plastics are less resistant to chemical attack and environmental stress cracking because they lack a crystalline structure.
Brittleness can be decreased with the addition of plasticizers, which increases the mobility of amorphous chain segments to effectively lower Tg. Modification of the polymer through copolymerization or through the addition of non-reactive side chains to monomers before polymerization can also lower Tg. Before these techniques were employed, plastic automobile parts would often crack when exposed to cold temperatures. Recently, thermoplastic elastomers have become available.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

[[Fermi liquid theory]]

CATEGORIES: Condensed matter physics, Fermions, Electronic band structures, Enrico Fermi

Fermi liquid theory (also known as Landau–Fermi liquid theory) is a theoretical model of interacting fermions that describes the normal state of most metals at sufficiently low temperatures.[tpl]cite book|last=Phillips|first=Philip|title=Advanced Solid State Physics|year=2008|publisher=Perseus Books|isbn=978-81-89938-16-1|pages=224[/tpl] The interaction between the particles of the many-body system does not need to be small. The phenomenological theory of Fermi liquids was introduced by the Soviet physicist Lev Davidovich Landau in 1956, and later developed by Alexei Abrikosov and I. M. Khalatnikov using diagrammatic perturbation theory.[tpl]cite web|last=Cross|first=Michael|title=Fermi Liquid Theory: Principles|url=http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~mcc/Ph127/c/Lecture9.pdf|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=14 February 2011[/tpl] The theory explains why some of the properties of an interacting fermion system are very similar to those of the Fermi gas (i.e. non-interacting fermions), and why other properties differ.
Important examples of where Fermi liquid theory has been successfully applied are most notably electrons in most metals and Liquid He-3.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schulz|first=H.

He-3 is an isotope of Helium, with 2 protons, 1 neutron and 2 electrons per atom. Because there is an odd number of fermions inside the atom, the atom itself is also a fermion. The electrons in a normal (non-superconducting) metal also form a Fermi liquid, as do the nucleons (protons and neutrons) in an atomic nucleus. Strontium ruthenate displays some key properties of Fermi liquids, despite being a strongly correlated material, and is compared with high temperature superconductors like cuprates.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wysokiński|first=Carol|author2=et al|title=Spin triplet superconductivity in Sr2RuO4|journal=Physica Status Solidi|year=2003|volume=236|issue=2|doi=10.1002/pssb.200301672|url=http://www.phy.bris.ac.uk/people/annett_jf/papers/physicab.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2012|arxiv = cond-mat/0211199 |bibcode = 2003PSSBR.236..325W [/tpl]

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, widely abbreviated as EDTA (for other names, see Table), is an aminopolycarboxylic acid and a colourless, water-soluble solid. Its conjugate base is named ethylenediaminetetraacetate. It is widely used to dissolve limescale. Its usefulness arises because of its role as a hexadentate ("six-toothed") ligand and chelating agent, i.e. its ability to "sequester" metal ions such as Ca2+ and Fe3+. After being bound by EDTA, metal ions remain in solution but exhibit diminished reactivity.  EDTA is produced as several salts, notably disodium EDTA and calcium disodium EDTA.

Saint Valentine's Day, also known as Valentine's Day  or the Feast of Saint Valentine,Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, Revised ed., Allied Publishers, 2005 ISBN 9780550142108 is a holiday observed on February 14 each year. It is celebrated in many countries around the world, although it is not a holiday in most of them.
St. Valentine's Day began as a liturgical celebration of one or more early Christian saints named Valentinus. Several martyrdom stories were invented for the various Valentines that belonged to February 14, and added to later martyrologies.Ansgar, 1986, Chaucer and the Cult of Saint valentine, pp. 46-58 A popular hagiographical account of Saint Valentine of Rome states that he was imprisoned for performing weddings for soldiers who were forbidden to marry and for ministering to Christians, who were persecuted under the Roman Empire. According to legend, during his imprisonment, he healed the daughter of his jailer, Asterius. An embellishment to this story states that before his execution he wrote her a letter signed "Your Valentine" as a farewell. Today, Saint Valentine's Day is an official feast day in the Anglican Communion,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx|title=Holy Days|year=2012|publisher=Church of England (Anglican Communion)|accessdate=27 October 2012|quote=February 14 Valentine, Martyr at Rome, c.269[/tpl] as well as in the Lutheran Church.[tpl]cite book |last=Pfatteicher|first=Philip H.|title=New Book of Festivals and Commemorations: A Proposed Common Calendar of Saints|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W82FOCZ4hmwC&pg=PA86|accessdate=27 October 2012|date=1 August 2008|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9780800621285|page=86|quote=IO February 14 The Lutheran Service Book, with its penchant for the old Roman calendar, commemorates Valentine on this date.[/tpl] The Eastern Orthodox Church also celebrates Saint Valentine's Day, albeit on July 6 and July 30, the former date in honor of the Roman presbyter Saint Valentine, and the latter date in honor of Hieromartyr Valentine, the Bishop of Interamna (modern Terni). In Brazil, the Dia de São Valentim is recognized on June 12. 
The day was first associated with romantic love in the circle of Geoffrey Chaucer in the High Middle Ages, when the tradition of courtly love flourished. 
In 18th-century England, it  evolved into an occasion in which lovers expressed their love for each other by presenting flowers, offering confectionery, and sending greeting cards (known as "valentines").
Valentine's Day symbols that are used today include the heart-shaped outline, doves, and the figure of the winged Cupid. Since the 19th century, handwritten valentines have given way to mass-produced greeting cards.Leigh Eric Schmidt, "The Fashioning of a Modern Holiday: St. Valentine's Day, 1840–1870" Winterthur Portfolio 28.4 (Winter 1993), pp. 209–245.

Pebbles Flintstone (also known as Pebbles Flintstone-Rubble as an adult) is a fictional character, the red-haired daughter of Fred and Wilma Flintstone who's born near the end of the third season. She's most famous in her infant form on the animated TV show The Flintstones, but has also appeared at various other ages, including as a teenager on the early 1970s spin-off The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show and as an adult in three made-for-television movies. She spent most of her time with Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm were best friends as kids, became boyfriend-and-girlfriend as teenagers, and eventually got married and had children of their own as adults (Pebbles pet name for Bamm-Bamm when they're adults is "Bammer").
Pebbles dwelled in the fictional prehistoric city of Bedrock, a world where dinosaurs coexisted with cavepeople and the cavepeople enjoyed "primitive" versions of modern conveniences such as telephones, automobiles and washing machines.

Indigenous languages of the Americas are spoken by indigenous peoples from Alaska and Greenland to the southern tip of South America, encompassing the land masses that constitute the Americas. These indigenous languages consist of dozens of distinct language families, as well as many language isolates and unclassified languages.
Many proposals to group these into higher-level families have been made, such as in three macrofamilies of Eskimo–Aleut, Na-Dene, and Amerind. This scheme is rejected by nearly all specialists.Campbell, Lyle (1997). American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America. p. 253. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-509427-1.
According to UNESCO, most of the indigenous American languages in North America are critically endangered, and many are already extinct.Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (Ed.). (2005). Ethnologue: Languages of the World (15th ed.). Dallas, Texas: SIL International. ISBN 1-55671-159-X. (Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com) The most widely spoken indigenous language is Southern Quechua, with about 6 to 7 million speakers, primarily in South America.

[[Megabyzus]]

CATEGORIES: 5th-century BC deaths, Persian people of the Greco-Persian Wars, Achaemenid military leaders, Year of birth unknown, 5th-century BC Iranian people

Megabyzus (Old Persian "Bagabuxša" meaning: "God saved") was a Persian general, son of Zopyrus, satrap of Babylon. His father was killed when the satrapy rebelled in 482 BC, and Megabyzus led the forces that recaptured the city, after which the statue of the god Marduk was destroyed to prevent future revolts.  Megabyzus subsequently took part in the expedition against Greece.  Herodotus claims that he refused to act on orders to pillage Delphi, but it is doubtful such orders were ever given.
According to Ctesias, who is not especially reliable but is often our only source, Amytis, wife of Megabyzus and daughter of Xerxes, was accused of adultery shortly afterwards.  As such, Megabyzus took part in the conspiracy of Artabanus to assassinate the emperor, but betrayed him before he could kill the new emperor Artaxerxes as well.  In a battle, Artabanus' sons were killed and Megabyzus was wounded, but Amytis interceded on his behalf and he was cured.
After this Megabyzus became satrap of Syria.  Together with Artabazus, satrap of Phrygia, he had command of the Persian armies sent to put down the revolt of Inarus in Egypt.  They arrived in 456 BC, and within two years had put down the revolt, capturing Inarus and various Athenians supporting him(1).  They then turned their attention to Cyprus, which was under attack by the Athenians, led by Cimon.  Shortly afterwards hostilities between Persia and Athens ceased, called the peace of Callias.
Some time later Megabyzus himself revolted.  Ctesias tells us the reason was that Amestris  had the captives from the Egyptian revolt executed, though Megabyzus had given his word that they would not be harmed.  Armies under Usiris of Egypt and then prince Menostanes, a nephew of the king, were sent against him, both foregoing battle for (non-fatal) duels between the generals, and in both cases Megabyzus was victorious. The king resolved to send his brother Artarius, the eunuch Artoxares and Amytis in a peace embassy. His honour restored, Megabyzus agreed to surrender and was pardoned, retaining his position.  Some time later, Megabyzus saved Artaxerxes from a lion in a hunt, was subsequently exiled to Cyrtae for violating the royal prerogative to make the first kill, but returned to Susa by pretending to be a leper and was pardoned.
Megabyzus died shortly afterwards, at age 76.  His son Zopyrus II is known to have visited Athens, and aided in its assault on Caunus during his father's exile, where he was killed by a rock.

[[Porphyrin]]

CATEGORIES: Biomolecules, Metabolism, Photosynthesis, Supramolecular chemistry, Chelating agents, Porphyrins

Porphyrins are a group of organic compounds, many naturally occurring. One of the best-known porphyrins is heme, the pigment in red blood cells; heme is a cofactor of the protein hemoglobin. Porphyrins are heterocyclic macrocycles composed of four modified pyrrole subunits interconnected at their α carbon atoms via methine bridges (=CH−). Porphyrins are aromatic. That is, they obey Hückel's rule for aromaticity, possessing 4n+2  π electrons (n=4 for the shortest cyclic path) delocalized over the macrocycle. Thus porphyrin macrocycles are highly conjugated systems. As a consequence, they typically have very intense absorption bands in the visible region and may be deeply colored; the name "porphyrin" comes from a Greek word for purple. The macrocycle has 26 pi electrons in total. The parent porphyrin is porphine, and substituted porphines are called porphyrins. The specific porphyrin in heme B (see Figure) is called protoporphyrin IX and has 4 methyl, two vinyl, and two propionic acid substituents at the indicated positions.

Microdictyon is an extinct "armored worm" coated with dot-like
Maotianshan shale of Yunnan China. Microdictyon is sometimes included
in a somewhat ill-defined Phylum – Lobopodia – that includes several
other odd worm-like and segmented free-swimming animals that do not appear
to be arthropods or worms.  The phylum includes Microdictyon, Onychodictyon, Cardiodictyon,
Luolishania, Paucipodia, as well as the
Anomalocarids.  The isolated sclerites of Microdictyon
are known from other Lower Cambrian deposits.  Microdictyon sclerites appear to have moulted; one sclerite seems to have been preserved during ecdysis.Figured in [tpl]cite doi|10.1111/1475-4983.00289[/tpl]
Microdictyon sinicum (Chen, Hou and Lu, 1989) is typical.  The

[[Armed merchantman]]

CATEGORIES: Ship types, Auxiliary cruisers

Armed merchantman is a term that has come to mean a merchant ship equipped with guns, usually for defensive purposes, either by design or after the fact. In the days of sail, piracy and privateers, many merchantmen would be routinely armed, especially those engaging in long distance and high value trade. The most famous of this type were the East Indiamen able to defeat regular warships in battle (see Battle of Pulo Aura). In more modern times, auxiliary cruisers were used offensively to disrupt trade chiefly during both World War I and World War II, particularly by Germany.

The German auxiliary cruiser ''Kormoran'' (HSK-8) was a Kriegsmarine (German Navy) merchant raider of World War II. Originally the merchant vessel Steiermark, the ship was acquired by the Kriegsmarine following the outbreak of war for conversion into a raider. Administered by the Kriegsmarine under the designation Schiff 41, to the Allied navies she was known as Raider G. The largest merchant raider operated by Germany during World War II, Kormoran was responsible for the destruction of ten merchant vessels and the capture of an eleventh during her year-long career in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.
She is also known for sinking the Australian light cruiser [tpl]HMAS|Sydney|D48|6[/tpl] during a mutually destructive battle off Western Australia on 19 November 1941. Damage sustained during the battle prompted the scuttling of Kormoran. While 318 of the 399 aboard the German ship were rescued and placed in prisoner of war camps for the duration of World War II, there were no survivors from the 645 aboard the Australian cruiser. The wreck of Kormoran was rediscovered on 12 March 2008, five days before that of her adversary.
Kormoran[tpl]'[/tpl]s success is commonly attributed to the proximity of the two ships during the engagement, and the raider's advantages of surprise and rapid, accurate fire. Prior to the discovery of the wrecks in 2008, the cruiser's loss with all hands compared to the survival of most of the German crew created controversy and spawned numerous conspiracy theories; some alleged that the German commander, Theodor Detmers, used illegal ruses to lure Sydney into range, others that a Japanese submarine was involved, or that details of the battle were concealed through a wide-ranging cover up.

Plesiosauroidea ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|iː|s|i|ə|s|ɔər[/tpl]; Greek: plēsios/πλησιος 'near' or 'close to' and sauros/σαυρος 'lizard') is an extinct clade of carnivorous plesiosaur marine reptiles. They have the longest neck to body ratio of any reptile. Plesiosauroids, are known from the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. After their discovery, some plesiosauroids were somewhat fancifully said to have resembled "a snake threaded through the shell of a turtle",[tpl]Cite web |last = Everhart|first = Mike |title = A Snake Drawn Through the Shell of a Turtle |date=2005-10-14 |url=http://www.oceansofkansas.com/Snaketurtle.html |work=Oceans of Kansas Paleontology |accessdate = 2010-06-10 |postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] although they had no shell.
Plesiosauroidea appeared at the Early Jurassic Period (late Sinemurian stage) and thrived until the K-Pg extinction, at the end of the Cretaceous Period. The oldest confirmed plesiosauroid is Plesiosaurus itself, as all younger taxa were recently found to be pliosauroids.[tpl]cite journal |authors=Hilary F. Ketchum and Roger B. J.

Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (July 6, 1818 – March 13, 1879)"Anderssen, Adolf" in The New Encyclopaedia Britannica. Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc., 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 385. was a German chess master. He is considered to have been the world's leading chess player in the 1850s and 1860s. He was "dethroned" temporarily in 1858 by Paul Morphy.  
After his defeat by Steinitz in 1866, Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered—including the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament, considered comparable in the strength of its contestants to recent "super GM tournaments". He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.
Anderssen is famous even today for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the "Immortal Game" (1851) and the "Evergreen Game" (1852). He was a very important figure in the development of chess problems, driving forward the transition from the "Old School" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.
He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an "elder statesman" of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.

The route links Greater London, the West Midlands, the North West, North Wales and the Central Belt of Scotland. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has trains running at [tpl]convert|125|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl], thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line.[tpl]cite web |publisher=International Union of Railways |url=http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article971 |title=General definitions of highspeed |accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl]
The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger route in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys.Network Rail media centre, December 2008.
The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic.  The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland.West Coast Main Line, Network Rail, October 2007.

Anthracite (Greek ἀνθρακίτης (anthrakítes), "coal-like," from ἄνθραξ (ánthrax), coal)"anthracite," The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2010-06-26. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50009392 is a hard, compact variety of mineral coal that has a high luster. It has the highest carbon content, the fewest impurities, and the highest calorific content of all types of coal, which also include bituminous coal and lignite.
Anthracite is the most metamorphosed type of coal (but still represents low-grade metamorphism), in which the carbon content is between 92.1% and 98%.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.faculty.uaf.edu/ffrg/min454/Handout2_UMM.doc| title =  MIN 454: Underground Mining Methods handout; from course at the University of Alaska Fairbanks|accessdate = 2009-05-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090326053910/http://www.faculty.uaf.edu/ffrg/min454/Handout2_UMM.doc| archivedate= 26 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite book| title = Coal Mining Technology: Theory and Practice| author = R.

Anthracite ignites with difficulty and burns with a short, blue, and smokeless flame.
Anthracite is categorized into standard grade, which is used mainly in power generation, and high grade (HG) and ultra high grade (UHG), the principal uses of which are in the metallurgy sector. Anthracite accounts for about 1% of global coal reserves,World Coal Association - The Coal Resource and is mined in only a few countries around the world. China accounts for the majority of global production; other producers are Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Vietnam, the UK, Australia and the US. Total production in 2010 was 670 million tons.U.S. Energy Information Administration 2010 international energy statistics

Long a market town, the Kennet and Avon canal runs to the north of Trowbridge and played an instrumental part in the town's development as it enabled coal to be transported from the Somerset Coalfield and so marked the advent of steam-powered manufacturing in woollen cloth mills. The town was foremost producer of this mainstay of contemporary clothing and blankets in south west England in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by which time it held the nickname "The Manchester of the West".[tpl]cite web |url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=228 |title=Wiltshire Council – Wiltshire Community History Get Community Information |publisher=history.wiltshire.gov.uk |accessdate=4 March 2011 [/tpl]

In the Middle Ages, it retained its strategic regional importance, changing hands between the Byzantine and Bulgarian Empires. It came under Ottoman rule in the 14th century. In 4 January 1878, Plovdiv was liberated from Ottoman rule by the Russian army and was within the borders of Bulgaria until July, the same year, when it became the capital of an autonomous Ottoman region of Eastern Rumelia. In 1885, it and Eastern Rumelia itself became part of Bulgaria.
Plovdiv is situated in south-central Bulgaria on the two banks of the Maritsa River. The city has historically developed on seven syenite hills, some of which are [tpl]convert|250|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl] high. Because of these hills, Plovdiv is often referred to in Bulgaria as "The City of the Seven Hills".
Plòvdiv is host to cultural events such as the International Fair Plovdiv, the international theatrical festival "A stage on a crossroad", the TV festival "The golden chest". There are many remains preserved from antiquity such as the ancient Plovdiv Roman amphitheatre, Roman odeon, Roman Stadium, the archaeological complex Eirene and others.
The oldest American educational institution outside the United States was founded in Plovdiv in 1860, which was later moved to Sofia – today's American College of Sofia.

Weezer, also known as "The Green Album" due to the lime-green cover, is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Weezer, released on May 15, 2001. Produced by Ric Ocasek, it was released on Geffen Records, as were its two predecessors. This is the first, and only Weezer album to feature bassist Mikey Welsh, who replaced long-time member Matt Sharp. The musical style of Weezer is grounded in the power pop genre, featuring strong melodies, crisp vocal harmonies, and prominent guitar riffs. It is also Weezer's quickest selling album.
Weezer received generally favourable reviews. The album is often recognized as a rebirth for the band after a long hiatus following their 1996 album, Pinkerton. The album attained chart success by debuting at number four in the US and number two in Canada. The album also charted within the top ten in Norway and Sweden. Since its release in 2001, the album has sold over 1,600,000 copies in the United States.
Three singles were released from the album including "Hash Pipe", "Island in the Sun", and "Photograph". The first single, "Hash Pipe", was a worldwide modern rock hit, charting on seven different charts, despite their record label's reluctance to release it as the first single.

[[Tōkai region]]
CATEGORIES: Chūbu region

The [tpl]Nihongo|Tōkai region|東海地方|Tōkai-chihō[/tpl] is a sub-region of the Chūbu region in Japan that runs along the Pacific Ocean.  The name means "East sea" and comes from the Tōkaidō, one of the Edo Five Routes.  Because Tōkai is a sub-region and is not officially classified, there is some disagreement about where exactly the region begins and ends, however Japanese maps widely conclude that the region includes Shizuoka, Aichi, Gifu and Mie prefectures.
The largest major city in the region is Nagoya and the Chūkyō Metropolitan Area (Nagoya Metropolitan Area) makes up a large portion of the region and has Japan's third strongest economy.  The business influence of this urban area sometimes extends out into the outlying areas of the three prefectures centered around Nagoya which are Aichi, Gifu, and Mie; this area is sometimes referred to as the Chūkyō region.
Tōkai is a heavy manufacturing area and is one of the most industrial regions in Japan.  Its coast is lined with densely populated cities with economies that thrive on factories.
The Tōkai region has experienced a number of large earthquakes in the past, including the two great earthquakes in 1944 (also known as the "Tonankai earthquake") and 1945 (also known as the "Mikawa earthquake").Karan, Pradyumna Prasad. (2005). [tpl]Google books|vSDLLpn4K4UC|Japan in the 21st Century: Environment, Economy, and Society, p. 36|page=36[/tpl].  Following the work of Kiyoo Mogi, it is predicted that there is a possibility that the area will be subject to a shallow magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the near future.Two grave issues concerning the expected Tokai Earthquake Kiyoo Mogi, Earth Planets Space, Vol. 56 (No. 8), pp. li-lxvi, published 2004, accessed 2011-03-11  Nagoya, Shizuoka, and other large cities would be greatly damaged, with casualties in the thousands, if not millions, making it one of the worst disasters on Earth. The Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction designated the region as an Area of Specific Observation in 1970, and upgraded it to an Area of Intensified Observation in 1974.

The Tumen River is a 521 km-long river that serves as part of the boundary between China, North Korea, and Russia, rising in Mount Paektu and flowing into the Sea of Japan.
The river flows in northeast Asia, on the border between China and North Korea in its upper reaches, and between North Korea and Russia in its last [tpl]convert|17|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] before entering the Sea of Japan. The river forms much of the southern border of Jilin Province in Northeast China and the northern borders of North Korea's North Hamgyong and Ryanggang provinces. Baekdu Mountain on the Chinese-North Korean border is the source of the river,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/weekinreview/22marsh.html?_r=1&oref=login Onishi, Norimitsu, "Tension, Desperation: The China-North Korean Border", October 22, 2006. Much of the information cited in this footnote comes from the captions to the large illustrated map published with the newspaper article and available online with it. as well as of the Yalu River (which forms the western portion of the border of North Korea and China).
The name of the river comes from the Mongolian word tümen, meaning "ten thousand" or a myriad. This river is badly polluted by the nearby factories of North Korea and China; however, it still remains a major tourist attraction in the area. In Tumen, Jilin, China, a riverfront promenade has restaurants where patrons can gaze across the river into North Korea. The Russian name of the river is Tumannaya, literally meaning foggy.
In 1995, the People's Republic of China, Mongolia, Russia, and South Korea, signed three agreements to create the Tumen River Economic Development Area. HighBeam Research - Article: Accord on Tumen River Area Development to Be Signed.
Important cities on the river are Hoeryong and Onsong in North Korea, Tumen and Nanping in China.

[[Barrel racing]]
CATEGORIES: Rodeo events

Barrel racing is a rodeo event in which a horse and rider attempt to complete a clover-leaf pattern around preset barrels in the fastest time. Though both boys and girls compete at the youth level and men compete in some amateur venues, in collegiate and professional ranks, it is primarily a rodeo event for women.  It combines the horse's athletic ability and the horsemanship skills of a rider in order to safely and successfully maneuver a horse through a clover leaf pattern around three barrels (typically three fifty-five gallon metal or plastic drums) placed in a triangle in the center of an arena. 
In timed rodeo events, the purpose is to make a run as fast as possible, while the time is being clocked either by an electronic eye, (a device using a laser system to record times), or by an arena attendant or judge who manually takes the time using the eye and a flag to let a clocker know when to hit the timer stop, though this last method is more commonly seen in local and non-professional events.
The timer begins when horse and rider cross the start line, and ends when the barrel pattern has been successfully executed and horse and rider cross the finish line. The rider's time depends on several factors, most commonly the horse's physical and mental condition, the rider's horsemanship abilities, and the type of ground or footing (the quality, depth, content, etc. of the sand or dirt in the arena).

[[Saccadic masking]]

CATEGORIES: Visual system, Vision

Saccadic masking, also known as visual saccadic suppression, is the phenomenon in visual perception where the brain selectively blocks visual processing during eye movements in such a way that neither the motion of the eye (and subsequent motion blur of the image) nor the gap in visual perception is noticeable to the viewer.
The phenomenon was first described by Erdmann and Dodge in 1898,Erdmann and Dodge, 1898. when it was noticed during unrelated experiments that an observer could never see the motion of their own eyes.  This can easily be duplicated by looking into a mirror, and looking from one eye to another.  The eyes can never be observed in motion, yet an external observer clearly sees the motion of the eyes.
The phenomenon is often used to help explain a temporal illusion by the name of Chronostasis, which momentarily occurs following a rapid eye-movement.

Site-specific art is artwork created to exist in a certain place. Typically, the artist takes the location into account while planning and creating the artwork. The actual term was promoted and refined by Californian artist Robert Irwin, but it was actually first used in the mid-1970s by young sculptors, such as Patricia Johanson, Dennis Oppenheim, and Athena Tacha, who had started executing public commissions for large urban sites (see Peter Frank, “Site Sculpture”, Art News, Oct. 1975).
Site specific environmental art was first described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett (“New Directions in Environmental Art,” Landscape Architecture, Jan. 1977) and art critic Lucy Lippard (“Art Outdoors, In and Out of the Public Domain,” Studio International, March–April 1977).

Psychobilly is often characterized by lyrical references to science fiction, horror and exploitation films, violence, lurid sexuality, and other topics generally considered taboo, though often presented in a comedic or tongue-in-cheek fashion. It is often played with an upright double bass, instead of the electric bass which is more common in modern rock music, and the hollowbody electric guitar, rather than the solid-bodied electric guitars that predominate in rock. Psychobilly gained underground popularity in Europe beginning in the early 1980s, with the UK band The Meteors, but remained largely unknown in the United States until the late 1990s.Downey, 77. "Before Tiger Army started touring in support of their 1999 debut, the psycho scene in the U.S. was practically nonexistent. There were fans in a few towns who hung with the rockabillies or punks, but psycho was their little imported secret."Downey, 78. "European record labels like Nervous (U.K.) and Crazy Love (Germany) were crucial as psychobilly continued to be virtually unnoticed in the U.S." Since then the advent of several notable psychobilly bands, such as the US band Tiger Army and the Australian band The Living End, has led to its mainstream popularity and attracted international attention to the genre.

Ildibad (Sometimes rendered Hildebad or Heldebadus) (died 541) was a king of the Ostrogoths in Italy, being chosen to replace Witiges, who had been engaged in various intrigues with Belisarius, and had left Ravenna. He moved his capital to Pavia in 540,Herwig Wolfram, History of the Goths (University of California Press, 1990). conquered Treviso, installing his nephew Totila as commander, and soon controlled Venetia and Liguria.Wolfram (1990)
Ildibald reigned for only about a year before being killed by a Gepid at a palace banquet. After a brief interlude under Eraric, he was succeeded by his nephew Totila.
Ildibad was a nephew of Theudis, one of the Visigothic kings in Spain. This relationship led Peter Heather to suggest that both belonged to a powerful, non-royal clan.Peter Heather, The Goths (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 242

[[Scottish Terrier]]

CATEGORIES: Terriers, Dog breeds originating in Scotland

The Scottish Terrier (also known as the Aberdeen Terrier), popularly called the Scottie, is a breed of dog. Initially one of the highland breeds of terrier that were grouped under the name of Skye Terrier, it is one of five breeds of terrier that originated in Scotland, the other four being the modern Skye, Cairn, Dandie Dinmont, and West Highland White Terrier. They are an independent and rugged breed with a wiry outer coat and a soft dense undercoat. The First Earl of Dumbarton nicknamed the breed "the diehard." The modern breed is said to be able to trace its lineage back to a single female, named Splinter II.
They are a small breed of terrier with a distinctive shape and have had many roles in popular culture. They have been owned by a variety of celebrities, including the 32nd President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose Scottie "Fala" is included with FDR in a statue in Washington, DC, as well as the 43rd President George W. Bush.  They are also well known for being a playing piece in the board game Monopoly. Described as a territorial, feisty dog, they can make a good watchdog and tend to be very loyal to their family. Healthwise, Scottish Terriers can be more prone to bleeding disorders, joint disorders,  autoimmune diseases, allergies, and cancer than some other breeds of dog and there is a condition named after the breed called Scotty cramp. They are also one of the more successful dog breeds at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show with a recent best in show in 2010.

[[Winkler test for dissolved oxygen]]

CATEGORIES: Aquatic ecology, Water quality indicators, Oxygen

The Winkler test is used to determine the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water samples. Dissolved oxygen (D.O.) is widely used in water quality studies and routine operation of water reclamation facilities.  An excess of manganese(II) salt, iodide (I–) and hydroxide (OH–) ions is added to a water sample causing a white precipitate of Mn(OH)2 to form.  This precipitate is then oxidized by the dissolved oxygen in the water sample into a brown manganese precipitate.  In the next step, a strong acid (either hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) is added to acidify the solution.  The brown precipitate then converts the iodide ion (I–) to iodine.  The amount of dissolved oxygen is directly proportional to the titration of iodine with a thiosulfate solution.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chiya Numako and Izumi Nakai |title= XAFS studies of some precipitation and coloration reaction used in analytical chemistry |journal =Physica B: Condensed Matter |volume=208–209 |pages=387–388 |year=1995 | doi=10.1016/0921-4526(94)00706-2 [/tpl]  Today, the method is effectively used as its colorimetric modification, where the trivalent manganese produced on acidifying the brown suspension is directly reacted with EDTA to give a pink color.A.

Chelsea is a neighborhood  on the West Side of the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The district's boundaries are roughly 14th Street to the south, 30th Street to the north, the western boundary of the Ladies' Mile Historic District – which lies between the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and Seventh Avenue – to the east, and the Hudson River and West Street to the west.  To the north of Chelsea is the neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, also known as "Clinton," to the northeast is the Garment District, to the east are NoMad and the Flatiron District, to the southwest is the Meatpacking District and to the southeast is the West Village.Neighborhoods in New York City do not have official status, and their boundaries are not specifically set by the city.  (There are a number of Community Boards, whose boundaries are officially set, but these are fairly large and generally contain a number of neighborhoods, and the neighborhood map issued by the Department of City Planning only shows the largest ones.)  Because of this, the definition of where neighborhoods begin and end is subject to a variety of forces, including the efforts of real estate concerns to promote certain areas, the use of neighborhood names in media news reports, and the everyday usage of people.
Chelsea is divided between Manhattan Community Board 4 and Manhattan Community Board 5. It contains the Chelsea Historic District and its extension, which were designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1970 and 1981, respectively,[tpl]cite nycland[/tpl], p.70-72 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, expanded in 1982 to include contiguous blocks containing particularly significant examples of period architecture.
The neighborhood is primarily residential, with a mix of tenements, apartment blocks, city housing projects, townhouses and renovated rowhouses, and its many retail businesses reflect the ethnic and social diversity of the population.  The western part of Chelsea has become a center of the New York art world, with many art galleries located in both new buildings and rehabilitated warehouses.

[[Inventory]]

CATEGORIES: Inventory, Supply chain management, Distribution, retailing, and wholesaling, Commercial item transport and distribution, Production and manufacturing, Manufacturing, Marketing, Industry, Operations research, National accounts, Lean manufacturing, Supply chain management terms

Inventory or stock refers to the goods and materials that a business holds for the ultimate purpose of resale (or repair).[tpl]refn|group=nb|The word inventory is commonly used in American English and in business accounting. In the rest of the English-speaking world, stock is more commonly used, although inventory is recognised as a synonym. In both British and American English, stock is the collective noun for one hundred shares, as shares were usually traded in stocks on Stock Exchanges.[/tpl]
Inventory management is a science primarily about specifying the shape and percentage of stocked goods. It is required at different locations within a facility or within many locations of a supply network to precede the regular and planned course of production and stock of materials.
The scope of inventory management concerns the fine lines between replenishment lead time, carrying costs of inventory, asset management, inventory forecasting, inventory valuation, inventory visibility, future inventory price forecasting, physical inventory, available physical space for inventory, quality management, replenishment, returns and defective goods, and demand forecasting. Balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels, which is an on-going process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment.
Inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling, and related costs are kept in check. It also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements, set targets, provide replenishment techniques, report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material. This would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. It also may include ABC analysis, lot tracking, cycle counting support, etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system, functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs.

[[Surface-to-air missile]]

CATEGORIES: Surface-to-air missiles, Anti-aircraft weapons, Missile types

A surface-to-air missile (SAM), or ground-to-air missile (GTAM), is a missile designed to be launched from the ground to destroy aircraft or other missiles. It is one type of antiaircraft system; in modern armed forces missiles have replaced most other forms of dedicated antiaircraft weapons, with antiaircraft guns pushed into specialized roles.
The first serious attempts at SAM development took place during World War II, although no operational systems were introduced. Further development through the 1940s and 50s led to the first operational systems being introduced by most major forces during the second half of the 1950s. Smaller systems, suitable for close-range work, evolved though the 1960s and 70s, to modern systems that are man-portable. Shipborne systems followed the evolution of land-based models, starting with long-range weapons and steadily evolving toward smaller designs to provide a layered defence that have pushed gun-based systems into the shortest-range roles.
Historically notable systems include the American Nike Ajax, the first operational guided missile SAM system, and the Soviet Union's S-75 Dvina, the most-produced SAM. Widely used modern examples include the Patriot and S-300 wide-area systems, SA-N-6 Grumble and SM3 naval missiles, and short-range man-portable systems like the Stinger and Strela-3.

[tpl]Norwegian music[/tpl][tpl]Norwegian-people[/tpl] 
Norway is a rather sparsely populated country in Europe (5 million inhabitants in an area of some [tpl]convert|685,000|km²|0|abbr=on[/tpl]) , but even so its music and its musical life are as complex as those of most other countries. Much has been learned about early music in Norway from physical artifacts found during archaeological digs. These include such instruments such as the lur. Viking and medieval sagas also describe musical activity, as do the accounts of priests and pilgrims from all over Europe coming to visit St Olaf's grave in Trondheim.
In the latter part of the 19th century Norway experienced economic growth leading to greater industrialization and urbanization. More music was established in the cities, and opera performances and symphony concerts were considered to be of high standards. In this era both prominent composers (like Edvard Grieg and Johan Svendsen) and performers combined the European traditions with Norwegian tones.
The import of music and musicians for dance and entertainment increased, and this continued in the 20th century, even more so when gramophone records and radio became common. In the last half of the 20th century, Norway, like many other countries in the world, underwent a roots revival that saw indigenous music being revived.

[[Time signal]]

CATEGORIES: Time signal radio stations, Time signals, Horology

A time signal is a visible, audible, mechanical, or electronic signal used as a reference to determine the time of day. Church bells or voices announcing hours of prayer gave way to automatically operated chimes on public clocks; however, audible signals (even signal guns) have limited range. Busy ports used a visual signal, the dropping of a ball, to allow mariners to check the chronometers used for navigation. The advent of electrical telegraphs allowed widespread and precise distribution of time signals from central observatories. Railways were among the first customers for time signals, which allowed synchronization of their operations over wide geographic areas. Special purpose radio time signal stations transmit a signal that allows automatic synchronization of clocks, and commercial broadcasters still include time signals in their programming. Today, GPS navigation radio signals are used to precisely distribute time signals over much of the world.

A clock signal is produced by a clock generator. Although more complex arrangements are used, the most common clock signal is in the form of a square wave with a 50% duty cycle, usually with a fixed, constant frequency. Circuits using the clock signal for synchronization may become active at either the rising edge, falling edge, or, in the case of double data rate, both in the rising and in the falling edges of the clock cycle.

[[Chlorin]]

CATEGORIES: Biomolecules, Metabolism, Photosynthesis, Tetrapyrroles

In organic chemistry, a chlorin is a large heterocyclic aromatic ring consisting, at the core, of three pyrroles and one pyrroline coupled through four =[tpl]chem|CH[/tpl]- linkages. Unlike porphin, the central aromatic ring structure of porphyrins, a chlorin is therefore largely aromatic but not aromatic through the entire circumference of the ring. 
Magnesium-containing chlorins are called chlorophylls, and are the central photosensitive pigment in chloroplasts.
Related compounds, with two pyrroles and two pyrrolines (which are like pyrroles with one double bond reduced to a single bond) in the macrocycle are called bacteriochlorins and isobacteriochlorins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI%3A52583|title=ChEBI|date=June 16, 2009|pages=isobacteriochlorin (CHEBI:52583)|accessdate=1 February 2012[/tpl]
Because of their photosensitivity, chlorins are in active use as photosensitizing agents in experimental photodynamic therapy.

[[Mach's principle]]
CATEGORIES: Theories of gravitation, Gravitation, Principles

In theoretical physics, particularly in discussions of gravitation theories,  Mach's principle (or Mach's conjecture[ref]Hans Christian Von Bayer, The Fermi Solution: Essays on Science, Courier Dover
Publications (2001), ISBN 0-486-41707-7, page 79[/ref]) is the name given by Einstein to an imprecise hypothesis often credited to the physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach.
The idea is that local inertial frames are determined by the large scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:
 You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move? 
Mach's principle says that this is not a coincidence—that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a centrifugal force. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like "mass out there influences inertia here". A very general statement of Mach's principle is "Local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe."
This concept was a guiding factor in Einstein's development of the general theory of relativity. Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the metric tensor, which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. Frame dragging and conservation of gravitational angular momentum makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made which would qualify as a Mach principle, and some of these are false. The Gödel rotating universe is a solution of the field equations which is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has closed timelike curves.

[[De Havilland Comet]]

CATEGORIES: British airliners 1940–1949, De Havilland aircraft, Quadjets

The de Havilland DH 106 Comet was the first production commercial jetliner.[tpl]#tag:ref|The Avro Tudor and Vickers VC.1 Viking, fitted with Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets, had flown earlier but were experimental models.|group=N[/tpl] Developed and manufactured by de Havilland at its Hatfield, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom headquarters, the Comet 1 prototype first flew on 27 July 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines buried in the wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet, comfortable passenger cabin and showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut.
A year after entering commercial service the Comets began suffering problems, with three of them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. This was later found to be due to catastrophic metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the cause; the first incident had been incorrectly blamed on adverse weather. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square windows and installation methodology, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.
Although sales never fully recovered, the improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career of over 30 years. The Comet was adapted for a variety of military roles such as VIP, medical and passenger transport, as well as surveillance. The most extensive modification resulted in a specialised maritime patrol aircraft variant, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. Nimrod remained in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) until June 2011, over 60 years after the Comet's first flight.

Busby and Raymond V. Ingersoll[/tpl] Sedimentary basins occur in diverse geological settings usually associated with plate tectonic activity. Basins are classified structurally in various ways, with a primary classifications distinguishing among basins formed in various plate tectonic regime (divergent, convergent, transform, intraplate), the proximity of the basin to the active plate margins, and whether oceanic,  continental or transitional crust underlies the basin.[tpl]cite book|last=Dickinson|first=William R.|title=Tectonics and Sedimentation|year=1974|publisher=Special Publications of the Society for Sedimentary Geology[/tpl] Basins formed in different plate tectonic regimes vary in their preservation potential. On oceanic crust, basins are likely to be subducted, while marginal continental basins may be partially preserved, and intracratonic basins have a high probability of preservation. As the sediments are buried, they are subjected to increasing pressure and begin the process of lithification. A number of basins formed in extensional settings can undergo inversion which has accounted for a number of the economically viable oil reserves on earth which were formerly basins.

[[Lithification]]

CATEGORIES: Geological processes, Sedimentary rocks, Geology terminology

Lithification (from the Greek word lithos meaning 'rock' and the Latin-derived suffix -ific) is the process in which sediments compact under pressure, expel connate fluids, and gradually become solid rock.  Essentially, lithification is a process of porosity destruction through compaction and cementation. Lithification includes all the processes which convert unconsolidated sediments into sedimentary rocks. Petrification, though often used as a synonym, is more specifically used to describe the replacement of organic material by silica in the formation of fossils.[tpl]cite book|last=Hazlett|first=James S.

Johnson–Nyquist noise (thermal noise, Johnson noise, or Nyquist noise) is the electronic noise generated by the thermal agitation of the charge carriers (usually the electrons) inside an electrical conductor at equilibrium, which happens regardless of any applied voltage. The generic, statistical physical derivation of this noise is called the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, where generalized impedance or generalized susceptibility is used to characterize the medium.
Thermal noise in an ideal resistor is approximately white, meaning that the power spectral density is nearly constant throughout the frequency spectrum (however see the section below on extremely high frequencies).  When limited to a finite bandwidth, thermal noise has a nearly Gaussian amplitude distribution.[tpl]cite book|author=John R. Barry, Edward A. Lee, and David G.

The Macintosh IIfx is a model of Apple Macintosh computer, introduced in 1990 and discontinued in 1992.  At introduction it cost from US $9,000 to US $12,000, depending on configuration, and it was the fastest Mac available at the time. It had many code-names, including Stealth, Blackbird, F-16, F-19, Four Square, IIxi, Zone 5 and Weed-Whacker.
Dubbed "Wicked Fast" by the Product Manager, Frank Casanova - who came to Apple from Apollo Computer in Boston, Massachusetts where the Boston term "wicked" was commonly used to define anything extreme - the system ran at a clock rate of a then-impressive 40 megahertz, had 32 KB of Level 2 cache, six NuBus slots and included a number of proprietary ASICs and coprocessors designed to speed up the machine further. These required software written specifically for the IIfx to take advantage of them. The 40 MHz speed referred to the main logic board clock (the bus), the Motorola 68030 CPU, and the computer's Motorola 68882 FPU. The machine had eight RAM slots, for a maximum of 128 MB RAM, an enormous amount at the time.
The IIfx featured specialized high-speed (80 ns) RAM using 64-pin dual-ported SIMMs, at a time when all other Macintosh models used 30-pin SIMMs. The extra pins were a separate path to allow latched read and write operations. It was also possible to use parity memory modules, being the only stock 68K Macintosh to support them. (There were special versions of the Macintosh IIci that used parity 30-pin SIMMs.)  The IIfx also included two special dedicated processors for sound and serial communications. These I/O chips featured a pair of embedded 6502 CPUs, meaning that this Mac also had the core of two Apple II machines inside it (albeit at 10 MHz rather than the 1 MHz of the Apple II). However the machine's architecture did not expose these CPUs to developers.
The IIfx used SCSI as its hard disk interface, as had all previous Macintosh models since the Macintosh Plus. The IIfx required a special black-colored SCSI terminator for external drives, however. SCSI would remain the standard internal storage connector on the Macintosh line until Apple began transitioning to IDE with the Quadra 630's release in 1994.
The IIfx was the apex of Apple's 68030-based Macintosh II series and was replaced at the top of Apple's lineup by the Macintosh Quadra series in 1991. It was the last Apple computer released that was designed using the Snow White design language.

[[Prussian blue]]

CATEGORIES: Cyanides, Iron compounds, Inorganic pigments, Coordination compounds, Mixed valence compounds, Shades of blue, Photographic chemicals, World Health Organization essential medicines

Prussian blue is a dark blue pigment with the idealized formula Fe7(CN)18. Another name for the color Prussian blue is Berlin blue or, in painting, Parisian blue. Turnbull's blue is the same substance but is made from different reagents, and its slightly different color stems from different impurities.
Prussian blue was one of the first synthetic pigments. It is employed as a very fine colloidal dispersion, as the compound itself is not soluble in water. It is famously complex, owing to the presence of variable amounts of other ions and the sensitive dependence of its appearance on the size of the colloidal particles formed when it is made. The pigment is used in paints, and it is the traditional "blue" in blueprints.
In medicine, Prussian blue is used as an antidote for certain kinds of heavy metal poisoning, e.g., by caesium and thallium. In particular it was used to absorb 137Cs+ from those poisoned in the Goiânia accident.  Prussian Blue is orally administered.  The therapy exploits Prussian Blue's ion exchange properties and high affinity for certain "soft" metal cations.
Prussian blue lent its name to prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide), which was derived from it. In Germany, hydrogen cyanide is called Blausäure ("blue acid"), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac gave cyanide its name, from the Greek word κυανός (kyanos, "blue"), because of the color of Prussian blue.

Prothero and Fred Schwab,  Sedimentary Geology: An Introduction to Sedimentary Rocks and Stratigraphy, W. H. Freeman (1996), ISBN 0-7167-2726-9.
Sedimentary rocks cover most of the Earth's surface, record much of the Earth's history, and harbor the fossil record. Sedimentology is closely linked to stratigraphy, the study of the physical and temporal relationships between rock layers or strata.
The premise that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past is the basis for determining how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed. By comparing similar features today to features in the rock record—for example, by comparing modern sand dunes to dunes preserved in ancient aeolian sandstones—geologists reconstruct past environments.

 Bloody Sunday ([tpl]lang-gle|Domhnach na Fola[/tpl]) was a day of violence in Dublin on 21 November 1920, during the Irish War of Independence. In total, 31 people were killed – fourteen British, fourteen Irish civilians and three republican prisoners.
The day began with an Irish Republican Army (IRA) operation organised by Michael Collins to assassinate the Cairo Gang, a team of undercover agents working and living in Dublin. Twelve were British Army officers, one a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the last a civilian informant.
Later that afternoon, Black and Tans of the Royal Irish Constabulary, supported by members of the Auxiliary Division, opened fire on the crowd at a Gaelic football match in Croke Park, killing fourteen civilians.Leeson, "Death in the Afternoon," pp. 49-50, 55-8; Carey and De Burca, "Bloody Sunday 1920," pp. 10-16. That evening, three IRA suspects in Dublin Castle were beaten and killed by their captors, allegedly while trying to escape. 
Overall, while its events cost relatively few lives, Bloody Sunday was considered a great victory for the IRA, as Collins's operation severely damaged his enemy's intelligence (especially important since the Irish rebels were fighting a guerrilla war against them) while the later reprisals did no real damage to the guerrillas but increased support for the IRA at home and abroad.The Irish War of Independence by Michael Hopkinson (ISBN 978-0717137411), page 91

[[Fault (geology)]]
CATEGORIES: Seismic faults, Seismology and earthquake terminology, Structural geology, Geology terminology

In geology, a fault is a planar fracture or discontinuity in a volume of rock, across which there has been significant displacement along the fractures as a result of earth movement. Large faults within the Earth's crust result from the action of plate tectonic forces, with the largest forming the boundaries between the plates, such as subduction zones or transform faults. Energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the cause of most earthquakes.
A fault line  is the surface trace of a fault, the line of intersection between the fault plane and the Earth's surface.[tpl]Harvnb|USGS|Fault Lines[/tpl].
Since faults do not usually consist of a single, clean fracture, geologists use the term fault zone when referring to the zone of complex deformation associated with the fault plane.
The two sides of a non-vertical fault are known as the hanging wall and footwall. By definition, the hanging wall occurs above the fault plane and the footwall occurs below the fault.[tpl]Harvnb|USGS|Hanging Wall[/tpl]. This terminology comes from mining: when working a tabular ore body, the miner stood with the footwall under his feet and with the hanging wall hanging above him.[tpl]Harvnb|Tingley|Pizarro|2000|p=132 [/tpl].

The Canadian Army (French: Armée canadienne), formerly Land Force Command (LFC), is the army of Canada.  The Canadian Army is one of three environmental commands within the unified Canadian Armed Forces. [tpl]As of|September 2013[/tpl] the Army has 21,600 regular soldiers, about 24,000 reserve soldiers, and 5000 rangers, for a total of 50,600 soldiers.  The Army is supported by 5,600 civilian employees.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/about-army/organization.page? |title=About the Army |publisher=Department of National Defence |accessdate=31 August 2010[/tpl] It maintains regular forces units at bases across Canada, and is also responsible for the Army Reserve, the largest component of the Primary Reserve. The Commander of the Canadian Army and Chief of the Army Staff is Lieutenant-General Marquis Hainse.
The name "Canadian Army" only came into official use beginning in 1940; from before Confederation until the Second World War the official designation was "Canadian Militia".  On 1 April 1966, as a precursor to the unification of Canada's armed services, all land forces were placed under a new entity called Force Mobile Command.  In 1968 the "Canadian Army" ceased to exist as a legal entity as the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), Canadian Army (CA), and Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) were merged to form a single service called the Canadian Armed Forces. Mobile Command was renamed Land Force Command in the 1993 reorganization of the Canadian Armed Forces. In August 2011, Land Force Command reverted to the pre-1968 title, the Canadian Army.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/08/15/pol-canadian-forces-names.html?ref=rss | work=CBC News | title=Navy and air force to be royal once again | date=16 August 2011[/tpl]

The Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) is a large species of flamingo at 110–130 cm (43–51 in) closely related to Caribbean Flamingo and Greater Flamingo, with which it was sometimes considered conspecific. This article follows the treatment in Ibis (2002) 144 707-710.
It breeds in temperate South America from Ecuador and Peru to Chile and Argentina and east to Brazil; it has been introduced into Germany and the Netherlands (colony on the border, Zwilbrockervenn).  There is also a small population in Utah and California. Like all flamingos it lays a single chalky white egg on a mud mound.

[[Cotys I (Odrysian)]]

CATEGORIES: 358 BC deaths, Thracian kings, 4th-century BC rulers, Year of birth unknown

Cotys I or Kotys I (Ancient Greek, "Κότυς") was born during the reign of Seuthes I. He became king after he killed the previous Thracian king Hebryzelmis. On gaining the Odrysian kingdom the Athenians made him their ally. In order to make his position stronger Cotys married his daughter to the Athenian general Iphicrates who soon became the second person in command after the king. Cotys assisted the Hales, leader of Triballi, a powerful Thracian tribe of Moesia, against Abdera. In 375 BC the Triballi, rebelled against his kingdom. One of the reasons for this revolt was that the Triballi were unable to get luxurious goods and other items from the south. Cotys stopped the rebellion by rebuilding the Greek city of Pistiros.
On the revolt of Ariobarzanes of Phrygia from Persia, Cotys opposed him and his ally, the Athenians. Soon after, he went to war with the Athenians for the possession of the Thracian Chersonese. Now that Athens could not trust Iphicrates to protect her interests, she organized a rebellion against Cotys, led by his treasurer Miltokythes. Yet Iphicrates, with the help of Charidemus, bribed the Athenian military and naval commanders to suppress the rebellion.  In 361 BC, Charidemus returned to Athens with a treaty from Cotys, proclaiming him an ally. Cotys had successful retained his kingdom.
By 359 BC, Cotys controlled the whole Chersonese peninsula. During the same year he made an alliance with the new Macedonian king, Philip II. In 358 BC, he was murdered by two of Plato’s students from Aenus, Python and Heraclides. Thought previously as advisers to the King, they murdered him during a feast in his palace, under the pretext that he had wronged their father. Upon their return to Athens, they were proclaimed honorary citizens and rewarded with gold wreaths.
Kotis Point on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Cotys I.

CATEGORIES: 1937 births, Living people, Swedish sociologists

Johan Asplund (born 1937) is a Swedish sociologist interested in social interaction and ethnomethodology.He appears cited e.g. in the works of Mats Alvesson (on reflexive methodology and critical management theory). At present, his works are not widely translated from the original Swedish.It is said that he thinks that the essence of a text gets lost if you translate it, and therefore refuses being published in other languages. Until his retirement, he holds[tpl]clarify|date=July 2012[/tpl] the chair of Sociology at Lund University.
Two of his most widely read books are "Det sociala livets elementära former" (1987, approximately "Elementary forms of social life"), in which he introduces his theory about humans as essentially "socially responsive" (socialt responsiva), and "Essä om Gemeinschaft och Gesellschaft" (1991, "Essay about Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft"), in which he explains and discusses this concept, originally developed by the German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies, 1887. Johan Asplund's writings on cities are summarized in English by Bo Gronlund in New Urban Theory.

[[Pattern language]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural theory, Cybernetics, Design, Linguistics

A pattern language is a method of describing good design practices within a field of expertise.  The term was coined by architect Christopher Alexander and popularized by his book A Pattern Language. Advocates of this design approach claim that ordinary people can use it to successfully solve very large, complex design problems.
Like all languages, a pattern language has vocabulary, syntax, and grammar—but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication. In pattern languages for design, the parts break down in this way:
This simplifies the design work, because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand, and work toward the unknown parts. At the same time, if the pattern language has worked well for many projects, there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process, and the result will be usable. For example, skiers coming inside must shed snow and store equipment. The messy snow and boot cleaners should stay outside. The equipment needs care, so the racks should be inside. etc.

Mixed-member proportional representation, also termed mixed-member proportional voting and commonly abbreviated to MMP, is a voting system originally used to elect representatives to the German Bundestag, and which has now been adopted by numerous legislatures around the world. 
MMP is similar to other forms of proportional representation (PR) in that the overall total of party members in the elected body is intended to mirror the overall proportion of votes received; it differs by including a set of members elected by geographic constituency who are deducted from the party totals so as to maintain overall proportionality. MMP is similar to the additional member system used in some parts of the United Kingdom, which has no overhang seats or balance seats and consequently is not perfectly proportional.
In Germany, where it is used on the federal level and on most state levels, MMP is known as personalized proportional representation. In Quebec, where an MMP model was studied in 2007,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/provincial/media/reform-of-the-voting-system.php |accessdate=2011-05-06 |date=2007-12-21 |title=Reform of the voting system |publisher=Le Directeur général des élections du Québec[/tpl] it is called the compensatory mixed-member voting system (système mixte avec compensation or SMAC).

Hellblazer (also known as John Constantine, Hellblazer) was a contemporary horror comic book series, originally published by DC Comics, and subsequently by the Vertigo imprint since March 1993, when the imprint was introduced. Its central character was the streetwise magician John Constantine, who was created by Alan Moore, Steve Bissette and Jamie Delano, and first appeared as a supporting character in The Saga of the Swamp Thing #37 (June 1985), during that creative team's run on that title.

Hellblazer was often a stepping stone to many British writers.

Hellblazer would later be one of the first modern occult detective fiction, and heavily influenced the genre to come.

Warwick Castle ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-warwick.ogg|ˈ|w|ɒr|ɪ|k[/tpl] [tpl]respell|WORR|ik[/tpl]) is a medieval castle developed from an original built by William the Conqueror in 1068. Warwick is the county town of Warwickshire, England,  situated on a bend of the River Avon. The original wooden motte-and-bailey castle was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century. During the Hundred Years War, the facade opposite the town was refortified, resulting in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th century military architecture. It was used as a stronghold until the early 17th century, when it was granted to Sir Fulke Greville by James I in 1604. Greville converted it to a country house and it was owned by the Greville family, who became earls of Warwick in 1759, until 1978 when it was bought by the Tussauds Group.

Originally the London terminus of the former Great Central Main Line to Sheffield and Manchester, which was closed north of Aylesbury in 1966, it now serves as the terminus of the Chiltern Main Line route to Birmingham.
Opened in 1899, it is the youngest of London's mainline terminal stations, and also one of the smallest, having opened with half the number of platforms originally planned. It is also the only London terminal station to host only diesel trains, having no electrified lines. From 1967 for many years it was served only by diesel multiple-unit trains (DMUs). It now once again also sees locomotive-hauled trains daily.
Two new platforms were added in 2006 to accommodate increases in services and passengers. Marylebone is in Travelcard Zone 1.

CATEGORIES: Jena, University towns in Germany

Jena ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈjeːna|-|Jena.ogg[/tpl]) is the second largest city in Thuringia, Germany, located [tpl]convert|70|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] SW of Leipzig, [tpl]convert|170|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] N of Nuremberg and [tpl]convert|150|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] W of Dresden. Together with the neighbour-cities Erfurt and Weimar it forms the central metropolitan area of Thuringia with approximately 500,000 inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of nearly 110,000. Jena is a centre of education and research; the Friedrich Schiller University was founded in 1558 and has 21,000 students today and the Ernst-Abbe-Fachhochschule Jena counts another 5,000 students. Furthermore, there are many institutes of the leading German research societies.
Jena was first mentioned in 1182 and stayed a small town until the 19th century, when industry developed. For most of the 20th century, Jena was a world centre of the optical industry around companies like Carl Zeiss, Schott and Jenoptik (since 1990). As one of only a few medium cities in Germany, it has some high-rise buildings in the city centre, like the Jen Tower. These also have their origin in the former Carl Zeiss factory. Between 1790 and 1850, Jena was a focal point of the German Vormärz as well as of the student liberal and unification movement and German Romanticism. Notable persons of this period in Jena were Friedrich Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Novalis and August Wilhelm Schlegel.
The city's economy is based on the high-technology industry and research, making Jena an innovation centre in Germany. The optical and precision industry is the leading branch to date, while software engineering, other digital businesses and biotechnology are of growing importance. Furthermore, Jena is also a service hub for the surrounding regions.
Jena lies in a hilly landscape in the east of Thuringia, within the wide valley of the Saale river.

Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541 (1999), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the contentious North Carolina's 12th congressional district.  In an earlier case, Shaw v. Reno, 517 U.S. 899 (1995), the Supreme Court ruled that the 12th district of North Carolina as drawn was unconstitutional because it was created for the purpose of placing African-Americans in one district thereby constituting illegal racial gerrymandering.  The Court then ordered the state of North Carolina to redraw the boundaries of the district.
In this follow up case, the Supreme Court ruled that the state was able to justify the new boundaries of the 12th district by showing that it was intended to create a safe seat for Democrats, and therefore the redrawn district was a constitutional example of political gerrymandering. Justice O'Connor acted as the swing vote, satisfied with the change in reasoning since Shaw v. Reno.

Ephedrine ([tpl]IPAc-en|ɨ|ˈ|f|ɛ|d|r|ɪ|n[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|f|ɨ|d|r|iː|n[/tpl]; not to be confused with ephedrone) is a sympathomimetic amine commonly used as a stimulant, appetite suppressant, concentration aid, decongestant, and to treat hypotension associated with anaesthesia.
Ephedrine is similar in molecular structure to the well-known drugs phenylpropanolamine and methamphetamine, as well as to the important neurotransmitter epinephrine (adrenaline). Chemically, it is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). It works mainly by increasing the activity of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on adrenergic receptors. It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt.
The herb má huáng (麻黄, Ephedra sinica), used in traditional Chinese medicine, contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as its principal active constituents. The same may be true of other herbal products containing extracts from other Ephedra species.

Easley v. Cromartie, 532 US 234 (2001), also known as Hunt v. Cromartie, was a U.S. Supreme Court case.  The court's ruling on April 18, 2001 stated that redistricting for political reasons did not violate Federal Civil Rights Law banning race-based gerrymandering. (Case No. 99-1864).
The Supreme Court held in the case that as Southern blacks tend to vote for the Democratic Party, North Carolina's 12th congressional district was drawn based upon voting behavior, instead of upon racial characteristics. The allegedly odd-shaped district was allowed to stand.  Critics of this ruling found this to be a case of judicial nitpicking and that the Court had in essence allowed the previously-banned practice of concentrating a racial group into a single district.

thumb|200px|Carl Adolph SchurichtCarl Adolph Schuricht ([tpl]IPA-de|kaʁl ˈaːdɔlf ˈʃuːʁɪçt[/tpl]) (3 July 1880[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]7 January 1967) was a German conductor.
Schuricht was born in Danzig (Gdańsk), German Empire; his father's family had been respected organ-builders. His mother, Amanda Wusinowska, a widow soon after her marriage (Carl's father Carl Conrad Schuricht drowned in the Baltic Sea while saving a friend, three weeks before he was born), brought up her son alone. His childhood was surrounded by music - "every Sunday in summer we used to hire three large open carriages and go out into the country. After the picnic we would join in singing choral works by Bach, Handel and Mendelssohn." He showed a talent for music at an early age, studying piano and violin from the age of six. By eleven he was composing, and continued his academic and musical studies when his mother moved to Berlin, then to Wiesbaden.Gavoty B. Carl Schuricht (Great Concert Artists series). Geneva, René Kister, 1956.
At 20 he obtained the post of Korrepetitor at the Stadttheater in Mainz and two years later won the Kuczynski Foundation prize for composition and a Felix von Mendelssohn scholarship. He then returned to Berlin to study piano under Ernst Rudorff and composition with Engelbert Humperdinck, later working under Max Reger in Leipzig, publishing chamber pieces, sonatas and lieder. Attracted by the profession of conductor he undertook tours in Germany conducting operettas, operas, choral societies and symphony concerts. During this time he had the chance to watch at rehearsal and in concert such figures as Arthur Nikisch, Felix Weingartner, Ernst von Schuch, Felix Mottl, Hans Richter, Karl Muck and Gustav Mahler.
In 1906 he heard Frederick Delius's Sea Drift in Essen with the composer present, and promised to Delius that when he had his own orchestra he would conduct it himself, which he did in Frankfurt with Delius again in the audience. In 1909 he succeeded Siegfried Ochs as director of the Rühlscher Oratorienverein in Frankfurt-am-Mein and at 31 was appointed musical director of the municipal orchestra in Wiesbaden; festivals of modern music (Richard Strauss, Reger, Mahler, Delius and Arnold Schoenberg) made Wiesbaden an internationally-renowned centre for music. Schuricht said of this time "The German public was no more avid than any other for the novelties which I wanted to give it. I have to prepare it for them gently, convince without bludgeoning, cajole and seduce. I managed this by prefacing concerts of modern music by lectures, which I illustrated with extracts played by myself at the piano or by the orchestra."
His career was not that of a star but he was loved both by the orchestra members and audience. As music director at Wiesbaden (1923-1944) he conducted performances of Mahler's symphonies, although they were not as popular at the time as they are now and were eventually banned under the Nazis because of the composer's Jewish background. Obituary for Carl Schuricht, Musical Times, 108(1489), p. 252 (1967)Hugo Leichtentritt, "Musical Notes from Abroad: Germany". Musical Times, 74(1086), p. 747 (1933). Schuricht continued to conduct Mahler outside Germany. In October 1939, during the Phoney War, a performance of his with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde was disrupted by a woman heckler who called out "Deutschland über alles, Herr Schuricht". Schuricht worked at the Hague/Scheveningen Festival from 1930-39 and was guest conductor with the Dresden Philharmonic from 1942 to 1944. He was expected to take over as director of the orchestra from 1 October 1944, but escalation of the war meant that the orchestra was closed down and Schuricht himself received a warning that he was about to be arrested, and he fled to Switzerland.Profile in Schuricht (2005) Artone. ISBN 3-86562-068-X He settled in Zürich where he married Maria Martha Banz and worked with l'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.
During the late 1940s and 1950s Schuricht conducted throughout Switzerland, at the re-opening of the Salzburg Festival in 1946, in Paris, and at the festivals of Holland, Lucerne, Aix-en-Provence and Montreux. He regularly conducted the South German Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1950 to 1966.Some of his 125 recordings in the SDR archive were issued by Hänssler Classic in 2005. When the Vienna Philharmonic made their first tour to the USA in 1956, Schuricht replaced Erich Kleiber, sharing the conducting during the six weeks with André Cluytens.Baeck E. André Cluytens: Itinéraire d’un chef d’orchestre. Editions Mardaga, Wavre, 2009. Cluytens conducted 19 concerts on the tour, Schuricht 11.
He died at the age of 86 in his home at Corseaux-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, and was buried in Wiesbaden, as an honorary citizen of that city.Scharlau U. Commentary to 'Carl Schuricht Collection'. Hänssler Classic, 2005.

[[Brig]]

CATEGORIES: Sailing rigs and rigging, Brigs

A brig is a sailing vessel with two square-rigged masts. During the Age of Sail, brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels. They were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind.  They are not to be confused with a brigantine, which has different rigging. In the narrow technical field of sailing rigs, a brig is distinct from a three-masted ship by virtue of only having two masts.

[[Salmacida Spolia]]

CATEGORIES: History of theatre, English Renaissance plays, 1640 plays, Masques by William Davenant

Salmacida Spolia was the last masque performed at the English Court before the outbreak of the English Civil War. Written by Sir William Davenant, with costumes, sets, and stage effects designed by Inigo Jones and with music by Lewis Richard, it was performed at Whitehall Palace on 21 January 1640.
In English, the title means "Salmacian spoils," and refers to an ancient Greek legend: a band of barbarians pillaging the Greek city of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor are pacified and civilized by drinking from the fountain of Salmacis.Leapman, p. 328. The masque was intended to convey a message of yielding and pacification, because Charles I has just ended his eleven-year period of personal rule and called for a new session of Parliament. In an effort to create an amicable atmosphere for the coming Parliamentary session, several leading aristocratic members of the Parliamentary party were cast in the masque, including Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford, and Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke. (This effort at political theatre quickly proved useless: the Parliament that followed was the famous Short Parliament.)
The masque was unique in that both Charles I and his queen, Henrietta Maria, performed in it; the Queen's mother, Marie de' Medici, was in the audience. In the masque, The King "personated" the role of Philogenes ("lover of the people"), a good but misunderstood ruler. Philogenes endures a fierce tempest that features the spirit of Discord, to reach an ensuing prosperous calm. A chariot descends from the cloudy heavens, carrying the personifications Concord and the Good Genius of Great Britain. The Queen, pregnant at the time, also descends from the heavens, "in a transparent brightness of thin exhalations, such as the gods are feigned to descend in."
A complex anti-masque featured, among other characters, quack doctors offering "cures" that can only make the chaos greater—for example, "Essence of dissimulation to enforce Love" and "An Opiade of the spirit of Muskadine taken in good quantity to bedward, to make one forget his Creditors." The anti-masque figures, as shown in Jones's surviving sketches, were "bizarrely dressed, physically deformed, and even obscene...one of them is equipped with an enormous erect penis...."Raylor, p. 114. The King dispels evil influences from a "golden throne surrounded by palm trees and heroic statues."Leapman, p. 329.
The masque featured elaborate dancing, and the sophisticated special effects that were Jones's specialty: for example,
The masque concluded with an idealized cityscape of London, replete with "magnificent buildings," and with another of Jones's famous and stunning cloudscapes, "a heaven opened full of deities."
The royal couple were highly pleased with the masque, and danced it again on the next Shrove Tuesday. The public response, such as there was among the restricted audience, appears to have been less positive, as contemporary witnesses reported more "disorder" among the crowd than usual. An element of negativity in the masque's reception was comprehensible, since it attributes the disorder of the realm to the stubbornness of the King's subjects ("the people's giddy fury"), and hints that the royal power won't always be held in check.
Davenant later adapted aspects of Salmacida Spolia to create his famous The Siege of Rhodes, the "first English opera."McGuire, p. 89.
As was often the case, the masque was published in quarto soon after its performance, in this instance by the bookseller Thomas Walkley.The quarto is dated "1639," since prior to 1751 the English began the new year on 25 March, not 1 January. See: Old Style and New Style dates. It was reprinted in a duodecimo volume in 1750, by William Rufus Chetwood.

[[Hail Mary]]

CATEGORIES: Christian prayer, Eastern Orthodoxy, Marian devotions, Marian hymns, Roman Catholic prayers, Rosary

The Hail Mary, also commonly called the Ave Maria (Latin) or Angelic Salutation, is a traditional Christian prayer asking for the intercession of the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus. In Roman Catholicism, the prayer forms the basis of the Rosary and the Angelus prayers. In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, a similar prayer is used in formal liturgies, both in Greek and in translations. It is also used by many other groups within the Catholic tradition of Christianity including Anglicans, Independent Catholics, and Old Catholics. Some Protestant denominations, such as Lutherans, also make use of a form of the prayer.
Based on the greeting of the angel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary in the Gospel of Luke, the prayer takes different forms in various traditions. It has often been set to music, although the most famous musical expression of the words Ave Maria by Schubert does not actually contain the Hail Mary prayer.

CATEGORIES: Spirals

A hyperbolic spiral is a transcendental plane curve also known as a reciprocal spiral. A hyperbolic spiral is the opposite of an Archimedean spiral and are a type of Cotes' spiral.
It has the pol equation:
It begins at an infinite distance from the pole in the centre (for θ starting from zero r = a/θ starts from infinity), and it winds faster and faster around as it approaches the pole; the distance from any point to the pole, following the curve, is infinite. Applying the transformation from the polar coordinate system:
leads to the following parametric representation in Cartesian coordinates: 
where the parameter t is an equivalent of the polar coordinate θ.
The spiral has an asymptote at y = a: for t approaching zero the ordinate approaches a, while the abscissa grows to infinity:
It was Pierre Varignon who studied the curve as first, in 1704. Later Johann Bernoulli and Roger Cotes worked on the curve.

[[Thrombosis]]
CATEGORIES: Hematology

Thrombosis (Greek: θρόμβωσις) is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus; Greek: θρόμβος) inside a blood vessel, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelets (thrombocytes) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss.  Even when a blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions. A clot that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as an embolus.[tpl]cite journal | author=Furie B, Furie BC | title=Mechanisms of thrombus formation | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | year=2008 | volume=359 | pages=938–949 | doi=10.1056/NEJMra0801082 | pmid=18753650 | issue=9[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Handin RI |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, et al. |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |chapter=Chapter 53: bleeding and thrombosis[/tpl]
When a thrombus is significantly large enough to reduce the blood flow to a tissue, hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) can occur and metabolic products such as lactic acid can accumulate. A larger thrombus causing a much greater obstruction to the blood flow may result in anoxia, the complete deprivation of oxygen and infarction, tissue death. There are also a number of other conditions that can arise according to the location of the thrombus and the organs affected.
Thromboembolism is the combination of thrombosis and its main complication, embolism.

An embolus (plural emboli; from the Greek ἔμβολος "clot, lit. ram") is any detached, traveling intravascular mass (solid, liquid, or gaseous) carried by circulation, which is capable of clogging arterial capillary beds (create an arterial occlusion) at a site distant from its point of origin.[tpl]cite book|author=Kumar V., Abbas A.K., Fausto N.|title=Pathologic Basis of Disease[/tpl]
By contrast there are non-traveling blockages that develop locally from vascular trauma or epithelial pathology and vascular inflammation — like atheroma, thrombi. However, if a thrombus breaks loose from its genesis site it becomes a thrombo-embolus and if not broken down during transit, may cause embolism(s).http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3224

[[Thrombus]]
CATEGORIES: Hematology

A thrombus ([tpl]lang-el|θρόμβος[/tpl]), or blood clot, is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis. There are two components to a thrombus, aggregated platelets that form a platelet plug, and a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein. A thrombus is a healthy response to injury intended to prevent bleeding, but can be harmful in thrombosis, when clots obstruct blood flow through healthy blood vessels.
Mural thrombi are thrombi that adhere to the wall of a blood vessel. They occur in large vessels such as heart and aorta, and can restrict blood flow but usually do not block it entirely.  They appear grey-red with alternating light and dark lines (known as lines of Zahn) which represent bands of fibrin (lighter) with entrapped white blood cells and red blood cells (darker).

Old Sarum ([tpl]lang-la|Sorviodunum[/tpl]) is the site of the earliest settlement of Salisbury in England. The site contains evidence of human habitation as early as 3000 BC. Old Sarum is mentioned in some of the earliest records in the country. It is located on a hill about two miles north of modern Salisbury next to the A345 road.
Old Sarum was originally an  Iron Age hill fort strategically placed on the conjunction of two trade routes and the River Avon. The hill fort is broadly oval shaped, measuring [tpl]convert|400|m|ft[/tpl] in length and [tpl]convert|360|m|ft[/tpl] in width; it consists of a double bank and intermediate ditch with an entrance on the eastern side. The site was used by the Romans, becoming the town of Sorviodunum. The Saxons used the site as a stronghold against marauding Vikings, and the Normans built a stone curtain wall around the Iron Age perimeter and a centrally placed castle on a motte protected by a deep dry moat. A royal palace was built within the castle for King Henry I and subsequently used by Plantagenet monarchs. A Norman cathedral and bishop's residence were built at the western end of the town.
In 1219, the cathedral was demolished in favour of the new one built near the river and the townspeople moved down to the new city, then called New Salisbury or New Sarum. The castle fell out of use and was sold for materials by King Henry VIII. 
By the 19th century, the settlement was officially uninhabited and yet still had formal parliamentary representation, making it the most notorious of the rotten boroughs that existed before the Reform Act 1832.
It is now an English Heritage property and open to the public.

According to the broadest definition, the Namib stretches for more than [tpl]convert|2000|km[/tpl] along the Atlantic coasts of Angola, Namibia, and South Africa, extending southward from the Carunjamba River in Angola, through Namibia and to the Olifants River in Western Cape, South Africa.[tpl]cite book|author=Goudie, Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |chapter=Chapter 17: Namib Sand Sea: Large Dunes in an Ancient Desert |editor1-first=Piotr |editor1-last=Migoń |title=Geomorphological Landscapes of the World |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-TI55urJYyEC&lpg=PR2&dq=Geomorphological%20Landscapes%20of%20the%20World&pg=PR2#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |pages=163–169 |isbn=978-90-481-3054-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Africa |editor1-first=Henry Louis |editor1-last=Gates |editor1-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |editor2-first=Kwame Anthony|editor2-last=Appiah |editor2-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-533770-9 |page=213 |volume=2 |url= |accessdate=[/tpl] The Namib's northernmost portion, which extends [tpl]convert|450|km[/tpl] from the Angola-Namibia border, is known as Moçâmedes Desert, while its southern portion approaches the neighboring Kalahari Desert. From the Atlantic coast eastward, the Namib gradually ascends in elevation, reaching up to [tpl]convert|200|km[/tpl] inland to the foot of the Great Escarpment. Annual precipitation ranges from [tpl]convert|2|mm[/tpl] in the most arid regions to [tpl]convert|200|mm[/tpl] at the escarpment, making the Namib the only true desert in southern Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1315 |title=Namib desert (AT1315) |author=Spriggs, Amy |date= |work=Wild World |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |accessdate=11 December 2011[/tpl] Having endured arid or semi-arid conditions for roughly 55–80 million years, the Namib may be the oldest desert in the world.
The desert geology consists of sand seas near the coast, while gravel plains and scattered mountain outcrops occur further inland. The sand dunes, some of which are [tpl]convert|300|m[/tpl] high and span [tpl]convert|32|km[/tpl] long, are the second largest in the world after the Badain Jaran Desert dunes in China. Temperatures along the coast are stable and generally range between [tpl]convert|9|-|20|°C|°F[/tpl] annually, while temperatures further inland are variable—summer daytime temperatures can exceed [tpl]convert|45|°C[/tpl] while nights can be freezing. Fogs that originate offshore from the collision of the cold Benguela Current and warm air from the Hadley Cell create a fog belt that frequently envelops parts of the desert. Coastal regions can experience more than 180 days of thick fog a year. While this has proved a major hazard to ships—more than a thousand wrecks litter the Skeleton Coast—it is a vital source of moisture for desert life.
The Namib is almost completely uninhabited by humans except for several small settlements and indigenous pastoral groups, including the Ovahimba and Obatjimba Herero in the north, and the Topnaar Nama in the central region. Owing to its antiquity, the Namib may be home to more endemic species than any other desert in the world.[tpl]cite book |title=Dryland Climatology |last=Nicholson |first=Sharon E. |year=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-51649-5 |pages=385–388 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fqussIGJ0NcC&lpg=PA384&pg=PA388#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=13 December 2011[/tpl] Most of the desert wildlife is arthropods and other small animals that live on little water, although larger animals inhabit the northern regions. Near the coast, the cold ocean water is rich in fishery resources and supports populations of brown fur seals and shorebirds, which serve as prey for the Skeleton Coast's lions. Further inland, the Namib-Naukluft National Park, the largest game park in Africa, supports populations of African Bush Elephants, Mountain Zebras, and other large mammals. Although the outer Namib is largely barren of vegetation, lichens and succulents are found in coastal areas, while grasses, shrubs, and ephemeral plants thrive near the escarpment. A few types of trees are also able to survive the extremely arid climate.

[[Galaxy rotation curve]]

CATEGORIES: Astrophysics, Galactic astronomy

The rotation curve of a disc galaxy (also called a velocity curve) is a plot of the magnitude of the orbital velocities (i.e., the speeds) of visible stars or gas in that galaxy versus their radial distance from that galaxy's center, typically rendered graphically as a scatter plot.
A general feature of the galaxy rotation curves that have been obtained through measurement to date is that the orbital speed of stars and gas is almost constant as far from the galactic centre as can be measured (line B in the illustration): that is, stars are observed to revolve around the centre of the galaxy at almost the same speed over a large range of distances from the centre of the galaxy. If disc galaxies had mass distributions similar to the observed distributions of stars and gas then the orbital speed would decline at increasing distances (dotted line A in illustration) in the same way as do other systems with most of their mass in the centre, such as the Solar System or the moons of Jupiter.
The rotation curves of Spiral galaxies are also known to be asymmetric. The observational data from each side of a galaxy are generally averaged. Therefore, only highly asymmetric cases are well known. But smaller asymmetries are also reported.Shane, W. W. and Bieger-Smith, G. P., 1966, “The galactic rotation curve derived from observations of neutral hydrogen”, ``Bull. Astron. Inst. Netherlands’’, 18, 263. RC asymmetry appears to be normal rather than exceptional.Jog, C. J., 2002, “Large-scale asymmetry of rotation curves in lopsided spiral galaxies”, ``A&A’’,391,471 and references therein.
The galaxy rotation problem is the discrepancy between observed galaxy rotation curves and the theoretical prediction, assuming a centrally-dominated mass associated with the observed luminous material. When masses of galaxies are calculated solely from the luminosities and mass-to-light ratios in the disk, and if core portions of spiral galaxies are assumed to approximate to those of stars, the masses derived from the kinematics of the observed rotation and the law of gravity do not match. 
This discrepancy can be accounted for by postulating a large amount of dark matter that permeates the galaxy and extends into the galaxy's halo. 
Though dark matter is by far the most accepted explanation for the resolution to the galaxy rotation problem, other proposals have been offered with varying degrees of success. Of the possible alternatives, the most notable is Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which involves modifying the laws of gravity.For an extensive discussion of the data and its fit to MOND see [tpl]cite arxiv |title=The MOND Paradigm |author=Mordehai Milgrom |class= astro-ph|eprint=0801.3133 |year=2007[/tpl] This paper is a talk presented at the XIX Rencontres de Blois "Matter and energy in the Universe: from nucleosynthesis to cosmology".

In geology and sedimentology, connate fluids are liquids that were trapped in the pores of sedimentary rocks as they were deposited.  These liquids are largely composed of water, but also contain many mineral components as ions in solution.
As rocks are buried, they undergo lithification and the connate fluids are usually expelled.  If the escape route for these fluids is blocked, the pore fluid pressure can build up, leading to overpressure.

CATEGORIES: Fregata, Fregatidae, Seabirds, National symbols of Nauru

The frigatebirds are a family, Fregatidae, of seabirds.  There are five species in the single genus Fregata. They are also sometimes called Man of War birds or Pirate birds. Since they are related to the pelicans, the term "frigate pelican" is also a name applied to them. They have long wings, tails, and bills and the males have a red gular pouch that is inflated during the breeding season to attract a mate.
Frigatebirds are pelagic piscivores that obtain most of their food on the wing. A small amount of their diet is obtained by robbing other seabirds, a behaviour that has given the family its name, and by snatching seabird chicks. Frigatebirds are seasonally monogamous, and nest colonially. A rough nest is constructed in low trees or on the ground on remote islands. A single eggHOWARD, Laura. University of Michigan Museum of Zoology – ADW : Family Fregatidae is laid each breeding season. The duration of parental care in frigatebirds is among the longest for birds, rivalled only by the Southern Ground Hornbill and some large accipitrids.See Skutch; Alexander Frank (author) and Gardner, Dana (illustrator) Helpers at birds' nests : a worldwide survey of cooperative breeding and related behavior; pp. 69–71.

The BMW 801 was a powerful German air-cooled 14-cylinder-radial aircraft engine built by BMW and used in a number of German Luftwaffe aircraft of World War II. Production versions of the twin-row engine generated between 1,560 and 2,000 PS (1,540-1,970 hp, or 1,150-1,470 kW). It was the most produced radial engine of Germany in World War II with more than 28,000 built. 
The 801 was originally intended to replace existing radial types in German transport and utility aircraft. At the time, it was widely agreed among European designers[tpl]fact|date=December 2013[/tpl] that an inline engine was a requirement for high performance designs due to its smaller frontal area and resulting lower drag. Kurt Tank successfully fitted a BMW 801 to a new fighter design he was working on, and as a result the 801 became best known as the power plant for the famous Focke-Wulf Fw 190.

A Bilander, also spelled billander or be'landre, was a small European merchant ship with two masts, used in the Netherlands for coast and canal traffic and occasionally seen in the North Sea but more frequently to be seen in the Mediterranean Sea. The mainmast was lateen-rigged with a trapezoidal mainsail, but the foremast carried the conventional square course and square topsail. Displacement was typically under 100 tons. The bilander was short-lived, being replaced by more efficient designs, and few examples exist today.
The word bilander comes from the Dutch and literally means "by-lander" because it was used on canals.

The Ascension Frigatebird (Fregata aquila) breeds on the rocky slopes of the tiny Boatswain Bird Island just off Ascension Island in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It formerly bred on the larger island, but was exterminated by introduced cats, Brown Rats, and human persecution; in 2012 it was announced that a breeding pair had been found on Ascension Island following a project to exterminate feral cats.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/dec/08/frigatebird-returns-to-ascension |last=McKie |first=Robin |title=Frigatebird returns to nest on Ascension for first time since Darwin |newspaper=The Observer |date=8 December 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2012 [/tpl]
As with other frigatebirds, its movements outside the breeding season are little known because of identification problems within this difficult group, but it occurs off west Africa. It feeds on fish and similar surface prey such as small turtles.
This species is very similar to the other frigatebirds and is similarly sized to all but Lesser Frigatebird. It has a white axillary spur, and juveniles show a white head, and a distinctly white hind neck with no reddish-brown hue. It has a brown breast band.
A frigatebird found moribund in 1953 in Tiree, Scotland was identified at the time as Magnificent Frigatebird but the specimen was re-examined in 2002 and found to be an Ascension Frigatebird.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Wallbridge |first1=Grahame |last2=Small |first2=Brian |last3=McGowan |first3=Robert Y |year=2003 |title=From the Rarities Committee’s files: Ascension Frigatebird  on Tiree – new to the Western Palearctic  |journal=British Birds |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=58–73[/tpl] A juvenile was photographed at Bowmore on the island of Islay in July 2013.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-23202393 |title=Rare Ascension frigatebird recorded on Islay |publisher=BBC Highlands & Islands |date=7 July 2013 |accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl]

Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output — particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines — is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[tpl]cite book|author=Mike Brake|title=Comparative Youth Culture: The Sociology of Youth Cultures and Youth Subcultures in America, Britain, and Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vcv2-Gc7nWYC&pg=PA160|date=December 31, 1990|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-05108-8|page=160[/tpl] Television, magazines, and newspapers are primarily for-profit corporations based on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. Nevertheless, both the television broadcasting and publications sectors require a number of government interventions to remain profitable, ranging from regulation that bars foreign companies in the broadcasting industry to tax laws that limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[tpl]cite book|author1=Steven Globerman|author2=Institute for Research on Public Policy|title=Cultural Regulation in Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jlBGJyEdDy4C&pg=PR18|year=1983|publisher=IRPP|isbn=978-0-920380-81-9|page=18[/tpl]
In the broadcasting sector, Canada has a government-funded broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Société Radio-Canada, which operates radio and TV networks in English and French. As well, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as Ontario's TVOntario and Quebec's Télé-Québec. Given Canada's small market and its position next to the dominant producer of feature films, the Canadian film industry receives substantial assistance from the government. In the 2000s, about half of the budget of a typical Canadian film came from various federal and provincial government sources.
The organization Reporters Without Borders compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organization's assessment of their press freedom records. In 2011-12 Canada was ranked 10th out of 179 countries, which was an improvement from the preceding year.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=classement&id_rubrique=1043 |title=A Press Freedom Index 2011 - 2012 |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]

[tpl]nihongo|Usagi Yojimbo|兎用心棒|Usagi Yōjinbō|lit. "rabbit bodyguard"[/tpl] is a comic book series created by Stan Sakai that first appeared in Albedo Anthropomorphics #2 published by Thoughts and Images in November 1984.Albedo Anthropomorphics #2 (Thoughts and Images, 1984) Stan Sakai accepted an offer to move his warrior rabbit to Fantagraphics Books where he appeared in several issues of the new anthropomorphic anthology series Critters. Usagi's popularity influenced Fantagraphics to then release the Usagi Yojimbo Summer Special in October 1986Usagi Yojimbo Summer Special (Fantagraphics Books 1986) and then to give the ronin rabbit his own on-going series with issue #1 being published in July 1987.Usagi Yojimbo #1 (Fantagraphics Books 1987)http://www.usagiyojimbo.com In 2011, IGN ranked Miyamoto Usagi 92nd in the top 100 comic books heroes.
Set primarily at the beginning of Edo period of Japan, with anthropomorphic animals replacing humans, the series features a rabbit ronin, Miyamoto Usagi, whom Stan Sakai based partially on the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi.[tpl]cite news|title= Don't get between the rabbit and his sword|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=2005-11-25|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/18/books/bk-solomon18|accessdate=2010-11-28 | first=Charles | last=Solomon[/tpl] Usagi wanders the land on a musha shugyo (warrior's pilgrimage) occasionally selling his services as a bodyguard. Usagi Yojimbo is heavily influenced by Japanese cinema and has included references to the work of Akira Kurosawa (the title of the series is derived from Kurosawa's 1960 film Yojimbo) and to icons of popular Japanese cinema such as Lone Wolf and Cub, Zatoichi, and Godzilla. The series is also influenced somewhat by Groo the Wanderer by Sergio Aragonés (Sakai is the letterer for that series), but the overall tone of Usagi Yojimbo is more serious and reflective.
The books are primarily episodic, with some novel-length narratives, with underlying larger plots which create long extended story lines. The stories include many references to Japanese history and Japanese folklore, and sometimes include mythical creatures.[tpl]cite news|title= Take one part Toshiro Mifune.

There are often stories whose purpose is to illustrate various elements of Japanese arts and crafts, such as the fashioning of kites, swords, and pottery.

The Boeing E-6 Mercury (formerly E-6 Hermes) is an airborne command post and communications relay based on the Boeing 707-320. The original E-6A manufactured by Boeing's defense division entered service with the United States Navy in July 1989, replacing the EC-130Q. It conveyed instructions from the National Command Authority to fleet ballistic missile submarines, a mission known as TACAMO (TAke Charge And Move Out). The E-6B model deployed in October 1998 kept this role, but added further command post capabilities and control of land-based missiles and nuclear-armed bombers. The E-6B replaced Air Force EC-135Cs in the "Looking Glass" role, providing command and control of U.S. nuclear forces should ground-based control become inoperable. With production lasting until 1991, the E-6 was the final derivative of the Boeing 707 to be built.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

A front-side bus (FSB) was a computer communication interface (bus) often used in Intel-chip-based computers during the 1990s and 2000s.  The competing EV6 bus served the same function for AMD CPUs.  Both typically carry data between the central processing unit (CPU) and a memory controller hub, known as the northbridge.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E1p2FDL7P5QC&pg=PA314 |title=Upgrading and repairing PCs |author=Scott Mueller |edition=15th |publisher=Que Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7897-2974-3 |page=314[/tpl]
Depending on the implementation, some computers may also have a back-side bus that connects the CPU to the cache. This bus and the cache connected to it are faster than accessing the system memory (or RAM) via the front-side bus. The speed of the front side bus is often used as an important measure of the performance of a computer.
The original front-side bus architecture has been replaced by HyperTransport, Intel QuickPath Interconnect or DMI 2.0 in modern volume CPUs.

[[Thermal history modelling]]

CATEGORIES: Petroleum geology, Sedimentology

Thermal history modelling is an exercise undertaken during basin modelling to evaluate the temperature history of stratigraphic layers in a sedimentary basin.
The thermal history of a basin is usually calibrated using thermal indicator data, including vitrinite reflectance and fission tracks in the minerals apatite and zircon.
The temperatures undergone by rocks in a sedimentary basin are crucial when attempting to evaluate the quantity, nature and volume of hydrocarbons (fossil fuels) produced by diagenesis of kerogens (a group of chemicals formed from the decay of organic matter).
Fourier's Law provides a simplified one-dimensional description of the variation in heat flow Q as a function of thermal conductivity k and thermal gradient dT/dz:
(The minus sign indicates that heat flows in the opposite direction to increasing depth, that is, towards the Earth's surface.)
If the assumptions used to justify this simplified approximation (i.e. steady-state heat conduction, no convection or advection) are accepted, we define the simple 1-dimensional heat diffusion equation where temperature T at a depth z and time t is given by the equation:
where Tt0 is the surface temperature history, Qt is the heat flow history and k is thermal conductivity.  The integral thus represents the integrated thermal conductivity history of a 1-dimensional column of rock.
Thermal history modelling attempts to describe the temperature history Tz,t and therefore requires a knowledge of the burial history of the stratigraphic layers which is obtained through the process of back-stripping.

[[Ideology of Tintin]]

CATEGORIES: Tintin

Hergé started drawing his comics series The Adventures of Tintin in 1929 for Le Petit Vingtième, the children's section of the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle, run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez, an avid supporter of social Catholicism, a right-wing movement. During World War II, Tintin appeared in the Brussels daily pro-German Le Soir; after the war he appeared in his own Tintin magazine (founded by a member of the Resistance, Raymond Leblanc) until Hergé's death in 1983.
As a young artist Hergé was influenced by his mentors, specifically the Abbé Wallez, who encouraged Hergé to use Tintin as a tool for Catholic propaganda to influence Belgian children. This shows in his earlier works within the Tintin series. As a result, European stereotypes pervade Hergé's early catalogue. A breakthrough came in 1934,  when the cartoonist was introduced to Zhang Chongren, a Chinese student, who explained Chinese politics, culture, language, art, and philosophy to him, which Hergé used to great effect in The Blue Lotus. From this point onward, the artist developed ideologically, amidst the collapse of his country and the Second World War, and so did the series: the general trend of the postwar stories is to become more progressive and universalist. Though, the very last frame of the last completed adventure suggests a cynical view that the poor will suffer, no matter who rules the state.

[[Submitochondrial particle]]

CATEGORIES: Cellular respiration

A submitochondrial particle is a compartmentalized membranous product of exposing mitochondria to ultrasound. This causes the cristae to pinch off forcing the inner mitochondrial membrane inside out. As a consequence, the F1 particle becomes exposed and on the outside. Using chaotropic agents such as urea, these particles can be removed, dissociating the related ATPase activity from the membrane. However, the electron transport complexes remain on the membrane.
If F1 particles are removed from submitochondrial particles, they can be reconstituted by carefully removing the chaotropic agent.

At the Battle of Taginae (also known as the Battle of Busta Gallorum) in June/July 552, the forces of the Byzantine Empire under Narses broke the power of the Ostrogoths in Italy, and paved the way for the temporary Byzantine reconquest of the Italian Peninsula.  
From as early as 549 the Emperor Justinian I had planned to dispatch a major army to Italy to conclude the protracted war with the Ostrogoths initiated in 535. During 550-51 a large expeditionary force totaling 20,000 or possibly 25,000 men was gradually assembled at Salona on the Adriatic, comprising regular Byzantine units and a large contingent of foreign allies, notably Lombards, Heruls and Bulgars.J. Norwich, Byzantium: The Early Centuries, p. 251 The imperial chamberlain (cubicularius) Narses was appointed to command in mid 551.

[[Nuclear isomer]]
CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics

A nuclear isomer is a metastable state of an atomic nucleus caused by the excitation of one or more of its nucleons (protons or neutrons). "Metastable" refers to the fact that these excited states have half-lives more than 100 to 1000 times the half-lives of the excited nuclear states that decay with a "prompt" half life (ordinarily on the order of 10−12 seconds). As a result, the term "metastable" is usually restricted to refer to isomers with half-lives of 10−9 seconds or longer. Some sources recommend 5 × 10−9 s to distinguish the metastable half life from the normal "prompt" gamma emission half life.Nuclear isomers
Occasionally the half-lives are far longer than this, and can last minutes, hours, years, or in one notable case [tpl]Nuclide2|Ta|180|m[/tpl], so long that it has never been observed to decay (at least 1015 years). Sometimes, the gamma decay from a metastable state is given the special name of an isomeric transition, but save for the long-lived nature of the meta-stable parent nuclear isomer, this process resembles shorter-lived gamma decays in all external aspects. The longer lives of nuclear isomers (metastable states) are often due to the larger degree of nuclear spin change which must be involved in their gamma emission to reach the ground state.

Dating creation is the attempt to provide an estimate of the age of the Earth or the age of the universe as understood by various religious traditions. Varieties of traditional beliefs held that the Earth, or the entire Universe, was brought into being in a grand Creation event by one or more gods. Once these cultures developed calendars, many began to ponder the question of precisely how long ago this event happened.

John Sculley III (born April 6, 1939) is an American businessman, entrepreneur and investor in high-tech startups. Sculley was  vice-president (1970–1977) and president of PepsiCo (1977–1983), until he became CEO of Apple on April 8, 1983, a position he held until leaving in 1993. In May 1987, Sculley was named Silicon Valley's top-paid executive, with an annual salary of US$2.2M.Malone, Infinite Loop, pg 412.
Sales at Apple increased from $800 million to $8 billion under Sculley's management, although many attribute this success to Sculley merely joining at an opportune time when Steve Jobs' vision and creations had begun to skyrocket.The New York Times: "Company News – Visionary Apple Chairman Moves On" However, his stint at Apple remains controversial due to his departure from founder Steve Jobs's sales structure, particularly regarding Sculley's decision to compete with IBM in selling computers to the same types of customers.The New York Times: "New Strategy Set by Apple" Others say that the "two clashed over management styles and priorities, Jobs focusing on future innovation and Sculley more on current product lines and profitability."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2013/03/18/ex-apple-ceo-john-sculley-believes-innovation-lull-will-end-smart-watch-likely-key-product-focus/ |title=Sculley quic bio at end of article" |publisher="MacRumors |date=2013-03-18 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] But Sculley ultimately was forced to step down as Apple CEO because he was opposed to licensing Macintosh software and was talking to Goldman-Sachs about splitting Apple into two companies. When Sculley left in May 1993, Apple had $2 billion in cash and $200 million in debt.
John Sculley is recognized worldwide as an expert in marketing, in part because of his early successes at PepsiCo, notably his introduction of the Pepsi Challenge, which allowed the company to gain market share from primary rival Coca Cola.[tpl]cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9|page=149[/tpl] He used similar marketing strategies throughout the 1980s and 1990s at Apple to mass market Macintosh personal computers, and today he continues to speak and write about disruptive marketing strategies.

Exploratory engineering is a term coined by K. Eric Drexler to describe the process of designing and analyzing detailed hypothetical models of systems that are not feasible with current technologies or methods, but do seem to be clearly within the bounds of what science considers to be possible within the narrowly defined scope of operation of the hypothetical system model. It usually results in paper or video prototypes, or (more likely nowadays) computer models that are as convincing as possible to those that know the relevant science, given the lack of experimental confirmation. By analogy with protoscience, it might be considered a form of protoengineering.

Life extension science, also known as anti-aging medicine, indefinite life extension, experimental gerontology, and biomedical gerontology, is the study of slowing down or reversing the processes of aging to extend both the maximum and average lifespan. Some researchers in this area, and "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation with stem cells, molecular repair, and organ replacement (such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia[tpl]OED|agerasia[/tpl]) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition.
The sale of putative anti-aging products such as nutrition, physical fitness, skin care, hormone replacements, vitamins, supplements and herbs is a lucrative global industry, with the US market generating about $50 billion of revenue each year. Some medical experts state that the use of such products has not been proven to affect the aging process, and many claims of anti-aging medicine advocates have been roundly criticized by medical experts, including the American Medical Association.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Holliday, R |title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine |journal=Biogerontology volume=10 issue=2 pages=223–8 date=April 2009 pmid=18726707 |doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6 |pmid=18726707 |volume=10 |issue=2 |date=April 2009 |pages=223–8[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |first=Carl |last=Marziali |date=7 December 2010 |title=Reaching Toward the Fountain of Youth |url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/health/reaching_toward_the_fountain_of_youth.html |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |accessdate=7 December 2010[/tpl]

Chess Records was an American record company based in Chicago, Illinois. It specialized in blues, R&B, soul, gospel music, early rock and roll, and occasional jazz recordings, released on several labels including Chess, Checker, Argo and Cadet.
Formed and run by Polish immigrant brothers Leonard and Phil Chess, the company produced and released many important singles and albums, which are now regarded as central to the rock music canon. Musician and critic Cub Koda described Chess Records as "America's greatest blues label."Allmusic ((( Chess Blues > Overview )))

Freiherr Adolph Franz Friedrich Ludwig Knigge (16 October 1752 – 6 May 1796) was a German writer and Freemason.
Knigge was born in Bredenbeck (now a part of Wennigsen, Lower Saxony) in the Electorate of Hanover as a member of the lesser nobility. He studied law from 1769 to 1772 in Göttingen where he became a member of Corps Hannovera. He was allegedly initiated into Freemasonry in 1772 in Kassel, where he held a position as Court Squire (hofjunker) and Assessor of the War and Domains Exchequer.  In 1777 he became Chamberlain at the Weimar court.
In 1780 Knigge joined Adam Weishaupt's Bavarian Illuminati and his work with the Illuminati gave the group a great deal of publicity. But in 1783 dissensions arose between Knigge and Weishaupt, which resulted in the final withdrawal of the former on 1 July 1784. Knigge could no longer endure Weishaupt's pedantic domineering, which frequently assumed offensive forms. He accused Weishaupt of "Jesuitism", and suspected him of being "a Jesuit in disguise" (Nachtr., I, 129). "And was I", he adds, "to labour under his banner for mankind, to lead men under the yoke of so stiff-necked a fellow?—Never!"
Knigge's involvement with the Illuminati, support of the advancement of human rights, and a period of serious illness led to the loss of support of his aristocratic sponsors and finally his fortune. Knigge found a measure of financial stability again with a position in Bremen in 1790. He died in Bremen in 1796.
In Germany, Knigge is best remembered for his book Über den Umgang mit Menschen (On Human Relations), a treatise on the fundamental principles of human relations that has the reputation of being the authoritative guide to behaviour, politeness, and etiquette. The work is more of a sociological and philosophical treatise on the basis of human relations than a how-to guide on etiquette, but the German word “Knigge” has come to mean “good manners” or books on etiquette.

DC Talk (styled as dc Talk), was a Grammy-winning Christian rap trio. The group was formed in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1987 by Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait, and Kevin Max Smith. They have released five major studio albums together: DC Talk (1989), Nu Thang (1990), Free at Last (1992), Jesus Freak (1995), and Supernatural (1998). In 2002, the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music called DC Talk "the most popular overtly Christian act of all time."[tpl]cite book |last = Powell |first = Mark Allan |title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |publisher = Hendrickson Publishers |year = 2002 |location = Peabody, Massachusetts |pages = 239–42 |isbn = 1-56563-679-1[/tpl]
In 2000, the group released an EP titled Solo which contained two solo songs from each member. Since that time, DC Talk has been on an indefinite hiatus, and the three band members have each led solo careers. They have performed and recorded individual songs together several times during the 2000s, although the group never officially reunited or disbanded.
The group's musical style evolved significantly throughout their career. Their first two releases, DC Talk and Nu Thang, were of the hip hop genre. DC Talk's third album, Free at Last, also mainly took influence from the hip hop style, although their music began taking on a rock sound. The trio's last two albums, Jesus Freak and Supernatural, were predominantly pop rock.

Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally "powerful" sound.Neo-classical & Power Metal (progrockandmetal.net) The term was first used in the middle of the '80sPower Metal (guitarmasterclass.net) and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Germany, Greece, Finland, Italy and Scandinavia), Latin America (Argentina, Brazil) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.

Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordingsChris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 (ISBN 0-7862-8517-6) and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings, usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece, and emphasizing the drum and bass parts (this stripped down track is sometimes referred to as a 'riddim'). Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo, reverb, panoramic delay, and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.
Dub was pioneered by Osbourne "King Tubby" Ruddock, Lee "Scratch" Perry, Errol Thompson and others  in the late 1960s.  Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy.Larkin, Colin: "The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae", 1998, Virgin Books, ISBN 0-7535-0242-9 These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different.

[[Thermodynamic activity]]
CATEGORIES: Dimensionless numbers of chemistry, Physical chemistry, Thermodynamics, Thermodynamic properties

In chemical thermodynamics, activity (symbol a) is a measure of the “effective concentration” of a species in a mixture, in the sense that the species' chemical potential depends on the activity of a real solution in the same way that it would depend on concentration for an ideal solution. 
By convention, activity is treated as a dimensionless quantity, although its value depends on customary choices of standard state for the species. The activity of pure substances in condensed phases (solid or liquids) is normally taken as unity (the number 1). Activity depends on temperature, pressure and composition of the mixture, among other things. For gases, the activity is the effective partial pressure, and is usually referred to as fugacity.
The difference between activity and other measures of composition arises because molecules in non-ideal gases or solutions interact with each other, either to attract or to repel each other. The activity of an ion is particularly influenced by its surroundings.
Activities should be used to define equilibrium constants but, in practice, concentrations are often used instead. The same is often true of equations for reaction rates. However, there are circumstances where the activity and the concentration are significantly different and, as such, it is not valid to approximate with concentrations where activities are required. Two examples serve to illustrate this point:

A chassis ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|æ|s|i[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|s|i[/tpl]; plural: "chassis") consists of an internal framework that supports a man-made object in its construction and use. It is analogous to an animal's skeleton. An example of a chassis is the underpart of a motor vehicle, consisting of the frame (on which the body is mounted). If the running gear such as wheels and transmission, and sometimes even the driver's seat, are included then the assembly is described as a rolling chassis.

Theophilus Philip (23 March 1926 – 24 December 1960), better known as Mighty Spoiler, was a Trinidadian calypsonian.
Spoiler's career began in 1946 (see 1946 in music) at the House of Lords Tent, and he soon became one of the most popular calypso singers, known for hits such as "Bedbug", "Magistrate Try Himself", "Picking Sense out of Nonsense", "Royal Wedding" and "Trinidad is My Land". The last of these has, to some extent, entered the consciousness of every Trinidadian. He won the Calypso King title on three occasions, in 1948 (with "Royal Wedding"), 1953 ("Bed Bug"), and 1955 ("Pick Sense Out of Nonsense").Thompson, Dave (2002) Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, ISBN 0-87930-655-6, p. 5

His performing and recording careers emerged during the period of transition from completely segregated "race music", to "rhythm and blues", which was marketed to white audiences.

[[Dragonlance]]

CATEGORIES: Dragonlance, Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings

Dragonlance is a shared universe created by Laura and Tracy Hickman, and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis under the direction of TSR, Inc. into a series of popular fantasy novels.  The Hickmans conceived Dragonlance while driving in their car on the way to TSR for a job application. At TSR Tracy met Margaret Weis, his future writing partner, and they gathered a group of associates to play the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules, a series of novels, licensed products such as board games, and lead miniature figures.
In 1984, TSR published the first Dragonlance novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight.  It began the Chronicles trilogy, a core element of the Dragonlance world. While the authoring team of Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis wrote the setting's central books, numerous other authors contributed novels and short stories to the setting. Over 190 novels have used the Dragonlance setting, and have been accompanied by supplemental Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting material for over a decade. In 1997, Wizards of the Coast LLC purchased TSR, and licensed Dragonlance to Sovereign Press, Inc in 2001 to produce game materials; this licensing agreement expired in 2007.
The fictional Dragonlance world of Krynn contains numerous characters, an extensive timeline, and a detailed geography.  The history of Krynn consists of five ages.  The novels and related game products are primarily set in the fourth age, The Age of Despair. Since February 2009, the fifth age, the Age of Mortals, has been used.  The Heroes of the Lance, created by Weis and Hickman, are the popular protagonists of the Chronicles trilogy. Along with D&D's world of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance is one of the most popular shared worlds in fiction.

[[Bicycle brake]]

CATEGORIES: Bicycle parts, Vehicle braking technologies, Brakes

A bicycle brake reduces the speed of a bicycle or prevents it from moving. The three main types are: rim brakes, disc brakes, and drum brakes. There have been various types of brake used throughout history, and several are still in use today
Most bicycle brake systems consist of three main components: a mechanism for the rider to apply the brakes, such as brake levers or pedals; a mechanism for transmitting that signal, such as Bowden cables, hydraulic hoses, rods, or the bicycle chain; and the brake mechanism itself, a caliper or drum, to press two or more surfaces together in order to convert, via friction, kinetic energy of the bike and rider into thermal energy to be dissipated.

Mount Hood, called Wy'east by the Multnomah tribe, is a stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc of northern Oregon. It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located about [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] east-southeast of Portland, on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties.  In addition to being Oregon's highest mountain, it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence.
The height assigned to Mount Hood's snow-covered peak has varied over its history. Modern sources point to three different heights: [tpl]convert|11249|ft|0[/tpl], a 1991 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey (NGS),[ref]

Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt,[ref]Most likely to erupt based on history; see

though based on its history, an explosive eruption is unlikely. Still, the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7 percent, so the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) characterizes it as "potentially active", but the mountain is informally considered dormant.[ref]

[[Ambidexterity]]

CATEGORIES: Handedness, Mental processes

Ambidexterity is the state of being equally adept in the use of both left and right appendages (such as the hands). It is one of the most famous varieties of cross-dominance. People that are naturally ambidextrous are uncommon, with only one out of one hundred people being naturally ambidextrous."Mixed-handed children more likely to have mental health, language and scholastic problems, study finds. " The degree of versatility with each hand is generally the qualitative factor in determining a person's ambidexterity.
In modern times, it is more common to find people considered ambidextrous who were originally left handed and who learned to be ambidextrous, either deliberately or during childhood institutions such as schools, or jobs where right-handed habits are often emphasized or required. Since many everyday devices (such as can openers and scissors) are asymmetrical and designed for right-handed people, many left-handlers learn to use them right-handedly due to the rarity or lack of left-handed models. Thus, left-handed people are much more likely to develop motor skills in their non-dominant hand than right-handed people (who are not subjected to left-favoring devices). Right-handers may become ambidextrous due to an injury of their right hand or arm. Ambidexterity is often encouraged in activities requiring a great deal of skill in both hands, such as knitting, typing on a computer, juggling, swimming, percussion, keyboard music, baseball, paintball, lacrosse, surgery, boxing, martial arts, Parkour and basketball.

[[Penny-farthing]]

CATEGORIES: 1869 introductions, History of cycling, Cycle types

Penny-farthing, high wheel, high wheeler, and ordinary are all terms used to describe a type of bicycle with a large front wheel and a much smaller rear wheel that was popular after the boneshaker, until the development of the safety bicycle, in the 1880s. They were the first machines to be called "bicycles".
Although they are now most commonly known as "penny-farthings", this term was probably not used until they were nearly outdated; the first recorded print reference is 1891 in Bicycling News. It comes from the British penny and farthing coins, one much larger than the other, so that the side view resembles a penny leading a farthing. For most of their reign, they were simply known as "bicycles". In the late 1890s, the retronym "ordinary" began to be used, to distinguish them from the emerging safety bicycles, and this term or Hi-wheel (and variants) is preferred by many modern enthusiasts.
About 1870, English inventor, James Starley, described as the father of the bicycle industry, and others began producing bicycles based on the French boneshaker but with front wheels of increasing size, because larger front wheels, up to 1.5 m (60 in) in diameter, enabled higher speeds on bicycles limited to direct drive. In 1878, Albert Pope began manufacturing the Columbia bicycle outside of Boston, starting their two-decade heyday in America.
Although the trend was short-lived, the penny-farthing became a symbol of the late Victorian era. Its popularity also coincided with the birth of cycling as a sport.

SLC Punk! is a 1998 American comedy-drama film written and directed by James Merendino. The film is about the young punk rock fan Steven "Stevo" Levy, a college graduate living in Salt Lake City. The character is portrayed as a stereotype of an anarchist punk in the mid-1980s. Many events and characters in the movie are allegedly based on real life, although they may have been exaggerated.
The character of Stevo is based on the life of writer/director James Merendino, although the character is named after Stephen Egerton, originally known as Stephen "Stevo" O'Reilly, who played for the Salt Lake City punk band Massacre Guys, and eventually joined the L.A. bands Descendents and ALL.  SLC Punk was chosen as the opening-night feature at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival."SUMMER FILMS: INDIES; Festival to Festival, a Movable Marketplace," New York Times, Sunday, May 2, 1999 
Merendino created the film based on his experience growing up in Salt Lake City. Although the film is not autobiographical, Merendino has said that many characters were based on people he knew.[tpl]cite news| title=S.L.-filmed 'Punk!' becomes a cult classic| author=Chris Hicks | publisher=Deseret News| date=2003-08-08 | page=W05[/tpl]

[[Buddha (album)]]

Buddha is the third and final demo by the American rock band Blink-182. Recorded and released in January 1994 under the name Blink, it was the band's first recording to be sold and distributed. Blink-182 was formed in Poway, California, a suburb outside of San Diego, in August 1992. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus were introduced to one another by Hoppus' sister. The duo recruited drummer Scott Raynor and began to practice together in his bedroom, spending hours together writing music, attending punk shows and movies and playing practical jokes. The band had recorded two previous demos in Raynor's bedroom — Flyswatter and Demo No.2 — using a four track recorder.
Pat Secor, Hoppus' boss at music store The Wherehouse, was attempting to start his own record label, named Filter Records. Secor pulled money from his savings and helped finance and produce the demo recording. Buddha was recorded live at local Santee studio Doubletime, compiling a collection that represented nearly all of the songs the band had written up to that point. Hoppus and friends Cam Jones and Kerry Key created the cassette artwork, and the original cassette packaging was compiled by the band and Hoppus' family. Locally distributed to several San Diego record stores and available for purchase at early concerts, Buddha helped the trio cement an audience and was a deciding factor in their signing to local label Cargo in 1994.
The recording became the subject of a legal dispute between the band and Secor in later years. The band accused Secor of selling the tape without paying royalties, and attempted to put a stop to his distribution with help of lawyer Joe Escalante of The Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. Kung Fu digitally remixed and remastered the demo and commercially re-released it in October 1998, deleting two original tracks for other recordings from the original session. Kung Fu has since reportedly sold 300,000 copies of Buddha. It is currently the only commercially available demo by Blink-182.

Cheshire Cat is the debut studio album by the American rock band Blink-182. Recorded at Westbeach Recorders in Los Angeles and produced by Otis Barthoulameu and the band themselves, the album was released on February 17, 1995 through local independent record label Cargo Music. The trio, composed of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Scott Raynor, formed in 1992 and recorded three demos that impressed the San Diego-based Cargo. In addition, their reputation as an irreverent local live act at venues such as SOMA alerted the label, which was trying to expand into different genres.
Cargo were still not in a position to offer more than a few days' worth of finances to record the album, and so the band recorded under financial constraints at Westbeach. Ten Foot Pole member Steve Kravac engineered the recording and advised the trio to record additional overdubs. As such, the band spent an additional week re-recording several tracks at Santee, California's Doubletime Studios. The record was originally released with the band's name as Blink, until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action, after which the band appended "-182" to the end of their name.
Released during the breakthrough year for punk rock in California, the album brought the band great success in and outside of the San Diego skate punk scene. "M+M's" and "Wasting Time" were released as singles to promote the album, and received popularity locally through radio play. The band toured in support of the album vigorously, most notably on the GoodTimes Tour of 1995, which brought them outside of California for the first time. Cheshire Cat is cited by bands and fans as an iconic release and has sold in excess of 250,000 copies as of 2001.

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of networking protocols that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and establish functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment. UPnP is intended primarily for residential networks without enterprise-class devices.
The UPnP technology is promoted by the UPnP Forum. The UPnP Forum is a computer industry initiative to enable simple and robust connectivity to stand-alone devices and personal computers from many different vendors. The Forum consists of over eight hundred vendors involved in everything from consumer electronics to network computing.
The concept of UPnP is an extension of plug-and-play, a technology for dynamically attaching devices directly to a computer, although UPnP is not directly related to the earlier plug-and-play technology. UPnP devices are "plug-and-play" in that when connected to a network they automatically establish working configurations with other devices.

[[Dude Ranch (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Blink-182 albums, MCA Records albums, 1997 albums, English-language albums, Albums produced by Mark Trombino, Albums certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America

Dude Ranch is the second studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Recorded at Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, California with producer Mark Trombino, the album was released in the United States on June 17, 1997, jointly through independent label Cargo Music and major label MCA Records. MCA signed the band in 1996 following moderate sales of their debut Cheshire Cat (1995) and growing popularity of the trio in Australia. Dude Ranch was the band's final recording released on Cargo and their last with original drummer Scott Raynor before he was dismissed from the band in 1998.
The band recorded the album during the winter of 1996–1997. With lyrical material written on the band's nonstop tours over the previous years, as well as completed songs, the band recorded with Trombino in sessions that lasted for five weeks. During the production for Dude Ranch, the members of Blink-182 were plagued with difficulties only made worse by the rushed schedule: bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge, co-vocalists for the band, were having vocal problems and Raynor had to record his drum tracks with both heels broken, on crutches.
Promoted by lead single "Dammit (Growing Up)", the record was released in the summer of 1997 and was a success. "Dammit" became a rock radio hit single and helped the band gain mainstream credibility as they toured worldwide on the Vans Warped Tour. Three more singles were released, with "Josie (Everything's Gonna Be Fine)" gathering MTV play and charting highly in Australia. Dude Ranch eventually grew in sales and was certified platinum in the US by the end of the decade. In 2011, Total Guitar referred to the record as "a genuine modern punk classic."

[[Scrambling]]

CATEGORIES: Types of climbing, Hiking

Scrambling (also known as alpine scrambling) is a method of ascending rocky faces and ridges. It is an ambiguous term that lies somewhere between hillwalking and rock climbing.See Terry Adby and Stuart Johnston, The Hillwalker's Guide to Mountaineering, (Milnthorpe:Cicerone, 2003), ISBN 1-85284-393-4, pp.62-65 for more on defining scrambles. It is often distinguished from hillwalking by defining a scramble as a route where hands must be used in the ascent. Less exists to distinguish it from climbing, with many easy climbs sometimes referred to as difficult scrambles. A distinction can be made by defining a climb as any ascent where hands are used to hold body weight, rather than just for balance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
The Mountaineers climbing organization defines scrambling as follows:
 "Alpine Scrambles are off-trail trips, often on snow or rock, with a 'non-technical' summit as a destination. A non-technical summit is one that is reached without the need for certain types of climbing equipment (body harness, rope, protection hardware, etc), and not involving travel on extremely steep slopes or on glaciers. However, this can mean negotiating lower angle rock, traveling through talus and scree, crossing streams, fighting one's way through dense brush, and walking on snow-covered slopes."The Mountaineers.

On 19 June 1797 Hume was born at Seven Hills (his father's property) near Parramatta, a settlement close to (and now a suburb of) Sydney.
Hume was the eldest son of Andrew Hamilton Hume and his wife Elizabeth, née Kennedy. Andrew Hume got the appointment of Commissary-General for New South Wales, and came out to this colony in 1797.

It differs from more traditional methods that derive from critical path and PERT algorithms, which emphasize task order and rigid scheduling.  A critical chain project network strives to keep resources levelly loaded, but requires that they be flexible in start times, and quickly switch between tasks and task chains to keep the project on schedule.

Mark Allan Hoppus (born March 15, 1972) is an American musician, record producer, and television host best known as the bassist and one of two lead vocalists for the rock band Blink-182. Born in Ridgecrest, California, Hoppus spent his childhood moving back and forth between his mother and father's houses, as they divorced when he was in third grade. He became interested in skateboarding and punk rock in junior high, and received a bass guitar from his father at the age of fifteen. After moving to San Diego in 1992, Hoppus' sister introduced him to Tom DeLonge, and together with drummer Scott Raynor, they formed the band Blink-182.
Blink-182 produced several indie recordings and toured exhaustively before signing to major label MCA to co-distribute their sophomore effort, 1997's Dude Ranch, which featured the Hoppus-penned hit "Dammit". After replacing Raynor with Travis Barker, the trio recorded Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band into multiplatinum success, becoming the biggest pop punk act of the era. Two more records followed—the heavier Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) and the more experimental Blink-182 (2003)—before the band split in 2005 following internal tension. Hoppus continued playing with Barker in +44 in the late 2000s. Blink-182 reunited in 2009 and have since released two new recordings and have toured worldwide.
Aside from his musical career, Hoppus has had multiple successes behind the recording console, producing records for groups such as Idiot Pilot, New Found Glory, The Matches, and Motion City Soundtrack. He has previously co-owned two companies, Atticus and Macbeth Footwear, and has begun a clothing line named Hi My Name is Mark. Hoppus hosted a weekly podcast in 2005 and 2006 and hosted his own television talk show, Hoppus on Music, from 2010 to 2012 on Fuse. In 2014 Mark and his friend Chris Holmes started a band called Nothing and Nobody.

[[Learning]]

Learning is the act of acquiring new, or modifying and reinforcing, existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences and may involve synthesizing different types of information. The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals and some machines. Progress over time tends to follow learning curves. Learning is not compulsory; it is contextual.  It does not happen all at once, but builds upon and is shaped by what we already know. To that end, learning may be viewed as a process, rather than a collection of factual and procedural knowledge. Learning produces changes in the organism and the changes produced are relatively permanent.[tpl]cite book | title=Psychology, 2nd edition | publisher=Worth Publishers | author=Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner | year=2009, 2011 | pages=264 | isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2[/tpl]
Human learning may occur as part of education, personal development, schooling, or training. It may be goal-oriented and may be aided by motivation. The study of how learning occurs is part of neuropsychology, educational psychology, learning theory, and pedagogy.
Learning may occur as a result of habituation or classical conditioning, seen in many animal species, or as a result of more complex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals.Jungle Gyms: The Evolution of Animal PlayWhat behavior can we expect of octopuses? Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped is called learned helplessness.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1380861/learned-helplessness There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally, in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation, indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development.Sandman, Wadhwa, Hetrick, Porto & Peeke. (1997). Human fetal heart rate dishabituation between thirty and thirty-two weeks gestation. Child Development, 68, 1031–1040.
Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through play. 85 percent of brain development occurs during the first five years of a child's life.[tpl]cite web|last=Aga Khan|first=Aga Khan|title=Investing in Early Childhood Development|url=http://www.agakhanschools.org/akelc/downloads/akelc_brochure.pdf|publisher=Aga Khan Early Learning Centre|accessdate=March 21, 2013[/tpl]

Charles Lee (1758 – June 24, 1815) was an American lawyer from Virginia. He served as United States Attorney General from 1795 until 1801.
Charles was born to Henry (1729–1787) and Lucy (Grymes) Lee on his father's plantation of Leesylvania in Prince William County, Virginia. He was the third of eleven children and a younger brother of General Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee, making him the uncle of Robert E. Lee. Another brother was Congressman Richard Bland Lee. A third cousin was Zachary Taylor. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1775, and then read law with Jared Ingersoll in Philadelphia before returning to Virginia.
Charles married Anne Lee (1 December 1770 – 9 September 1804), his second cousin and the daughter of Richard Henry Lee (his first cousin once removed) in 1789. Before her death in 1804 the couple had six children; Anne Lucinda Lee (1790–1845), Infant Son (Arthur) Lee (1791-1791), Richard Henry Lee (Feb 1793-Mar 1793), Charles Henry Lee (b. Oct 1794), William Arthur Lee (Sept 1796-1817), Alfred Lee (1799–1865). He married a second time in 1809, to Margaret Scott (1783–1843), and had three more children in this union; Robert Eden Lee (1810–1843), Elizabeth Gordon Lee (1813-1813), Alexander Lee (1815-1815).
President Washington appointed Lee the Attorney General after William Bradford died in office. After Senate approval he took office on December 10, 1795 and served through the rest of the administration. He was continued in office by John Adams and served through the entire Adams administration until February 19, 1801.
During his term in office Lee lived in Alexandria, which was then part of the capital district. He was an early advocate for the return of the southern part of the District of Columbia to Virginia which finally happened in 1847. After his time as Attorney General, he became the port officer for the District of the Potomac and among the most prominent trial lawyers in Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia.
Lee represented William Marbury and other appointees of John Adams in Marbury v. Madison, the landmark case against the Jefferson administration for unfulfilled political appointments. Simultaneously, he defended Hugh Stuart in Stuart v. Laird.
He declined Thomas Jefferson's offer to appoint him a justice of the Supreme Court.
Lee died in 1815 in Fauquier County, Virginia, aged  56 or 57, and is buried in the Warrenton Cemetery in Warrenton.

[[Chord progression]]

CATEGORIES: Harmony, Chord progressions

A chord progression (or harmonic progression) is a series of musical chords, or chord changes that "aims for a definite goal" of establishing (or contradicting) a tonality founded on a key, root or tonic chordArnold Schoenberg, Structural Functions of Harmony, Faber and Faber, 1983, p.1-2. and that is based upon a succession of root relationships.Benward & Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I, p.178. Seventh Edition. ISBN 978-0-07-294262-0. Chords and chord theory are generally known as harmony.
A chord progression can be thought of as a harmonic simultaneity succession: it offers an ongoing shift of level that is essential to many musical traditions. A change of chord, or "chord change", generally occurs on an accented beat, so that chord progressions may contribute significantly to the rhythm, meter and musical form of a piece, delineating bars, phrases and sections.Stewart MacPherson, Musical Form, Chapter 1, Joseph Williams, London, 1930. This is known as harmonic rhythm.

[[Epistemic community]]
CATEGORIES: Types of communities, Social epistemology

An epistemic community is a transnational network of knowledge-based experts who help decision-makers to define the problems they face, identify various policy solutions and assess the policy outcomes. The definitive conceptual framework of an epistemic community is widely accepted as that of Peter M. Haas. He describes them as  
 "...a network of professionals with recognised expertise and competence in a particular domain and an authoritative claim to policy relevant knowledge within that domain or issue-area" (1992, p.3).Haas, P. (1992) Introduction: epistemic communities and international policy coordination, International Organization 46:1, 1-35

Although the members of an epistemic community may originate from a variety of academic or professional backgrounds, they are linked by a set of unifying characteristics for the promotion of collective amelioration and not collective gain.Sebenius, J. (1992) Challenging conventional explanations of international cooperation: negotiation analysis and the case of epistemic communities, International Organization 46:1, 323-365 This is termed their "normative component". In the big picture, epistemic communities are socio-psychological entities that create and justify knowledge. Such communities can constitute of only two persons and yet gain an important role in building knowledge on any specific subject. Miika Vähämaa has recently suggested that epistemic communities consist of persons being able to understand, discuss and gain self-esteem concerning the matters of being discussed.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vähämaa|journal=Social Epistemology|year=2013[/tpl] 
Some theorists argue that an epistemic community may consist of those who accept one version of a story, or one version of validating a story. Michel Foucault referred more elaborately to mathesis as a rigorous episteme suitable for enabling cohesion of a discourse and thus uniting a community of its followers.  In philosophy of science and systems science the process of forming a self-maintaining epistemic community is sometimes called a mindset.  In politics, a tendency or faction is usually described in very similar terms.
Most researchers carefully distinguish between epistemic forms of community and "real" or "bodily" community which consists of people sharing risk, especially bodily risk.
It is also problematic to draw the line between modern ideas and more ancient ones, for example, Joseph Campbell's concept of myth from cultural anthropology, and Carl Jung's concept of archetype in psychology. Some consider forming an epistemic community a deep human need, and ultimately a mythical or even religious obligation. Among these very notably are E. O. Wilson, as well as Ellen Dissanayake, an American historian of aesthetics who famously argued that almost all of our broadly shared conceptual metaphors centre on one basic idea of safety: that of "home".
From this view, an epistemic community may be seen as a group of people who do not have any specific history together, but search for a common idea of home as if forming an intentional community.  For example, an epistemic community can be found in a network of professionals from a wide variety of disciplines and backgrounds.Reinalda, B. and Verbeek, B. (1998) Autonomous Policy Making by International Organizations,Routledge: London. p. 184
As discussed in Peter M. Haas's definitive text, an epistemic community is made up of a diverse range of academic and professional experts, who are allied on the basis of four unifying characteristics:
Thus, when viewed as an epistemic community, the overall enterprise of the expert members emerges as the product of a combination of shared beliefs and more subtle conformity pressures, rather than a direct drive for concurrence (Michael J. Mazarr). Epistemic communities also have a "normative component" meaning the end goal is always for the betterment of society, rather than self gain of the community itself (Peter M. Haas).
In international relations and political science, an epistemic community can also be referred to as a global network of knowledge-based professionals in scientific and technological areas that often have an impact on policy decisions.

The [tpl]Nihongo|Transformers|トランスフォーマー|Toransufomā[/tpl] is a line of toys produced by the Japanese company Takara (now known as Takara Tomy) and American toy company Hasbro. The Transformers toyline was created from toy molds mostly produced by Japanese company Takara in the toylines Diaclone and Microman. Other toy molds from other companies such as Bandai were used as well. In 1984, Hasbro bought the distribution rights to the molds and rebranded them as the Transformers for distribution in North America. Hasbro would go on to buy the entire toy line from Takara, giving them sole ownership of the Transformers toy-line, branding rights, and copyrights, while in exchange, Takara was given the rights to produce the toys and the rights to distribute them in the Japanese market. The premise behind the Transformers toyline is that an individual toy's parts can be shifted about to change it from a vehicle, a device, or an animal, to a robot action figure and back again. The taglines "More Than Meets The Eye" and "Robots In Disguise" reflect this ability.[tpl]cite news|title= A brief history of the Transformers|work= Malaysia Star|date=|url= http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2004/11/9/features/20041108160036&sec=features|accessdate=2010-10-09[/tpl]
The Transformers toyline is typically divided into two main factions: the heroic Autobots and their opponents, the evil Decepticons (traditionally known in Japan as the Cybertrons and Destrons, respectively, although more recent releases often use the English terms). Transformers toys are sold at a number of price points, and various Transformers series utilize unique play features.
There have also been a number of spin-offs based on the toys including a Marvel comic book series, an animated television series program presented by Claster Television, a television production company that Hasbro organized for this and similar purposes, that began transmissions in 1984 (Transformers series) and a feature-length movie, The Transformers: The Movie. The original series program was followed by a number of spin-offs with varying levels of popularity. A live-action film series, directed by Michael Bay under the sponsorship of Steven Spielberg has had three films with more planned.

[[Proof theory]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical logic, Proof theory, Metalogic

Proof theory is a branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques.  Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system.  As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.  Together with model theory, axiomatic set theory, and recursion theory, proof theory is one of the so-called four pillars of the foundations of mathematics.E.g., Wang (1981), pp. 3–4, and Barwise (1978).
Proof theory is important in philosophical logic, where the primary interest is in the idea of a proof-theoretic semantics, an idea which depends upon technical ideas in structural proof theory to be feasible.

[[New World vulture]]

CATEGORIES: New World vultures, Cathartidae, Incertae sedis

The New World vulture or condor family Cathartidae contains seven species in five genera, all but one of which are monotypic.  It includes five vultures and two condors found in warm and temperate areas of the Americas. The "New World" vultures were widespread in both the Old World and North America during the Neogene.
New World vultures are not closely genetically related to the superficially similar family of Old World vultures; similarities between the two groups are due to convergent evolution. Just how closely related they are is a matter of debate (see Taxonomy and systematics).
Vultures are scavenging birds, feeding mostly from carcasses of dead animals. New World vultures have a good sense of smell, whereas Old World vultures find carcasses exclusively by sight.  A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head, devoid of feathers.

Description logic (DL) is a family of formal knowledge representation languages. It is more expressive than propositional logic but has more efficient decision problems than first-order predicate logic.
DL is used in artificial intelligence for formal reasoning on the concepts of an application domain (known as terminological knowledge). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web. The most notable application outside information science is in biomedical informatics where DL assists in the codification of medical knowledge.

CATEGORIES: Mathematical logic, Logic, Metatheory

Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) is due to David Hilbert's attempt of proving the consistency of mathematical theories by proving a proposition about a theory itself, i.e. specifically about all possible proofs of theorems in the theory; in particular, both a proposition A and its negation not A should not be theorems (Kleene 1952, p. 55). However, metamathematics provides "a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic, among which the consistency problem is only one" (Kleene 1952, p. 59).

[[Retail]]
CATEGORIES: Retailing

Retail is the sale of goods and services from individuals or businesses to the end-user.  Retailers are part of an integrated system called the supply chain. A retailer purchases goods or products in large quantities from manufacturers directly or through a wholesale, and then sells smaller quantities to the consumer for a profit.  Retailing can be done in either fixed locations like stores or markets, door-to-door or by delivery. In the 2000s, an increasing amount of retailing is done using online websites, electronic payment, and then delivered via a courier or via other services.
Retailing includes subordinated services, such as delivery.  The term "retailer" is also applied where a service provider services the needs of a large number of individuals, such as for the public. Shops may be on residential streets, streets with few or no houses or in a shopping mall. Shopping streets may be for pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to protect customers from precipitation. Online retailing, a type of electronic commerce used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions and mail order, are forms of non-shop retailing.
Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products. Sometimes this is done to obtain necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it is done as a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often involves window shopping (just looking, not buying) and browsing and does not always result in a purchase.

It is navigable for most of its length.
The river drains the Himalaya east of the Indo-Nepal border, southern-central portion of the Tibetan plateau above the Ganges basin, south-eastern portion of Tibet, the Patkai-Bum hills, the northern slopes of the Meghalaya hills, the Assam plains and the northern portion of Bangladesh. The basin, especially south of Tibet is characterized by high levels of rainfall. Kangchenjunga (8,586m) is the only peak above 8,000m and the highest point within the Brahmaputra basin.
The Brahmaputra's upper course was long unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpo was only established by exploration in 1884–86. This river is often called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river.
The lower reaches are sacred to Hindus. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent have female names, this river has a rare male name, as it means "son of Brahma" in Sanskrit (putra means "son").

Guangxi ([tpl]zh|c=广西|p=Guǎngxī|w=Kuang-hsi[/tpl]; pronounced [tpl]IPAc-cmn|g|uang|3|x|i|1[/tpl]), officially Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR), is an autonomous region of southern China along its border with Vietnam. Formerly a province, Guangxi became an autonomous region in 1958.
Guangxi's location, in mountainous terrain in the far south of China, has placed it on the frontier of Chinese civilization throughout much of China's history. The current name "Guang" means "expanse" and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in AD 226. It was given provincial level status during the Yuan Dynasty, but even into the 20th century it was considered an open, wild territory.
The abbreviation of the province is "桂" (Pinyin: [tpl]transl|zh|Guì[/tpl]; Zhuang: [tpl]transl|zh|Gvei[/tpl]), which comes from the city of Guilin, the former capital, center of much of Guangxi's culture, politics, and history, and currently a major city in the autonomous region.

[[Cucoloris]]
CATEGORIES: Film production, Stage lighting, Film and video technology

In lighting for film, theatre and still photography, a cuculoris (occasionally also spelled cucoloris, kookaloris, cookaloris or cucalorus) is a device for casting shadows or silhouettes to produce patterned illumination. The word is sometimes shortened to cookie or coo-koo. The cookie is used to create a more natural look by breaking up the light from a man made source. It can be used to simulate movement by passing shadows or light coming through a leafy canopy.
Generally, cookies fall into three groups: hard cookies, made from thin plywood or heavy poster board with random shapes cut out of the body; soft cookies (often called "celo" cookies), made from plastic impregnated screen (the same screen one might find in a storm window), also with random shapes cut or burned out; and brancholorises or dingles, which are simply tree limbs or other available things that can be placed between the light and the subject.
Many "old-school" grips would say that any unnatural pattern used to create a shadow is a cookie.
Cucolorises are sometimes thought of as a subset of the gobo category. A gobo is either a metal or a glass device, used inside a lighting instrument (or in very close proximity to a lighting instrument), used to create patterns, shadows, logos or silhouettes. Cucolorises differ in that they are used farther away from the lighting instrument, and therefore do not need to be as heat resistant. Gobos generally are used when a very crisp, well-defined edge is needed for a silhouette or projected object.
A similar technique of using a cookie is simulated in 3D computer graphics, where using an alpha map as a cookie (sometimes called a light texture) to cast shadows on 3D objects is simulated by applying an alpha texture to an emitting light source in the 3D scene, typically a spot light type or a directional light type, to serve as a virtual cookie that projects shadows onto 3D object(s) by emitting light only through the transparent or translucent parts of the alpha texture, thus simulating the effect of a cucoloris as used in its real-world counterpart. This effect is commonly used in both 3D computer-generated animation and video games.[tpl]cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Components/class-Light.html | title=Unity reference manual: Light[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Lighting/Lights/Textures |title=Blender Doc:2.6 manual - Lighting/Lights/Textures[/tpl]

Initially, with the annexation of the island by the British Empire, the "Cyprus dispute" was identified as the conflict between the people of Cyprus and the British Crown regarding the Cypriots' demand for self determination. The dispute however was finally shifted from a colonial dispute to an ethnic dispute between the Turkish and the Greek islanders.Anthony Eden, “Memoirs, Full Circle, Cassell, London 1960 The international complications of the dispute stretch far beyond the boundaries of the island of Cyprus itself and involve the guarantor powers (Turkey, Greece, and the United Kingdom alike), along with the United States, the United Nations and the European Union.[tpl]cite news|title=FACTBOX: Key issues in Cyprus dispute|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/10/us-cyprus-conflict-factbox-idUSTRE5A94EV20091110|accessdate=10 November 2009 | work=Reuters|date=10 November 2009[/tpl]

As a result of the two communities and the guarantor countries committing themselves to finding a peaceful solution to the dispute, the United Nations maintain a buffer zone (the "Green Line") to avoid any further intercommunal tensions and hostilities. This zone separates the Greek Cypriot-controlled south from the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north.

The Pacific Loon or Pacific Diver (Gavia pacifica), is a medium-sized member of the loon, or diver, family. It may be conspecific with Black-throated Diver/Arctic Loon, which it closely resembles.
It breeds on deep lakes in the tundra region of Alaska and northern Canada as far east as Baffin Island, and in Russia east of the Lena River.
Unlike other loons/divers, this bird may migrate in flocks. It winters at sea, mainly on the Pacific coast, or on large lakes over a much wider range, including China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, USA and Mexico. It has occurred as a vagrant to Greenland, Hong Kong, Great Britain, Spain, and Finland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/11/pacific_loon_spotted_on_finnish_lake_2146177.html?origin=rss |title=Pacific Loon Spotted on Finnish Lake |author= |date=November 16, 2010 |work=YLE.fi |publisher=Yleisradio Oy |accessdate=January 29, 2011[/tpl]

They measure [tpl]convert|58|-|74|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, [tpl]convert|110|-|128|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in wingspan and weigh [tpl]convert|1|-|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pacific_Loon/lifehistory (2011). They have a grey head, black throat, white underparts and chequered black-and-white mantle. Non-breeding plumage is drabber with the chin and foreneck white. Its bill is grey or whitish and dagger-shaped. In all plumages, lack of a white flank patch distinguishes this species from the otherwise very similar Black-throated Diver/Arctic Loon.
This species, like all divers/loons, is a specialist fish-eater, catching its prey underwater. It flies with neck outstretched.
The call is a yodelling high-pitched wailing, as well as harsh growls and barks.

The Red-throated Loon or Red-throated Diver (Gavia stellata) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere. It breeds primarily in Arctic regions, and winters in northern coastal waters. It is the most widely distributed member of the loon or diver family. Ranging from [tpl]convert|55|-|67|cm|in[/tpl] in length, the Red-throated Loon is the smallest and lightest of the world's loons. In winter, it is a nondescript bird, greyish above fading to white below. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive reddish throat patch which is the basis for its common name. Fish form the bulk of its diet, though amphibians, invertebrates and plant material are sometimes eaten as well. A monogamous species, the Red-throated Loon forms long-term pair bonds. Both members of the pair help to build the nest, incubate the eggs (generally two per clutch) and feed the hatched young.
The Red-throated Loon has a large global population and a significant global range, though some populations are declining. Oil spills, habitat degradation, pollution and fishing nets are among the major threats this species faces. Natural predators—including various gull species, and both Red and Arctic Foxes, will take eggs and young. The species is protected by a number of international treaties.

Otto von Kotzebue (Russian: О́тто Евста́фьевич Коцебу́, Otto Evstàf'evič Kotsebù) (December 30, 1787 – February 15, 1846) was a  Baltic German navigator in Russian service.
The second son of writer and diplomat August von Kotzebue, he was born in Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia), then part of the Russian Empire.  After attending the St Petersburg school of cadets, he accompanied Adam Johann von Krusenstern on his voyage of 1803–1806. On promotion to lieutenant, Kotzebue was placed in command of an expedition, fitted out at the expense of the imperial chancellor, Count Nikolay Rumyantsev, in the brig Rurik. In this vessel, with only twenty-seven men, including the naturalists Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz and Adelbert von Chamisso, and the artist Louis Choris, Kotzebue set out on July 30, 1815 to find a passage across the Arctic Ocean and explore the less-known parts of Oceania.
Proceeding via Cape Horn, he discovered the Romanzov Islands, Rurik Islands and Krusenstern Islands (today Tikehau), then made for Kamchatka, and in the middle of July proceeded northward, coasting along the north-west coast of North America, and discovering and naming Kotzebue Sound or Gulf and Cape Krusenstern in the remote Chukchi Sea.
Returning by the coast of Asia, he again sailed to the south, sojourned for three weeks at the Sandwich Islands, and on January 1, 1817 discovered New Year Island.  After further cruising in the Pacific Ocean, he again proceeded north, but severe illness compelled him to return to Europe, and he reached the Neva on August 3, 1818, bringing home a large collection of previously unknown plants and much new ethnological information.
In 1823 Kotzebue, now a captain, was entrusted with the command of an expedition in two ships of war, the main object of which was to take reinforcements to Kamchatka. There was, however, a staff of scientists on board the Russian sailing sloop "Enterprise," who collected much valuable information and material in geography, ethnography and natural history. The expedition, proceeding by Cape Horn, visited the Radak and Society Islands, and reached Petropavlovsk in July 1824.  Many positions along the coast were rectified, the Navigator islands visited, and several discoveries made. The expedition returned by the Marianas, Philippines, New Caledonia and the Hawaiian Islands, reaching Kronstadt on July 10, 1826.

He died in Reval (now Tallinn) in 1846 and was buried in the Kose churchyard approx. 30 km from Tallinn where his imposing monument now stands. In the last years of his life he lived at the Triigi Manor (Kau) near Kose. Kotzebue Sound and the city of Kotzebue, Alaska are named after him.

In Mexico, a maquiladora ([tpl]IPA-es|makilaˈðoɾa[/tpl]) or maquila ([tpl]IPA-es|maˈkila|IPA[/tpl])Also referred to as a "twin plant", or "in-bond" industry.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] is a manufacturing operation in a free trade zone (FTZ), where factories import material and equipment on a duty-free and tariff-free basis for assembly, processing, or manufacturing and then export the assembled, processed and/or manufactured products, sometimes back to the raw materials' country of origin.
Currently about 1.3 million Mexicans are employed in one or more of approximately 3,000 maquiladoras."The Rebirth of Solidarity on the Border" article by David Bacon in Democratic Left, the publication of the Democratic Socialists of America, Fall 2011

Sidereus Nuncius (usually Sidereal Messenger, also Starry Messenger or Sidereal Message) is a short astronomical treatise (or pamphlet) published in New Latin by Galileo Galilei in March 1610. It was the first published scientific work based on observations made through a telescope, and it contains the results of Galileo's early observations of the imperfect and mountainous Moon, the hundreds of stars that were unable to be seen in either the Milky Way or certain constellations with the naked eye, and the Medicean Stars that appeared to be circling Jupiter.Raphael, Renée. Sidereus nuncius; or, A Sidereal Message, by Galileo Galilei. Isis, Vol. 101, No. 3 (September 2010), pp. 644-645. Published by: The University of Chicago Press on behalf of The History of Science Society.
The Latin word nuncius was typically used during this time period to denote messenger; however, albeit less frequently, it was also interpreted as message. While the title Sidereus Nuncius is usually translated into English as Sidereal Messenger, many of Galileo's early drafts of the book and later related writings indicate that the intended purpose of the book was "simply to report the news about recent developments in astronomy, not to pass himself off solemnly as an ambassador from heaven."Rosen, Edward. The Title of Galileo's Sidereus nuncius. Isis, Vol. 41, No. 3/4 (Dec., 1950), pp. 287-289. Published by: The University of Chicago Press on behalf of The History of Science Society. Therefore, the correct English translation of the title is Sidereal Message (or often, Starry Message).
A copy of the original edition is a valuable rare book and can reach £180,000, or USD $276,264, as of 2010.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The Guardian | title= 'Tome raider' jailed again for stealing antique books |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jun/22/tome-raider-stealing-books | date=2010-06-22 | last=Topping | first= Alexandra[/tpl]

[[Viburnum]]

CATEGORIES: Viburnum

Viburnum  is a genus of about 150–175 species of shrubs or (in a few species) small trees in the moschatel family, Adoxaceae. Its current classification is based on molecular phylogeny. It was previously included in the family Caprifoliaceae.
The member species are native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America, Russia and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains. In Ukraine it is seen as a national symbol.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The generic name originated in Latin, where it referred to V. lantana.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zIOvJSJs-IkC |first=Umberto |last=Quattrocchi |title=CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms, Synonyms, and Etymology |volume=IV R-Z |year=2000 |publisher=Taylor & Francis US |isbn=978-0-8493-2678-3 |page=2793[/tpl]
The leaves are opposite, simple, and entire, toothed or lobed; cool temperate species are deciduous, while most of the warm temperate species are evergreen. Some species are densely hairy on the shoots and leaves, with star-shaped hairs.
The flowers are produced in corymbs 5–15 cm across, each flower white to cream or pink, small, 3–5 mm across, with five petals, strongly fragrant in some species. The gynoecium has 3 connate carpels with the nectary on top of the gynoecium. Some species also have a fringe of large, showy sterile flowers round the perimeter of the corymb to act as a pollinator target.
The fruit is a spherical, oval or somewhat flattened drupe, red to purple, blue, or black, and containing a single seed; some are edible for humans, but many others are mildly poisonous. The leaves are eaten by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species.

Viburnum lentago (Nannyberry, Sheepberry, or Sweet Viburnum) is a species of Viburnum native to the northeastern and midwestern United States, and in southern Canada from New Brunswick west to southeastern Saskatchewan. Isolated populations are found in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Colorado, and the Appalachian Mountains as far south as Kentucky and Virginia.Germplasm Resources Information Network: Viburnum lentago[tpl]cite web | url = http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/vibulent.pdf | title = Viburnum lentago Range Map | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | publisher = United States Geological Survey[/tpl]
It is a large shrub or small tree growing upwards to 30 ft (9 m) tall with a trunk up to ~10 inches (25 cm) diameter and a short trunk, round-topped head, pendulous, flexible branches. The bark is reddish- to grayish-brown, and broken into small scales. The twigs are pale green and covered with rusty down at first, later becoming dark reddish brown, sometimes glaucous, smooth, tough, flexible, and produce an offensive odor when crushed or bruised. The winter buds are light red, covered with pale scurfy down, protected by a pair of opposing scales. Flower-bearing buds are ~3/4 in (2 cm) long, obovate, long pointed; other terminal buds are acute, ~1/3 to 1/2 in (10–15 mm) long, while lateral buds are much smaller. The bud scales enlarge with the growing shoot and often become leaf-like.
Like all viburnums, the leaves are arranged in opposite pairs on the twigs; they are oval, ~2 - 4 in (5–10 cm) long and ~3/4 in - 2 in (2–5 cm) broad, wedge-shaped, rounded or subcordate at base, with an acuminate apex and a finely serrated margin, and a winged petiole. They open from the bud involute, bronze green and shining, hairy and downy; when full grown are bright green and shining above, pale green and marked with tiny black dots beneath. In autumn they turn a deep red, or red and orange.
The flowers are small, 5–6 mm diameter, with five whitish petals, arranged in large round terminal cymes 5–12 cm diameter; flowering is in late spring. The calyx is tubular, equally five-toothed, persistent; the corolla is equally five-lobed, imbricate in the bud, cream-white, one-quarter of an inch across; lobes acute, and slightly erose. There are five stamens, inserted on the base of the corolla, alternate with its lobes, exserted; filaments slender; anthers bright yellow, oblong, introrse, versatile, two-celled; cells opening longitudinally. The pistil has a one-celled inferior ovary, the style thick, short, light green, and the stigma broad; there is one ovule in each cell. The fruit is a small round blue-black drupe, 8–16 mm long on a reddish stem; it is thick skinned, sweet and rather juicy, and edible. The stone is oblong oval, flattened.
The roots are fibrous, wood is ill-smelling. It grows in wet soil along the borders of the forest, often found in fence corners and along roadsides. The wood is dark orange brown, heavy, hard, close-grained, with a density of 0.7303.
The Sheepberry is one of the largest of the Viburnums.  It is admired for its compact habit, its lustrous foliage which insects rarely disfigure, its beautiful and abundant flowers, its handsome edible fruit and its brilliant autumnal color.  It readily adapts itself to cultivation, and is one of the best of the small trees of eastern America for the decoration of parks and gardens in all regions of extreme winter cold.  It is easily raised from seeds which, like those of the other American species, do not germinate until the second year after they are planted.[tpl]cite book | last =Keeler | first =Harriet L. | title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them | publisher =Charles Scriber's Sons | year =1900 | location =New York | pages =181–182 [/tpl]

[[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup]]
CATEGORIES: FIS Alpine Ski World Cup

The FIS Alpine Ski World Cup is the top international circuit of alpine skiing competitions, launched in 1966 by a group of ski racing friends and experts which included French journalist Serge Lang and the alpine ski team directors from France (Honore Bonnet) and the USA (Bob Beattie).[tpl]cite book | last = Lang | first = Serge | authorlink = Serge Lang (skiing) | title = 21 Years of World Cup Ski Racing | publisher = Johnson Books / James Wotton | year = 1986 | isbn = 1-55566-009-6 [/tpl] Also available under ISBN 0-246-13116-0. It was soon backed by International Ski Federation (FIS) president Marc Hodler during the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1966 at Portillo, Chile, and became an official FIS event in the spring of 1967 after the FIS Congress at Beirut, Lebanon. The first World Cup ski race was held in Berchtesgaden, West Germany, on January 5, 1967.  Jean-Claude Killy of France and Nancy Greene of Canada were the overall winners for the first two seasons.
Competitors attempt to achieve the best time in four disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, Super G, and downhill. The fifth event, the combined, employs the downhill and slalom.  The World Cup originally included only slalom, giant slalom, and downhill races. Combined events (calculated using results from selected downhill and slalom races) were included starting with the 1974–75 season, while the Super G was added for the 1982–83 season.  The current scoring system was implemented in the 1991–92 season.  For every race points are awarded to the top 30 finishers: 100 points to the winner, 80 for second, 60 for third, winding down to 1 point for 30th place.  The racer with the most points at the end of the season in mid-March wins the Cup, with the trophy consisting of a 9 kilogram crystal globe.FIS NewsFlash, Edition 72, April 26th, 2006 Sub-prizes are also awarded in each individual race discipline, with a smaller 3.5 kg crystal globe.  (See the section on scoring system below for more information.) 
The World Cup is held annually, and is considered the premier competition for alpine ski racing after the quadrennial Winter Olympics. Many consider the World Cup to be a more valuable title than the Olympics or the biennial World Championships, since it requires a competitor to ski at an extremely high level in several disciplines throughout the season, and not just in one race.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fisalpine.com/fis-info/world-cup-history.html |title=World Cup History: The FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup |accessdate= 14 December 2008|last=Lang |first=Patrick[/tpl]
Races are hosted primarily at ski resorts in the Alps in Europe, with regular stops in Scandinavia, North America, and east Asia, but a few races have also been held in the Southern Hemisphere. World Cup competitions have been hosted in 25 different countries around the world: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.[tpl]cite web|title=FIS: Complete Calendar of Alpine Ski World Cup Races|url=http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/disciplines/alpineskiing/fiscalendar.html?place_search=&seasoncode_search=all&sector_search=AL&category_search=WC&rec_start=0&limit=100|accessdate=12 February 2012[/tpl] (Note that all World Cup races hosted at ski resorts in Bosnia and Slovakia were held when those countries were still part of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia respectively.)

François Pierre Guillaume Guizot ([tpl]IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa pjɛʁ ɡijom ɡizo|lang[/tpl]; 1787–1874) was a French historian, orator, and statesman. Guizot was a dominant figure in French politics prior to the Revolution of 1848, a conservative liberal who opposed the attempt by King Charles X to usurp legislative power, and worked to sustain a constitutional monarchy following the July Revolution of 1830.  He then served the "citizen king" Louis Philippe, as Minister of Education, 1832–37, ambassador to London, Foreign Minister 1840–1847, and finally Prime Minister of France from 19 September 1847 to 23 February 1848. Guizot's influence was critical in expanding public education, which under his ministry saw the creation of primary schools in every French commune. But as a leader of the "Doctrinaires", committed to supporting the policies of Louis Phillipe and limitations on further expansion of the political franchise, he earned the hatred of more left-leaning liberals and republicans through his unswerving support for restricting suffrage to propertied men, advising those who wanted the vote to "enrich yourselves" (enrichissez-vous) through hard work and thrift. As Prime Minister, it was Guizot's ban on the political meetings (called the Paris Banquets, which celebrated the birthday of George Washington) of an increasingly vigorous opposition in January 1848 that catalyzed the revolution that toppled Louis Philippe in February and saw the establishment of the French Second Republic.
Guizot is famous as the originator of the quote "Not to be a republican at 20 is proof of want of heart; to be one at 30 is proof of want of head".See page 327 in The Yale book of quotations, Fred R. Shapiro & Joseph Epstein, Yale University Press, 2006 This quote has been reworked many times, especially in reference to socialism and liberalism. It has been borrowed by or attributed to many notable figures who lived after Guizot, including Winston Churchill, George Bernard Shaw, Benjamin Disraeli, Georges Clemenceau,List of misquotations, Wikiquote Otto von Bismarck, Aristide Briand, Theodore Roosevelt,Misquotations Woodrow Wilson, David Lloyd George, Wendell Willkie,Misquotations William J.

HMS ''Endeavour, also known as 'HM Bark Endeavour''', was a British Royal Navy research vessel that Lieutenant James Cook commanded on his first voyage of discovery, to Australia and New Zealand, from 1769 to 1771.
She was launched in 1764 as the collier Earl of Pembroke, and the Navy purchased her in 1768 for a scientific mission to the Pacific Ocean and to explore the seas for the surmised Terra Australis Incognita or "unknown southern land". The Navy renamed and commissioned her as His Majesty's Bark the Endeavour. She departed Plymouth in August 1768, rounded Cape Horn, and reached Tahiti in time to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun. She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of Huahine, Borabora, and Raiatea to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain. In September 1769, she anchored off New Zealand, the first European vessel to reach the islands since Abel Tasman's Heemskerck 127 years earlier. 
In April 1770, Endeavour became the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia, when Cook went ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay. Endeavour then sailed north along the Australian coast. She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the Great Barrier Reef, and Cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her. He then beached her on the mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. On 10 October 1770, she limped into port in Batavia (now named Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies for more substantial repairs, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had discovered. She resumed her westward journey on 26 December, rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.
Largely forgotten after her epic voyage, Endeavour spent the next three years shipping Navy stores to the Falkland Islands. Renamed and sold into private hands in 1775, she briefly returned to naval service as a troop transport during the American Revolutionary War and was scuttled in a blockade of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, in 1778. Her wreck has not been precisely located, but relics, including six of her cannon and an anchor, are displayed at maritime museums worldwide. A replica of Endeavour was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney Harbour.  The space shuttle Endeavour is named for the original ship. Endeavour also features on the New Zealand fifty cent coin.

The Nauvoo Expositor was a newspaper in Nauvoo, Illinois that published only one issue, which was dated June 7, 1844. Its publication set off a chain of events that led to the death of Latter Day Saint movement Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr..
The Expositor was founded by several seceders from Nauvoo church and was critical of Smith and LDS leadership.   They espoused a belief in Mormonism, but criticized Smith for doctrines like  plural marriage, and exaltation."Polygamy, Persecution And Power", Salt Lake Tribune, June 16, 1996, paragraph 16, 17
In response Smith and the Nauvoo City Council declared the paper a public nuisance, and ordered the press destroyed.History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints volume VI (1912), pp. 430-432. The council met on June 8 and June 10 to discuss the matter. The town marshal carried out the order that evening.History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints volume VI (1912), p. 432: "The Council passed an ordinance declaring the Nauvoo Expositor a nuisance, and also issued an order to me to abate the said nuisance. I immediately ordered the Marshall to destroy it without delay." – Joseph Smith
The destruction of the press led to charges of Riot against Smith and others.   After Smith surrendered on the charge of riot, he was additionally charged with treason.  Smith was killed by a mob while awaiting a trial.

"[tpl]Lang |la|Dies Irae[/tpl]" (Day of Wrath) is a thirteenth-century Latin hymn attributed to either Thomas of Celano of the Franciscan Order (1200 – c. 1265)[tpl]CathEncy | wstitle = Dies Iræ[/tpl] or to Latino Malabranca Orsini (+1294), lector at the  Dominican studium at Santa Sabina, the forerunner of the  Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome.[tpl]Citation | contribution-url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12354c.htm | accessdate = 15 Feb 2013 | contribution = Scritti vari di Filologia | place = Rome | title = The Catholic Encyclopædia | publisher = New Advent | year = 1901 | page = 488[/tpl]
It is a medieval Latin poem characterized by its accentual stress and its rhymed lines. The metre is trochaic. The poem describes the day of judgment, the last trumpet summoning souls before the throne of God, where the saved will be delivered and the unsaved cast into eternal flames.
The hymn is best known from its use as a sequence in the Roman Catholic Requiem mass (Mass for the Dead or Funeral Mass). An English version is found in various Anglican Communion service books.

The Lenne is a river in the Sauerland area in North Rhine-Westphalia, western Germany, a left tributary of the Ruhr.
Having its source on top of the Kahler Asten near Winterberg in an intermittent spring at an elevation of 2,687 feet, the Lenne ends after a course of 128 km flowing into the Ruhr river near the city of Hagen. With an average discharge of 25 m³/s near its mouth, it is the main tributary of the Ruhr. Both rivers are quite close to each other at their sources, but spread to different routes until they meet again in Hagen. Towns along the Lenne are Schmallenberg, Lennestadt, Finnentrop, Werdohl, Altena, Iserlohn, and Hagen. The lower part of the Lenne valley is characterized by great altitude differences to the surrounding plateaus and by a concentration of small-scale industry along the river.

They are found as zooplankton throughout the ocean, and their skeletal remains make up a large part of the cover of the ocean floor as siliceous ooze. Due to their rapid turn-over of species, they represent an important diagnostic fossil found from the Cambrian onwards. Some common radiolarian fossils include Actinomma, Heliosphaera and Hexadoridium.

[[Bushwhacked MP3]]
CATEGORIES: Presidency of George W. Bush, Culture jamming

The "Bushwhacked" MP3 files are satirical speeches created from parts of United States president George W. Bush's orations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] The recordings were created by UK comedian Chris Morris, who has used similar techniques in the past, most notably in his edited version of the eulogy at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. 
The first "Bushwhacked" MP3 was created in late 2001 after the September 11, 2001 attacks. It begins: "Good afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against our staunch friend, Great Britain, Australia, Germany and France, Canada, more than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and across Asia. These carefully targeted actions are designed to attack the Islamic faith.  This military action is a part of our campaign against diplomacy, intelligence, freedom, clock, tyre, the freezing of food, and a lot of dance."
The fictional speech mixes political satire ("the White House, a place where American Presidents have become outlaws and murderers themselves") with absurdity ("to all the men and women in our military .. I gave a 4th grade girl with more than forty cunts") and highly explicit, vulgar language. The file is about two minutes long.
The MP3 was originally posted at the Warp Records website, which also posted "Bushwhacked 2" (the sequel), and released a 12" single of the recording with remixes. 
A sequel was released in February 2003 after George W. Bush's State of the Union address. It is less vulgar but otherwise similar in style and content, and exclusively uses elements of the State of the Union speech. The speech begins: "Mr. Speaker, members of Congress and fellow citizens. Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to threaten the world. The American flag stands for corporate scandals, recession, stock market declines, blackmail, burning with hot irons, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, terror, mass murder, and rape. Our first goal is to show utter contempt for the environment." Bush's words are frequently interrupted by strong applause.
Again, elements of absurdity ("We must offer every child in America three nuclear missiles") are combined with the accusation of US complicity with terrorists ("One by one the terrorists are learning: We are building a culture to encourage international terrorism"). Unlike the first "speech", this one also addresses the 2003 invasion of Iraq ("And tonight I have a message for the people of Iraq: Go home and die"). It ends on a dark note: "In all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process. It is to achieve a result: the end of the civilized world."
There is also a slightly different movie version of the speech, based on the State of the Union video footage. Cuts to the faces of the audience are used to conceal the cropping of the different elements of the speech. This appears as an Easter egg on a compilation DVD of material from The Day Today.
Similar edits of speeches by George H. W. Bush, entitled "Bush Speech (corrected), Parts 1 and 2", were released by the Evolution Control Committee on the Gunderphonics tape in 1994.
A version of the 2003 sequel, with instrumental background accompaniment added, was included on the 2005 Stan Ridgway/Drywall album Barbeque Babylon.

[[Assize of Clarendon]]

The Assize of Clarendon was an 1166 act of Henry II of England that began the transformation of English law from such systems for deciding the prevailing party in a case, especially felonies, as trial by ordeal or trial by battle or trial by compurgation to an evidentiary model, in which evidence, inspection, and inquiry was made by laymen, knights or ordinary freemen, under oath.  This act greatly fostered the methods that would eventually be known in common law countries as trial by jury. 
The Assize of Clarendon did not lead to this change immediately, however; recourse to trial by combat was not officially rescinded until 1819.
The Assize takes its name from Clarendon Palace, Wiltshire, the royal hunting lodge at which it was promulgated.

The Flowers of Romance were an early punk band, formed in mid-1976 by Jo Faull and Sarah Hall. The band never played live or released any recordings, and, like London SS and Masters of the Backside, are more famed for the number of band members that later became well known, including: Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, Keith Levene (an early member of The Clash and later of Public Image Ltd) and Palmolive and Viv Albertine, who went on to play in The Slits. Despite never playing live, they were interviewed by a fanzine named SCUM, in which Sid Vicious proclaimed "I'll just be the yob that I am now".Punk77.co.uk
The highly controversial song "Belsen Was a Gas", about one of the concentration camps in Nazi Germany, Bergen-Belsen, which was liberated by British troops in 1945, originates from this band, and was later performed live by the Sex Pistols, Public Image Ltd, as well as Sid Vicious' solo act. Also, Viv Albertine wrote "So Tough" for this band, with the song eventually appearing on The Slits' debut album Cut."In Search of Sid". BBC Radio 4 broadcast 2009-01-20
The band's name subsequently became the title of an early Sex Pistols song, "The Flowers of Romance", as well as a 1981 Public Image Ltd album and song, The Flowers of Romance.

[[Duty]]

CATEGORIES: Tort law, Contract law, Ethical principles, Deontological ethics

Duty (from "due" meaning "that which is owing"; [tpl]lang-fro|deu, did[/tpl], past participle of devoir; [tpl]lang-la|debere, debitum[/tpl], whence "debt") is a term that conveys a sense of moral commitment or obligation to someone or something. The moral commitment should result in action;[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] it is not a matter of passive feeling or mere recognition. When someone recognizes a duty, that person theoretically commits themself to its fulfillment without considering their own self-interest. This is not to suggest that living a life of duty entirely precludes a life of leisure; however, its fulfillment generally involves some sacrifice of immediate self-interest. Typically, "the demands of justice, honor, and reputation are deeply bound up" with duty.http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~leirbakk/rpg/mythus/mythus_samurai.html
Cicero, an early philosopher who discusses duty in his work “On Duty", suggests that duties can come from four different sources:Cicero, Marcus T. De Officiis. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1913. Print.
Various derivative uses of the word have sprung from the root idea of obligation, a concept involved in the notion of duty; thus it is used in the services performed by a minister of a church, by a soldier, or by any employee or servant.
Many schools of thought have debated the idea of duty. While many assert mankind's duty on their own terms, some philosophers have absolutely rejected a sense of duty.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Duty has to be accepted and understood on the basis of one's foundation of sense and knowledge. Therefore, duty and its manifestations vary with values from culture to culture. On one hand duty may be seen as terms of reference, job description, or behavior - and it is all of that ... but duty is not only about doing things right, it is about doing the right thing.

[[Primality test]]

CATEGORIES: Primality tests, Asymmetric-key algorithms

A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime. Amongst other fields of mathematics, it is used for cryptography. Unlike integer factorization, primality tests do not generally give prime factors, only stating whether the input number is prime or not. Factorization is thought to be a computationally difficult problem, whereas primality testing is comparatively easy (its running time is polynomial in the size of the input). Some primality tests prove that a number is prime, while others like Miller–Rabin prove that a number is composite. Therefore the latter might be called compositeness tests instead of primality tests.

CATEGORIES: Populated places on the Rhine, Neuwied (district)

Neuwied ([tpl]IPA-de|nɔʏˈviːt[/tpl]) is a town in the north of the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, capital of the District of Neuwied. Neuwied lies on the right bank of the Rhine, 12 km northwest of Koblenz, on the railway from Frankfurt am Main to Cologne. The town has 13 suburban administrative districts: Heimbach-Weis, Gladbach, Engers, Oberbieber, Niederbieber, Torney, Segendorf, Altwied, Block, Irlich, Feldkirchen, Heddesdorf, and Rodenbach. The largest is Heimbach-Weis, with approximately 8000 inhabitants.
Founded by Count Frederick of Wied in 1653, Neuwied was located near the village of Langendorf, destroyed during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648).  It grew rapidly due to its religious toleration. Among those who sought refuge here was a colony of Moravian Brethren.
Near Neuwied, one of the largest Roman castra on the Rhine has been excavated by archeologists.
In April 1797 the French, under General Louis Lazare Hoche, defeated the Austrians near Neuwied, this being their first decisive success in the French Revolutionary Wars.
Neuwied is the native town of paternal ancestors of John D. Rockefeller, traced to the 16th century and possible French Huguenot refugees. His father's line emigrated to the North American colonies, arriving in New York in 1710, the year of a massive immigration of nearly 2800 Palatine Germans, whose transportation of refugees from London was paid by Queen Anne's government of England.  Neuwied was also the birth town of William of Wied, who briefly held the title of King of Albania in 1914.

CATEGORIES: 1978 albums, Albums with cover art by Hipgnosis, A&M Records albums, Concept albums, Styx albums

Pieces of Eight is the eighth studio album and second concept album by Styx, released on September 1, 1978.
Like the band's previous album, The Grand Illusion, it managed to achieve triple-platinum certification, thanks to the hit singles "Sing for the Day", "Blue Collar Man" and "Renegade".
The band members produced and recorded the album (like their previous three efforts) at Paragon Studios in Chicago with recording engineer Barry Mraz and mixing engineer Rob Kingsland. "I'm O.K" was recorded at Paragon and St. James Cathedral. This would be the last album to be produced at Paragon Studios.
The theme of the album, as Dennis DeYoung explained on In the Studio with Redbeard which devoted an entire episode to Pieces of Eight, was about "not giving up your dreams just for the pursuit of money and material possessions".
Eight of the album's ten tracks have vocals, and it features two instrumentals, the DeYoung synthesizer showcase "The Message" and Tommy Shaw's closing "Aku-Aku" (although for the latter, there was one lyric spoken, the title of the song). "The Message" serves as a prelude for "Lords of the Ring", and "Aku-Aku" is a postlude for "Pieces of Eight".
The album's cover was done by Hipgnosis. DeYoung stated in the same 1991 interview with Redbeard on the "In the Studio" episode that he initially hated the cover but grew to like it as he got older.

According to keyboardist Dennis DeYoung, the album's theme was the struggle to overcome self-deluding superficiality in order to affirm one's genuine value. This theme was reflected in the lyrics of the album's title track:
The title of The Grand Illusion had been considered dating back to the 1975 album Equinox.

[[Crystal Ball (Styx album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1976 albums, A&M Records albums, Styx albums

Crystal Ball is the sixth album by Styx, released in 1976.
This album marked the recording debut of new guitarist Tommy Shaw. The track "Mademoiselle" was Tommy Shaw's vocal debut and the album's Top 40 hit.
The album's title track would become a concert staple for the band as it was performed on every subsequent Styx tour with which Shaw was involved.
"Shooz" was co-written by Shaw and James Young. The bluesy rocker had Shaw on slide guitar while Young contributed a Hendrix-like solo to the middle of the track after Shaw's slide solo.
"This Old Man" is a song that DeYoung wrote for his father and the impact his dad had on his life.
Debussy's classical piece "Clair De Lune" served as the intro to the album's closing track Ballerina. The version of "Clair De Lune" on Crystal Ball just had DeYoung on piano and changed the key from D flat to C as the next track ("Ballerina") started in C minor.
Although the album stalled at #66 upon its 1976 release, it would go platinum in 1978 after the success of the next album The Grand Illusion.

[[Equinox (Styx album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1975 albums, A&M Records albums, Styx albums

Equinox is the fifth album by Styx, released in December 1975.
The album was the band's first release for A&M Records (with whom they signed earlier in 1975, after the unexpected success of the single "Lady").
The album also marked the final appearance of original Styx guitarist John Curulewski who left the band VH1's: Styx Behind The Musicabruptly following the release of Equinox.  The band went into a frantic search to find a replacement for their upcoming tour to support Equinox.  Soon after, they found Tommy Shaw.
The album's biggest hit was the track "Lorelei", which was Styx's second US Top 30 hit. Another well-known song in the album was "Suite Madame Blue" (the title of which has a play on the word "sweet" to refer to the musical term of "suites", i.e. unrelated instrumental successions) which was written about the upcoming Bicentennial of the US. The track became a staple for all Styx tours with Dennis DeYoung.  It's a rare example of a Styx song that (briefly) requires four voice parts; during the Return to Paradise tour, the "America" bridge would be sung by DeYoung, Shaw, James Young and the usually silent Chuck Panozzo.
Although Equinox stalled at #58, it went Gold in 1977 shortly before the release of The Grand Illusion.

William Patrick "Billy" Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967) is an American musician, producer, lyricist, writer, and poet, best known as the frontman and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins.  Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1987, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. The band's direction has largely been driven by Corgan through his confessional lyrics, grandiose production values, and virtuosic musical interplay, notably with Chamberlin.  In three years, The Smashing Pumpkins had transformed themselves into a major label success. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s, while Chamberlin's drug problems escalated until he had to be fired.  The Pumpkins continued as a three-piece until Chamberlin rejoined the band in 1999, then broke up in 2000.  Corgan started a new band with Chamberlin right away, called Zwan, and after their demise, he released a solo album (TheFutureEmbrace) and a collection of poetry (Blinking with Fists) before setting his sights on reforming the Smashing Pumpkins. He has also assisted Breaking Benjamin in making their album We Are Not Alone.
The new version of that band, consisting of Corgan, Chamberlin, and a revolving tour lineup, released an album in 2007 and followed it with extensive touring over the next year and a half.  Chamberlin left the Smashing Pumpkins in March 2009, while Corgan has continued to record and tour with a new lineup.

James Addison Reavis (May 10, 1843 – November 27, 1914), later using the name James Addison Peralta-Reavis, the so-called Baron of Arizona,[tpl]#tag:ref|While Reavis was commonly referred to as "Baron", he never used the term himself.  He instead used the term "Barony" when referring to his claim as a means of emphasizing his wife's supposed noble lineage.[tpl]sfn|Powell|1959|p=164[/tpl]|group="Note"[/tpl] was an American forger and fraudster. He is best known in association with the Peralta land grant, also known as the Barony of Arizona, a pair of fraudulent land claims that if certified would have granted him ownership over [tpl]convert|18600|sqmi|km2|sigfig=3[/tpl] of land in central Arizona Territory and western New Mexico Territory.[tpl]sfn|Wagoner|1970|p=274[/tpl] During the course of the fraud, Reavis collected an estimated USD 5.3 million in cash and promissory notes ($[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|5300000|1895[/tpl][/tpl] in present-day terms[tpl]Inflation-fn|US[/tpl]) through the sale of quitclaims and proposed investment plans.[tpl]sfn|Cookridge|1972|p=150[/tpl]
Under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Gadsden Purchase, the United States was required to recognize and honor existing land grants made by either the Spanish or Mexican governments.[tpl]sfn|Wagoner|1970|p=271[/tpl] Reavis utilized this provision by manufacturing a fictional claim and then generating a collection of documents demonstrating how the claim came into his possession. The documents were then covertly inserted into various records archives. In his initial claim, Reavis claimed title to the grant via a series of conveyances.  When serious challenges to this claim developed, Reavis developed a second claim by marrying the purported last surviving lineal descendant of the original claim recipient.
During the course of his deception, Reavis managed to convince a number of prominent persons to support his efforts. He obtained legal and political support from Roscoe Conkling, Robert G. Ingersoll and James Broadhead. Business leaders such as Charles Crocker and John W. Mackay in turn provided financial support. Initial exposure of the fraud occurred when an unfavorable Surveyor General report caused the claim to be summarily dismissed. In response to this action, Reavis sued the U.S. government for US$11 million in damages ($[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|11000000|1895[/tpl][/tpl] in present-day terms[tpl]Inflation-fn|US[/tpl]). The suit in turn prompted the U.S. government to perform a detailed investigation that fully exposed the forgeries Reavis had planted in a variety of locations.

[[Lotharingia]]

CATEGORIES: Carolingian dynasty, Former countries in Europe, States and territories established in 843, States and territories established in 855

Lotharingia was a medieval successor kingdom of the Carolingian Empire, comprising the Low Countries, the western Rhineland, the lands today on the border between France and Germany, and what is now western Switzerland.The present-day Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany), Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), Saarland (Germany), and Lorraine (France). 
It was born of the tripartite division in 855, of the kingdom of Middle Francia, itself formed of the threefold division of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. Neither Lotharingia nor Middle Francia had any natural coherence, but each was conceived as a territorial division of a larger realm. In 870 Lotharingia, after a brief interregnum, was divided by the Treaty of Meerssen between its neighbours, East Francia and West Francia. After brief wars in 876 and 879 West Francia ceded its half of Lotharingia to East Francia by the Treaty of Ribemont (880). The Lotharingian aristocracy, in attempting to assert its right to elect a sovereign, joined the other East Frankish lands in deposing their king, Charles the Fat, in 887. Under a series of dukes that began under the child king Louis IV in 903, the Lotharingians frequently swapped allegiance between the East and West Frankish kings. In 939 the East Frankish king Otto I brought the reigning duke Gilbert to heel and incorporated Lotharingia into his realm as one of the "younger" stem duchies, whose dukes had a vote in royal elections. While the other stem duchies were tribal or national identities, Lotharingia's identity was solely political.
In 959 the Lotharingian duke Bruno the Great divided the duchy between Lotharingia superior (Upper Lorraine) and Lotharingia inferior (Lower Lorraine), giving each to the rule of a margrave. Except for one brief period (1033–44, under Gothelo I), the division was never reversed and the margraves had soon raised their separate fiefs into dukedoms. In the twelfth century the ducal authority in Lower Lorraine became fragmented, causing the formation of the Duchy of Limburg and the Duchy of Brabant, whose rulers retained the title Duke of Lothier (derived from "Lotharingia"). With the disappearance of a "lower" Lorraine, the duchy of Upper Lorraine became the primary referent for "Lorraine" within the Holy Roman Empire. After centuries of French invasions and occupations, Lorraine was finally ceded to France at the close of the War of the Polish Succession (1737). In 1766 the duchy was inherited by the French crown and became the province of Lorraine. In 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War, the German-speaking part of Lorraine was merged with Alsace to become the province of Alsace-Lorraine in the German Empire. Today the greater part of the French side of the Franco-German border belongs to the Lorraine région.

[[Ventricular fibrillation]]
CATEGORIES: Cardiac dysrhythmia, Medical emergencies, Causes of death

Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib or VF) is a condition in which there is uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of the ventricles in the heart, making them quiver rather than contract properly. Ventricular fibrillation is the most commonly identified arrhythmia in cardiac arrest patients.[tpl]cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/158712-overview|title=Ventricular Fibrillation|publisher=Medscape|author=Michael E Zevitz, MD|accessdate=2011-08-17[/tpl] While there is some activity, the lay person is usually unable to detect it by palpating (feeling) the major pulse points of the carotid and femoral arteries. Such an arrhythmia is only confirmed by electrocardiography. Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency that requires prompt Advanced Life Support interventions. If this arrhythmia continues for more than a few seconds, it will likely degenerate further into asystole ("flatline"). This condition results in cardiogenic shock and cessation of effective blood circulation. As a consequence, sudden cardiac death (SCD) will result in a matter of minutes. If the patient is not revived after a sufficient period (within roughly 5 minutes at room temperature), the patient could sustain irreversible brain damage and possibly become brain dead due to the effects of cerebral hypoxia. On the other hand, death often occurs if sinus rhythm is not restored within 90 seconds of the onset of VF, especially if it has degenerated further into asystole.

The National Forensic League (now also known as the National Speech and Debate Association) is a non-partisan, non-profit educational honor society established to encourage and motivate American high school students to participate in and become proficient in public speaking. The League is the America's oldest and largest high school speech and debate honor society. Since 1925, the League has enrolled over 1.4 million students in fulfillment of its vision of empowering every child in the United States "to become an effective communicator, ethical individual, critical thinker, and leader in a democratic society."
The organization is the central agent for coordination and facilitation of heightened public awareness of the value of speech communication skills, development of educational initiatives for student and teacher training, excellence in interscholastic competition, and the promotion of honor society ideals.
The National Forensic League is one of four national organizations which direct high school competitive speech and debate events in the United States. The other three are the National Catholic Forensic League or NCFL, the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association or NCFCA, and Stoa USA. The National Forensic League Board of Directors meets twice a year for rules revision. It votes on each rule change, which affects the entire high school forensics community. 
The word "forensic" is an adjective meaning "of public debate or argument." The word is derived from the Latin word forensis, meaning "of the forum." The sense of the word "forensic" that means "pertaining to legal trials" dates from the 17th century (Oxford English Dictionary) and led to the use of the word "forensics" in reference to legal evidence.

The United States public's opinion of the invasion of Iraq has changed significantly since the years preceding the incursion. For various reasons, mostly related to the unexpected consequences of the invasion, as well as misinformation provided by US authorities, the US public’s perspective on its government’s choice to initiate an offensive is increasingly negative. Before the invasion in March 2003, polls showed 47-60% of the US public supported an invasion, dependent on U.N. approval.USA Today Poll, March 16, 2003 According to the same poll retaken in April 2007, 58% of the participants stated that the initial attack was a mistake.[ref]

[[Opposition to the Iraq War]]

CATEGORIES: Opposition to the Iraq War, George W. Bush administration controversies, Criticisms of wars, Anti-war protests

Significant opposition to the Iraq War occurred worldwide, both before and during the initial 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States, United Kingdom, and smaller contingents from other nations, and throughout the subsequent occupation. People and groups opposing the war include the governments of many nations which did not take part in the invasion, and significant sections of the populace in those that did.
Rationales for opposition include the belief that the war is illegal according to the United Nations Charter, or would contribute to instability both within Iraq and the wider Middle East. Critics have also questioned the validity of the war's stated objectives, such as a supposed link between the country's Ba'athist government and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, and its possession of weapons of mass destruction "certified" by the Niger uranium forgeries. The latter was claimed by the United States during the run-up to the war, but no such weapons have since been found.
Within the United States, popular opinion on the war has varied significantly with time. Although there was significant opposition to the idea in the months preceding the attack, polls taken during the invasion showed that a majority of US citizens supported their government's action. However, public opinion had shifted by 2004 to a majority believing that the invasion was a mistake, and has remained so since then. There has also been significant criticism of the war from US politicians and national security and military personnel, including generals who served in the war and have since spoken out against its handling.
Worldwide, the war and occupation have been officially condemned by 54 countries and the heads of many major religions. Popular anti-war feeling is strong in these and other countries, including the US' allies in the conflict, and many have experienced huge protests totalling millions of participants.

CATEGORIES: Iraq War, Causes and prelude of the Iraq War

In March 2003 the United States government announced that "diplomacy has failed" and that it would proceed with a "coalition of the willing" to rid Iraq under Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction the US insisted it possessed. The 2003 invasion of Iraq began a few days later.
Prior to this decision, there had been much diplomacy and debate amongst the members of the United Nations Security Council over how to deal with the situation. This article examines the positions of these states as they changed during 2002-2003.
Prior to 2002, the Security Council had passed 16 resolutions on Iraq. In 2002, the Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441.
In 2003, the governments of the US, Britain, and Spain proposed another resolution on Iraq, which they called the "eighteenth resolution" and others called the "second resolution." This proposed resolution was subsequently withdrawn when it became clear that several permanent members of the Council would cast 'no' votes on any new resolution, thereby vetoing it. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2828985.stm Had that occurred, it would have become even more difficult for those wishing to invade Iraq to argue that the Council had authorized the subsequent invasion. Regardless of the threatened or likely vetoes, it seems that the coalition at no time was assured any more than four affirmative votes in the Council—the US, Britain, Spain, and Bulgaria—well short of the requirement for nine affirmative votes.http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/mar/08/iraq.unitednations
On September 16, 2004 Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, speaking on the invasion, said, "I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN Charter. From our point of view, from the charter point of view, it was illegal."Iraq war illegal, says Annan BBC 16 September 2004.

Louis II, sometimes called the YoungerHis ordinal and nickname comes from the fact that he was the second Louis to be emperor after his grandfather Louis the Pious. (825 – 12 August 875), was the King of Italy and Roman Emperor from 844, co-ruling with his father Lothair I until 855, after which he ruled alone. Louis's usual title was imperator augustus ("august emperor"), but he used imperator Romanorum after his conquest of Bari in 871, which led to poor relations with Byzantium. He was called imperator Italiae ("emperor of Italy") in West Francia while the Byzantines called him Basileus Phrangias ("Emperor of the Franks").

In Euclidean geometry, a rhombus (◊), plural rhombi or rhombuses, is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length. Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length. The rhombus is often called a diamond, after the diamonds suit in playing cards, or a lozenge, though the former sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60° angle (see Polyiamond), and the latter sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 45° angle.
Every rhombus is a parallelogram, and a rhombus with right angles is a square.

The presidency of George W. Bush began on January 20, 2001, when he was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States of America. The oldest son of former president George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush was elected president in the 2000 general election, and became the second U.S. president whose father had held the same office (John Quincy Adams was the first).
After two recounts, Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Al Gore filed a lawsuit for a third. The Supreme Court's highly controversial decision in Bush v. Gore resolved the dispute. The Florida Secretary of State certified Bush as the winner of Florida. Florida's 25 electoral votes gave Bush, the Republican candidate, 271 electoral votes, enough to defeat Al Gore. Bush was re-elected in 2004. His second term ended on January 20, 2009.
As president, Bush pushed through a $1.3 trillion tax cut program and the No Child Left Behind Act, and also pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based welfare initiatives.

Imperial Japan's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan [tpl]nihongo|Fukoku Kyōhei|富国強兵||"Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army"[/tpl] led to its emergence as a world power, eventually culminating in its membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific region. At the height of its power in 1942, the Empire of Japan ruled over a land area spanning [tpl]Convert|7400000|km2|mi2|-3[/tpl], making it one of the largest maritime empires in history.Bruce R.

After several large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) and the Pacific War, the Empire of Japan also gained notoriety for its war crimes against the peoples of the countries it conquered. After suffering many defeats and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, however, the Empire of Japan surrendered to the Allies on September 2, 1945. A period of occupation by the Allies followed the surrender, and a new constitution was created with American involvement. The constitution came into force on May 3, 1947, officially dissolving the Empire. American occupation and reconstruction of the country continued well into the 1950s, eventually forming the current nation-state whose full title is the "State of Japan" (Nippon-koku) simply rendered "Japan" in English.
The Emperors during this time, which spanned the entire Meiji and Taishō, and the lesser part of the Shōwa eras, are now known in Japan by their posthumous names, which coincide with those era names: Emperor Meiji (Mutsuhito), Emperor Taishō (Yoshihito), and Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito).

Pontiac, or Obwandiyag, (c. 1720 – April 20, 1769) was an Ottawa leader who became famous for his role in Pontiac's War (1763–1766), an American Indian struggle against British military occupation of the Great Lakes region following the British victory in the French and Indian War. Pontiac's importance in the war that bears his name has been debated. Nineteenth century accounts portrayed him as the mastermind and leader of the revolt, but some subsequent scholars argued that his role had been exaggerated. Historians today generally view him as an important local leader who influenced a wider movement that he did not command.
The war began in May 1763 when Pontiac and 300 followers attempted to take Fort Detroit by surprise. His plan foiled, Pontiac laid siege to the fort, and was eventually joined by more than 900 warriors from a half-dozen tribes. Meanwhile, messengers spread the word of Pontiac's actions, and the war expanded far beyond Detroit. In July 1763, Pontiac defeated a British detachment at the Battle of Bloody Run, but he was unable to capture the fort. In October he lifted the siege and withdrew to the Illinois Country.
Although Pontiac's influence had declined around Detroit because of the unsuccessful siege, he gained stature as he continued to encourage resistance to the British. Seeking to end the war, British officials made Pontiac the focus of their diplomatic efforts. In July 1766, Pontiac made peace with British Superintendent of Indian Affairs Sir William Johnson. The attention that the British paid to Pontiac created resentment among other Native leaders, particularly because Pontiac claimed greater authority than he possessed. Increasingly ostracized, in 1769 he was assassinated by a Peoria Indian.

Empress Gi (奇皇后; Mongolian: Öljei Khutugh Өлзий хутуг (完者忽都), Korean: [tpl]lang|ko|기황후[/tpl]) (1315–1369/70) was one the primary of empresses of Toghun Temür Khan of the Yuan Dynasty and the mother of Ayushiridar from a Korean aristocratic family.
Öljei Khutugh, a Yuan name by which she came to be known, was born to Gi Ja-o (奇子敖) in Haengju (幸州), in the Goryeo Dynasty of Korea. She had an elder brother named Gi Cheol (奇轍). She became a concubine of Toghun Temür and mothered Ayurshiridar. After the primary empress Danashri was overthrown in 1340[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl] because of the rebellion by her brother Tanggisi, Toghun Temür tried to install Öljei Khutugh as the empress. However Bayan, who held real power, opposed it. When Bayan was purged, Öljei Khutugh became the secondary empress in 1340 (the primary one was Bayan Khutugh of the Khunggirad clan). Her son Ayurshiridar was designated Crown Prince in 1353. Using her Korean eunuch Bak Bulhwa (朴不花) as her agent, she began a campaign to force the emperor to pass the imperial throne to her son Ayurshiridar. However her intentions became known to the emperor and he grew apart from her.
Depending on Öljei Khutugh's position in the imperial capital her brother Gi Cheol (Bayan Bukha) came to threaten the position of the king of Goryeo which was a client state of the Mongols. King Gongmin exterminated the Gi family in a coup in 1356. Upon this incident in her homeland Öljei Khutugh chose Tash Temür as the new king of Goryeo and dispatched troops to Korea. The Mongol troops were defeated by Goryeo army in crossing the Yalu River.
Within the Mongol capital an internal strife was fought between supporters and opponents of the Crown Prince. An opposition leader Bolud Temür finally occupied the capital in 1364. Ayurshiridar fled to Köke Temür who supported him but Öljei Khutugh was imprisoned by Bolud Temür. Bolud Temür was overthrown by Köke Temür the next year. Once again, she tried to install her son as the Khan, with the support of Köke Temür, but in vain. After Bayan Khutugh died, Öljei Khutugh was elevated to the primary empress.
The collapse of the Mongol rule of China in 1368 forced her to flee to Yingchang (應昌). In 1370 Toghun Temür Khan died and Ayurshiridar ascended to the throne there. She became Empress Dowager, but soon after that went missing.

Eddie P. Stobart (born 1929 Millom celebrates VE Day with action.... eladvertiser.co.uk. 11 August 2005 to parents John and Adelaide) is a British businessman who started an agriculture business in the late 1940s.  This became Eddie Stobart Ltd in 1970, expanded to a haulage company during the 1970s with the help of his late son Edward Stobart who gradually took over the running of the company during the 1970s and 1980s, and then became a multi-modal logistics public company the Stobart Group in 2007 under the control of another son William Stobart.
He married Nora Boyd on 26 December 1951 and they live in Cumbria. They had four children: Anne (1952–), John (1953–), Edward (1954–2011) and William (1961–).  Eddie bought his first lorry (a Guy Invincible four-wheeler truck) second-hand from the local garage in 1960, and had it re-painted in his choice of colours: post-office red and Brunswick green. He took over the collection of basic slag (a waste product of steelworks used as fertiliser) when local company Harrison Ivinson went out of business, and purchased two Ford Thames Trader trucks which were also painted in his favourite colours with his logo on the doors.  A contract with ICI for storage of basic slag in 1963 enabled expansion of the business, and it became a limited company: Eddie Stobart Ltd in November 1970 with a share value of ten thousand pounds.Noel Davidson (1998). Only the Best will do: The Eddie Stobart Story, pages 76, 88 and 124. Ambassador, ISBN 184030043. Eddie continued to run the company until 1976, when son Edward took over running the transport side, but father Eddie continued to be involved, and retained his own separate warehouse until 1989, when he handed over full control to his sons Edward and William, retaining the title of non-executive chairman of Eddie Stobart Ltd until December 1992.
Eddie's son William retains the family involvement in the business in his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Eddie Stobart Logistics.

[[UTF-32]]
CATEGORIES: Character encoding, Unicode Transformation Formats

UTF-32 stands for Unicode Transformation Format 32 bits (or UCS-4) is a protocol to encode Unicode characters that uses exactly 32 bits per Unicode code point. All other Unicode transformation formats use variable-length encodings. The UTF-32 form of a character is a direct representation of its codepoint.SIL, Mapping codepoints to Unicode encoding forms, §1: UTF-32
The main advantage of UTF-32, versus variable length encodings, is that the Unicode code points are directly indexable. Examining the n'th code point is a constant time operation.http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-utf8/ In contrast, a variable length code requires sequential access to find the n'th code point. This makes UTF-32 a simple replacement in code that uses integers to index characters out of strings, as was commonly done for ASCII.
The main disadvantage of UTF-32 is that it is space inefficient, using four bytes per character. Non-BMP characters are so rare in most texts, they may as well be considered non-existent for sizing issues, making UTF-32 twice the size of UTF-16 and up to four times the size of UTF-8.
Though a fixed number of bytes per code point appear convenient, it is not as useful as it appears. In a way, it is more simple-minded and less elegant than its alternatives. It makes truncation easier but not significantly so compared to UTF-8 and UTF-16. It does not make it faster to find a particular offset in the string, as an "offset" can be measured in the fixed-size code units of any encoding. It does not make calculating the displayed width of a string easier except in limited cases, since even with a “fixed width” font there may be more than one code point per character position (combining marks) or more than one character position per code point (for example CJK ideographs). Combining marks mean editors cannot treat one code point as being the same as one unit for editing. Editors that limit themselves to left-to-right languages and precomposed characters can take advantage of fixed-sized code units, but such editors are unlikely to support non-BMP characters and thus can work equally well with 16-bit UTF-16 encoding.

According to the 2011 census, its population was 1,695 (953 males, 742 females, including 275 indigenous Australians). The town is sometimes referred to as the "opal capital of the world" because of the quantity of precious opals that are mined there. Coober Pedy is renowned for its below-ground residences, called "dugouts", which are built due to the scorching daytime heat. The name "Coober Pedy" comes from the local Aboriginal term kupa-piti, which means "white man's hole".Place Names of South Australia
Opal was found in Coober Pedy on 1 February 1915; since then the town has been supplying most of the world's gem-quality opal.  Coober Pedy today relies as much on tourism as the opal mining industry to provide the community with employment and sustainability.  Coober Pedy has over 70 opal fields and is the largest opal mining area in the world.

Alexander Henry 'The Elder' (August 1739 – 4 April 1824) was one of the leading pioneers of the British-Canadian fur trade following the British Conquest of New France; a partner in the North West Company, and a founding member and vice-chairman of the Beaver Club. In 1763-64, he lived and hunted with Wawatam of the Ojibwa, who had adopted him as a brother. "Blessed with as many lives as a cat," his time with the Ojibwa and subsequent explorations are retold in his Travels and Adventures in Canada and the Indian Territories between the years 1760 and 1776 (published New York, 1809), which he dedicated to his friend Sir Joseph Banks. The book is considered an adventure classic and one of the best descriptions of Native Indian life at this time. An "easy and dignified" raconteur, in 1776 Henry was invited to give an account of his journeys at the Royal Society in London and at Versailles to Queen Marie Antoinette. In the 1780s, Henry introduced John Jacob Astor into the Canadian fur trade and subsequently Astor would stay as Henry's guest during his annual visits to Montreal.

[[T Tauri type stars]]

CATEGORIES: Star types, T Tauri stars, Star formation

T Tauri stars (TTS) are a class of variable stars named after their prototype – T Tauri. They are found near molecular clouds and identified by their optical variability and strong chromospheric lines.  T Tauri stars are pre-main sequence stars in the process of contracting to the main sequence along the Hayashi track, a luminosity-temperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than 3 solar masses in the pre-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution.  It ends when a star of 0.5 solar masses develops a radiative zone, or when a larger star commences nuclear fusion on the main sequence.

[[Starspot]]

Starspots are the equivalent of sunspots located on other stars. Spots the size of sunspots are very hard to detect on other stars because they are too small to cause detectable fluctuations in brightness. Observed starspots are in general much larger than those on the Sun: up to about 30% of the stellar surface may be covered, corresponding to starspots 100 times larger than those on the Sun.

[[Stellar wind]]

CATEGORIES: Stellar astronomy

A stellar wind is a flow of neutral or charged gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star.  It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated, although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric.
Different types of stars have different types of stellar winds.
G-type stars like the Earth's Sun have a wind driven by their hot, magnetized corona. The Sun's wind is called the solar wind.  These winds consist mostly of high-energy electrons and protons (about 1 keV) that are able to escape the star's gravity because of the high temperature of the corona.
Stellar winds from main-sequence stars do not strongly influence the evolution of lower mass stars such as the Sun. However, for more massive stars such as O stars, the mass loss can result in a star shedding as much as 50% of its mass whilst on the main sequence: this clearly has a significant impact on the later stages of evolution. The influence can even be seen for intermediate mass stars, which will become white dwarfs at the ends of their lives rather than exploding as supernovae only because they lost enough mass in their winds.

[[Alice Springs]]

CATEGORIES: 1872 establishments in Australia, Towns in the Northern Territory, Alice Springs, Springs of Australia

Alice Springs is the third largest town in the Northern Territory, Australia. Popularly known as "the Alice" or simply "Alice", Alice Springs is situated in the geographic centre of Australia near the southern border of the Northern Territory.Geoscience Australia Centre of Australia, States and Territories updated July 2006 "Officially, there is no centre of Australia. This is because there are many complex but equally valid methods that can determine possible centres of a large, irregularly shaped area especially one that is curved by the earth's surface." See the Geoscience Australia page for further details. The site is known as Mparntwe to its original inhabitants, the Arrernte, who have lived in the Central Australian desert in and around what is now Alice Springs for thousands of years. "Alice" in the English language was named by surveyor W. W. Mills after Lady Alice Todd (née Alice Gillam Bell), wife of Sir Charles Todd. Alice Springs has a population of 28,605, which makes up 12.2 percent of the territory's population. Alice Springs is nearly equidistant from Adelaide, South Australia and Darwin.
The town straddles the usually dry Todd River on the northern side of the MacDonnell Ranges. The surrounding region is known as Central Australia, or the Red Centre, an arid environment consisting of several different deserts. In Alice Springs temperatures can vary dramatically with an average maximum temperature in summer of [tpl]convert|35.6|°C|°F[/tpl], and an average minimum temperature in winter of [tpl]convert|5.1|°C|°F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |year=2011 |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_015590.shtml|title=Climate statistics for Alice Springs Airport|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl]

[[Winter Wren]]

CATEGORIES: Birds of Canada, Birds of the United States, North American migratory birds, Fauna of the Arctic, Troglodytes (wren), Birds of Ukraine, Animals described in 1819

The Winter Wren (Troglodytes hiemalis) is a very small North American bird and a member of the mainly New World wren family Troglodytidae. It was once lumped with Troglodytes pacificus of western North America and Troglodytes troglodytes of Eurasia under the name Winter Wren.
It breeds in coniferous forests from British Columbia to the Atlantic Ocean. It migrates through and winters across southeastern Canada, the eastern half the United States and (rarely) north-eastern Mexico. Small numbers may be casual in the western United States and Canada.
The scientific name is taken from the Greek word "troglodytes" (from "trogle" a hole, and "dyein" to creep), meaning "cave-dweller", and refers to its habit of disappearing into cavities or crevices whilst hunting arthropods or to roost.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) also known as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or corticoliberin is a peptide hormone and neurotransmitter involved in the stress response. It belongs to corticotropin-releasing factor family.  In humans, it is encoded by the CRH gene.
Its main function is the stimulation of the pituitary synthesis of ACTH, as part of the HPA Axis.
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a 41-amino acid peptide derived from a 196-amino acid preprohormone. CRH is secreted by the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus in response to stress. Increased CRH production has been observed to be associated with Alzheimer's disease and major depression,[tpl]cite journal | author = Raadsheer FC, van Heerikhuize JJ, Lucassen PJ, Hoogendijk WJ, Tilders FJ, Swaab DF | title = Corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA levels in the paraventricular nucleus of patients with Alzheimer's disease and depression | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 152 | issue = 9 | pages = 1372–6 |date=September 1995 | pmid = 7653697 | doi = | url = [/tpl] and autosomal recessive hypothalamic corticotropin deficiency has multiple and potentially fatal metabolic consequences including hypoglycemia. In addition to being produced in the hypothalamus, CRH is also synthesized in peripheral tissues, such as T lymphocytes, and is highly expressed in the placenta. In the placenta, CRH is a marker that determines the length of gestation and the timing of parturition and delivery. A rapid increase in circulating levels of CRH occurs at the onset of parturition, suggesting that, in addition to its metabolic functions, CRH may act as a trigger for parturition.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CRH corticotropin releasing hormone| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=1392| accessdate = [/tpl]

[[Kerogen]]

CATEGORIES: Soil science, Petroleum, Oil shale geology

Kerogen (Greek κηρός "wax" and -gen, "that which produces")Oxford English Dictionary 3rd Ed. (2003) is a mixture of organic chemical compounds that make up a portion of the organic matter in sedimentary rocks.Oilfield Glossary It is insoluble in normal organic solvents because of the high molecular weight (upwards of 1,000 daltons or 1000 Da; 1Da= 1 atomic mass unit) of its component compounds. The soluble portion is known as bitumen. When heated to the right temperatures in the Earth's crust, (oil window ca. 50–150 °C, gas window ca. 150–200 °C, both depending on how quickly the source rock is heated) some types of kerogen release crude oil or natural gas, collectively known as hydrocarbons (fossil fuels). When such kerogens are present in high concentration in rocks such as shale they form possible source rocks. Shales rich in kerogens that have not been heated to a warmer temperature to release their hydrocarbons may form oil shale deposits.
The name "kerogen" was introduced by the Scottish organic chemist Alexander Crum Brown in 1906. D. R. Steuart in H. M. Cadell et al. Oil-Shales of Lothians iii. 142 (1906)  "We are indebted to Professor Crum Brown, F.R.S., for suggesting the term Kerogen to express the carbonaceous matter in shale that gives rise to crude oil in distillation."

[[Backpack]]

CATEGORIES: Bags, Camping equipment, Domestic implements, Hiking equipment, Luggage

A backpack (also called rucksack, knapsack, packsack, pack) is, in its simplest form, a cloth sack carried on one's back and secured with two straps that go over the shoulders, but there can be exceptions. Lightweight types of backpacks are sometimes worn on only one shoulder strap.
Backpacks are often preferred to handbags for carrying heavy loads or carrying any sort of equipment, because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights for long periods of time in the hands. Large backpacks, used to carry loads over 10 kg (22 lbs), usually offload the largest part (up to about 90%) of their weight onto padded hip belts, leaving the shoulder straps mainly for stabilising the load. This improves the potential to carry heavy loads, as the hips are stronger than the shoulders, and also increases agility and balance, since the load rides nearer the wearer's own center of mass.
In ancient times, the backpack was used as a means to carry the hunter's larger game and other types of prey and as a way of easier transport for other materials. In the cases of larger hunts, the hunters would dismember their prey and distribute the pieces of the animal around, each one packing the meat into many wrappings and then into bags which they placed on to their backs. The bag itself was made up of different animal hide and skin (depending on what sorts of animals were in the area) and sewn together by animal intestines, which were woven together tightly to make a sturdy thread-like material.http://www.fabric-and-handle.com/articles/backpack-history-%E2%80%93-how-and-when-did-they-came-into-being/

The Anhinga ([tpl]IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|h|ɪ|ŋ|g|ə[/tpl]; Anhinga anhinga), sometimes called Snakebird, Darter, American Darter, or Water Turkey, is a water bird of the warmer parts of the Americas. The word anhinga comes from the Brazilian Tupi language and means devil bird or snake bird.
It is a cormorant-like bird with an average body length of [tpl]convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], a wingspan of [tpl]convert|117|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], and a mass of up to [tpl]convert|1.35|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].  It is a dark-plumaged piscivore with a very long neck, and often swims with only the neck above water. When swimming in this style the name Snakebird is apparent, since only the colored neck appears above water the bird looks like a snake ready to strike. They do not have external nares (nostrils) and breathe solely through their epiglottis.
The Anhinga is placed in the darter family, Anhingidae, and is closely related to Indian (Anhinga melanogaster), African (A. rufa), and Australian (A. novaehollandiae) Darters.  Like other darters, the Anhinga hunts by spearing fishes and other small prey using its sharp, slender beak.

[[Lysocline]]

CATEGORIES: Geochemistry, Oceanography

The lysocline is the depth in the ocean below which the rate of dissolution of calcite increases dramatically.
Shallow marine waters are generally supersaturated in calcite, CaCO3, so as marine organisms (which often have shells made of calcite or its polymorph, aragonite) die, they will tend to fall downwards without dissolving.  As depth (i.e. pressure) increases within the water column, the corresponding calcite saturation of seawater decreases and the shells start to dissolve. The reaction involved, though more complex, can be thought as: CaCO3(s) + H2O + CO2 → Ca2+(aq) + 2HCO3-(aq).   At the lysocline, the rate of dissolution increases dramatically.  Below this, there exists a depth known as the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) below which the rate of supply of calcite equals the rate of dissolution, such that no calcite is deposited.  This depth is the equivalent of a marine snow-line, and averages about 4,500 meters below sea level.  Hence, the two are not equivalent. The lysocline and compensation depth occur at greater depths in the Atlantic (5000-6000 m) than in the Pacific (4000 - 5000 m), and at greater depths in equatorial regions than in polar regions.
The depth of the CCD varies as a function of the chemical composition of the seawater and its temperature.  Specifically, it is the deep waters that are undersaturated with calcium carbonate primarily because its solubility increases strongly with increasing pressure and salinity and decreasing temperature.  Furthermore, it is not constant over time, having been globally much shallower in the Cretaceous through to Eocene. If the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide continues to increase, the CCD can be expected to rise, along with the ocean's acidity.

Aragonite is a carbonate mineral, one of the two common, naturally occurring, crystal forms of calcium carbonate, CaCO3 (the other form being the mineral calcite). It is formed by biological and physical processes, including precipitation from marine and freshwater environments.
Aragonite's crystal lattice differs from that of calcite, resulting in a different crystal shape, an orthorhombic system with acicular crystals. Repeated twinning results in pseudo-hexagonal forms.  Aragonite may be columnar or fibrous, occasionally in branching stalactitic forms called flos-ferri ("flowers of iron") from their association with the ores at the Carinthian iron mines.

Corymbia is a genus of about 113 species of tree that were classified as Eucalyptus species until the mid-1990s. It includes the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums. The bloodwoods had been recognised as a distinct group within the large and diverse Eucalyptus genus since 1867. Molecular research in the 1990s, however, showed that they, along with the rest of the Corymbia section, are more closely related to Angophora than to Eucalyptus, and are probably best regarded as a separate genus.  All three genera - Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus - are closely related, often difficult to tell apart, and are still commonly and correctly referred to as "eucalypts". Groups of naturalists and conservationists do not recognise the Corymbia genus and still categorise its species within Eucalyptus.Brooker & Kleinig (2006) Field Guide to Eucalypts. 3rd ed.
Botanists Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson were the first to define the genus Corymbia in 1995, identifying the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums as a group distinct from Eucalyptus.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hill, Ken D.; Johnson, L.A.S.|year=1995|title=Systematic studies in the Eucalypts 7.

Genetic analysis of ETS and ITS sequences of DNA in 2006 by Carlos Parra-O and colleagues of 67 taxa (47 of which were within Corymbia) yielded Corymbia and Angophora as each other's closest relatives, with the genus Eucalyptus as an earlier offshoot.

Jean Henri Georges Laguerre (June 24, 1858 - June 17, 1912) was a French lawyer and politician.
Born in Paris, he was called to the bar in 1879 and distinguished himself by brilliant pleadings in favour of socialist and anarchist leaders, defending Prince Kropotkine at Lyon in 1883, Louise Michel in the same year.  In 1886, with Alexandre Millerand as colleague he defended Ernest Roche and Duc Quercy, the instigators of the Decazeville strike. His strictures on the procureur de la Republique on this occasion being declared libellous he was suspended for six months and in 1890 he again incurred suspension for an attack on the attorney-general, Quesnay de Beaurepaire.
He pleaded in the greatest criminal cases of his time, but from 1893 onwards exclusively in the provinces, his exclusion from the Parisian bar having been secured on the pretext of his connection with La Presse. He entered the Chamber of Deputies for Apt in 1883 as a representative of the extreme revisionist programme, and was one of the leaders of the Boulangist agitation. He had formerly written for Georges Clemenceau's organ La Justice, but when Clemenceau refused to impose any shibboleth on the radical party he became director of La Presse. He rallied to the republican party in May 1891 some months before General Boulanger's suicide. He was not re-elected to the Chamber in 1893.
Laguerre was an excellent lecturer on the revolutionary period of French history, concerning which he had collected many valuable and rare documents. He interested himself in the fate of the "Little Dauphin" (Louis XVII), whose supposed remains, buried at Ste Marguerite, proved to be those of a boy of fourteen.

The Foss Dyke, or Fossdyke, connects the River Trent at Torksey to Lincoln, the county town of Lincolnshire, and may be the oldest canal in England that is still in use. It is usually thought to have been built around 120 AD by the Romans, but there is no consensus among authors. It was refurbished in 1121, during the reign of King Henry I, and responsibility for its maintenance was transferred to the city of Lincoln by King James I. Improvements made in 1671 included a navigable sluice or lock at Torksey, and warehousing and wharves were built at Brayford Pool in the centre of Lincoln.
Connection to the River Witham at Brayford was hampered by the small bore and depth of High Bridge, a medieval structure just below the pool. The channel through it was made deeper in 1795, but John Rennie's plans to demolish it in 1803 were not adopted. The canal was leased to several generations of the Ellison family, who profited from the tolls but failed to maintain it. Although cargos of coal and wool moved to the railway, the carriage of grain continued, and the last commercial operation was in 1972. The Brayford Mere Trust have turned Brayford Pool from a rubbish-filled eyesore into an attractive marina, and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership are opening a footpath and cycleway from Lincoln to Torksey; the section to Saxilby was officially opened on 26 July 2011.

Jean Gilbert Victor Fialin, duc de Persigny (January 11, 1808 – January 12, 1872) was a French statesman of the Second French Empire.
Fialin was born at Saint-Germain-Lespinasse (Loire), the son of a receiver of taxes, and was educated at Limoges.  He entered the cavalry school at Saumur in 1826, becoming maréchal des logis in the 4th Hussars two years later. The role played by his regiment in the July Revolution of 1830 was regarded as insubordination, and Fialin was dismissed from the army. He became a journalist, and in 1833 became a strong Bonapartist, assuming the title of vicomte de Persigny, said to be dormant in his family. 
He was involved in the abortive Bonapartist coups at Strasbourg in 1836 and at Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1840. After the second, he was arrested and condemned to twenty years' imprisonment in a fortress, commuted to mild detention at Versailles. There he wrote a book to prove that the Egyptian pyramids were built to prevent the Nile from silting up. This was published in 1845 under the title, De la destination et de l'utilité permanente des Pyramides.
During the revolution of 1848, he was arrested by the provisional government. After his release, he took a prominent part in securing the election of Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (Napoleon III) to the presidency. With Morny and the marshal Saint Arnaud he plotted the restoration of the empire, and was a devoted adherent of Napoleon III. He succeeded Morny as Minister of the Interior in January 1852, and later in the year became senator. He resigned in 1854, and was ambassador in London the next year, which he occupied with a short interval (1858–1859) until 1860, when he resumed the portfolio of the interior. But the growing influence of his rival Rouher provoked his resignation in 1863, when he received the title of duke.
A more dangerous enemy than Rouher was the empress Eugénie, whose marriage he had opposed and whose presence in the council chamber he deprecated in a memorandum which fell into the empress' hands. He sought in vain to see Napoleon before the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and the breach was further widened when master and servant were in exile. Persigny returned to France in 1871, and died at Nice on 12 January 1872.
A devoted, even fanatical follower of Louis-Napoleon, whose service dated back to the future Emperor's wilderness years of exile and imprisonment, Persigny always stood out among the Emperor's motley political entourage as the most passionate ideologue of Bonapartism. Hence the Emperor's famous wry comment: "The Empress is a Legitimist, Morny is an Orleanist, Prince Napoleon is a Republican, and I myself am a Socialist. There is only one Bonapartist, Persigny - and he is mad!"[tpl]Cite book|last=Jerrold |first=Blanchard |authorlink=William Blanchard Jerrold |title=The Life of Napoleon III |year=1882 |publisher=Longmans, Green |location=London |page=378 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hbUwAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA378|accessdate=18 September 2011 [/tpl]

[[Cold dark matter]]
CATEGORIES: Dark matter

In cosmology and physics, cold dark matter (CDM) is a hypothetical form of matter (a kind of dark matter) whose particles move slowly compared to the speed of light (the cold in CDM) and interact very weakly with electromagnetic radiation (the dark in CDM). It is believed that approximately 80% of matter in the Universe is dark matter, with only a small fraction being the ordinary baryonic matter that composes stars, planets and living organisms. [tpl]As of|2006[/tpl], most cosmologists favor the cold dark matter theory as a description of how the Universe went from a smooth initial state at early times (as shown by the cosmic microwave background radiation) to the lumpy distribution of galaxies and their clusters we see today — the large-scale structure of the Universe. The theory sees the role that dwarf galaxies played as crucial, as they are thought to be natural building blocks that form larger structures, created by small-scale density fluctuations in the early Universe. The theory was originally published in 1984 by American physicists Joel R. Primack, George Blumenthal, and Sandra Moore Faber with British scientist Martin Rees.
In the cold dark matter theory, structure grows hierarchically, with small objects collapsing under their self-gravity first and merging in a continuous hierarchy to form larger and more massive objects. In the hot dark matter paradigm, popular in the early 1980s, structure does not form hierarchically (bottom-up), but rather forms by fragmentation (top-down), with the largest superclusters forming first in flat pancake-like sheets and subsequently fragmenting into smaller pieces like our galaxy the Milky Way. The predictions of the hot dark matter theory disagree with observations of large-scale structures, whereas the cold dark matter paradigm is in general agreement with the observations.

Hysteria, in its colloquial use, describes unmanageable emotional excesses. The fear can be centered on a body part, or most commonly, on an imagined problem with that body part. Disease is a common complaint; see also body dysmorphic disorder and hypochondriasis.
Generally, modern medical professionals have given up the use of "hysteria" as a diagnostic category, replacing it with more precisely defined categories such as somatization disorder. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association officially changed the diagnosis of "hysterical neurosis, conversion type" to "conversion disorder".

René Goblet ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʁəne ɡɔblɛ[/tpl]; 26 November 1828 – 13 September 1905) was a French politician, Prime Minister of France for a period in 1886–1887.
He was born at Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais and was trained in law. Under the Second Empire, he helped found a Liberal journal, Le Progrès de la Somme, and in July 1871 he was sent by the département of the Somme to the National Assembly, where he took his place on the extreme left. Having failed to secure election in 1876, he was returned for Amiens the following year. He held a minor government office in 1879, and in 1882 became minister of the interior in the Freycinet cabinet. He was minister of education, fine arts and religion in Henri Brisson's first cabinet in 1885, and again under Freycinet in 1886, when he greatly increased his reputation by an able defence of the government's education proposals.
Meanwhile his independence and outspokenness had alienated him from many of his party, and throughout his life he was frequently in conffict with his political associates, from Léon Gambetta downwards. On the fall of the Freycinet cabinet in December he formed a cabinet in which be reserved for himself the portfolios of the interior and of religion. The Goblet cabinet was unpopular from the outset, and it was with difficulty that anybody could be found to accept the ministry of foreign affairs, which was finally given to Gustave Flourens.
Then came what is known as the Schnaebele incident, the arrest on the German frontier of a French official named Schnaebele, which caused immense excitement in France. For some days Goblet took no definite decision, but left Flourens, who stood for peace, to fight it out with General Boulanger, the minister of war, who urged the despatch of an ultimatum. Although he finally intervened on the side of Flourens, and peace was preserved, his weakness in the face of Boulangist propaganda became a national danger. Defeated on the budget in May 1887, his government resigned; but he returned to office next year as foreign minister in the radical administration of Charles Floquet. He was defeated at the polls by a Boulangist candidate in 1889, and sat in the senate from 1891 to 1893 when he returned to the popular chamber. In association with Édouard Locroy, Ferdinand Sarrien and Paul Peytral he drew up a republican programme which they put forward in the Petite Republique francaise. At the elections of 1898 he was defeated, and from then on took little part in public affairs. He died in Paris.

[[Gustave Flourens]]

CATEGORIES: 1838 births, 1871 deaths, Politicians from Paris, People of the Paris Commune, Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery

Gustave Flourens (4 August 1838 in Paris – 3 April 1871) was a French Revolutionary leader and writer, son of the physiologist Jean Pierre Flourens (who was Professor at the Collège de France and deputy in 1838-1839). He was also the elder brother of Emile Flourens, who became minister of foreign affairs under the Third Republic.
At 25 years old Flourens undertook in 1863, on behalf of his father, a course of lectures at the Collège de France, on the subject of the history of mankind. His theories as to the manifold origin of the human race gave offence to the clergy, and he was prevented from delivering further lectures. He then went to Brussels, where he published his lectures under the title of Histoire de l’homme (1863). Gustave Flourens then visited Constantinople and Athens and took part in the Cretan insurrection of 1866-1868; he was one of those chosen for a difficult mission to Athens on behalf of the Cretan Revolutionary Assembly.Jules Ballot, Histoire de l'insurrection crétoise. Paris, 1868. He attempted to convince influential people, such as Victor Hugo,Who, incidentally, had failed to enter the Académie Française because Jean Pierre Flourens had been chosen at his place. to support the Cretan insurrection. Gustave Flourens then spent some time in Italy, where an article of his in the Fe polo d'Italia caused his arrest and imprisonment, and finally, having returned to France, nearly lost his life in a duel with Paul de Cassagnac, editor of the Pays.
In Paris he devoted his time to the cause of "red republicanism", and begin writing articles in the La Marseillaise weekly newspaper. At length, having failed in an attempt to organize a revolution at Belleville on 7 February 1870, was compelled to flee from France. Returning to Paris on the downfall of Napoleon, he placed himself at the head of a body of 500 tirailleurs (sharpshooters). Because of his insurrectionary proceedings (he was one of the organizers of the 31 October 1870 riot against the provisional government's moderate policy) he was taken prisoner at Créteil, near Vincennes, by the provisional government, and confined at Mazas on 7 December 1870, but was released by his men on the night of 21–22 January. On 18 March he joined the population's uprising, was elected a member of the revolutionary Commune by the XXe arrondissement, and was named general. Gustave Flourens was one of the most active leaders of the insurrection, and after a sortie against the Versailles troops in the morning of 3 April, he fled into an inn near the bridge that separates Chatou and Rueil. There, after he was captured and disarmed by the Gendarmerie, he was murdered by Captain Jean-Marc Démaret.[ref]See Benoît Doessant's mémoire La gendarmerie et la Commune de Paris, part 2, chapter IV.C Controverse autour de la mort de Flourens [tpl]fr icon[/tpl].

[[Infinitesimal strain theory]]

CATEGORIES: Physical quantities, Elasticity (physics), Materials science, Solid mechanics, Mechanics

In continuum mechanics, the infinitesimal strain theory is a mathematical approach to the  description of the deformation of a solid body in which the displacements of the material particles are assumed to be much smaller (indeed, infinitesimally smaller) than any relevant dimension of the body; so that its geometry and the constitutive properties of the material (such as density and stiffness) at each point of space can be assumed to be unchanged by the deformation.
With this assumption, the equations of continuum mechanics are considerably simplified.  This approach may also be called small deformation theory, small displacement theory, or small displacement-gradient theory.  It is contrasted with the finite strain theory where the opposite assumption is made.
The infinitesimal strain theory is commonly adopted in civil and mechanical engineering for the stress analysis of structures built from relatively stiff elastic materials like concrete and steel, since a common goal in the design of such structures is to minimize their deformation under typical loads.

In taxonomy, the Volvocales, also known as Chlamydomonadales, are an order of flagellate or pseudociliate green algae, specifically of the Chlorophyceae.See the NCBI webpage on Chlamydomonadales. Data extracted from the [tpl]cite web | url=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/ | title=NCBI taxonomy resources | publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information | accessdate=2007-03-19[/tpl] Volvocales can form planar or spherical colonies. These vary from Gonium (4 to 32 cells) up to Volvox (500 cells or more). Each cell has two flagella, and is similar in appearance to Chlamydomonas, with the flagella throughout the colony moving in coordination.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur. In the former, cells divide until they form new colonies, which are then released. In the smaller forms typically all cells are involved, but larger forms have anterior vegetative and posterior reproductive cells. Sexual reproduction varies from isogamy (both genders produce flagellate gametes of equal size) to oogamy (one gender produces a much larger, non-motile gamete).
The classification of the Volvocales varies. Very often they are taken to include the orders Chlamydomonadales and Dunallielales, which contain closely related unicellular flagellates, as suborders.

Pierre-Joseph Cambon (10 June 1756 – 15 February 1820) was a French statesman.
Born in Montpellier, Cambon was the son of a wealthy cotton merchant. In 1785, his father retired, leaving Pierre and his two brothers to run the business, but in 1788 Pierre entered politics, and was sent by his fellow-citizens as deputy suppliant to the Estates-General, where he was mostly a spectator. In January 1790 he returned to Montpellier, was elected a member of the municipality, co-founded the Jacobin Club in that city, and on the flight to Varennes of King Louis XVI in 1791, he drew up a petition to invite the National Constituent Assembly to proclaim a Republic —the first in date of such petitions.
Elected to the Legislative Assembly, Cambon was viewed as independent, honest, and talented in the financial domain. He was the most active member of the committee of finance and was often charged to verify the state of the treasury. His analytical skills were recorded in his remarkable speech of 24 November 1791.
It was Cambon who made the initial suggestion for the state debt to be "rendered republican and uniform" and it was he who proposed to convert all the contracts of the creditors of the state into an inscription in a great book, which should be called the "Great Book of the Public Debt".Adolphe Thiers, George Thomas, Frederic Shoberl. The History of the French Revolution, Vickers, 1845 p. 329 This proposal was implemented in 1792 when the Great Book of the Public Debt was created as a consolidation of all the states debts.[ref]

He held his distance from political clubs and even factions, but nonetheless defended the new institutions of the state. On 9 February 1792, he succeeded in having a law passed cofiscating the possessions of the émigrés, and tried to arrange the deportation of non-juring priests to French Guiana. He was the last president of the Legislative Assembly.
Re-elected to the National Convention, Cambon opposed the pretensions of the Paris Commune and the proposed grant of money to the municipality of Paris by the state. He denounced Jean-Paul Marat's placards as inciting to murder, summoned Georges Danton to give an account of his ministry, supervised the furnishing of military supplies to the French Revolutionary Army, and was a strong opponent of Charles François Dumouriez, in spite of the general's great popularity.
Cambon incurred the hatred of the theist Maximilien Robespierre (see Cult of the Supreme Being) by proposing the suppression of the pay to the clergy, which would have meant the separation of church and state. His authority grew steadily. On 15 December 1792, he persuaded the Convention to adopt a proclamation to all nations in favour of a universal republic.
Although he took part in toppling Robespierre in July 1794, Cambon was targeted and pursued by the Thermidorian Reaction, and had to live in hiding in Montpellier. During the Hundred Days, he was a deputy to the lower chamber, but only took part in debates over the budget. Proscribed by the Bourbon Restoration in 1816, he died at Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, near Brussels.

Born in India, the descendant of a family of Afghan nobles, Shah grew up mainly in England. His early writings centred on magic and witchcraft. In 1960 he established a publishing house, Octagon Press, producing translations of Sufi classics as well as titles of his own. His seminal work was The Sufis, which appeared in 1964 and was well received internationally. In 1965, Shah founded the Institute for Cultural Research, a London-based educational charity devoted to the study of human behaviour and culture. A similar organisation, the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK), exists in the United States, under the directorship of Stanford University psychology professor Robert Ornstein, whom Shah appointed as his deputy in the U.S.
In his writings, Shah presented Sufism as a universal form of wisdom that predated Islam. Emphasizing that Sufism was not static but always adapted itself to the current time, place and people, he framed his teaching in Western psychological terms. Shah made extensive use of traditional teaching stories and parables, texts that contained multiple layers of meaning designed to trigger insight and self-reflection in the reader. He is perhaps best known for his collections of humorous Mulla Nasrudin stories.
Shah was at times criticised by orientalists who questioned his credentials and background. His role in the controversy surrounding a new translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, published by his friend Robert Graves and his older brother Omar Ali-Shah, came in for particular scrutiny. However, he also had many notable defenders, chief among them the novelist Doris Lessing. Shah came to be recognised as a spokesman for Sufism in the West and lectured as a visiting professor at a number of Western universities. His works have played a significant part in presenting Sufism as a secular, individualistic form of spiritual wisdom.

Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is a 1989 book by United States academic Noam Chomsky concerning political power using propaganda to distort and distract from major issues to maintain confusion and complicity, preventing real democracy from becoming effective. The title of this book borrows a phrase from the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr.
Nearly the entire first half of the book is based on Chomsky's five 1988 Massey Lectures on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio from November 1988 and extends his and Edward S. Herman's propaganda model to a variety of new situations.  The remaining appendices address criticisms of the work and provide additional detail.
As a genre of political thought, parallels exist between Niebuhr's "necessary illusions" and the "noble lies" of Leo Strauss, "public relations" of Edward Bernays and "myth making" of Niccolò Machiavelli.  Likewise, Chomsky's analyses in Necessary Illusions represent a refocus on the use of these patterns of power, which he implies to underscore the failure of populations - particularly in a representative democracy - to learn from history in this regard.

Vicia sativa, known as the common vetch, tare or simply "the vetch", is a nitrogen fixing leguminous plant. Although considered a weed when found growing in a cultivated grainfield, this hardy plant is often grown as green manure or livestock fodder. There is no firm evidence that this is the same as the "tare" in some English translations of the Bible (as in the "Parable of the Tares") – ryegrass (Lolium) is another candidate.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

The Red Arrows, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, is the aerobatics display team of the Royal Air Force based at RAF Scampton. The team was formed in late 1964 as an all-RAF team, replacing a number of unofficial teams that had been sponsored by RAF commands.
The Red Arrows badge shows the aircraft in their trademark diamond nine formation, with the motto Éclat, a French word meaning "brilliance" or "excellence".
Initially, they were equipped with seven Folland Gnat trainers inherited from the RAF Yellowjacks display team. This aircraft was chosen because it was less expensive to operate than front-line fighters. In their first season, they flew at 65 shows across Europe. In 1966, the team was increased to nine members, enabling them to develop their Diamond Nine formation. In late 1979, they switched to the BAE Hawk trainer. The Red Arrows have performed over 4,000 displays worldwide in 52 countries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/reds/history/teamhistory.cfm |title=Team History |year=2012 |publisher=Royal Air Force Arrows |accessdate=3 July 2012[/tpl]

[[Singing sand]]

CATEGORIES: Dunes, Physical phenomena, Sand

Singing sand, whistling sand or barking sand is sand that produces sound. The sound emission may be caused by wind passing over dunes or by walking on the sand.
Certain conditions have to come together to create singing sand:
The most common frequency emitted seems to be close to 450 Hz.
There are various theories about the singing sand mechanism. It has been proposed that the sound frequency is controlled by the shear rate. Others have suggested that the frequency of vibration is related to the thickness of the dry surface layer of sand. The sound waves bounce back and forth between the surface of the dune and the surface of the moist layer, creating a resonance that increases the sound's volume.  The noise may be generated by friction between the grains or by the compression of air between them.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hTPOi8urYKwC&pg=PA534 |title=Shifting theories of singing sand |journal=New Scientist |date=31 May 1973[/tpl] 
Other sounds that can be emitted by sand have been described as "roaring" or "booming".
The particular note produced by the dune, between 60 and 105 hertz, is controlled by the rate of collision in the shear band separating the avalanche from the static part of the dune. For spontaneous avalanches, the frequency is controlled by gravity and by the size of the sand grains.

[[Time hierarchy theorem]]
CATEGORIES: Structural complexity theory, Theorems in computational complexity theory, Articles containing proofs

In computational complexity theory, the time hierarchy theorems are important statements about time-bounded computation on Turing machines. Informally, these theorems say that given more time, a Turing machine can solve more problems. For example, there are problems that can be solved with n2 time but not n time.
The time hierarchy theorem for deterministic multi-tape Turing machines was first proven by Richard Stearns and Juris Hartmanis in 1965. It was improved a year later when F. C. Hennie and Richard Stearns improved the efficiency of the Universal Turing machine. Consequent to the theorem, for every deterministic time-bounded complexity class, there is a strictly larger time-bounded complexity class, and so the time-bounded hierarchy of complexity classes does not completely collapse. More precisely, the time hierarchy theorem for deterministic Turing machines states that for all time-constructible functions f(n),
The time hierarchy theorem for nondeterministic Turing machines was originally proven by Stephen Cook in 1972. It was improved to its current form via a complex proof by Joel Seiferas, Michael Fischer, and Albert Meyer in 1978. Finally in 1983, Stanislav Žák achieved the same result with the simple proof taught today. The time hierarchy theorem for nondeterministic Turing machines states that if g(n) is a time-constructible function, and f(n+1) = o(g(n)), then
The analogous theorems for space are the space hierarchy theorems. A similar theorem is not known for time-bounded probabilistic complexity classes, unless the class also has advice.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1109/FOCS.2004.33|title=45th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|year=2004|author=Fortnow, L.|pages=316|last2=Santhanam|first2=R.|chapter=Hierarchy Theorems for Probabilistic Polynomial Time|isbn=0-7695-2228-9[/tpl]

"The Man from Snowy River" is a poem by Australian bush poet Banjo Paterson.  It was first published in The Bulletin, an Australian news magazine, on 26 April 1890, and was published by Angus & Robertson in October 1895, with other poems by Paterson, in The Man From Snowy River, and Other Verses.[tpl]cite web|last=Semmler|first=Clement|title=Paterson, Andrew Barton (Banjo) (1864–1941)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/paterson-andrew-barton-banjo-7972|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=3 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Man from Snowy River, 1895|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-053.htm|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=3 April 2014[/tpl] 
The poem tells the story of a horseback pursuit to recapture the colt of a prizewinning racehorse that escaped from its paddock and is living with the brumbies (wild horses) of the mountain ranges.  Eventually the brumbies descend a seemingly impassably steep slope, at which point the assembled riders give up the pursuit, except the young hero, who spurs his 'pony' (horse) down the "terrible descent" to catch the mob. 
Two characters mentioned in the early part of the poem are featured in previous Paterson poems; "Clancy of the Overflow" and Harrison from "Old Pardon, Son of Reprieve".

Edward Moore "Ted" Kennedy (February 22, 1932 – August 25, 2009) was the senior United States Senator from Massachusetts and a member of the Democratic Party. He was the second most senior member of the Senate when he died and was the fourth-longest-serving senator in United States history, having served there for almost 47 years. As the most prominent living member of the Kennedy family for many years, he was also the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Kennedy; the youngest brother of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, both victims of assassination; and the father of Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy.
Kennedy entered the Senate in a November 1962 special election to fill the seat once held by his brother John. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was reelected seven more times before his death. The Chappaquiddick incident on July 18, 1969, resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident; the incident and its aftermath significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming President of the United States. His one attempt, in the 1980 presidential election, resulted in a Democratic primary campaign loss to incumbent President Jimmy Carter.
Kennedy was known for his charisma and oratorical skills. His 1968 eulogy for his brother Robert and his 1980 rallying cry for modern American liberalism were among his best-known speeches. He became recognized as "The Lion of the Senate" through his long tenure and influence. More than 300 bills that Kennedy and his staff authored were enacted into law. Unabashedly liberal, Kennedy championed an interventionist government emphasizing economic and social justice, but was also known for working with Republicans to find compromises between senators with disparate views. Kennedy played a major role in passing many laws, including laws addressing immigration, cancer research, health insurance, apartheid, disability discrimination, AIDS care, civil rights, mental health benefits, children's health insurance, education and volunteering. During the 2000s, he led several unsuccessful immigration reform efforts. Over the course of his Senate career and continuing into the Obama administration, Kennedy continued his efforts to enact universal health care, which he called the "cause of my life."
In 2008, Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, which limited his appearances in the Senate. He died the following August at his Hyannis Port, Massachusetts home. By the later years of his life, he had come to be viewed as a major figure and spokesman for American progressivism.

Box Car Racer is the debut and only studio album by American rock band Box Car Racer. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was released May 21, 2002 through MCA Records. The band was essentially a side-project of Blink-182 members Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker, with David Kennedy completing the band’s studio lineup; a bassist and friend of Kennedy, Anthony Celestino, toured with the band throughout late 2002. The record was the only studio effort the trio produced together, and was recorded over the course of six weeks during the winter of 2001.
The record is primarily based on DeLonge's post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The sessions were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who had previously underwent back surgery. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus by all accounts felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion on the project, which evolved into tensions between the two. The record is a concept album detailing the end of the world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion.
The album peaked at number twelve on the Billboard 200, and the two singles "I Feel So" and "There Is" charted on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks. Despite receiving positive reviews on release, this is the last and only album from Box Car Racer after Delonge stated that the band "served its purpose and is now defunct."  The album has been certified  gold in Canada.

Senator Bass explained his motivation for reintroducing the bill years later: “He Mitchell was the father of the modern Air Force.... This should be done.”[/tpl][/ref]
Mitchell served in France during World War I and, by the conflict's end, commanded all American air combat units in that country. After the war, he was appointed deputy director of the Air Service and began advocating increased investment in air power, believing that this would prove vital in future wars. He argued particularly for the ability of bombers to sink battleships and organized a series of bombing runs against stationary ships designed to test the idea.
He antagonized many people in the Army with his arguments and criticism and, in 1925, was returned from appointment as a brigadier general to his permanent rank of Colonel. Later that year, he was court-martialed for insubordination after accusing Army and Navy leaders of an "almost treasonable administration of the national defense"This comment is quoted as "incompetency, criminal negligence, and almost treasonable administration by the War and Navy departments" from an interview given by Gen Mitchell in San Antonio, Texas and published in the New York Times according to "The Courtmartial of Billy Mitchell (1925)" in Footnotes to American History by Harold S. Sharp, The Scarecrow Press, Inc., Metuchen, N.J., 1977, pp. 430–433. for investing in battleships instead of aircraft carriers. He resigned from the service shortly afterward.
Mitchell received many honors following his death, including a commission by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a Major General. He is also the only individual after whom a type of American military aircraft, the North American B-25 Mitchell, is named.

[[Draize test]]

CATEGORIES: Animal testing, Animal rights, Toxicology tests

The Draize Test is an acute toxicity test devised in 1944 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicologists John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines. Initially used for testing cosmetics, the procedure involves applying 0.5mL or 0.5g of a test substance to the eye or skin of a restrained, conscious animal, and then leaving it for set amount of time before rinsing it out and recording its effects.Carbone, Larry. What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy. Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 63, used as a source for "conscious and restrained." The animals are observed for up to 14 days for signs of erythema and edema in the skin test, and redness, swelling, discharge, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or blindness in the tested eye. The test subject is commonly an albino rabbit, though other species are used too, including dogs.Carbone 2004, p. 24, with an image, fig 2.1, of two restrained rabbits and one dog undergoing Draize testing, citing The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. The animals are euthanized after testing if the test renders irreversible damage to the eye or skin.  Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a "wash out" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.Animals in Product Testing, National Anti-Vivisection Society, retrieved 29 June 2009.
The tests are controversial. They are viewed as cruel as well as unscientific by critics because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that "to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement for ... the Draize test" "Validation of In Vitro Methods: Regulatory Issues", Animal Welfare Information Center Newsletter, Summer 1994, Vol. 5, no. 2 Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used.Alternatives to Animal Testing Web Site, retrieved 29 June 2009. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects in vitro are not currently used in a Draize test,Eye irritation caused by chemicals, 3R Research Foundation, retrieved 29 June 2009. thereby reducing the number and severity of tests carried out.

[[Goat Tying]]
CATEGORIES: Rodeo events

Goat-tying is a rodeo event in which the participant rides to a goat tethered by a 10' rope to a stake, dismounts, catches, throws, and ties any three of its legs together. The goat must stay tied for six seconds after the contestant has backed away from the animal. If the goat becomes untied before six seconds have passed, the rider receives no score.
A participant may be disqualified for undue roughness while handling the goat, touching the goat after the tie, or after signaling completion of the tie a contestant’s horse coming in contact with the goat or tether while the contestant still has control of the horse.
The event is not seen in professional rodeo, but is a common event seen at youth, High school rodeo and intercollegiate rodeo levels.  In most cases it is considered a women's event.

It was the first school for the advanced education of the deaf and hard of hearing in the world and remains the only higher education institution in which all programs and services are specifically designed to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing students. Hearing students are admitted to the graduate school and a small number are also admitted as undergraduates each year. The university was named after Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, a notable figure in the advancement of deaf education.
Gallaudet University is officially bilingual, with American Sign Language (commonly abbreviated ASL) and English used for instruction and by the college community. Although there are no specific ASL proficiency requirements for undergraduate admission, many graduate programs do require varying degrees of knowledge of the language as a prerequisite.Communication & Culture Issues – Gallaudet University
