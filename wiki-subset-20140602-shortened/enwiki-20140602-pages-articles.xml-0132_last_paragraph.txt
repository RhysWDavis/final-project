The Malacañang Palace (officially Malacañan Palace, colloquially "Malacañang" or "the Palace"; [tpl]lang-tl|Palasyo ng Malakanyang[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-tl|malakɐˈɲaŋ|[/tpl]), is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of the Philippines. 
The original structure was built in 1750 by Don Luís Rocha as a summer house along the Pasig River. It was purchased by the state in 1825 as the summer residence for the Spanish Governor-General. After the June 3, 1863 earthquake destroyed the Palacio del Governador (Governor's Palace) in the walled city of Manila, it became the Governor-General's official residence. After sovereignty over the Islands was ceded to the United States of America in 1898, it became the residence of the American Governors, with Gen. Wesley Merritt being the first."Residents of Malacañan Palace and their respective periods of residence". Presidential Museum & Library (Philippines). Retrieved on 2013-06-06.
Since 1863, the Palace has been occupied by eighteen Spanish Governors General, fourteen American Military and Civil Governors, and later the Presidents of the Philippines.  The Palace had been enlarged and refurbished several times since 1750; the grounds were expanded to include neighboring estates, and many buildings were demolished and constructed during the Spanish and American periods. Most recently, the Palace complex was again drastically remodeled and extensively rebuilt during the rule of Ferdinand Marcos. Among the presidents of the present Fifth Republic, only Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has actually lived in the main Palace, with all others residing in nearby properties that form part of the larger Palace complex."Malacañan Palace". Presidential Library and Museum. Retrieved on 2013-06-15. 
The Palace have been seized several times as the result of protests starting with the People Power Revolution, the 1989 coup attempt (when the Palace was buzzed by T-28 Trojans); the 2001 Manila riots; and the EDSA III or May 1 riots.

The term Mackenzie River Husky describes several overlapping local populations of arctic and subarctic sleddog type dogs, none of which constitutes a breed. Most prominent and current of these are the sleddogs of Donna Dowling and others in the interior of Alaska. These dogs are described as standing [tpl]convert|26|to|29|in|cm[/tpl] in height and weighing [tpl]convert|63|to|104|lb|kg[/tpl]. Usually long-coated, they are rangy, deep-chested and long-legged, built for heavy freighting in single file through deep snow. Their colors are the usual northern-dog range of black and white, shades of grey and sable, tan, blond, and red.[tpl]cite web|last=MacQuarrie|first=Gordon|title=The Gordon MacQuarrie Sporting Treasury|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8fz13_yIvLQC&pg=PA98&dq=Mackenzie+River+Husky&hl=en&sa=X&ei=N_H7ULaNCYTq8gSn3YC4BA&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Mackenzie%20River%20Husky&f=false|work=Kenai, Dog of Alaska|publisher=Willow Creek Press|accessdate=20 January 2013|pages=98-99[/tpl]
Historically, the term has been variously applied to different dog populations in the Arctic and subarctic regions of Alaska and Canada. Dogs from Old Crow, Fort McPherson, Arctic Red River, Porcupine River, Hay River and Mackenzie River regions, although distinguished by locals, were collectively termed “Mackenzie River” dogs by outsiders; crosses of these local freighting huskies with large European breeds such as St. Bernards, Newfoundlands, or Staghounds were sometimes called “Mackenzie River Hounds,” giving rise to great confusion surrounding the name. Some reference sources describe the Mackenzie River Husky as a dog, used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, consisting of a mix of Inuit dog (Canadian Eskimo dog), large European breeds, and wolf ancestry [tpl]Fact|date=February 2007[/tpl].
Currently Donna Dowling acts as a coordinator for Alaskan residents interested in breeding and preservation of the native arctic freighting dog. She describes the gene pool as capable of considerable variation, but states that the temperament is always guaranteed to be independent but “completely trustworthy with children, intelligent and eager to work.”

The Immortal Game is a chess game played by Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky on 21 June 1851 in London, during a break of the first international tournament. The bold sacrifices made by Anderssen to secure victory have made it one of the most famous chess games of all time. Anderssen gave up both rooks and a bishop, then his queen, checkmating his opponent with his three remaining minor pieces. The game has been called an achievement "perhaps unparalleled in chess literature".[tpl]cite book |title=Teach Yourself Chess |author=Hartston, Bill |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |isbn=0-340-67039-8 |year=1996 |pages=150[/tpl]

[[Culture of Italy]]

CATEGORIES: Libraries in Italy, Italian culture

From antiquity until the mid-17th century, Italy was considered as the central place of Western culture and the starting point of worldwide phenomena such as the Roman Empire, Roman Catholic Church, cultural and educational reform and new beginning. During this period, Italy gave birth to a number of famous painters, sculptors, poets, musicians, mathematical and architects those created a niche of their own in history.
Both the internal and external facets of Western culture were born on the Italian peninsula, whether one looks at the history of the Christian faith, civil institutions (such as the Senate), philosophy, law,Roman law. Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2011. Web. 25 Sep. 2011. art, science, or social customs and culture. Furthermore, the country played a leading role in the fight against the death penalty.
Italy was home to many well-known and influential civilizations, including the Etruscans, Samnites, Phoenicians, Greeks, and the Romans. Etruscan and Samnite cultures flourished in Italy before the emergence of the Roman Empire, which conquered and incorporated them. Phoenicians and Greeks established settlements in Italy beginning several centuries before the birth of Christ, and the Greek settlements in particular developed into thriving classical civilizations. The Greek ruins in southern Italy are perhaps the most spectacular and best preserved anywhere.
For more than 2,000 years Italy experienced migrations, invasions and was divided into many independent states until 1861 when it became a nation-state.Risorgimento. Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2011. Web. 25 Sep. 2011. Due to this comparatively late unification, and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the Italian peninsula, many traditions and customs that are now recognized as distinctly Italian can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social isolation of these regions, Italy's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe and the world remain immense.
The famous elements of Italian culture are its art, music, fashion, and iconic food. Italy was the birthplace of opera,Kimbell, David R. B. Italian Opera. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p. 1. Web. 22 Jul. 2012. and for generations the language of opera was Italian, irrespective of the nationality of the composer. Popular tastes in drama in Italy have long favored comedy; the improvisational style known as the Commedia dell'arte began in Italy in the mid-16th century[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Commedia dell'arte. Treccani, il portale del sapere. Web. 24 Jul. 2012. and is still performed today. Before being exported to France, the famous Ballet dance genre also originated in Italy.
The country boasts several world-famous cities. Rome was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the pope of the Catholic Church. Florence was the home of many artists of the Renaissance, a period of great achievements in the arts.Zirpolo, Lilian H. The A to Z of Renaissance Art. Scarecrow Press, 2009. pp. 154-156. Web. 16 Jul. 2012. Other important cities are Turin, which used to be the capital of Italy, is now one of the world's great centers of automobile engineering. Milan is the industrial, commercial and financial capital of Italy. Venice, with its intricate canal system, attracts tourists from all over the world.
Italy is home to the greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites (49) to date,http://whc.unesco.org/en/list UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Web. 25 Sep. 2011.[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Beni Italiani Unesco.

[[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]

CATEGORIES: Isaac Newton, Alchemical documents, Alchemy, Hermeticism, Occult

Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727), the noted English scientist and mathematician, wrote many works that would now be classified as occult studies. These occult works explored chronology, alchemy, and Biblical interpretation (especially of the Apocalypse). Newton's scientific work may have been of lesser personal importance to him, as he placed emphasis on rediscovering the occult wisdom of the ancients. In this sense, someKeynes, J.M., "Newton, The Man"; Proceedings of the Royal Society Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 15–19 July 1946; Cambridge University Press (1947) believe that any reference to a "Newtonian Worldview" as being purely mechanical in nature is somewhat inaccurate.
After purchasing and studying Newton's alchemical works in 1942, economist John Maynard Keynes, for example, opined that "Newton was not the first of the age of reason, he was the last of the magicians". In the Early Modern Period of Newton's lifetime, the educated embraced a world view different from that of later centuries. Distinctions between science, superstition, and pseudoscience were still being formulated, and a devoutly Christian Biblical perspective permeated Western culture.

In mathematical logic, logical assertion is a statement that asserts that a certain premise is true, and is useful for statements in proof. It is equivalent to a sequent with an empty antecedent.
For example, if p = "x is even", the implication
is thus true. We can also write this using the logical assertion symbol, as

[[Evergreen Game]]

CATEGORIES: Chess games, Chess in Germany, 1852 in chess

The Evergreen Game is a famous chess game played in Berlin in 1852 between Adolf Anderssen and Jean Dufresne.
Adolf Anderssen was one of the strongest players of his time, and was considered by many to be the world champion after winning the London 1851 tournament. Jean Dufresne, a popular author of chess books, was considered a master of lesser but still considerable skill.Fadul, Jose A.  Lessons in Chess, Lessons in Life.  Lulu Press.  2008. page 59. This was an informal game, like the Immortal Game.
Wilhelm Steinitz later described the game as the "evergreen in Anderssen's laurel wreath", thus giving this game its name. The German word Immergrün (Evergreen), used by Steinitz, refers to a specific evergreen plant, called Periwinkle (Vinca) in English. The symbolic meaning is expressed in the French translation, the "Forever Young Game" (La Toujours Jeune).

[[Algebraic data type]]
CATEGORIES: Functional programming, Type theory, Data types, Articles with example Haskell code, Composite data types

In computer programming, particularly functional programming and type theory, an algebraic data type is a kind of composite type, i.e. a type formed by combining other types.
Two common classes of algebraic type are product types, i.e. tuples and records, and sum types, also called tagged unions or variant types.Records and variants - OCaml manual section 1.4
The values of a product type typically contain several values, called fields.  All values of that type have the same combination of field types.  The set of all possible values of a product type is the set-theoretical product of the sets of all possible values of its field types.
The values of a sum type are typically grouped into several classes, called variants.  A value of a variant type is usually created with a quasi-functional entity called a constructor.  Each variant has its own constructor, which takes a specified number of arguments with specified types.
The set of all possible values of a sum type is the set-theoretical sum, i.e. the disjoint union, of the sets of all possible values of its variants. enumerated types are a special case of sum types in which the constructors take no arguments.
Values of algebraic types are analyzed with pattern matching, which identifies a value by its constructor or field names and extracts the data it contains.
Algebraic data types were introduced in Hope,  a small functional programming language developed in the 1970s at Edinburgh University.

Bol played basketball for many teams over his career. He played for two colleges and four NBA teams. A center, he was known as a specialist player; he was considered among the best shot-blockers in the history of the sport, but other aspects of his game were considered fairly weak. Over the course of his career he blocked more shots than he scored points. He is second all-time in NBA history in terms of average blocked shots per game, and ranks 15th on the career blocks list.

It is the administrative center of the Moravica District of Serbia. Čačak is the main economic, cultural and sport center of the district, which includes Gornji Milanovac to the north and Lučani to the southwest. Čačak borders Požega, Serbia (Zlatibor District) to the west, Knić (Šumadija District) to the east and Kraljevo (Raška District) to the southeast. Moravica District includes Čačak, Gornji Milanovac, Lučani and Ivanjica.

This area is also called "Serbian Mount Athos." Čačak got its current name in 1408; before that it was called Gradac. One of Gradac's leaders was Stracimir Zavidović, brother of Stefan Nemanja, an important Serbian ruler. He built the church of 'Our Lady' (Church of Jesus Ascension), which still stands in the center of Čačak. The church underwent reconstruction from 2010 to 2011, following an earthquake which damaged its facade.
From 1459, when Serbia lost its independence to the Ottomans to 1718, and again from 1739 to 1878 Čačak was a part of the Ottoman Empire.

At the highest peak of Ljubić hill, where the main battles of the uprising were fought, now stands a monument to Tanasko Rajić, who died a brave death while protecting the city. After that Serbia was given autonomy in the Ottoman Empire in 1817. Sixty one years later Serbia became an independent country. 
After 1882. Čačak was a part of the Kingdom of Serbia, then from 1918. to 2003. part of Yugoslavia. From 2003. to 2006. Čačak was a part of Serbia and Montenegro.

Denner was born in Leipzig to a family of horn-tuners.  With his father, Heinrich Denner, a maker of game whistles and hunting horns, moved to Nuremberg in 1666. J. C. Denner went into business as an instrument maker in 1678.   Two of his sons, Jacob and Johann David, also became instrument builders.  At least sixty-eight instruments attributed to J. C. Denner have survived to the present day. Denner died in 1707 and was buried in Nuremberg.
In 1730, Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr wrote of Denner:

 | first = Colin

On the basis of this passage, Denner has been credited by many with the improvement of the chalumeau and the invention of the clarinet.  Despite the words "At the beginning of the current century" he is often said to have developed the clarinet in 1690; there is no evidence for this.  In fact, J. C. Denner may have built no clarinets at all(not true)...  Only one extant clarinet, owned by the University of California, Berkeley has been attributed to him, and this attribution has been challenged.[ref]

Johannes Virolainen ([tpl]Audio|Fi-Johannes_Virolainen.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl]) (31 January 1914 – 11 December 2000) was a Finnish politician. 
Virolainen was born near Viipuri. After the Continuation War Virolainen moved to Lohja, but he remained one of the leaders of the evacuated Karelians, and never gave up the hope that Soviet Union and later Russia would return Finnish Karelia to Finland. After World War II Virolainen became the first president of the Maaseudun Nuorten Liitto later known as Finnish Centre Youth, which has been educating tens of ministers and hundreds of members of the Finnish Parliament.Vanhanen, Tatu. Vihreä Nuoriso, Nuoren Keskustan Liitto r.y., 1995, p. 79.
He was also famous as a teetotaller, saying that the only circumstance where he would countenance downing a toast would be if Karelia was ceded back to Finland. He was fond of repeating the line, and it has been claimed that he said it to, among others, Nikita Khrushchev and Anastas Mikoyan on the Soviet side, to fend off needling by them for lacking the Soviet style of social graces.
A member of the Agrarian League (later the Centre Party), Virolainen was a Member of Parliament 1945–1983 and 1987–1991.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eduskunta.fi/triphome/bin/hx5000.sh?{hnro}=231&{kieli}=su&{haku}=kaikki |title=Edustajamatrikkeli |publisher=Eduskunta[/tpl] [tpl]fi icon[/tpl]
He had a long ministerial career, serving as Assistant Minister of the Interior 1950–1951; Minister at the Council of State Chancellery 1951, and 1956–1957; Minister of Education 1953, 1954, 1956–1957, and 1968–1970; Minister for Foreign Affairs 1954–1956, 1957, and 1958; Deputy Prime Minister 1957, 1958, 1962–1963, 1968–1970, and 1977–1979; Minister of Agriculture 1961–1962, 1962–1963; Minister of Finance 1972–1975; and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry 1976–1977 and 1977–1979.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.valtioneuvosto.fi/hakemisto/ministerikortisto/ministeritiedot.asp?nro=430 |title=Ministerikortisto |publisher=Valtioneuvosto[/tpl] [tpl]fi icon[/tpl]
Virolainen was Prime Minister in 1964–1966, presiding over a coalition government comprising the Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Swedish People's Party, and Finnish People's Party. He also served as Speaker of the Parliament in 1966–1968 and 1979–1982. Virolainen is considered one of the strongest Centre Party leaders in the post-war era, second only to Urho Kekkonen.
Virolainen had a variable, often tense relationship with President Kekkonen, who considered him an unreliable, too frequently opinion-changing politician (Juhani Suomi, "A Ski Trail Being Snowed In:  Urho Kekkonen 1976-1981" / Umpeutuva latu.  Urho Kekkonen 1976-1981, Helsinki:  Otava Publishing Ltd., 2000).  Virolainen himself claimed that the two basic reasons for their tense relationship were that he had never been a member of the right-wing, nationalist Academic Karelia Society (Kekkonen had, until 1932), and that he was a teetotaller (Kekkonen drank and at times smoked) (Johannes Virolainen, "The Last Electoral Term" / Viimeinen vaalikausi, Helsinki:  Otava Publishing Ltd., 1991).  Moreover, Kekkonen was unconvinced that Virolainen always supported his official foreign policy toward the Soviet Union.  In June 1979, he publicly rebuked Virolainen, who was then Speaker of Parliament, for "bearing a false testimony" about Finland's foreign policy, and for harming Finland's international relations.  Shortly before this harsh accusation, Virolainen had suggested in an interview by the Suomen Kuvalehti magazine that the National Coalition Party had remained in the opposition despite its major victory in the 1979 parliamentary elections because of "general reasons" or foreign policy (Suomi 2000;  Pekka Hyvärinen, "Finland's Man:  Urho Kekkonen's Life" / Suomen mies.  Urho Kekkosen elämä, Helsinki:  Werner Söderström Publishing Ltd., 2000;  Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., "A Small Giant of the Finnish History" / Suomen historian pikkujättiläinen, Helsinki:  Werner Söderström Publishing Ltd., 2003).
After Kekkonen resigned in October 1981, Virolainen became the Centre Party's presidential candidate, but he was handily defeated in the 1982 presidential elections by the Social Democratic candidate, Mauno Koivisto.  In the 1983 parliamentary elections, Virolainen was one of the major-party deputies to lose their seats because of allegations that he had illegally received the parliamentary daily allowance for commuting between Helsinki and his official hometown.  Determined to finish his parliamentary career in style, he was re-elected to Parliament in the 1987 parliamentary elections.  During his last electoral term, Virolainen supported constitutional amendment proposals that reduced the President's power (Zetterberg et al., eds., 2003;  Virolainen 1991).
During his nine-year retirement from Parliament, Virolainen still actively followed the Finnish political affairs and sometimes gave interviews on current topics (the Finnish broadcasting corporation YLE "Living Archives" / Elävä arkisto, search words:  "Johannes Virolainen").  He also wrote some volumes of political memoirs, including "A Defence of Politics" (Politiikan puolustus), "From the Path" (Polun varrelta), and "The Pictures Move" (Kuvat kulkevat).

[[Canoeing]]

CATEGORIES: Canoeing

Canoeing is a paddle sport in which you kneel or sit facing forward in an open or closed-decked canoe, and propel yourself with a single-bladed paddle, under your own power. Kayaking is a comparable activity in a kayak which usually has a closed deck and is propelled with a double bladed paddle. In a kayak the paddler typically sits with legs extended forward.[tpl]cite book|last=Dillon, Pamela and Oyen, Jeremy|title=Canoeing|year=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=0-7360-6715-9|pages=4–5[/tpl]
In some situations canoeing refers to both canoeing and kayaking. Other than by the minimum competition specifications (typically length and width (beam)) and seating arrangement it is difficult to differentiate most competition canoes from the equivalent competition kayaks. The most common difference is that competition kayaks are always seated and paddled with a double-bladed paddle, and competition canoes are generally kneeled and paddled with a single-bladed paddle. Exceptions include Canoe Marathon (in both European and American competitive forms) and sprint (high kneeling position). The most traditional and early canoes did not have seats, the paddlers merely knelt on the bottom of the boat. Recreational canoes and kayaks employ seats and whitewater and surf variants employ the use of foam 'saddles' with thigh straps or increasingly foam 'bulkheads' with integrated thigh hooks that give greater boat control under extreme conditions.

[tpl]legend|#04E3F1|countries neutral in the past [/tpl]]]
A neutral power in a particular war is a sovereign state which officially declares itself to be neutral towards the belligerents. A non-belligerent state does not need to be neutral. The rights and duties of a neutral power are defined in Sections 5Second Hague Convention, Section 5 and 13Second Hague Convention, Section 13 of the Hague Convention of 1907.  A permanently neutral power is a sovereign state which is bound by international treaty to be neutral towards the belligerents of all future wars. An example of a permanently neutral power is Switzerland.  The concept of neutrality in war is narrowly defined and puts specific constraints on the neutral party in return for the internationally recognised right to remain neutral.
Neutralism or a "neutralist policy" is a foreign policy position wherein a state intends to remain neutral in future wars. A sovereign state that reserves the right to become a belligerent if attacked by a party to the war is in a condition of armed neutrality.

[[Renal failure]]

CATEGORIES: Nephrology, Organ failure

Renal failure (also kidney failure or renal insufficiency) is a medical condition in which the kidneys fail to adequately filter waste products from the blood.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/kidneyfailure.html |title=Kidney Failure |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl] The two main forms are acute kidney injury, which is often reversible with adequate treatment, and chronic kidney disease, which is often not reversible. In both cases, there is usually an underlying cause.
Renal failure is mainly determined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, the rate at which blood is filtered in the glomeruli of the kidney. This is detected by a decrease in or absence of urine production or determination of waste products (creatinine or urea) in the blood. Depending on the cause, hematuria (blood loss in the urine) and proteinuria (protein loss in the urine) may be noted.
In renal failure, there may be problems with increased fluid in the body (leading to swelling), increased acid levels, raised levels of potassium, decreased levels of calcium, increased levels of phosphate, and in later stages anemia. Bone health may also be affected. Long-term kidney problems are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1155/2012/691369 |title=Insulin Resistance in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease |year=2012 |last1=Liao |first1=Min-Tser |last2=Sung |first2=Chih-Chien |last3=Hung |first3=Kuo-Chin |last4=Wu |first4=Chia-Chao |last5=Lo |first5=Lan |last6=Lu |first6=Kuo-Cheng |journal=Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology |volume=2012 |pages=1–5 |pmid=22919275[/tpl]

[[Immunization]]

CATEGORIES: Immunology, Immune system, Vaccination

Immunization, or immunisation, is the process by which an individual's immune system becomes fortified against an agent (known as the immunogen).
When this system is exposed to molecules that are foreign to the body, called non-self, it will orchestrate an immune response, and it will also develop the ability to quickly respond to a subsequent encounter because of immunological memory. This is a function of the adaptive immune system. Therefore, by exposing an animal to an immunogen in a controlled way, its body can learn to protect itself: this is called active immunization.
The most important elements of the immune system that are improved by immunization are the T cells, B cells, and the antibodies B cells produce. Memory B cells and memory T cells are responsible for a swift response to a second encounter with a foreign molecule. Passive immunization is when these elements are introduced directly into the body, instead of when the body itself has to make these elements.
Immunization is done through various techniques, most commonly vaccination. Vaccines against microorganisms that cause diseases can prepare the body's immune system, thus helping to fight or prevent an infection. The fact that mutations can cause cancer cells to produce proteins or other molecules that are unknown to the body forms the theoretical basis for therapeutic cancer vaccines. Other molecules can be used for immunization as well, for example in experimental vaccines against nicotine (NicVAX) or the hormone ghrelin in experiments to create an obesity vaccine.
Before the introduction of vaccines, the only way people became immune to an infectious disease was by actually getting the disease and surviving it. Smallpox (variola) was prevented in this way by inoculation, which produced a milder effect than the natural disease. It was introduced into England from Turkey by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in 1721 and used by Zabdiel Boylston in Boston the same year. In 1798 Edward Jenner introduced inoculation  with cowpox (smallpox vaccine), a much safer procedure. This procedure, referred to as vaccination,  gradually replaced smallpox inoculation, now called variolation to distinguish it from vaccination. Until the 1880s vaccine/vaccination referred only to smallpox, but Louis Pasteur developed immunisation methods for chicken cholera and anthrax in animals and for human rabies, and suggested that the terms vaccine/vaccination should be extended to cover the new procedures. This can cause confusion if care is not taken to specify which vaccine is used e.g. measles vaccine or influenza vaccine.
Immunizations are definitely less risky and an easier way to become immune to a particular disease than risking a milder form of the disease itself. They are important for both adults and children in that they can protect us from the many diseases out there.  Through the use of immunizations, some infections and diseases have almost completely been eradicated throughout the United States and the World.  One example is polio.  Thanks to dedicated health care professionals and the parents of children who vaccinated on schedule, polio has been eliminated in the U.S. since 1979.  Polio is still found in other parts of the world so certain people could still be at risk of getting it. This includes those people who have never had the vaccine, those who didn't receive all doses of the vaccine, or those traveling to areas of the world where polio is still prevalent.
Active immunization/vaccination has been named one of the "Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century".

[[Teratoma]]
CATEGORIES: Teratoma, Congenital disorders, Obstetrics, Male genital neoplasia, Anatomical pathology, Rare cancers, Pediatric cancers, Dermal and subcutaneous growths, Gynaecological cancer, Induced stem cells

A teratoma is an encapsulated tumor with tissue or organ components resembling normal derivatives of more than one germ layer. The tissues of a teratoma, although normal in themselves, may be quite different from surrounding tissues and may be highly disparate; teratomas have been reported to contain hair, teeth, bone and, very rarely, more complex organs or processes such as eyes, torso, and hands, feet, or other limbs.[tpl]cite news | title = Tumor in baby’s brain contained tiny foot | publisher = msnbc.msn.com | date = December 18, 2008 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28294470/ | accessdate = 2008-12-19[/tpl]
Usually, however, a teratoma will contain no organs but rather one or more tissues normally found in organs such as the brain, thyroid, liver, and lung.  Sometimes, the teratoma has within its capsule one or more fluid-filled cysts; when a large cyst occurs, there is a potential for the teratoma to produce a structure within the cyst that resembles a fetus.  Because they are encapsulated, teratomas are usually benign, although several forms of malignant teratoma are known and some of these are common forms of teratoma.  A mature teratoma is typically benign and found more commonly in women, while an immature teratoma is typically malignant and is more often found in men.
Teratomas are thought to be present at birth (congenital), but small ones are often not discovered until much later in life.
Definitive medical diagnosis of a teratoma is based on its histology;  this diagnosis is made by a pathologist.

The cracticines have large, straight bills and mostly black, white or grey plumage. All are omnivorous to some degree: the butcherbirds mostly eat meat, Australian Magpies usually forage through short grass looking for worms and other small creatures, currawongs are true omnivores, taking fruit, grain, meat, insects, eggs and nestlings. The female constructs bulky nests from sticks, and both parents help incubate the eggs and raise the young thereafter.[tpl]cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Howley, Ian|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 226–227|isbn= 1-85391-186-0[/tpl]

In 1993 he completed a bicycle pilgrimage to Mecca.Lally Hoffman, Beduin i laksko, Lindhardt & Ringhof: 2004, biography (Danish), ISBN 87-595-2207-0
The Danish government strongly supported the US-led invasion of Iraq, 2003, and in what was seen as recognition of the Scandinavian country's support for the coalition, Olsen was appointed to the position as coordinator for one of the four U.S.-led provisional authorities, that in Southern Iraq, stationed in Basra. The other three coordinators were US Americans. Olsen has however criticized his US superiors in Baghdad for the lack of support for his reconstruction efforts, and for providing him with too little assistance, for instance on security back-up. He was suddenly replaced on July 28, three and a half months before his contract was due to end. He then returned to his former posting in Damascus as the Danish ambassador to Syria.
After Syria, he returned to Denmark, where he worked at the Danish Institute of International Studies for 1 year as a senior consultant. In 2006 he was sent on his latest posting; as the Danish ambassador to Algeria.

Juan Evo Morales Ayma, (born October 26, 1959), popularly known as Evo ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈeβo[/tpl]), is a Bolivian cocalero activist and politician, who has served as President of Bolivia since 2006. Widely regarded as the country's first democratically-elected President to come from the indigenous population, his administration has focused on the implementation of leftist policies, poverty reduction, and combating the influence of the United States and transnational corporations in Bolivia. A democratic socialist, he is the head of the Movement for Socialism (MAS) political party.
Born to an Aymara family of subsistence farmers in Isallawi, Orinoca Canton, Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to Chapare Province. Growing coca and becoming a trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the campesino (rural laborers) union, campaigning against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to eradicate coca as a part of the War on Drugs. Often taking direct action against the government, he was arrested on multiple occasions. Entering electoral politics in 1995, he became the leader of the MAS, and began a campaign focusing on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the redistribution of gas wealth. Gaining increasing visibility through the Cochabamba protests and gas conflict, in 2002 he was expelled from Congress, though came second in that year's presidential election.
Elected president in 2005, Morales oversaw increased taxation on the hydrocarbons industry, agrarian reform, and a program of literacy, anti-poverty, and anti-racism campaigns. He scaled back U.S. involvement in Bolivia while building relationships with other nations in the Latin American Pink Tide and joining the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. Attempting to moderate the left-indigenous activist community, his administration also opposed the right-wing autonomist demands of the media luna. Winning a recall referendum in 2008, he instituted a new constitution before being re-elected with a landslide in 2009, furthering leftist policies and joining the Bank of the South and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. He is seeking reelection in the 2014 general election.
Morales is a controversial and divisive world figure, lauded by his supporters as a champion of indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. Leftist critics have condemned him for failing to implement socialism, while rightist critics have accused him of being authoritarian in suppressing eastern Bolivia's autonomist movements.

[[Table of contents]]

CATEGORIES: Technical communication, Book design, Indexing

A table of contents, usually headed simply "Contents" and abbreviated informally as TOC, is a list of the parts of a book or document organized in the order in which the parts appear. The contents usually includes the titles or descriptions of the first-level headers, such as chapter titles in longer works, and often includes second-level or section titles (A-heads) within the chapters as well, and occasionally even third-level titles (subsections or B-heads). The depth of detail in tables of contents depends on the length of the work, with longer works having less. Formal reports (ten or more pages and being too long to put into a memo or letter) also have a table of contents. Within an English-language book, the table of contents usually appears after the title page, copyright notices, and, in technical journals, the abstract; and before any lists of tables or figures, the foreword, and the preface.
Printed tables of contents indicate page numbers where each part starts, while digital ones offer links to go to each part. The format and location of the page numbers is a matter of style for the publisher. If the page numbers appear after the heading text, they might be preceded by characters called leaders, usually dots or periods, that run from the chapter or section titles on the opposite side of the page, or the page numbers might remain closer to the titles. In some cases, the page number appears before the text.
If a book or document contains chapters, articles, or stories by different authors, the author's name also usually appears in the table of contents.
In some cases, tables of contents contains a high quality description of the chapter's but usually first-level header's section content rather than subheadings.

The Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) was a non-profit 501(c)(4) corporation[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] founded in 1985 that, upon its formation, argued the United States Democratic Party should shift away from the leftward turn it took in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.  The DLC hailed President Bill Clinton as proof of the viability of Third Way politicians and as a DLC success story.
The DLC's affiliated think tank is the Progressive Policy Institute.  Democrats who adhere to the DLC's philosophy often call themselves New Democrats. This term is also used by other groups who have similar views on where the party should go in the future, like NDNNew Democrat Network official website and Third Way.Third Way official website

The family Pachycephalidae, collectively the whistlers, includes the whistlers, shrike-thrushes, shrike-tits, pitohuis and Crested Bellbird, and is part of the ancient Australo-Papuan radiation of songbirds. Its members range from small to medium in size, and occupy most of Australasia. Australia and New Guinea are the centre of their diversity, and in the case of the whistlers, the South Pacific islands as far as Tonga and Samoa and parts of Asia as far as India. The exact delimitation of boundaries of the family are uncertain.

[[Callaeidae]]

CATEGORIES: Bird families, Callaeidae, Higher-level bird taxa restricted to New Zealand

The small bird family Callaeidae (also named in some sources as Callaeatidae) is endemic to New Zealand. It contains three monotypic genera; of the three species in the family, only two survive and both of them, the Kokako and the Saddleback, are endangered species, threatened primarily by the predations of introduced mammalian species such as rats, mustelids and possums. A third, the Huia became extinct early in the 20th century. 
The Callaeidae are often known as wattlebirds, a term that leads to confusion, as there are other, unrelated species with this same name, notably the large Australian wattlebirds of the family Meliphagidae, which are honeyeaters. For this reason New Zealand wattlebirds is the informal name for this family used by the scientific community.Higgins, P.J. & J.M. Peter (eds) 2002.

[[Bowerbird]]

Bowerbirds [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aʊər|b|ɜr|d[/tpl] make up the bird family Ptilonorhynchidae. They are renowned for their unique courtship behaviour, where males build a structure and decorate it with sticks and brightly coloured objects in an attempt to attract a mate.
The family has 20 species in eight genera. These are medium to large-sized passerines, ranging from the Golden Bowerbird at [tpl]convert|22|cm|inch[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|70|g|oz[/tpl] to the Great Bowerbird at [tpl]convert|40|cm|inch[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|230|g|oz[/tpl].

The bowerbirds have an Austro-Papuan distribution, with ten species endemic to New Guinea, eight endemic to Australia, and two found in both. Although their distribution is centered on the tropical regions of New Guinea and northern Australia, some species extend into central, western, and southeastern Australia. They occupy a range of different habitats, including rainforest, eucalyptus and acacia forest, and shrublands.

CATEGORIES: 1882 births, 1965 deaths, BBC people, British radio DJs, Royal Fusiliers officers, People educated at Eton College, Radio Luxembourg (English) presenters

Major Christopher Reynolds Stone, D.S.O., M.C. (19 September 1882 – 22 May 1965) was the first disc jockey in the United Kingdom.
He was educated at Eton College and served in the Royal Fusiliers. In 1906 Stone published a book of Sea songs and ballads and in 1923 he wrote the history of his old regiment. He became the London editor of The Gramophone, a magazine started by his brother-in-law Compton Mackenzie. 
Stone approached the BBC himself with the idea for a record programme, which the corporation initially dismissed. Stone managed to convince them though and on 7 July 1927 he started playing records on air. His relaxed, conversational style was exceptional at a time when most of the BBC's presentation was extremely formal, and his programmes became highly popular as a result. He wore a dinner jacket and tie when he presented.
In 1934 Stone joined the commercial station Radio Luxembourg (for 5,000 pounds a year) and was barred by the BBC in consequence.   He wrote a column reviewing new popular records for the Sunday Referee newspaper and appeared in advertisements for Bush radio sets.Sunday Referee, 24 May 1936  In 1937, as "Uncle Chris", he presented the first daily children's programme on commercial radio, Kiddies Quarter Hour on Radio Lyons. Stone later rejoined the BBC and caused a major row in 1941. On 11 November he wished King Victor Emmanuel of Italy a happy birthday on air, adding "I don't think any of us wish him anything but good, poor soul." This good wish towards the head of a state Britain was at war with at the time led to the sacking of the BBC's Senior Controller of Programmes and tighter government control over all broadcasts.
Stone was an avid record collector; in the mid-1930s he already owned over 12,000. When he turned 75 in 1957 the magazine Melody Maker praised his pioneering work: "Everyone who has written, produced or compered a gramophone programme should salute the founder of his trade."

[[Think aloud protocol]]

CATEGORIES: Human–computer interaction, Software testing, Usability

Think-aloud protocol (or think-aloud protocols, or TAP; also talk-aloud protocol) is a method used to gather data in usability testing in product design and development, in psychology and a range of social sciences (e.g., reading, writing, translation research, decision making, and process tracing). The think-aloud method was introduced in the usability field by Clayton Lewis [ref]
</ref> while he was at [[IBM]], and is explained in ''Task-Centered User Interface Design: A Practical Introduction'' by C. Lewis and J. Rieman.<ref>http://grouplab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/saul/hci_topics/tcsd-book/chap-1_v-1.html ''Task-Centered User Interface Design: A Practical Introduction'', by Clayton Lewis and John Rieman.</ref> The method was developed based on the techniques of [[protocol analysis]] by Ericsson and Simon.<ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref>
Think-aloud protocols involve participants thinking aloud as they are performing a set of specified tasks. Users are asked to say whatever they are looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling as they go about their task. This enables observers to see first-hand the process of task completion (rather than only its final product). Observers at such a test are asked to objectively take notes of everything that users say, without attempting to interpret their actions and words. Test sessions are often audio- and video-recorded so that developers can go back and refer to what participants did and how they reacted. The purpose of this method is to make explicit what is implicitly present in subjects who are able to perform a specific task.
A related but slightly different data-gathering method is the talk-aloud protocol. This involves participants only describing their action but not giving explanations. This method is thought to be more objective in that participants merely report how they go about completing a task rather than interpreting or justifying their actions (see the standard works by Ericsson & Simon).
As Kuusela and Paul [ref]
</ref> state the think-aloud protocol can be divided into two different experimental procedures. The first one is the concurrent think-aloud protocol, collected during the decision task. The second procedure is the retrospective think-aloud protocol, gathered after the decision task.

In human–computer interaction, paper prototyping is a widely used method in the user-centered design process, a process that helps developers to create software that meets the user's expectations and needs - in this case, especially for designing and testing user interfaces. It is throwaway prototyping and involves creating rough, even hand-sketched, drawings of an interface to use as prototypes, or models, of a design. While paper prototyping seems simple, this method of usability testing can provide a great deal of useful feedback which will result in the design of better products.

[[Hino da Independência]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Brazil, Portuguese-language songs, Brazilian patriotic songs, Historical national anthems

The Hino da Independência (Portuguese: Independence Anthem) is a Brazilian official patriotic song, created in 1822, commemorating the country's declaration of independence from Portugal.
It was used as the Brazilian national anthem until the abdication, in 1831, of the  first Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro I, the composer of the anthem's melody. The lyrics were written by Evaristo da Veiga.
Dom Pedro I soon lost popularity and because of the anthem's close association with him in the minds of the people, on his abdication the anthem was replaced as National Anthem by another, also created in 1822, and which remains the new nation's national anthem to this day.
However, Pedro I's composition remained in use as a patriotic song, being played especially in the context of civil or military ceremonies celebrating the country's Independence, and it was declared the "Anthem of the Independence of Brazil", keeping, therefore, the status of one of Brazil's official patriotic songs.

Crad Kilodney (1948 – April 14, 2014) was the pen name of a Canadian writer who lived in Toronto, Ontario, and was best known for selling his self-published work on the streets of the city.
Born in Jamaica, New York, Kilodney obtained a degree in astronomy, but instead of working in that field he took a job at Exposition Press, a self-publishing company. Many of his experiences in that job, and with vanity publishing in general, shaped his outlook on fiction and provided him with material for many stories.  The stories "Three Dead Men" and "A Moment of Silence for Man Ray" (both in Girl on the Subway) are examples of this.
After moving to Canada, he worked at a number of other book publishers, mostly in their stockrooms, and while doing so decided that it might be best to reach people by publishing his books (under his own Charnel House imprint) and selling them face-to-face on the street.  This he did from 1978 through 1995, and published 32 books in this manner. Kilodney could generally be found, and indeed was a fixture, on Yonge Street and at the University Of Toronto downtown campus with a cardboard sign hanging from his neck, holding a book he was selling.[tpl]cite news|title=Cult literary figure Crad Kilodney dies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cult-literary-figure-crad-kilodney-dies-1.2610850|accessdate=April 15, 2014|newspaper=CBC News|date=April 15, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Author Crad Kilodney was a cranky and courageous fixture on Toronto streets | url = http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/04/30/author_crad_kilodney_was_a_cranky_and_courageous_fixture_on_toronto_streets_fiorito.html | newspaper = Toronto Star | first = Joe | last = Fiorito | date = April 30, 2014 | accessdate = May 1, 2014[/tpl]
In 1991 Kilodney was charged with selling commercial goods without a license, making him the only Canadian writer ever charged for selling his own writing.  At various times he kept a tape recorder with him and recorded quite a bit of bizarre byplay between himself and prospective customers; the tapes ("On The Street With Crad Kilodney" Vols 1, 2, and 3) are compilation recordings. They are extremely rare and are collector's items (much as original printings of his books are).
Vol. 3 (a 90 minute cassette) is from 1991. "Dub 154" of this tape, a representative example, includes photocopied typewritten notes detailing the recording process, transfer technique and equipment used. Kilodney handwrote with ballpoint pen on the cassette jacket as well. Side A has 11 recordings, Side B 16 recordings; four of the recordings are answering machine messages, and the rest are the famous surreptitious encounters with people wondering why this man has a sign around his neck. "Excrement" and "Putrid Scum", as well as several of his stories (such as "Henry", featured in Girl on the Subway) are also inspired by these experiences.
Kilodney mentioned that while most writers are inspired by conventionally great literature, he drew inspiration from the exact opposite: the slush pile, the crank letter, and of course the vanity press.  He was, however, not interested in being seen as a crank or an eccentric, but simply wanted to find respectable, legitimate work as a writer and be taken seriously for doing so.
In 1988, as a prank, Kilodney submitted a number of stories by famous writers to the CBC Radio literary competition, many under absurd names. All of the stories were screened out by the jury.
Kilodney has written for a variety of publications, Canadian and otherwise, such as Only Paper Today, 'What' (a literary magazine), and Rustler (for which he wrote a monthly column at one point).  According to information on his unofficial website, he also wrote the first unsolicited short story ever accepted by National Lampoon.
He retired from writing books in 1995. A fanbased website, run by Syd Allan, featured occasional new material up until 2004. From April 2008 until a few months before his death, new satirical articles were posted on his blog.
In 1997, Toronto Hardcore Band (and long time supporters of the Independent DIY ethos) Armed & Hammered released a song on their CD "It's About Fucking TIme" called "Crad Kilodney Was Innocent".  This was pre-dated by an earlier recording of "Crad Kilodney Was Innocent" which was released on a 7" single vinyl record in the early 1990s.
Kilodney died of cancer on April 15, 2014 at the age of 66. The day after his death and at his request, his friend, artist Lorette C. Luzajic, launched the Crad Kilodney Literary Foundation, a website dedicated to preserving and promoting his works.

Bananas in Pyjamas is an Australian children's television show that premiered on 20 July 1992 on ABC. It has since become syndicated in many different countries, and dubbed into other languages. In the United States, the "Pyjamas" in the title was modified to reflect the American spelling pajamas. This aired in syndication from 1995 to 1997 as a half-hour series, then became a 15-minute show paired with a short-lived 15-minute series The Crayon Box, under a 30-minute block produced by Sachs Family Entertainment titled Bananas in Pajamas & The Crayon Box. Additionally, the characters and a scene from the show were featured in the Kids for Character sequel titled Kids for Character: Choices Count. The pilot episode was Pink Mug.
The concept was inspired by the success of the song Bananas in Pyjamas, written by Carey Blyton in 1967, on Play School.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pluslicens.se/index.php/site/characters_details/bananas_in_pyjamas_characters/ |title=Plus Licens: Bananas in Pyjamas |publisher=Pluslicens.se |date= |accessdate=2010-05-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/children/bananas/about/ |title=Bananas in Pyjamas – About |publisher=ABC Television|date= |accessdate=2010-05-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100519053516/http://www.abc.net.au/children/bananas/about/| archivedate= 19 May 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This song, which had become a regular item on Play School, became the theme of the new series.

Northern Rhodesia was a protectorate in south central Africa, formed in 1911 by the amalgamating the two earlier protectorates of North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia. It was initially administered, as were the two earlier protectorates, by the British South Africa Company, (BSAC), a chartered company on behalf of the British government. Although under the BSAC charter, it had features of a charter colony the BSAC's treaties with local rulers and British legislation gave it the status of a protectorate. From 1924 it was administered by the British government as a protectorate under similar conditions to other British-administered protectorates, and the special provisions required when it was administered by BSAC were terminated. The territory attracted a relatively small number of European settlers, but from the time these first secured political representation, they agitated for white minority rule, either as a separate entity or associated with Southern Rhodesia and possibly Nyasaland. The mineral wealth of Northern Rhodesia made full amalgamation attractive to Southern Rhodesian politicians, but the British government preferred a looser association to include Nyasaland. This was intended to protect Africans in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland from discriminatory Southern Rhodesian laws. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland formed in 1953 was intensely unpopular among the African majority and its formation hastened calls for majority rule. As a result of this pressure, the country became independent in 1964 as Zambia.
The geographical, as opposed to political, term "Rhodesia" referred to a region generally comprising the areas that are today Zambia and Zimbabwe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/rhodesia|title=Merriam-Webster online dictionary[/tpl] From 1964 it only referred to the former Southern Rhodesia.

[[Flowerpecker]]

CATEGORIES: Dicaeidae, Bird families

The flowerpeckers are a family,  Dicaeidae , of passerine birds. The family comprises two genera, Prionochilus and Dicaeum, with 44 species in total. The family has sometimes been included in an enlarged sunbird family Nectariniidae. The berrypeckers of the family Melanocharitidae and the painted berrypeckers, Paramythiidae, were once lumped into this family as well. The family is distributed through tropical southern Asia and Australasia from India east to the Philippines and south to Australia. The family is catholic in its habitat preferences, occupying a wide range of environments from sea level to montane habitats. Some species, such as the Mistletoebird of Australia, are recorded as being highly nomadic over parts of their range.
There is little variation between species in the family. Flowerpeckers are stout birds, with short necks and legs. These are small birds ranging from the 10-cm, 5.7-gram Pygmy Flowerpecker to the 18-cm, 12-gram Mottled Flowerpecker. Flowerpeckers have short tails, short thick curved bills and tubular tongues. The latter features reflect the importance of nectar in the diet of many species. They also have digestive systems that have evolved to deal efficiently with mistletoe berries.[tpl]Cite book | first = Robert | last = Cheke | first2 =Clive | last2 =Mann | first3 = | last3 = | first4 = | last4 = | first5 = | last5 = | first6 = | last6 = | editor-last = Josep | editor-first = del Hoyo | editor2-last = Andrew | editor2-first = Elliott | editor3-last = David | editor3-first = Christie | contribution = Family Dicaeidae (Flowerpeckers) | title = Handbook of the Birds of the World.

Nectar forms part of the diet, although they also take berries, spiders and insects.[tpl]cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Lindsey, Terence|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 205–208|isbn= 1-85391-186-0[/tpl] Mistletoes of 21 species in 12 genera have been found to be part of the diet of flowerpeckers, and it is thought that all species have adaptations to eat these berries and dispose of them quickly. Flowerpeckers may occur in mixed-species feeding flocks with sunbirds and white-eyes, as well as other species of flowerpecker.
The breeding biology of the flowerpeckers has been little studied. In the species where data has been collected they apparently form monogamous pairs for breeding, but the division of labour varies; in Scarlet-breasted Flowerpeckers both parents participate in all aspects of nest building, incubation and chick rearing, but in the Mistletoebird the female undertakes the first two tasks alone.  Flowerpeckers lay 1-4 eggs, typically in a purse-like nest of plant fibres, suspended from a small tree or shrub. Recorded incubations times are scarce, but range from 10–12 days, with fledging occurring after 15 days.
The majority of flowerpeckers are resilient in their habits and are not threatened by human activities. Five species are considered to be near threatened by the IUCN, two are listed as vulnerable and one, the Cebu Flowerpecker, is listed as critically endangered. The status of the enigmatic Spectacled Flowerpecker is unknown.  Habitat loss is the cause of the declines of these species.

The election of the ninth-term President and Vice-President of the Republic of China (第九任中華民國總統 、副總統選舉) was the first ever direct presidential election in the ROC on Taiwan; it occurred on 23 March 1996. In the previous eight elections the president and vice president had been chosen in a ballot of the deputies of the National Assembly, in accordance with the 1947 constitution.
The outcome of the 1996 election was that Lee Teng-hui was elected as President of the Republic of China and Lien Chan as Vice President. Lee stood as the incumbent, and as the candidate of the ruling Kuomintang. He won a majority of 54% of the votes cast. His election followed missile tests by the People's Republic of China. These were an attempt to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate and discourage them from supporting Lee, however the tactic backfired. Voter turnout was 76.0%.Nohlen, D, Grotz, F & Hartmann, C (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II, p558 ISBN 0-19-924959-8

Col du Galibier (el. [tpl]convert|2645|m|ft[/tpl]) is a mountain pass in the southern region of the French Dauphiné Alps near Grenoble. It is the ninth highest paved road in the Alps and the sixth highest mountain pass. It is often the highest point of the Tour de France.
It connects Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne and Briançon via the col du Télégraphe and the Col du Lautaret. The pass is closed during the winter. It is located between the massif d'Arvan-Villards and the massif des Cerces, taking its name from the secondary chain of mountains known as the Galibier.
Before 1976, the tunnel was the only point of passage at the top, at an altitude of 2556 m. The tunnel was closed for restoration until 2002, and a new road was constructed over the summit. The re-opened tunnel is a single lane controlled by traffic lights, which are among the highest such installations in Europe.

Raymond Poulidor (born 15 April 1936), is a former professional bicycle racer. He was known as the eternal second, because he finished the Tour de France in second place three times, and in third place five times, including his final Tour at the age of 40. Despite his consistency, he never wore the Yellow Jersey in 14 Tours, of which he completed 12.
His career was distinguished, despite coinciding with two great riders - Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx. This underdog position may have been the reason Poulidor was a favourite of the public.

In computer operating systems, read-copy-update (RCU) is a synchronization mechanism implementing a kind of mutual exclusionRCU does not implement mutual exclusion in the conventional sense: RCU readers can and do run concurrently with RCU updates.  RCU's variant of mutual exclusion is in space, with RCU readers accessing old versions of data being concurrently updated, rather than in time, as is the case for conventional concurrency-control mechanisms. which can sometimes be used as an alternative to a readers-writer lock. It allows extremely low overhead, wait-free reads. However, RCU updates can be expensive, as they must leave the old versions of the data structure in place to accommodate pre-existing readers.  These old versions are reclaimed after all pre-existing readers finish their accesses.

It is the largest theatrical producer in the world.Circus arts in Quebec and in Canada (PDF), Regroupement national - des arts du cirque. Accessed in 11 October 2013. Based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and located in the inner-city area of Saint-Michel, it was founded in Baie-Saint-Paul in 1984 by two former street performers, Guy Laliberté and Gilles Ste-Croix.
Initially named Les Échassiers ([tpl]IPA-fr|lez‿e.ʃa.sje|[/tpl], "The Waders"), they toured Quebec in 1980 as a performing troupe. Their initial financial hardship was relieved in 1983 by a government grant from the Canada Council for the Arts, as part of the 450th anniversary celebrations of Jacques Cartier's voyage to Canada.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117949141.html?categoryid=2276&cs=1|author=Adam Sandler|title=Guy Laliberte: Cirque's shining light|accessdate=August 18, 2007 | work=Variety | date=August 28, 2006[/tpl] Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success in 1984, and after securing a second year of funding, Laliberté hired Guy Caron from the National Circus School to re-create it as a "proper circus". Its theatrical, character-driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus ("nouveau cirque") that it remains today.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/05/arts/05cirq.html?ex=1304481600&en=fe2ce3ff5cc2f609&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss | title=The Soleil Never Sets | author=John Rockwell | date=May 5, 2006 |work=New York Times [/tpl]
Each show is a synthesis of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows.[tpl]cite book |last= Babinski |first= Tony |title= Cirque du Soleil: 20 years under the sun |publisher=Harry N.

The State Anthem of the Russian Federation ([tpl]lang-rus|Госудáрственный гимн Росси́йской Федерáции|r=Gosudarstvenny Gimn Rossiyskoy Federatsii[/tpl])  is the name of the official national anthem of Russia. Its musical composition and lyrics were adopted from the National Anthem of the Soviet Union, composed by Alexander Alexandrov, and lyricists Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan.[tpl]cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/russia-national-anthem-of-the-russian-federation/ | title=Russia — National Anthem of the Russian Federation | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2011-11-23 [/tpl] The Soviet anthem was used from 1944, replacing "The Internationale" with a more Russocentric song. The anthem had no lyrics after 1956, due to the original lyrics having references to former leader Joseph Stalin. New lyrics were introduced in 1977 by Mikhalkov with lyrics placing less emphasis on the Great Patriotic War and more on the victory of communism.
Russia was the only republic of the USSR without its own anthem. The lyric-free "Patrioticheskaya Pesnya", composed by Mikhail Glinka, was officially adopted in 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of Russia[tpl]cite web|url=http://pravo.levonevsky.org/baza/soviet/sssr0606.htm|title=On the National Anthem of the Russian SFSR|work=Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR|date=23 November 1990 |publisher=pravo.levonevsky.org[/tpl] and confirmed in 1993,[tpl]cite web|url=http://infopravo.by.ru/fed1993/ch01/akt10443.shtm|title=On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation|work=Ukase of the President of the Russian Federation|date=11 December 1993|publisher=infopravo.by.ru[/tpl] after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, by President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin. The government sponsored contests to create lyrics for the unpopular anthem because of its inability to inspire Russian athletes during international competitions. None of the entries were adopted, resulting in President Vladimir Putin's restoration of the Soviet anthem.  The government sponsored a contest to find lyrics, eventually settling upon a composition by Mikhalkov; according to the government, the lyrics were selected to evoke and eulogize the history and traditions of Russia. The new anthem was adopted in late 2000, and became the second anthem used by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Public perception of the anthem is mixed among Russians. The anthem reminds some of the best days of Russia and past sacrifices, while it reminds others of the violence that occurred under the rule of Stalin. The Russian government maintains that the anthem is a symbol of the unity of the people, and that it respects the past. A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem, and that 81% liked it.

The Blue Lotus ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Le Lotus bleu[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-zh|link=no|藍蓮花[/tpl]) is the fifth volume of The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper [tpl]lang|fr|Le Vingtième Siècle[/tpl] for its children's supplement [tpl]lang|fr|Le Petit Vingtième[/tpl], it was serialised weekly from August 1934 to October 1935. Continuing where the plot of the previous story, Cigars of the Pharaoh, left off, the story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who are invited to China in the midst of the 1931 Japanese invasion, where he reveals the machinations of Japanese spies and uncovers a drug-smuggling ring.
The Blue Lotus was a commercial success and was published in book form shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Broken Ear.  In 1945, The Blue Lotus was coloured and re-drawn in Hergé's distinctive [tpl]lang|fr|ligne-claire[/tpl] style for republication by Casterman.  The Adventure introduces the recurring characters Dawson and Chang Chong-Chen. The story was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin.  Critical analysis has argued that The Blue Lotus is Hergé's "first masterpiece". The series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The book was included on Le Monde[tpl]'[/tpl]s 100 Books of the Century list.

[[Boldness]]
CATEGORIES: Psychological attitude, Social psychology

Boldness is the opposite of being fearful.
For example, in the context of sociability, a bold person may be willing to risk shame or rejection in social situations, and willing to bend rules of etiquette or politeness. An excessively bold person could aggressively ask for money, or persistently push a person to fulfill some request, and so on. Boldness  does not necessarily mean obnoxious; it is possible for one to be bold, while staying silent. Excessive boldness may thus be regarded as impertinence or arrogance.
Outside a social context, "boldness" can also refer to a willingness to get things done, even despite risks, and is therefore broadly synonymous with bravery.
Boldness is not always in a rash context, but can have a great positive connotation to the word. Being bold can be a huge step in social development.
"Bold" is sometimes used synonymously with (and in place of) "impudent", where a child may be punished for "being bold" when he or she had acted disrespectfully toward an adult, or simply misbehaved.
A typical example of personified boldness is often found by many specialists in the Greco-Roman mythological character of Philemon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Ar-Be/Baucis-and-Philemon.html |title=Baucis and Philemon - Myth Encyclopedia - mythology, Greek, people |publisher=Mythencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25[/tpl]

[[Power forward (basketball)]]

CATEGORIES: Basketball positions, Power forwards (basketball), Basketball terminology

Power forward (PF) is a position in the sport of basketball. The position is referred to in playbook terms as the four position and is commonly abbreviated "PF". It has also been referred to as the "post" position. Power forwards play a role similar to that of center in what is called the "post" or "low blocks". They typically play offensively with their backs towards the basket and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense.
The power forward position entails a variety of responsibilities, one of which is rebounding. Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot, and several players have become very accurate from [tpl]convert|12|to|18|ft|m[/tpl].  These skills are more typically exhibited in the European style of play.
In the NBA, power forwards usually range from 6' 8" (2.03 m) to 7' (2.13 m) and [tpl]convert|240|to|260|lb|kg[/tpl] or more. Despite the averages, a variety of players fit "tweener" roles which finds them in the small forward and/or center position depending upon matchups and coaching decisions. Some "natural" power forwards often play the center position and have the skills but lack the height that is associated with that position.
Examples of today's power forwards include Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Chris Bosh, Amar'e Stoudemire, Zach Randolph, LaMarcus Aldridge, Josh Smith, and Carlos Boozer. Great power forwards of the past include Bob Pettit, Dennis Rodman, Ralph Sampson, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, Chris Webber, and Kevin McHale.

Roger McCluskey (August 24, 1930 – August 29, 1993) was an American race car driver. He was from Tucson, Arizona.
He won championship titles in three divisions of USAC -Sprints, Stocks, and Champ Cars. He won the USAC Sprint Car title in 1963 and 1966, the USAC Stock Car title in 1969 and 1970.  The Champ Car title in 1973.  His first USAC Stock Car start resulted in a runner-up finish in Phoenix, Arizona in January 1968, when he drove as a substitute driver for Norm Nelson.
McCluskey earned four USAC Midget Car wins, 23 USAC Sprint Car wins, 23 USAC Stock Car wins and five USAC Championship Car (national championship) wins.  He was the USAC national champion in 1973.  He started every Indianapolis 500 race from 1961 to 1979 except 1964, with a best finish of 3rd in 1973.
He also made four NASCAR Grand National (now Sprint Cup Series) starts from 1969 to 1977 with a best finish of second in 1970 at Riverside International Raceway.
He represented the USAC series in the 1974 International Race of Champions.
McCluskey raced for the Holman and Moody team in a Ford GT40 Mk.IIB at the 1967 LeMans 24hrs of Endurance, France. During this event, McCluskey is credited with pulling Mario Andretti to safety-and thus saving his life-after Andretti had seriously crashed his Ford GT40 Mk.IV when a front brake locked.
McCluskey died on August 29, 1993, just five days after his 63rd birthday after a long battle with cancer. In 2004 the local United Sports Arizona Race Park hosted the Roger McCluskey Sprint Car Classic in his honor.

Clarence Leonidas "Leo" Fender (August 10, 1909 – March 21, 1991) was an American inventor who founded Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company, or "Fender" for short. In January 1965, he sold the company to CBS and later founded two other musical instrument companies, Music Man and G&L Musical Instruments.
The guitars, bass guitars, and amplifiers he designed from the 1940s on are still relevant: the Fender Telecaster (1950) was the first mass-produced solid-body electric guitar; the Fender Stratocaster (1954) is among the world's most iconic electric guitars; the Fender Precision Bass (1951) set the standard for electric bass guitars, and the Fender Bassman amplifier, popular enough in its own right, became the basis for later amplifiers (notably by Marshall and Mesa Boogie) that dominated rock and roll music. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, a unique achievement because Fender never learned how to play the instruments he made a career of building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204186/Leo-Fender|title=Leo Fender (American inventor and manufacturer)[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Game artificial intelligence, Video board games, Computer chess, Bit data structures

A bitboard is a data structure commonly used in computer systems that play board games.
A bitboard, often used for boardgames such as chess, checkers, othello and word games, is a specialization of the bitset data structure, where each bit represents a game position or state, designed for optimization of speed and/or memory or disk use in mass calculations. Bits in the same bitboard relate to each other in the rules of the game often forming a game position when taken together.  Other bitboards are commonly used as masks to transform or answer queries about positions.  The "game" may be any game-like system where information is tightly packed in a structured form with "rules" affecting how the individual units or pieces relate.

Roskilde Festival is a festival held south of Roskilde in Denmark and is one of the largest music festivals in Europe (alongside with the Vieilles Charrues Festival, the Sziget Festival, the Glastonbury Festival, the Paléo Festival, Rock Werchter, and Exit Festival). Roskilde Festival is the largest festival in northern Europe. It was created in 1971 by two high school students, Mogens Sandfær and Jesper Switzer Møller, and promoter Carl Fischer. In 1972, the festival was taken over by the Roskilde Foundation, which has since run the festival as a non-profit organization for development and support of music, culture and humanism. Toward the festival of 2014, the Roskilde Foundation has provided the participants of the festival with the opportunity, by votes and nominations, to influence which organizations should receive the profit of the festival.
It is Denmark's first real music-oriented festival, originally for hippies but it has never been afraid to change[tpl]cite web|last=Jonsson|first=Kika|title=Interview: Roskilde Festival – "An experience that may change you forever"|url=http://nbhap.com/interviews/roskilde-festival-2013/|accessdate=23 June 2013[/tpl] and today covers more of the mainstream youth from Scandinavia and the rest of Europe. Roskilde Festival 2007 had more than 180 performing bands and gathered around 80,000 people paying for the concerts, with more than 21,000 volunteers, 5,000 media people and 3,000 artists – which means almost 110,000 people participated in the festival.
For many years it was a tradition that the campsite opened the last Sunday of June, but in 2010 the festival opened Saturday instead. The festival management argued that this would prevent earlier years problems with the fence going down before time. The festival officially starts the following Thursday and the days leading up to the officiel opening is called warm up days. One stage Pavillion is during the warm up days renamed Pavillion Junior and presents the festival guests to up-coming bands from Scandinavia.
The festival officially starts the following Thursday at the Animal Showgrounds (in recent years simply known as the "Festival Site") and lasts for 4 days.
Until the mid-1990s the festival attracted mostly Scandinavians, but in recent years it has become more and more international (with an especially large influx of Germans, Australians and British).[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

[[RF probe]]
CATEGORIES: Radio electronics, Electronic circuits, Electronic test equipment

An RF probe is a device which allows electronic test equipment to measure radio frequency oscillation (RF) in an electronic circuit.
RF energy may be challenging to measure for one or more reasons, depending on the nature of the circuit to be measured and the measuring equipment at hand. 
The first kind of difficulty arises when the RF energy to be measured is at a frequency too high for available test equipment, such as a low-bandwidth oscilloscope, to process directly. In that case, the RF has to be converted to a DC or near-DC signal.
In this situation, a simple probe type sometimes called an RF detector can be used to convert the RF signal to DC. Such device will work as a RF rectifier and give a pulsed DC voltage.http://www.instructables.com/id/RF-probe/Instructables, RF Probe
The second kind of difficulty arises when RF energy has to be measured in a circuit which is sensitive to small changes in its electrical environment. For example, with some oscillator circuits, the presence of an ordinary wire within a few centimeters of the active components may change the amplitude or frequency of oscillations, or even prevent the circuit from oscillating at all. In that case, the signal has to be acquired by a measurement probe which extracts very little energy from the circuit. This can be achieved by employing very thin conductors, or tiny coils kept at some minimum separation from the active elements of the circuit.
In that situation, where circuit loading rather than high frequency is the real problem, a variety of small-geometry, high impedance probes can be used, sometimes including an amplifier to boost the tiny amount of energy extracted from the circuit to a level that allows it to be measured by available high-frequency test equipment.

[[Brahmi script]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistic history of India, Brahmic scripts, Ancient languages, Extinct languages, Extinct languages of Asia

Brāhmī is the modern name given to the one of the oldest scripts used on the Indian Subcontinent and in Central Asia, during the final centuries BCE and the early centuries CE. Like its contemporary, Kharoṣṭhī, which was used in what is now Afghanistan, Pakistan and North India, Brahmi was an abugida.
The best-known Brahmi inscriptions are the rock-cut edicts of Ashoka in north-central India, dated to 250-232 BCE. The script was deciphered in 1837 by James Prinsep, an archaeologist, philologist, and official of the British East India Company.More details about Buddhist monuments at Sanchi, Archaeological Survey of India, 1989. The origin of the script is still much debated, with current Western academic opinion generally agreeing (with some exceptions) that Brahmi was derived from or at least influenced by one or more contemporary Semitic scripts, but a strong current of opinion in India favors the idea that it is connected to the much older and as-yet undecipered Indus script.
The Gupta script of the 5th century is sometimes called "Late Brahmi". The Brahmi script diversified into numerous local variants, classified together as the Brahmic family of scripts. Dozens of modern scripts used across South Asia have descended from Brahmi, making it one of the world's most influential writing traditions.

Megasthenes ([tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɨ|ˈ|g|æ|s|θ|ɨ|n|iː|z[/tpl] [tpl]respell|mi|GAS|thi-neez[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Μεγασθένης[/tpl], ca. 350 – 290 BCE) was a Greek ethnographer and explorer in the Hellenistic period, author of the work Indika.
He was born in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) and became an ambassador of Seleucus I of the Seleucid dynasty possibly to Chandragupta Maurya in Pataliputra, India. However the exact date of his embassy is uncertain. Scholars place it before 298 BC, the date of Chandragupta's death.
Arrian explains that Megasthenes lived in Arachosia, with the satrap Sibyrtius, from where he visited India:
 
 "Megasthenes lived with Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, and often speaks of his visiting Sandracottus, the king of the Indians." Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri v.6

We have more definite information regarding the parts of India Megasthenes visited. He entered the subcontinent through the district of the Pentapotamia (modern day Punjab regionWHKMLA : History of West Punjab), providing a full account of the rivers found there (thought to be the five affluents of the Indus that form the Punjab region), and proceeded from there by the royal road to Pataliputra. There are accounts of Megasthenes having visited Madurai (then, a bustling city and capital of the Pandyas), but he appears not to have visited any other parts of India.
At the beginning of his Indika, he refers to the older Indians who know about the prehistoric arrival of Dionysus and Hercules in India, which was a story very popular amongst the Greeks during the Alexandrian period. Particularly important are his comments on the religions of the Indians. He mentions the devotees of Heracles and Dionysus  but he does not mention Buddhists, something that gives support to the theory that the latter religion was not widely known before the reign of Ashoka.Vassiliades, Demetrios, "Greeks and Buddhism Historical Contacts in the Development of a Universal religion"The Eastern Buddhist, Vol. XXXVI, No. 1 & 2, Otani University, Kyoto 2005.
His Indika served as an important source for many later writers such as Strabo and Arrian. He describes such features as the Himalayas and the island of Sri Lanka. He also describes a caste system different from the one that exists today, which shows that the caste system may to some extent be fluid and evolving. However, it might be that, being a foreigner, he was not adequately informed about the caste system. His description follows:
Later writers such as Arrian, Strabo, Diodorus, and Pliny refer to Indika in their works. Of these writers, Arrian speaks most highly of Megasthenes, while Strabo and Pliny treat him with less respect. Indika contained many legends and fabulous stories, similar to those we find in the Indica of Ctesias.
Megasthenes' Indika is the first well-known Western account of India and he is regarded as one of the founders of the study of Indian history in the West. He is also the first foreign Ambassador to be mentioned in Indian history.
Megasthenes also comments on the presence of pre-Socratic views among the Brahmans and Jews. Five centuries later Clement of Alexandria, in his Stromateis, may have misunderstood Megasthenes to be responding to claims of Greek primacy by admitting Greek views of physics were preceded by those of Jews and Indians. Megasthenes, like Numenius of Apamea, was simply comparing the ideas of the different ancient cultures.Bezalel Bar-Kochva The Image of the Jews in Greek Literature: The Hellenistic Period 2009 "He does not respond to the implied claim of Greek primacy, presumably because he did not have, and could not have had, hard information about the beginnings of “parallel” opinions among the Brahmans".

[[Peter Bartholomew]]
CATEGORIES: 1099 deaths, Christians of the First Crusade, French Christian monks, Year of birth unknown

Peter Bartholomew (died 20 April 1099) was a soldier and mystic from France who was part of the First Crusade.
In December 1097 during the siege of Antioch, Peter began to have visions, mostly of Saint Andrew. Peter claimed Saint Andrew took him to the Church of St. Peter, inside Antioch, and showed him where the relic of the Holy Lance could be found. Saint Andrew instructed Peter to tell the Crusade leaders about this and to give the Lance to Raymond of St. Gilles when it was found. Peter did not immediately inform Raymond or the other leaders and was visited four more times before June 1098.Runciman (1987), pp. 241-243. He began to lose his sight in February 1098, probably because of the famine afflicting the Crusaders, although he believed Saint Andrew was punishing him.
After the Crusaders captured Antioch, Peter and Raymond began excavating the floor of the church. On 14 June 1098, Peter apparently discovered the Lance and claimed to have been visited once more by St. Andrew that night, who told him to establish a feast day in honor of the discovery. Many people, including the papal legate Adhemar of Le Puy, believed Peter was a charlatan and had simply brought a piece of iron with him to "find." After Adhemar's death later in 1098, Peter said Adhemar visited him to confirm the authenticity of the Lance.Runciman (1987), p. 245.
The discovery of the Lance was at first considered to be a good omen, and it boosted the morale of the Crusaders when they were besieged by a Muslim army. The Lance was credited with ensuring the Crusader victory in this siege, just as Saint Andrew had promised. Nevertheless, Peter's reputation was tarnished because many of the nobles still did not believe him. He later claimed Christ had visited him and instructed the Crusaders to march barefoot to Jerusalem, although this was largely ignored. Other visions, from Christ, Saint Andrew, Adhemar and others, revealed divine anger at the various sins and vices of the Crusaders.Runciman (1987), p. 246.
On 8 April 1099, Peter went through an ordeal by fire by his own choice in an attempt to prove himself. It is very likely that he was severely burned in the process, although he claimed he was uninjured because Christ had appeared to him in the fire and that he had been hurt afterwards when a crowd rushed to him. In any case, he died on 20 April.Runciman (1987), pp. 273-274.

Sandra "Puma" Jones (5 October 1953—28 January 1990) was an American singer, best known for her involvement with the Grammy Award-winning group, Black Uhuru. 
Born in Columbia, South Carolina, Jones graduated from Columbia University with a Masters Degree, before becoming a social worker in New York City. She studied dance with the Chuck Davis troupe where she took particular interest in African dance. After becoming disillusioned with city life she declared a need to "discover her roots" and headed for Jamaica - ostensibly on vacation, but intending to seek employment.
She sang with Miriam Makeba and Ras Michael, and the Sons of Negus. In 1978, through Ras Michael, she was introduced by a mutual friend to Derrick "Duckie" Simpson, who was looking to augment Black Uhuru following line up changes that had brought Michael Rose into the band. She joined Black Uhuru for the recording sessions of the 1979 album, Showcase. She went on to sing on seven studio albums, which represents the groups most critically acclaimed period, culminating in the Grammy Award for 1983's Anthem. 
Jones was keen to exert her opinions on religious and social topics that feature in Black Uhuru[tpl]'[/tpl]s work. This was in a period where reggae musicians were often accused of being trite and dismissive of females in Jamaican society. The main inspiration of Black Uhuru, Michael Rose, quit the band in 1984, to manage a coffee farm, leaving Jones, Simpson and new member Delroy "Junior" Reid to try and keep the momentum going with the Brutal album in 1986.
Jones was committed to continuing with the band, but sometime leading up to the recording sessions of 1987's Positive album she was diagnosed with breast cancer. 
As the illness worsened she was forced to step down and the album was completed with Olafunke as an uncredited backing vocalist. Jones returned to New York City for treatment, but died on 28 January 1990, aged 36. She was later buried near her family home in South Carolina.

The Via Flaminia was an ancient Roman road leading from Rome over the Apennine Mountains to Ariminum (Rimini) on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, and due to the ruggedness of the mountains was the major option the Romans had for travel between Etruria, Latium and Campania and the Po Valley. Today the same route, still called by the same name for much of its distance, is paralleled or overlain by Strada Statale (SS) 3, also called Strada Regionale (SR) 3 in Lazio and Umbria, and Strada Provinciale (SP) 3 in Marche. It leaves Rome, goes up the Val Tevere ("Valley of the Tiber River"), strikes into the mountains at Castello delle Formiche, ascends to Gualdo Tadino, goes over the divide at Scheggia Pass, [tpl]convert|575|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], to Cagli. From there it descends the eastern slope waterways between the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines and the Umbrian Apennines to Fano on the coast and goes north parallel to Highway A1 to Rimini.
This route, convenient to ancients, is far from it to heavy modern traffic between north Italy and the capital. It remains a country road, while the traffic crosses by railway and autostrada through dozens of tunnels between Florence and Bologna, a shorter, more direct route under the ridges and nearly inaccessible passes.

CATEGORIES: Sound editors, Film techniques, Film sound production, Film crew

A sound editor  is a creative professional responsible for selecting and assembling sound recordings in preparation for the final sound mixing or mastering of a television program, motion picture, video game, or any production involving recorded or synthetic sound.  Sound editing developed out of the need to fix the incomplete, undramatic, or technically inferior sound recordings of early talkies, and over the decades has become a respected filmmaking craft, with sound editors implementing the aesthetic goals of motion picture sound design and supporting the narrative of the film's story.Holman, Tomlinson. Sound for Film and Television. New York: Focal Press, 3rd ed., 2010, p. xi.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes the artistic contribution of exceptional sound editing with the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing.
There are primarily three divisions of sound that are combined to create a final mix — dialogue, effects, and music.  In larger markets such as New York and Los Angeles, sound editors often specialize in only one of these areas; thus a show will have separate dialogue, effects, and music editors.  In smaller markets, sound editors are expected to know how to handle it all, often crossing over into the mixing realm as well.  Editing effects is likened to creating the sonic world from scratch, while dialogue editing is likened to taking the existing sonic world and fixing it.  Dialogue editing is more accurately thought of as "production sound editing", where the editor takes the original sound recorded on the set, and using a variety of techniques, makes the dialogue more understandable, as well as smoother, so the listener doesn't hear the transitions from shot to shot (often the background sounds underneath the words change dramatically from take to take).  Among the challenges that effects editors face are creatively blending various elements to create believable sounds for everything the audience sees on screen.

The Welland Canal is a ship canal in Ontario, Canada, connecting Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Traversing the Niagara Peninsula from Port Weller to Port Colborne, the canal forms a key section of the St. Lawrence Seaway, enabling ships to ascend and descend the Niagara Escarpment and bypass Niagara Falls.
Approximately 40,000,000 tonnes of cargo are carried through the Welland Canal annually by a traffic of about 3,000 ocean and Great Lakes vessels. This canal was a major factor in the growth of the city of Toronto. The original canal and its successors allowed goods from Great Lakes ports such as Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago, as well as heavily industrialized areas of the United States and Ontario, to be shipped to the port of Montreal or to Quebec City, where they were usually reloaded onto ocean-going vessels for international shipping.
By providing a relatively short and direct connection to Lake Erie, the Welland Canal eclipsed other, narrower canals in the region as a commercial traffic route for Great Lakes navigation, such as the Trent-Severn Waterway and, significantly, the Erie Canal, which linked the Atlantic and Lake Erie via New York City and Buffalo, New York.
The southern, Lake Erie terminus of the canal is 99.5 metres (326.5 feet) higher than the northern terminus on Lake Ontario. The canal includes eight 24.4 metre (80 foot)-wide ship locks.http://www.media-seaway.com/seaway_handbook/welland.pdf St. lawrence Seaways System - Region Guide: Welland Canal Section Seven of the locks (Locks 1-7, the 'Lift locks') are 233.5 metres (766 feet) long and raise (or lower) passing ships by between 43 (13.01 m) and 49 feet (14.94 m) each. The southernmost lock, (Lock 8 - the 'Guard' or 'Control' lock) is 349.9 m (1,148 feet) in length.http://www.offshoreblue.com/cruising/welland-canal.php Offshore Blue - Cruising the Welland Canal The Garden City Skyway passes over the canal, restricting the maximum height of the masts of the ships allowed on this canal to 35.5 metres (116.5 feet). All other highway or railroad  crossings of the Welland Canal are either movable bridges (of the vertical lift or bascule bridge types) or subterranean tunnels. The maximum permissible length of a ship in this canal is 225.5 metres (740 feet). It takes ships an average of about eleven hours to traverse the entire length of the Welland Canal.

Matamata [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|t|ə|ˌ|m|æ|t|ə[/tpl] is a rural Waikato town in New Zealand with a population of around 12,000 (6,000 in rural areas, 6,000 in the township). It is located near the base of the Kaimai Ranges, and is a thriving farming area known for Thoroughbred horse breeding and training pursuits. It is part of the Matamata-Piako District, which takes in the surrounding rural areas as well as Morrinsville and Te Aroha. State Highway 27 and the Kinleith Branch railway run through the town.
A nearby farm was the location for the Hobbiton set in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings. The New Zealand government decided to leave the Hobbit holes built on location as tourist attractions, since they were designed to blend seamlessly into the environment. During the interim period filming The Return of the King and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey they had no furniture or props, but could be entered with vistas of the farm viewed from inside them.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.exploring.co.nz/North_Island/Waikato/Matamata/ |title=Matamata Area Guide |accessdate=2009-01-07[/tpl] A "Welcome to Hobbiton" sign has been placed on the main road.

Robert Moses (December 18, 1888 – July 29, 1981) was the "master builder" of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, Rockland County, and Westchester County, New York. As the shaper of a modern city, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, and was arguably one of the most polarizing figures in the history of urban planning in the United States. His decisions favoring highways over public transit helped create the modern suburbs of Long Island and influenced a generation of engineers, architects, and urban planners who spread his philosophies across the nation. One of his major contributions to urban planning was New York's large parkway network.
Although Moses was never elected to any public office (his only attempt at public office is when he ran for governor of New York as a Republican in 1934 and lost by a significant margin), he was responsible for the creation and leadership of numerous public authorities which gave him autonomy from the general public and elected officials. It is due to Moses that New York State has a greater proportion of public benefit corporations than any other US state, making them the prime mode of infrastructure building and maintenance in New York, accounting for 90% of the state's debt.[tpl]Cite news |title= New York's 'shadow government' debt rises to $140 billion |date= September 2, 2009 |agency= Associated Press |newspaper= The Post-Standard |location= Syracuse |url= http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/09/new_yorks_shadow_government_de.html |accessdate= December 16, 2010 |postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] As head of various authorities, he controlled millions in income from his projects' revenue generation, such as tolls, and he had the power to issue bonds to borrow vast sums, allowing him to initiate new ventures with little or no input from legislative bodies. This allowed him to circumvent the power of the purse as it normally functioned in the United States, and the process of citizen comment on major public works.
Moses's projects were considered by many to be necessary for the region's development after being hit hard by the Great Depression. During the height of his powers, New York City participated in the construction of two World's Fairs: one in 1939 and the other in 1964. Moses was also in large part responsible for the United Nations' decision to headquarters in Manhattan, as opposed to Philadelphia, by helping the state secure the money and land needed for the project.Caro, Robert.

[[Communism in Peru]]
CATEGORIES: Communism by country, Political parties in Peru, Communism in Peru

Several different left-oriented organizations refer to themselves as the Communist Party of Peru (in Spanish: Partido Comunista del Perú) or similar names. Some are still active, others have disappeared and some joined the ranks of Shining Path or the MRTA, which participated in the internal conflict in Peru. Many of the parties are known by nicknames relating to their respective newspapers.
According to Broadleft.org, the oldest communist party in Peru is the Partido Comunista Peruano (PCP - Unidad),http://pcperuano.com/ founded in 1928, by José Carlos Mariátegui, under the name Partido Socialista del Perú.http://www.broadleft.org/pe.htm In 1930 the name was changed to PCP. PCP is often identified as PCP Unidad, to separate it from other parties with similar names. Jorge Del Prado was the general secretary between 1966 and 1991.  The main political base of PCP-Unidad is currently located at Plaza Ramón Castilla, Lima and is led by Renán Raffo Muñoz. PCP publishes Unidad ("Unity") and Nuestra Bandera ("Our Banner").
Another party that also considers itself the Communist Party of Peru is the Partido Comunista del Perú – Patria Roja,http://www.patriaroja.org.pe founded in 1970, and now, as of 2006, headed by Alberto Moreno. It descends from the mainstream fraction of PCP-Bandera Roja, which, in turn, originated as a Maoist fraction within the Partido Comunista Peruano.
Both PCP-Bandera Roja and PCP-Unidad are named after their traditional press organs. The name "PCP-Unidad" is an informal designation; the official name of the PCP-Unidad is simply "Partido Comunista Peruano". There was a fraction called PCP-Mayoría around 1980: its members considered that PCP-Unidad had taken a Eurocommunist turn, while they themselves preferred a more hard-line Soviet stance.
There are a few more groups that also consider themselves the Communist Party of Peru. The best known is the group generally referred to as the "Shining Path" (a name which the group itself does not use). This armed group, regarded by Peru as a terrorist organization, is an offshoot of PCP-Bandera Roja, having splintered from it in the early 1970s. The "Shining Path" considers PCP-Patria Roja and PCP-Unidad to be revisionist; it has assassinated several of their militants and elected officials.

[[Miniature wargaming]]

CATEGORIES: Miniatures games, Wargames, Scale modeling, Playscale miniaturism

Miniature wargaming is a form of wargaming which incorporates miniature figures, miniature armor and modeled terrain as the main components of play. Like other types of wargames, they can be generally considered to be a type of simulation game, generally about tactical combat, as opposed to computer and board wargames which have greater variety in scale.
While such games could also be played with counters on a table with colored paper to denote terrain types, the visual attractiveness and tactile satisfaction of painted miniatures moving around on a table with model trees, hills and other scenery has such an alluring power to convince many wargamers to prefer model/miniature games over the cheaper and easier board-and-chits alternatives.
The miniatures and scenario items at the core of the model wargaming experience are available in different scales, and many sets of rules are written with the assumption that a particular scale is being used.
The hobby got its start around the beginning of the 20th century, with the publication of Jane's naval war rules and H. G. Wells' Little Wars in 1913. A similar book titled Shambattle: How to Play with Toy Soldiers was published by Harry Dowdall and Joseph Gleason in 1929. Commercial products just for miniatures wargamers and awareness as a single community of people with similar interests date back to the 1950s with the efforts of Jack Scruby.Richard Gehman, "A Little War Can Be A Lot Of Fun", Sports Illustrated January 4, 1965, visited January 21, 2014. Major developments in the field since then include the rise in the 1960s and 1970s of fantasy and science fiction wargames as an alternative to games based on historical conflicts, and the emergence of companies like Games Workshop, Spartan Games, Battlefront, Foundry, Warlord Games, Privateer Press and many others.

Once Upon a Time in the West ([tpl]lang-it|C'era una volta il West[/tpl]) is a 1968 Italian/American epic Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone for Paramount Pictures. It stars Henry Fonda cast against type as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Jason Robards as a bandit, and Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader with a past as a prostitute. The screenplay was written by Leone and Sergio Donati, from a story devised by Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Dario Argento. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and Ennio Morricone provided the film score. It is the first statement in Leone's "Once Upon a Time" trilogy, the other two are  Once Upon a Time... the Revolution and Once Upon a Time in America.
After directing The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Leone decided to retire from Westerns and desired to produce his film based on The Hoods, which eventually became Once Upon a Time in America. However, Leone accepted an offer from Paramount to provide access to Henry Fonda and to use a budget to produce another Western film. He recruited Bertolucci and Argento to devise the plot of the film in 1966, researching other Western films in the process. After Clint Eastwood turned down an offer to play the villain's protagonist, Bronson was offered the role. During production, Leone recruited Donati to rewrite the script due to concerns over time limitations.
The original version by the director was 166 minutes (2 hours and 46 minutes) when it was first released on December 21, 1968. This was the version that was to be shown in European cinemas and was a box office success. For the US release on May 28, 1969, Once Upon a Time in the West was edited down to 145 minutes (2 hours and 25 minutes) by Paramount and was a financial flop. The film is now generally acknowledged as a masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=11651 |title=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=11651 |publisher=Dvdtimes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Cale |first=Matt |url=http://www.ruthlessreviews.com/1752/once-upon-a-time-in-the-west/ |title=http://www.ruthlessreviews.com/1752/once-upon-a-time-in-the-west/ |publisher=Ruthlessreviews.com |date=2006-03-09 |accessdate=2011-06-12 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120418231028/http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/11651/open-range.html | archivedate = 2012-04-18 [/tpl]

The term is a German word which has come to be accepted in English as a term in aesthetics.
The term was first used by the German writer and philosopher K. F. E. Trahndorff in an essay in 1827.Trahndorff (1827) That the aesthetic of this inherently Romantic concept preceded the explicit term may be seen in Carl Maria von Weber's enthusiastic review of the opera Undine (1814), a collaboration between  E.T.A. Hoffman, who composed the score, and Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué who adapted his own novella Undine for a libretto: Weber admired it in his review as 'an art work complete in itself, in which partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, disappear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world'.[tpl]cite book|last = Strunk |first=Oliver|title=Source Readings in Music History: The Romantic Era|year=1965|place=New York|pages=63|url=http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/aurifex/issue1/castein.html|accessdate=2008-05-10[/tpl] 
The German opera composer Richard Wagner used the term in two 1849 essays. It is unclear whether Wagner knew of Trahndorff's essay. The word has become particularly associated with Wagner's aesthetic ideals.

[[Intolerable Acts]]
CATEGORIES: 1774 in law, 1774 in the Thirteen Colonies, Laws leading to the American Revolution

The Intolerable Acts was the Patriots' name for a series of punitive laws passed by the British Parliament, in 1774 relating to Massachusetts after the Boston Tea party. It was meant to punish the colonists for its defiance when the tea was thrown in the harbor. In Great Britain, these laws were referred to as the Coercive Acts.
The acts took away Massachusetts self-government and historic rights, triggering outrage and resistance in the Thirteen Colonies. They were key developments in the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775.
Four of the acts were issued in direct response to the Boston Tea Party of December 1773; the British Parliament hoped these punitive measures would, by making an example of Massachusetts, reverse the trend of colonial resistance to parliamentary authority that had begun with the 1765 Stamp Act. A fifth act, the Quebec Act,  enlarged the boundaries of what was then the Province of Quebec and instituted reforms generally favorable to the French Catholic inhabitants of the region; although unrelated to the other four Acts, it was passed in the same legislative session and seen by the colonists as one of the Intolerable Acts. The Patriots viewed the acts as an arbitrary violation of the rights of Massachusetts, and in September of 1774 they organized the First Continental Congress to coordinate a protest. As tensions escalated, the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, leading in July 1776 to the creation of an independent United States of America.

Recitative [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɛ|s|ɪ|t|ə|ˈ|t|iː|v[/tpl], also known by its Italian name "recitativo" ([tpl]IPA-it|retʃitaˈtiːvo|[/tpl]),  is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech.   The mostly syllabic recitativo secco ("dry", accompanied only by continuo) is at one end of a spectrum through recitativo accompagnato (using orchestra),  the more melismatic arioso, and finally the full-blown  aria or ensemble, where the pulse is entirely governed by the music. 
Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition. The term recitative (or occasionally liturgical recitative) is also applied to the simpler formulas of Gregorian chant, such as the tones used for the Epistle and Gospel, preface and collects.

Count Emicho (not to be confused with Bishop Emicho of Leiningen), was a count in the Rhineland in the late 11th century and the leader of the "German Crusade" in 1096. He is also commonly referred to as Emicho of Leiningen or Emich of Flonheim.
The original idea for the First Crusade that had been preached by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095 had already turned into a much different popular movement, led by Peter the Hermit. Peter's preaching of the Crusade spread much more quickly than the official versions of Urban's call. Peter's version, which probably involved the Second Coming of Jesus, influenced Emicho, who spread his own story that Christ had appeared to him. And infused with the teachings of the Gospel of Luke he was chosen to fulfill the "end of times" Prophecy. Emicho envisioned that he would march on Constantinople and overcome the Forces there, taking over the title of "last World Emperor" in accordance with Canonical prophetic tradition.  All Christian armies, Latin & Greek, would then unite and march to seize Jerusalem from the Saracens thus prompting the Second Coming and denouement with the Antichrist.  Inspired by such exulting promises, a few thousand Franks and Germans merged and marched east in April of 1096.Chronicler Albert of Aachen. 
He did so, and in the first half of 1096 he gathered an army, which arrived at Speyer in May. Emicho, or his followers in separate groups, also went to Worms, Mainz, Cologne, Trier, and Metz, where they forcibly converted the Jewish communities, and massacred those who resisted. Eight hundred Jews were murdered at Worms and another seven hundred,(around two hundred escaped this Hordes knives and swords by slaying members of their family and themselves),wrote Albert of Aachen:in his 12th century chronicle of the Crusades. at Mainz.

Emicho was apparently motivated by greed, as he needed money to finance his army, and the Jewish communities were thought to be wealthy. He also seems to have felt that the Jews were just as much enemies of Christ as the Muslims in Syria, but the Jews were more familiar and closer to home. The Jews in the cities along the Rhine at first attempted to pay Emicho to make him go away, but although he accepted their money, he still converted or killed them. As one of the crusaders explained to a rabbi: "You are the children of those who killed the object of our veneration, hanging him on a tree; and he himself had said: 'There will yet come a day when my children will come and avenge my blood.'"Madden, Thomas F. The New Concise History of the Crusades. Rowman & Littlefield: New York, 2006.
In some communities, mothers were said to have killed their own children to avoid conversion. The Christian bishops of the cities often attempted to protect their Jewish subjects, but were not successful with the exception of Speyer. 
Emicho's army attracted many unusual followers, including a group who worshipped a goose they believed to be filled with the Holy Spirit.Albert of Aachen, Historia Ierosolimitana, ed. and trans. S. Edgington (Oxford: Oxford Medieval Texts, 2007), bk. I, ch. 30, pg. 59.  The army continued down the Rhine until they reached the Danube, which they followed to Hungary. Here, after having run out of money and food, they began to pillage Hungarian land. Much of the army was killed by the Hungarians; the rest split up to join the other Crusader armies, and Emicho went back home to his family, where he was scorned for not fulfilling his vow to capture Jerusalem.

CSIRAC ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|r|æ|k[/tpl]; ''Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Automatic Computer), originally known as 'CSIR Mk 1''', was Australia's first digital computer, and the fifth stored program computer in the world.

 (The Zuse Z4 at the Deutsches Museum is older, but was electro-mechanical, not electronic.)[/ref] and was the first in the world to play digital music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/science/ps4f.html |title=CSIRAC: Australia’s first computer |accessdate=2007-12-21 [/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Oldest computer music unveiled |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7458479.stm| date=2008-06-17|accessdate=2008-06-18|work=BBC News Online|last=Fildes|first=Jonathan [/tpl]
The CSIRAC was constructed by a team led by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard, working in large part independently of similar efforts across Europe and the United States, and ran its first test program sometime in November 1949.
The machine was fairly representative of first-generation valve-driven computer designs. It used mercury acoustic delay lines as its primary data storage, with a typical capacity of 768 20-bit words (later doubled), supplemented by a parallel disk-type device with a total 1024-word capacity and an access time of 10 milliseconds. Its memory clock ran at 1000 Hz, and the control unit, synchronized to the clock, took two cycles to execute an instruction (later the speed was doubled to one cycle per instruction). The bus (termed the "digit trunk" in their design) is unusual compared to most computers in that it was serial—it transferred one bit at a time.  The instruction set was minimal, but supported the basic set of arithmetic and logical operations, as well as conditional and relative jumps (making it possible to write a library of subroutines).
Input to the machine was performed in the form of punched paper tape, after experiments with punch cards proved unsatisfactory.  The machine was controlled through a console which allowed programs to be stepped through one at a time, and featured CRT displays which showed the contents of registers.  Output was through a standard teleprinter or to punch tape.
The machine, like all machines of the era, had no operating system.  A high-level interpreted programming language called INTERPROGRAM was developed in 1960 by Geoff Hill.  It was similar to early forms of BASIC, which was designed in 1963 for the 20-bit transistorized GE-200 series.
In 1950 or 1951, CSIRAC was used to play music, the first known use of a digital computer for the purpose. The music was never recorded, but it has been accurately reconstructed.
In 1955, with the CSIRO's decision that computing research was outside its purview, the machine was transferred from its home at the Radiophysics Laboratory at the CSIRO in Sydney, to the University of Melbourne, where it formed Australia's only academic computing facility until late 1956.  Many pioneers of computer use in Australia had their first exposure to computing there.
Most of CSIRAC's approximately 2000 valves were of the types 6SN7,6SN7 Double Triode, 8 pin, 3.8W heater 6V6,6V6 Beam Power Pentode, 8 pin, 2.8W heater EA50 Diodes and KT66.KT66 Beam Tetrode, 8 pin, 8.2W heater George Semkiw later redesigned the drum read electronics to use germanium transistors.
In 1964, CSIRAC was shut down for the last time.  Its historical significance was already recognised at that stage, and it was placed in storage with plans for its later exhibition in a museum.
The machine was stored in a warehouse through the 1960s and 1970s, before being set up for exhibit at Caulfield Institute of Technologyhttp://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/761661/slide-csirac-computer-trevor-pearcey-1965-1975 from 1980 to 1992.  It was then returned to storage.
Interest in the machine was revived in the 1990s, as it was realised that many of its developers were aging and precious history was being lost forever.  A conference about the machine was held in 1996.
The machine finally found a permanent home in the Melbourne Museum in 2000.  It has not been operable since its shutdown, but many of the programs that ran on it have been preserved, and an emulator has been written for it.  The curators have decided that, aside from the cost of restoring the device, that the huge number of repairs that would be required to make it safe to operate (CSIRAC used 30 kilowatts of power in operation) would detract from its historical authenticity.
CSIRAC is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and is included in a Heritage Overlay.

Anastasia is a 1997 American animated musical fantasy drama film produced by Fox Animation Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, the film is an animated adaptation of the 1956 live-action film of the same name, both based on the urban legend claiming that the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II, in fact survived the execution of her family. It tells the story of an eighteen-year-old orphan named Anya who, in hopes of finding some trace of her family, sides with a pair of con men who wish to take advantage of her likeness to the Grand Duchess. The film features the voices of Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Christopher Lloyd, Hank Azaria, Bernadette Peters, and Angela Lansbury.  
The film premiered on November 14, 1997 in New York City, and was released on November 21, 1997 in the United States and, despite the objections of some historians to its fantastical retelling of the life of the Grand Duchess, enjoyed a positive reception from many critics. From a $53 million budget, the film grossed $139,804,348 worldwide, making Anastasia a box office success. The film also received nominations for several awards, including two Oscars for Best Original Song ("Journey to the Past") and Best Original Musical or Comedy Score. It is the most profitable film from Don Bluth and Fox Animation Studios to date. 
The success of Anastasia spawned various adaptations of the film into other media, including a direct-to-video spin-off film, a computer game,[tpl]cite web | title = IGN: Anastasia: Adventures with Pooka and Bartok | publisher = IGN | url = http://pc.ign.com/objects/854/854157.html | accessdate = 2010-12-30[/tpl] books, toys, and an upcoming stage adaptation.[tpl]cite web | first=Rialto | last=Chatter | date=July 28, 2012 | work=Broadway World | publisher=Wisdom Digital Media | title=Exclusive: Crawford, Barrett, Halston, Page Join Tveit, Lansbury, Lazar in ANASTASIA Reading! | url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Exclusive-Crawford-Barrett-Halston-Page-Join-Tveit-Lansbury-Lazar-in-ANASTASIA-Reading-20120728 | accessdate=2012-07-01 [/tpl]

A private prison or for-profit prison, jail, or detention center is a place in which individuals are physically confined or interned by a third party that is contracted by a government agency.  Private prison companies typically enter into contractual agreements with governments that commit prisoners and then pay a per diem or monthly rate for each prisoner confined in the facility.
Today, the privatization of prisons refers both to the takeover of existing public facilities by private operators and to the building and operation of new and additional prisons by for-profit prison companies.

Bernard Hinault ([tpl]IPA-fr|bɛʁ.naʁ i.no|pron[/tpl]; born 14 November 1954) is a former French cyclist who won the Tour de France five times. He is one of only five cyclists to have won all three Grand Tours, and the only cyclist to have won each more than once. He won the Tour de France in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1985. He came second in 1984 and 1986 and won 28 stages, of which 13 were individual time trials. The other three to have achieved five Tour de France victories are Jacques Anquetil (1964), Eddy Merckx (1974) and Miguel Indurain (1995). Of these, Hinault is the only one to have finished either first or second in each Tour de France he finished. He remains the last French winner of the Tour de France.
Hinault was nicknamed Le Blaireau, as he would often don a hairband, thus resembling a shaving brush. In an interview in the French magazine Vélo, however, Hinault said the nickname had nothing to do with the animal. He said it was a local cyclists' way of saying "mate" or "buddy" in his youth – "How's it going, badger?" – and that it came to refer to him personally.

Airport security refers to the techniques and methods used in protecting passengers, staff and aircraft which use the airports from accidental/malicious harm, crime and other threats.
Large numbers of people pass through airports every day. This presents potential targets for terrorism and other forms of crime because of the number of people located in a particular location.[tpl]cite web|last=Rimmer |first=David |url=http://aviation.about.com/od/Terrorism/f/Does-Heightened-Airport-Security-Make-Us-Safer.htm |title=Does Heightened Airport Security Make Us Safer? |publisher=Aviation.about.com |date= |accessdate=October 26, 2011[/tpl] Similarly, the high concentration of people on large airliners, the potential high death rate with attacks on aircraft, and the ability to use a hijacked airplane as a lethal weapon may provide an alluring target for terrorism, whether or not they succeed due their high profile nature following the various attacks and attempts around the globe in recent years.
Airport security attempts to prevent any threats or potentially dangerous situations from arising or entering the country. If airport security does succeed in this, then the chances of any dangerous situations, illegal items or threats entering into both aircraft, country or airport are greatly reduced. As such, airport security serves several purposes: To protect the airport and country from any threatening events, to reassure the traveling public that they are safe and to protect the country and their people.

Belger of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration notes "The goal of aviation security is to prevent harm to aircraft, passengers, and crew, as well as support national security and counter-terrorism policy."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iwar.org.uk/comsec/resources/senate-biometrics/te111401st-belger.htm|title=Statement of Monte R.

Most are deciduous trees or shrubs, but a few species are nearly herbaceous perennial subshrubs, and a few of the woody species are evergreen. Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an involucre of large, typically white petal-like bracts, while others have more open clusters of petal-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are native throughout much of temperate and boreal Eurasia and North America, with China and Japan and the southeastern United States particularly rich in native species.
Species include the common dogwood Cornus sanguinea of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood Cornus nuttallii of western North America, the Kousa dogwood Cornus kousa of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), Cornus canadensis and Cornus suecica respectively.
Depending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine genera or subgenera; a broadly inclusive genus Cornus is accepted here, with four subgenera.

[[Scrubbird]]

CATEGORIES: Atrichornis, Atrichornithidae, Birds of Australia, Higher-level bird taxa restricted to Australia

Scrubbirds are shy, secretive, ground-dwelling birds  of the family Atrichornithidae. There are just two species. The Rufous Scrubbird is rare and very restricted in its range, and the Noisy Scrubbird is so rare that until 1961 it was thought to be extinct. Both are native to Australia.
The scrubbird family is ancient and is understood to be most closely related to the lyrebirds, and probably also the bowerbirds and treecreepers. All four families originated with the great corvid radiation of the Australia-New Guinea region.
The population of the Noisy Scrubbird was estimated at 40 to 45 birds in 1962. Conservation efforts succeeded in increasing the population to around 400 birds by the mid-1980s, and they have subsequently been reintroduced to several sites, but remain endangered.  As of 2002, the population had recovered to around 1,200 birds.

CATEGORIES: Daejeon, Special Cities and Metropolitan Cities of South Korea

Daejeon ([tpl]IPA-ko|tɛdʑʌn|lang|Ko-Daejeon.ogg[/tpl]) is South Korea's fifth largest metropolis. Daejeon had a population of over 1.5 million in 2010. 
Located in the center of South Korea, Daejeon serves as a hub of transportation and is at the crossroads of major transport routes. The capital Seoul is about 50 minutes away by high speed train.
Daejeon serves as an administration hub with the National Government Complex. The Korean administration in the 1980s decided to relocate some of its functions from Seoul, the national capital, to other cities. Currently, 12 national government offices including Korea Customs Service, Small and Medium Business Administration, Public Procurement Service, the National Statistical Office, Military Manpower Administration, Korea Forest Service, Cultural Heritage Administration, Korean Intellectual Property Office as well as Patent Court of Korea are located in Daejeon. Korail (Korea Railroad Corporation), K-water (Korea Water Resources Corporation) and KOMSCO (Korea Minting & Security Printing Corporation) are also headquartered in the city.
Daejeon has 18 universities including KAIST, Chungnam National University, Hanbat National University, Hannam University and UST (Korea University of Science and Technology). Daejeon has earned its name as "Asia's Silicon Valley" and "High technology city". 
The city hosted the Taejon Expo '93 and the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO) in 2000. Several important research institutes are based in the city.[tpl]cite journal|author=Song-Du-Bum|title=Scientific-industrial and nucleus administrative city, Daejeon|journal=GukTo(country)|date=(n. d.)| date=July 2000 |series=7|issue=225|page=70|url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/998530?Seq=4&Collection=0&q=%5B%EB%8C%80%EC%A0%84%20%EA%B3%BC%ED%95%99%C2%A7coldb%C2%A72%C2%A751%C2%A73%5D&Sort=1&SortType=desc&Page=1&PageSize=20&Multimedia=0[/tpl]
Daedeok Innopolis (Daedeok Research and Development Special Zone) is composed of 28 state-run research centers as well as 79 private research institutes with as many as 20,000 researchers. In addition, Daejeon established the WTA (World Technopolis Association) in 1998 with the view of realizing regional development through international cooperation with world science cities. Currently the WTA has grown to have 67 members from 32 countries, and it actively cooperates with many international organizations including UNESCO as its official consultative body.

The Pomatostomidae (Australo-Papuan or Australasian babblers, also known as pseudo-babblers) are small to medium-sized birds endemic to Australia-New Guinea. For many years, the Australo-Papuan babblers were classified, rather uncertainly, with the Old World babblers (Timaliidae), on the grounds of similar appearance and habits. More recent research, however, indicates that they are too basal to belong the Passerida - let alone the Sylvioidea where the Old World babblers are placed - and they are now classed as a separate family close to the Orthonychidae (logrunners). Five species in one genus are currently recognised, although the red-breasted subspecies rubeculus of the Grey-crowned Babbler may prove to be a separate species.

[[Testicular torsion]]
CATEGORIES: Medical emergencies, Testicle disorders, Pediatrics

Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord (from which the testicle is suspended) twists, cutting off the testicle's blood supply, a condition called ischemia.  The principal symptom is rapid onset of testicular pain. The most common underlying cause is a congenital malformation known as a "bell-clapper deformity" wherein the testis is inadequately affixed to the scrotum allowing it to move freely on its axis and susceptible to induced twisting of the cord and its vessels.
The diagnosis should usually be made based on the presenting signs and symptoms. An urgent ultrasound should only be done when the diagnosis is unclear. Irreversible ischemia begins around six hours after onset and emergency diagnosis and treatment is required within this time in order to minimize the risk of testicle loss.
It is most common just after birth and during puberty. It affects around 4 per 100,000 males less than 18 years per year.

Subbuteo is a group of table top games simulating team sports such as association football, cricket, both codes of rugby and hockey. The name is most closely associated with the football game, which for many years was marketed as "the replica of Association Football".
The "Subbuteo" name is derived from the neo-Latin scientific name Falco subbuteo (a bird of prey commonly known as the Eurasian hobby), after a trademark was not granted to its creator Peter Adolph (1916–1994) to call the game "Hobby".Hodkinson, Mark (2006-10-16).

True crime is a non-fiction literary and film genre in which the author examines an actual crime and details the actions of real people. The genre has been described as infotainment and as factional[tpl]cite book|author=Christiana Gregoriou|title=Language, Ideology and Identity in Serial Killer Narratives|year=2011|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-83265-3|page=2[/tpl]—a mix of fact and fiction.
The crimes most commonly include murder, with tales of serial killers dominating the genre[tpl]cite book|author=Ray Surette|title=Media, Crime and Criminal Justice: Images, Realities, and Policies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=geK4L1Q7fqAC&pg=PA92|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-80914-2|page=92[/tpl]—about 40% in a 2002 survey—, but true crime works have also focused on other subjects, for instance policemen memoirs, and more recently reality police TV shows. Depending on the writer, true crime can adhere strictly to well-established facts in journalistic fashion, or can be highly speculative. Some true crime works are "instant books" produced quickly to capitalize on popular demand; these have been described as "more than formulaic" and hyper-conventional.[tpl]cite book|author=Christiana Gregoriou|title=Language, Ideology and Identity in Serial Killer Narratives|year=2011|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-83265-3|page=59[/tpl] Others may reflect years of thoughtful research and inquiry and may have considerable literary merit. Still others revisit historic crimes (or alleged crimes) and propose solutions, such as books examining political assassinations, well-known unsolved murders, or the deaths of celebrities.

[[Leslie speaker]]

CATEGORIES: Loudspeakers, Instrument amplifiers, American inventions

The Leslie speaker is a combined amplifier and loudspeaker that modifies the sound of an instrument as well as amplifying it, by rotating sound waves. It is most commonly associated with the Hammond organ, though it was later used for the guitar and other instruments. A typical Leslie speaker contains an amplifier, treble and bass speaker, though specific components depend on the model. Control is achieved either by an external half-moon switch, or by a foot pedal, that alternates between two settings known as "chorale" and "tremolo".
The speaker is named after its inventor, Donald Leslie. Leslie began working in the late 1930s to get a speaker for a Hammond organ that had a closer emulation of a pipe or theatre organ, and discovered that rotating sound gave the best effect. Hammond was not interested in marketing or selling the speakers, so Leslie sold them himself as an add-on, targeting other organs as well as Hammond. The first speaker was made in 1941. The sound of the organ being played through his speakers received national radio exposure across the US, and it became a commercial and critical success as an essential part of any jazz organist. He eventually sold his business to CBS in 1965, who in turn sold it to Hammond in 1980. Today, the Hammond and Leslie brands are owned by Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation.
Because the Leslie is a sound modification device in its own right, various attempts have been made to emulate the effect using electronics. The Univox Uni-Vibe was used by a number of notable musicians, while the Neo Ventilator has received critical praise, and Hammond-Suzuki now manufacture their own simulator in a box.

Cinclosomatidae is a family of passerine birds native to Australia and nearby areas. It has a complicated taxonomic history and different authors vary in which birds they include in the family. It includes at least the quail-thrushes (Cinclosoma), 5 species of ground-dwelling birds found in Australia and New Guinea. The jewel-babblers (Ptilorrhoa), 4 species found in rainforest in New Guinea, also seem to belong in this family. 
The whipbirds and wedgebills (Psophodes and Androphobus) are often included in which case the name Psophodidae has priority as the name of the family. The Malaysian Rail-babbler (Eupetes macrocerus) was formerly sometimes placed in this family which would then be called Eupetidae.

[[Carousel]]

CATEGORIES: Carousels

A carousel (from French carrousel, from Italian carosello), or merry-go-round, is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The "seats" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gearwork to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music. This leads to one of the alternative names, the galloper. Other popular names are jumper, roundabout, horseabout and flying horses.
Carousels are commonly populated with horses, each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs (45 kg), but may include diverse varieties of mounts,[tpl]cite web | last = International Museum of Carousel Art | title = A Brief History of the Carousel | url = http://www.carouselmuseum.com/history.html | accessdate = 2008-07-24 [/tpl] like pigs, zebras, tigers, or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns. Sometimes, chairlike or benchlike seats are used as well, and occasionally mounts can be shaped like airplanes or cars.
Any rotating platform may also be called a carousel. In a playground, a roundabout or merry-go-round is usually a simple, child-powered rotating platform with bars or handles to which children can cling while riding. At an airport, rotating conveyors in the baggage claim area are often called carousels.Merriam-Webster online dictionary Various photographic slide projectors, notably those made by Kodak until 2004, used rotating trays or magazines called carousels to hold the slides and were often known as "carousel projectors".

The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving filter feeding shark and the largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12.65 m (41.50 ft) and a weight of more than  21.5 metric tons (47,000 lb), and unconfirmed reports of considerably larger whale sharks exist. Claims of individuals over 14 m (46 ft) long and weighing at least 30 mt (66,000 lb) are not uncommon. The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate, rivalling many of the largest dinosaurs in weight. It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the family, Rhincodontidae (called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984), which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The species originated about 60 million years ago.
The whale shark is found in tropical and warm oceans and lives in the open sea, with a lifespan of about 70 years. Whale sharks have very large mouths, and as filter feeders, they feed mainly on plankton. The BBC program Planet Earth filmed a whale shark feeding on a school of small fish. The same documentary showed footage of a whale shark timing its arrival to coincide with the mass spawning of fish shoals and feeding on the resultant clouds of eggs and sperm.Jurassic Shark (2000) documentary by Jacinth O'Donnell; broadcast on Discovery Channel, 5 August 2006

[[Maritime museum]]

CATEGORIES: Maritime museums, Types of museum

A maritime museum (sometimes nautical museum) is a museum specializing in the display of objects relating to ships and travel on large bodies of water. A subcategory of maritime museums are naval museums, which focus on navies and the military use of the sea.
The great prize of a maritime museum is a historic ship (or a replica) made accessible as a museum ship, but these are large and require a considerable budget to maintain, many museums preserve smaller or more fragile ships or partial ships within the museum buildings and most museums exhibit interesting pieces of ships (such as a figurehead or cannon), ship models, and miscellaneous small items like cutlery, uniforms, and so forth.
Ship modellers often have a close association with maritime museums; not only does the museum have items that help the modeller achieve better accuracy, but the museum provides a display space for models larger than will comfortably fit in a modeller's home; and of course the museum is happy to take a ship model as a donation. Museums will also commission models.
There are thousands of maritime museums in the world. Many belong to the International Congress of Maritime Museums (ICMM), which coordinates members' efforts to acquire, preserve, and display their material. There is a risk that too many maritime museums might dilute the experience for the public, while a poorly managed museeum might put other municipalities off the idea of hosting such a museum.[tpl]cite web| last =St. Jacques| first =Robert| title =Naval Warship Museums Problems And Potentials| publisher =Naval Weapons of the World| date =1 October 2000| url =http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/museum1.htm| accessdate = 23 December 2012[/tpl]
At 40 acres (162,000 m²), Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Connecticut can lay claim to the title of largest museum; it preserves not only a number of sailing ships, but also a large number of original seaport buildings, including a ship chandlery, sail loft, ropewalk, and so forth. However, the UK's National Maritime Museum in Greenwich is also a contender, with many items of great historical significance, such as the actual uniform worn by Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar.
A recent activity of maritime museums is to build replicas of ships, since there are few survivors that have not already been restored and put on display.

[[AC'97]]
CATEGORIES: Digital audio, Sound cards

AC'97 (Audio Codec '97; also MC'97 for Modem Codec '97) is an audio codec standard developed by Intel Architecture Labs in 1997. The standard was used in motherboards, modems, and sound cards.
Audio components integrated into chipsets consist of two component classes: an AC'97 digital controller (DC97), which is built into the southbridge of the chipset, and AC'97 audio and modem codecs, which are the analog components of the architecture.
AC'97 defines a high-quality, 16- or 20-bit audio architecture with surround sound support for the PC. AC'97 supports a 96 kHz sampling rate at 20-bit stereo resolution and a 48 kHz sampling rate at 20-bit stereo resolution for multichannel recording and playback. AC97 defines a maximum of 6 channels of analog audio output.
Integrated audio is implemented with the AC'97 Codec on the motherboard, a Communications and Networking Riser (CNR) card, or an audio/modem riser (AMR) card.
In 2004, Intel released Intel High Definition Audio (HD Audio) which is a successor that is not backward compatible with AC'97.[tpl]Citation|publisher=Intel Corporation|year=2010|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-specifications/high-definition-audio-specification.pdf|title=High Definition Audio Specification|version=Revision 1.0a|page=17|chapter=1.2.1 AC'97 Compatibility[/tpl]  HD Audio has the capability to define many more than AC'97's six output channels, but in practice most motherboards provide no more than 8 channels.

A political party platform or platform is a list of the values and actions which are supported by a political party or individual candidate, in order to appeal to the general public, for the ultimate purpose of garnering the general public's support and votes about complicated topics or issues. "Plank" is the term often given to the componentry of the political platform, in terms of the opinions and viewpoints about individual topics, as held by a party, person, or organization.  The word "plank" depicts a component of an overall political platform, as a metaphorical reference to a basic stage made out of boards or planks of wood.  The metaphor can return to its literal origin when public speaking or debates are actually held upon a physical platform.
A party platform is sometimes referred to as a manifesto[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto|title= Manifesto|publisher= Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl] or a political platform.

"You'll Never Walk Alone" is a show tune from the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel.
In the second act of the musical, Nettie Fowler, the cousin of the female protagonist Julie Jordan, sings "You'll Never Walk Alone" to comfort and encourage Julie when her husband, Billy Bigelow, the male lead, kills himself to avoid capture during a failed robbery. It is reprised in the final scene to encourage a graduation class of which Louise (Billy and Julie's daughter) is a member. The now invisible Billy, who has been granted the chance to return to Earth for one day in order to redeem himself, watches the ceremony and is able to silently motivate the unhappy Louise to join in the song.
The song is also sung at association football clubs around the world, where it is performed by a mass chorus of supporters on match day; this tradition began at Liverpool Football Club in the early 1960s and has continued to be a signature tradition to present day.[tpl]YouTube|8AXxf52k0cE|Liverpool vs. Leeds United[/tpl], F.A.

One year later, when Liverpool faced Leeds in the cup final, the travelling Kop sang the same song and match commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme commended the 'Liverpool signature tune'."

The Chevrolet Impala is a full-size sedan built by the Chevrolet division of General Motors introduced for the 1958 model year. Deriving its name from the South African antelope, Chevrolet's most expensive passenger model through 1965 had become the best-selling automobile in the United States, competing against the Ford Galaxie 500 and the Plymouth Fury when full-size models dominated the market. The Impala was distinguished for many years by its symmetrical triple taillights. The Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for the 1965 model year becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Bel Air and Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-size model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, Impala was revived as a muscular 5.7-liter V8–powered version of the Caprice Classic sedan. In 2000, the Impala was re-introduced again as a mainstream front-wheel drive full-size sedan.The editors of Consumer Guide As of February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked number one among Affordable Large Cars in U.S. News & World Report's rankings.http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/rankings/Affordable-Large-Cars/ As of 2014, the Impala Limited is sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The Impala is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East.
Ed Cole, Chevrolet's chief engineer in the late 1950s, defined the Impala as a "prestige car within the reach of the average American citizen."

John Hunyadi ([tpl]lang-hu|Hunyadi János[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ro|Ioan de Hunedoara[/tpl]; [tpl]circa[/tpl] 1406–11 August 1456) was a  leading Hungarian military and political figure in Central and Southeastern Europe during the 15th century. According to most contemporary sources, he was son of a noble family of Romanian ancestry. He mastered his military skills on the southern borderlands of the Kingdom of Hungary that were exposed to Ottoman attacks. Appointed voivode of Transylvania and head of a number of southern counties, he assumed responsibility for the defense of the frontiers in 1441.
Hunyadi adopted the Hussite method of using wagons for military purposes. He employed professional soldiers, but also mobilized local peasantry against invaders. These innovations contributed to his earliest successes against the Ottoman troops who were plundering the southern marches in the early 1440s. Although defeated in the battle of Varna in 1444 and in the second battle of Kosovo in 1448, his successful "Long Campaign" across the Balkan Mountains in 1443–44 and defence of Belgrade/Nándorfehérvár in 1456, against troops led personally by the Sultan established his reputation as a great general. The bells of Catholic and older Protestant churches are daily rung at noon to commemorate the Belgrade victory, although the pope had ordered this in advance, a week before the siege, in order to encourage the soldiers fighting for Christendom.
John Hunyadi was also an eminent statesman. He actively took part in the civil war between the partisans of Wladislas I and the minor Ladislaus V, two claimants to the throne of Hungary in the early 1440s, on behalf on the former. Popular among the lesser nobility, the Diet of Hungary appointed him, in 1445, as one of the seven "captains of the realm" responsible for the administration of state affairs until Ladislaus V (by that time unanimously accepted as king) came of age. The next Diet went even further, electing Hunyadi as sole regent with the title of governor. When he resigned from this office in 1452, the sovereign awarded him with the first hereditary title (perpetual count of Beszterce/Bistrița) in the Kingdom of Hungary. He had by this time become one of the wealthiest landowners in the kingdom, and preserved his influence in the Diet up until his death.
This Athleta Christi ("Christ's Champion"), as Pope Pius II referred to him, died some three weeks after his triumph at Nándorfehérvár/Belgrade, falling to an epidemic that had broken out in the crusader camp. However, his victories over the Turks prevented them from invading the Kingdom of Hungary for more than 60 years. His fame was a decisive factor in the election of his son, Matthias Corvinus, as king by the Diet of 1457. Hunyadi is still a popular historic figure among Hungarians, Romanians, Serbians, Bulgarians and other nations of the region, many[tpl]howmany|date=January 2014[/tpl] of them even considering him as their own hero.

Ladislaus Hunyadi or László Hunyadi (1431Bánhegyi 2008, p. 17. – March 16, 1457) was a Hungarian statesman.
Ladislaus Hunyadi was the elder of the two sons of John Hunyadi, voivode of Transylvania and later regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, and Elizabeth Szilágyi. He was the older brother of Matthias Hunyadi, who would later became the king of Hungary. At a very early age he accompanied his father in his campaigns. After the battle of Kosovo (1448) he was left for a time, as a hostage for his father, in the hands of George Brankovic (1427–1456), despot of Serbia. In 1452 he was a member of the deputation which went to Vienna to receive back the Hungarian king Ladislaus V. In 1453 he was already ban of Croatia and Dalmatia.Engel 1996, p. 27. At the diet of Buda (1455) he resigned all his dignities, because of the accusations of Ulrich II of Celje and the other enemies of his house, but a reconciliation was ultimately patched up and he was betrothed to Maria, the daughter of the palatine, Ladislaus Garai. 
After his father's death in 1456, he was declared by his enemy Ulrich II of Celje (now Captain General of Hungary with significant power), responsible for the debts alleged to be owing by the elder Hunyadi to the state; but he defended himself so ably at the diet of Futak (October 1456) that Ulrich II of Celje feigned a reconciliation, promising to protect the Hunyadis on condition that they first surrendered all the royal castles entrusted to them. A beginning was to be made with the fortress of Nándorfehérvár (now Belgrade, Serbia) of which Hunyadi was commandant.Engel 1996, p. 104. While admitting Ladislaus V and Ulrich, Hunyadi excluded their army of mercenaries. On the following morning (November 9, 1456) Ulrich II of Celje was killed by Hunyadi's men in unclear circumstances. Later Hunyadi served as master of the horse ([tpl]lang-hu|lovászmester[/tpl]) until his death.Engel 1996, p. 43.
The terrified young king, thereupon pardoned Hunyadi, and at a subsequent interview with his mother at Temesvár swore that he would protect the whole family. As a pledge of his sincerity he appointed Hunyadi lord treasurer and captain-general of the kingdom. Suspecting no evil, Hunyadi accompanied the king to Buda.  But on arriving there he was arrested on a charge of plotting against the king, condemned to death without the observance of any legal formalities, and beheaded on the 16 March  1457.
He is the protagonist of a popular Hungarian opera, Hunyadi László by Ferenc Erkel.

In the arts, vanitas is a type of symbolic work of art especially associated with still life painting in Flanders and the Netherlands in the 16th and 17th centuries, though also common in other places and periods.  The Latin word means "vanity" and loosely translated corresponds to the meaninglessness of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. Ecclesiastes [tpl]bibleref2-nb|Ecclesiastes|1:2;12:8|KJV[/tpl] from the Bible is often quoted in conjunction with this term.[tpl]cite web|last=Esaak|first=Shelley|title=vanitas painting|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/glossary/g/v_vanitas.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=March 30, 2012[/tpl] The Vulgate (Latin translation of the Bible) renders the verse as Vanitas vanitatum omnia vanitas.[tpl]Bibleref2c|Eccl.|1:2;12:8|VULGATE[/tpl] The verse is translated as Vanity of vanities; all is vanity by the King James Version of the Bible. Vanity is used here in its older (especially pre-14th century) sense of "futility".Oxford English Dictionary, on vanity Utterly meaningless!

The Khajuraho Group of Monuments in Khajuraho, a town in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, located in Chhatarpur District, about [tpl]convert|620|km|mi|0[/tpl] southeast of New Delhi, is  one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. Khajuraho has the largest group of medieval Hindu and Jain temples, famous for their erotic sculptures.
Between 950 and 1150, the Chandela monarchs built these temples when the Tantric tradition may have been accepted. In the days before the Mughal conquests, when boys lived in hermitages, following brahmacharya until they became men, they could learn about the world and prepare themselves to become householders through examining these sculptures and the worldly desires they depicted.Khajuraho
The name Khajuraho, ancient "Kharjuravāhaka", is derived from the Sanskrit words kharjura = date palm and vāhaka = "one who carries". Locals living in the Khajuraho village always knew about and kept up the temples as best as they could. They were pointed out to the English in the late 19th century when the jungles had taken a toll on the monuments. In the 19th century, British engineer T.S. Burt arrived in the area, followed by General Alexander Cunningham. Cunningham put Khajuraho on the world map when he explored the site on behalf of the Archaeological Survey of India and described what he found in glowing terms. The Khajuraho Group of Monuments has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is considered to be one of the "seven wonders" of India.

[[Muon-catalyzed fusion]]
CATEGORIES: Nuclear fusion

Muon-catalyzed fusion (μCF) is a process allowing nuclear fusion to take place at temperatures significantly lower than the temperatures required for thermonuclear fusion, even at room temperature or lower. It is one of the few known ways of catalyzing nuclear fusion reactions.
Muons are unstable subatomic particles. They are similar to electrons, but are about 207 times more massive. If a muon replaces one of the electrons in a hydrogen molecule, the nuclei are consequently drawn 207 times closer together than in a normal molecule. When the nuclei are this close together, the probability of nuclear fusion is greatly increased, to the point where a significant number of fusion events can happen at room temperature.
Current techniques for creating large numbers of muons require large amounts of energy, larger than the amounts produced by the catalyzed nuclear fusion reactions.  This prevents it from becoming a practical power source.  Moreover, each muon has about a 1% chance of "sticking" to the alpha particle produced by the nuclear fusion of a deuterium with a tritium, removing the "stuck" muon from the catalytic cycle, meaning that each muon can only catalyze at most a few hundred deuterium tritium nuclear fusion reactions.  So, these two factors, of muons being too expensive to make and then sticking too easily to alpha particles, limit muon-catalyzed fusion to a laboratory curiosity. To create useful room-temperature muon-catalyzed fusion reactors would need a cheaper, more efficient muon source and/or a way for each individual muon to catalyze many more fusion reactions.
Muon-catalyzed fusion is a well established and understood fusion mechanism. Although it's also a relatively low temperature process, it is distinct from cold fusion.

[[Kobayashi Maru]]
CATEGORIES: Dilemmas, Star Trek terminology

The Kobayashi Maru is a test in the fictional Star Trek universe. It is a Starfleet training exercise designed to test the character of cadets in the command track at Starfleet Academy. The Kobayashi Maru test was first depicted in the opening scene of the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and also appears in the 2009 film Star Trek. In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Dr. McCoy referenced the test as an example of the no-win scenario that he and Captain Kirk were facing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccdump.org/StarTrekVI.htm |title=The Computer Core Dump - Star Trek VI Script |publisher=Ccdump.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl]  The test's name is occasionally used among Star Trek fans or those familiar with the series to describe a no-win scenario, or a solution that involves redefining the problem.
The notional primary goal of the exercise is to rescue the civilian vessel Kobayashi Maru in a simulated battle with the Klingons. The disabled ship is located in the Klingon Neutral Zone, and any Starfleet ship entering the zone would be in violation of the Organian Peace Treaty. The approaching cadet crew must decide whether to attempt rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew – endangering their own ship and lives – or leave the Kobayashi Maru to certain destruction. If the cadet chooses to attempt rescue, the simulation is designed to guarantee that the ship is destroyed with the loss of all crew members.

The Congress of the Philippines (Filipino: Kongreso ng Pilipinas) is the national legislature of the Republic of the Philippines. It is a bicameral body consisting of the Senate (upper chamber), and the House of Representatives (lower chamber) although commonly in the Philippines the term congress refers to the latter. [tpl]cite web|title=Article VI: THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT|url=http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-vi/|work=Philippines Official Gazette|accessdate=31 May 2013[/tpl] 
The Senate is composed of 24 senators [tpl]cite web|title=The Legislative Branch|url=http://www.gov.ph/about/gov/the-legislative-branch/|work=Philippines Official Gazette|publisher=Philippines Official Gazette|accessdate=31 May 2013[/tpl]  half of which are elected every three years. Each senator, therefore, serves a total of six years. The senators are elected by the whole electorate and do not represent any geographical district.
The House of Representatives is composed of a maximum of 250 congressmen. There are two types of congressmen: the district and the sectoral representatives. The district congressmen represent a particular geographical district of the country. All provinces in the country are composed of at least one congressional district. Several cities also have their own congressional districts, with some composed of two or more representatives. [tpl]cite web|title=Article VI: THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT|url=http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-vi/|work=Philippines Official Gazette|accessdate=31 May 2013[/tpl]
The sectoral congressmen represent the minority sectors of the population. This enables these minority groups to be represented in the Congress, when they would otherwise not be represented properly through district representation.  Also known as party-list representatives, sectoral congressmen represent labor unions, rights groups, and other organizations.[tpl]cite web|title=Article VI: THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT|url=http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-vi/|work=Philippines Official Gazette|accessdate=31 May 2013[/tpl]
The Constitution provides that the Congress shall convene for its regular session every year beginning on the 4th Monday of July. A regular session can last until thirty days before the opening of its next regular session in the succeeding year. The President may, however, call special sessions which are usually held between regular legislative sessions to handle emergencies or urgent matters.

Raoul Vaneigem ([tpl]IPA-nl|raˈul vɑnˈɛiɣəm|lang[/tpl]; born 1934) is a Belgian writer and philosopher. He was born in Lessines (Hainaut, Belgium). After studying romance philology at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel) from 1952 to 1956, he participated in the Situationist International from 1961 to 1970. He currently resides in Belgium and is the father of four children.
Vaneigem and Guy Debord were two of the principal theoreticians of the Situationist movement. Vaneigem's slogans frequently made it onto the walls of Paris during the May 1968 uprisings. His most famous book, and the one that contains the most famous slogans, is The Revolution of Everyday Life (in French Traité de savoir-vivre à l'usage des jeunes générations).
According to the website nothingness.org,  "The voice of Raoul Vaneigem was one of the strongest of the Situationists. Counterpoised to Guy Debord's political and polemic style, Vaneigem offered a more poetic and spirited prose. The Revolution of Everyday Life (Traité de savoir-vivre à l'usage des jeunes générations), published in the same year as Debord's The Society of the Spectacle, helped broaden and balance the presentation of the SI's theories and practices. One of the longest SI members, and frequent editor of the journal Internationale Situationniste, Vaneigem finally left the SI in November 1970, citing their failures as well as his own in his letter of resignation. Soon after, Debord issued a typically scathing response denouncing both Vaneigem and his critique of the Situationist International."www.nothingness.org, which also has additional biographical material. See also www.notbored.org. 
After leaving the Situationist movement Vaneigem wrote a series of polemical books defending the idea of a free and self-regulating social order. He frequently made use of pseudonyms, including "Julienne de Cherisy," "Robert Desessarts," "Jules-François Dupuis," "Tristan Hannaniel," "Anne de Launay," and "Michel Thorgal." Recently he has been an advocate of a new type of strike, in which service and transportation workers provide services for free and refuse to collect payment or fares.
In 2009 Vaneigem was interviewed by Hans Ulrich Obrist for e-flux.In Conversation with Raoul Vaneigem accessed 8 August 2009

His acting roles include "Rahikainen" in Aki Kaurismäki's Crime and Punishment and "Pekka" in another Aki Kaurismäki film Calamari Union. In Calamari Union, Pekka appears for most of the film to gibber in English in an apparent schizophrenic delusion about his days as a soldier of fortune. This viewer interpretation is subverted towards the end of the movie, as a group of Latin American freedom fighters wreak their vengeance by shooting him like a dog.
As a stand-up comic, his shtick has largely been that of the balding middle aged man going through an identity crisis.
He lives in Helsinki with his wife, Ulla-Maija, and 2 children, son Toivo Toikka, who plays in band called "Security" and acts in amateur movies, and daughter named Tuuli.

[[Predicate (mathematical logic)]]

CATEGORIES: Predicate logic, Propositional calculus, Basic concepts in set theory, Fuzzy logic, Mathematical logic

In mathematics, a predicate is commonly understood to be a Boolean-valued function P: X→ {true, false}, called the predicate on X. However, predicates have many different uses and interpretations in mathematics and logic, and their precise definition, meaning and use will vary from theory to theory. So, for example, when a theory defines the concept of a relation, then a predicate is simply the characteristic function or the indicator function of a relation.  However, not all theories have relations, or are founded on set theory, and so one must be careful with the proper definition and semantic interpretation of a predicate.

In anatomy, the foramen magnum (Latin: "great hole") is a large opening in the occipital bone of the cranium.  It is one of the several oval or circular apertures in the base of the skull (the foramina), through which the medulla oblongata (an extension of the spinal cord) enters and exits the skull vault.
Apart from the transmission of the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the foramen magnum transmits the vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, the membrana tectoria and alar ligaments. It also transmits the spinal component of the accessory nerve into the cranial fossa.

Mac the Knife was the pen name (inspired by the homophonous well-known song "Mack the Knife") of an anonymous gossip columnist for the (now defunct) Apple Macintosh-focused trade publication MacWEEK.  Mac the Knife was always written by a single writer, but the identity of that writer changed more than once over the long publishing history of MacWEEK."Over the years, the column was penned by a number of anonymous writers, whose identities were closely guarded and frequently speculated on."

During the column's heyday, the trophy mugs were occasionally sent randomly to Apple employees in order to obscure the true leakers."Raines Cohen, who worked as a reporter at the MacWeek trade paper, recalled how the staff of the paper would occasionally send "Mac-the-Knife" coffee mugs to random Apple executives. The rationale was that having so many mugs spread throughout the office would make it harder for Apple to figure out which employees were actually talking to the publication." John Markoff, "To Cut Online Chatter, Apple Goes to Court," New York Times March 21, 2005.
MacWEEK's party at Macworld Conference & Expo was named for this fictional character.  The party was often more secretive than Apple's own parties, to protect the identity of the Knife.
During the latter part of the Knife's career, his or her columns appeared on a website called The Electric Knife, which was published by Mac Publishing at mactheknife.com, but after the Knife's retirement, the domain expired. For some time, it was not associated with the Knife. Recently, it has been pointed at the defunct MacEdition homepage.
Today, none of the former Mac the Knife columnists write using this name. The columnist himself moved to MacEdition in 2000, penning a column called the "Naked Mole Rat Report" (an allusion to a phrase used in one of the Knife's last columns).  The column seems to have ceased publication in 2003. Some speculate that Robert Hess or former editor Matthew Rothenberg (of the online publication eWEEK) might have been the columnist at one time.John Gruber's Daring Fireball site quotes MWJ as having the "scoop" identifying Rothenberg as the former Mac the Knife, but it is not clear whether the MWJ writer was speculating or had inside knowledge of the Knife's identity. A former employee adds that while Rothenberg might have later taken over the column at some point, he certainly wasn't the original... as he joined the mag long afterwards. She can also confirm that it wasn't Hess ;-) [tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2013[/tpl]

[[Drift migration]]
CATEGORIES: Bird migration, Ornithological terminology

Drift migration is the phenomenon in which migrating birds are blown off course by the winds at the time they are in flight. It is more likely to happen to birds heading south in autumn because the large numbers of inexperienced young birds are less able to compensate than the adults heading north in spring.{http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/Suppl_1/S8}
Drift is assisted by disorientating conditions such as mist or drizzle, and can result in large numbers of birds arriving together in an area in which they are not normally seen.  In the UK this is called a fall, while in the U.S. it's known as a fallout, though in the latter case, it need not involve vagrant birds.
An example would be an east wind in September blowing Scandinavian migrants such as Bluethroats, Wrynecks, and the continental race of Robin onto the east coast of England and Scotland, leading to temporary concentrations of these species at headlands like Spurn.

[[Romance (love)]]
CATEGORIES: Love, Romance, Philosophy of love, Emotions

Romance is the expressive and pleasurable feeling from an emotional attraction towards another person associated with love.
In the context of romantic love relationships, romance usually implies an expression of one's strong romantic love, or one's deep and strong emotional desires to connect with another person intimately or romantically. Historically, the term "romance" originates with the medieval ideal of chivalry as set out in its Romance literature.
Humans have a natural inclination to form bonds with one another through social interactions, be it through verbal communication or nonverbal gestures. With some individuals, these social interactions can span beyond what one would typically view as a platonic relationship. Positive romantic relationships are a crucial part of society in that not only do these relations affect those that are in participation, but they can also have an influence on those that are in close vicinity[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl].
Sometimes, what may be viewed as tradition does not allow for as much of a range that is realistically present among those that are aiming for a healthy positive relationship. Some traditional approaches place certain responsibilities or unsaid assumptions on each party, where each person is expected to act a certain way simply because that's how it's supposed to be. With positive psychology, there seems to be a push for a more equal division of responsibilities regardless of sex, gender, or any other circumstances. Each individual can learn about love on more than one level; there is an acknowledgment of the word having multiple meanings, as well as relationships having multiple outcomes, as a result of previous attachment patterns in other social domains (i.e. parenting).

Transpower New Zealand Limited (TPNZ) is the state-owned enterprise responsible for electric power transmission in New Zealand.  It performs two major functions in the New Zealand electricity market.  As the owner of the National Grid it provides the infrastructure of electric power transmission that allows consumers to have access to generation from a wide range of sources, and enables competition in the wholesale electricity market; as System Operator it manages the real-time operation of the grid and the physical operation of the electricity market. 
Transpower was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ) in 1987.  In 1994 it was separated from ECNZ and corporatised to become a state-owned enterprise with its own board of directors and Ministerial shareholders, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises. The New Zealand Treasury's Commercial Operations group (formerly the Crown Ownership Monitoring Unit) monitors the performance of Transpower on behalf of the shareholding Ministers.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.treasury.govt.nz/commercial/portfolio-entities/sector/energy-utilities/transpower-new-zealand/ |title= Transpower New Zealand Ltd |publisher= The Treasury |accessdate=15 March 2014[/tpl]

[[Pineal gland]]
CATEGORIES: Glands, Endocrine system, Human head and neck, Sleep physiology, Circadian rhythm

The pineal gland, also known as the pineal body, conarium or epiphysis cerebri, is a small endocrine gland in the vertebrate brain. It produces the serotonin derivative, melatonin, a hormone that affects the modulation of sleep patterns in the circadian rhythms and seasonal functions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Macchi M, Bruce J |title= Human pineal physiology and functional significance of melatonin |journal=Front Neuroendocrinol |volume=25 |issue=3–4 |pages=177–95 |year=2004 |pmid=15589268 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2004.08.001[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Arendt J, Skene DJ |title=Melatonin as a chronobiotic |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=25–39 |year=2005 |pmid=15649736 |quote=Exogenous melatonin has acute sleepiness-inducing and temperature-lowering effects during 'biological daytime', and when suitably timed (it is most effective around dusk and dawn) it will shift the phase of the human circadian clock (sleep, endogenous melatonin, core body temperature, cortisol) to earlier (advance phase shift) or later (delay phase shift) times. |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2004.05.002[/tpl] Its shape resembles a tiny pine cone (hence its name), and it is located in the epithalamus, near the centre of the brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join.
Nearly all vertebrate species possess a pineal gland.  The most important exception is the hagfish, which is often thought of as the most primitive type of vertebrate.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vernadakis AJ, Bemis WE, Bittman EL |title=Localization and partial characterization of melatonin receptors in amphioxus, hagfish, lamprey, and skate |journal=Gen. Comp.

The lamprey (considered almost as primitive as the hagfish), however, does possess one.  A few more developed vertebrates, including the alligator, lack pineal glands because they have been lost over the course of evolution.[tpl]cite journal |author=Erlich SS, Apuzzo ML |title=The pineal gland: anatomy, physiology, and clinical significance |journal=J.

The gland has been compared to the photoreceptive, so-called third parietal eye present in the epithalamus of some animal species, which is also called the pineal eye. René Descartes believed the pineal gland to be the "principal seat of the soul" and viewed it as the third eye.

[[Dummy variable (statistics)]]
CATEGORIES: Econometrics, Regression analysis, Statistical models, Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics)

In statistics and econometrics, particularly in regression analysis, a dummy variable (also known as an indicator variable, design variable, Boolean indicator, categorical variable, binary variable, or qualitative variable) is one that takes the value 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect that may be expected to shift the outcome.Draper, N.R.; Smith, H. (1998) Applied Regression Analysis, Wiley. ISBN 0-471-17082-8 (Chapter 14)[tpl]cite web|title=Interpreting the Coefficients on Dummy Variables|url=http://users.rcn.com/alancm/pp605/Interpreting_Dummy_Coefficients.pdf[/tpl] Dummy variables are used as devices to sort data into mutually exclusive categories (such as smoker/non-smoker, etc.).[tpl]cite book|last=Gujarati|first=Damodar N|title=Basic econometrics|year=2003|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-233542-4|pages=1002|url=http://www.mhhe.com/gujarati4e[/tpl]  For example, in econometric time series analysis, dummy variables may be used to indicate the occurrence of wars or major strikes. A dummy variable can thus be thought of as a truth value represented as a numerical value 0 or 1 (as is sometimes done in computer programming).
Dummy variables are "proxy" variables or numeric stand-ins for qualitative facts in a regression model. In regression analysis, the dependent variables may be influenced not only by quantitative variables (income, output, prices, etc.), but also by qualitative variables (gender, religion, geographic region, etc.). A dummy independent variable (also called a dummy explanatory variable) which for some observation has a value of 0 will cause that variable's coefficient to have no role in influencing the dependent variable, while when the dummy takes on a value 1 its coefficient acts to alter the intercept. For example, suppose Gender is one of the qualitative variables relevant to a regression. Then, female and male would be the categories included under the Gender variable. If female is arbitrarily assigned the value of 1, then male would get the value 0.[tpl]cite web|last=, Asha Sharma|first=Susan Garavaglia|title=A SMART GUIDE TO DUMMY VARIABLES: FOUR APPLICATIONS AND A MACRO|url=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/library/nesug98/p046.pdf[/tpl] Then the intercept (the value of the dependent variable if all other explanatory variables hypothetically took on the value zero) would be the constant term for males but would be the constant term plus the coefficient of the gender dummy in the case of females.
Dummy variables are used frequently in time series analysis with regime switching, seasonal analysis and  qualitative data applications. Dummy variables are involved in studies for economic forecasting, bio-medical studies, credit scoring, response modelling, etc. Dummy variables may be incorporated in traditional regression methods or newly developed modeling paradigms.

[[Helge Rosvaenge]]
CATEGORIES: 1897 births, 1972 deaths, Operatic tenors, Danish opera singers, Danish tenors

Helge Rosvaenge (Roswaenge, Rosvænge), Helge Anton Rosenvinge Hansen, (August 29, 1897[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]June 17, 1972)  was a famous Danish operatic tenor whose career was centred on Germany and Austria, before, during and after World War II.
Rosvaenge was born in Copenhagen. He made his debut at  Neustrelitz as Don Jose in Carmen in 1921. Engagements followed at Altenburg, Basle, Cologne (1927–30) and the Berlin State Opera, where he was leading tenor from 1930 to 1944, being especially distinguished in the Italian repertory. He sang regularly, too, at the Vienna State Opera (from 1936) and in Munich. Rosvaenge also appeared at the Salzburg Festival, making his debut there in Der Rosenkavalier. Other roles which he performed at Salzburg between 1933 and 1939 were Tamino in The Magic Flute, Huon in Oberon and Florestan in Fidelio. His London debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, occurred in 1938, as Florestan.
Rosvaenge sang Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival in 1934 and 1936 but otherwise avoided the Wagnerian repertory, except on recordings.
After World War II Rosvaenge divided his time between Berlin and Vienna. He continued to sing until May 30, 1959 (when he gave what was billed as his farewell concert at Vienna's Great Musikvereinssaal), appearing as Calàf, Radamès and Manrico. His voice showed little sign of age; it was still warm and sonorous throughout its range, and brilliant and lustrous in its upper register. Indeed, Rosvaenge, could deliver an easy and full-blooded high D during his vocal prime.  This can be heard in one of his most celebrated recordings, the Postillon's Song ("Mes amis, écoutez l'histoire") from Le postillon de Lonjumeau by Adolphe Adam.
Rosvaenge appeared in a wide spectrum of roles ranging from Mozart to Weber, from Verdi to Puccini. He sang with "a steely voice, brilliant high notes and insistent declamation throughout its scale" which was "brilliant and lustrous in its top register", according to Luiz Eduardo Goncalves Gabarra. Rosvaenge was equally impressive as Andrea Chénier and was also an acclaimed and exciting Radamès and Otello: he was often heard in this latter role on German radio.
Rosvaenge conducted a tour of the USA prior to his retirement. He died in Munich, aged 74.

[[International Securities Identification Number]]
CATEGORIES: Financial regulation, Security identifier types

An International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) uniquely identifies a security. Its structure is defined in ISO 6166. Securities for which ISINs are issued include bonds, commercial paper, stocks and warrants. The ISIN code is a 12-character alpha-numerical code that does not contain information characterizing financial instruments but serves for uniform identification of a security at trading and settlement.
Securities to which ISINs can be issued include debt securities, shares, options, derivatives and futures. The ISIN identifies the security, not the exchange (if any) on which it trades; it is not a ticker symbol. For instance, Daimler AG stock trades through almost 30 trading platforms and exchanges worldwide, and is priced in five different currencies; it has the same ISIN on each, though not the same ticker symbol. ISIN cannot specify a particular trading location in this case, and another identifier, typically MIC (Market Identification Code) or the three-letter exchange code, will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN. The Currency of the trade will also be required to uniquely identify the instrument using this method.

AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) is an international direct action advocacy group working to impact the lives of people with AIDS (PWAs) and the AIDS pandemic to bring about legislation, medical research and treatment and policies to ultimately bring an end to the disease by mitigating loss of health and lives.ACT/UP New York
ACT UP was effectively formed in March 1987 at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in New York. Larry Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. Kramer spoke out against the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), which he perceived as politically impotent. Kramer had co-founded the GMHC but had resigned from its board of directors in 1983. According to Douglas Crimp, Kramer posed a question to the audience: "Do we want to start a new organization devoted to political action?" The answer was "a resounding yes." Approximately 300 people met two days later to form ACT UP.Crimp, Douglas.  AIDS Demographics. Bay Press, 1990.

[tpl]Nihongo|Lupin III|ルパン三世|Rupan Sansei[/tpl], also written as Lupin the Third or Lupin the 3rd, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Monkey Punch. It follows the escapades of master thief Arsène Lupin III, the grandson of Arsène Lupin, the gentleman thief of Maurice Leblanc's series of novels.
The Lupin III manga, which first appeared in Weekly Manga Action on August 10, 1967, spawned a media franchise that includes numerous manga, four anime television series, five animated feature films, two live-action films, three OVAs, yearly television specials since 1989, music CDs, video games, and a musical. Many different companies have owned the English-language distribution rights to various Lupin III properties at various times, with just the first two movies having been released by over 10 companies alone. Tokyopop acquired the license to the original manga in 2002, and later the second series in 2004. Funimation Entertainment purchased the rights to several of the television specials and films in 2002, and the fourth television series in 2012. Geneon licensed and dubbed 79 episodes of the second television series, 26 of which were broadcast on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim during 2003. Discotek Media licensed the entire first television series and the live-action film, they also own the rights to several other Lupin titles, including some previously released by other companies.
Over forty years after its creation, Lupin III remains popular, with several different manga series currently being published, yearly television specials and a fourth anime series which aired in 2012. For several years, issues relating to the copyright of Maurice Leblanc's intellectual property meant that the Lupin name was removed from its releases outside of Japan, usually changed to "Rupan" or "Wolf". However, the copyright has since expired, allowing foreign releases to use the Lupin name.

The seven dirty words (or "Filthy Words") are seven English-language words that American comedian George Carlin first listed in 1972 in his monologue "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television".[tpl]cite web |author=Doug Linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/filthywords.html |title=Filthy Words by George Carlin |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl] The words are: shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.
At the time, the words were considered highly inappropriate and unsuitable for broadcast on the public airwaves in the United States, whether radio or television. As such, they were avoided in scripted material, and bleep censored in the rare cases in which they were used; broadcast standards differ in different parts of the world, then and now, although most of the words on Carlin's original list remain taboo on American broadcast television as of 2014. The list was not an official enumeration of forbidden words, but rather was compiled by Carlin. Nonetheless, a radio broadcast featuring these words led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that helped establish the extent to which the federal government could regulate speech on broadcast television and radio in the United States.

Based on the traditional ghawazi   and other folk styles and formed by western influences such as  marching bands, the Russian ballet, Latin dance, etc., this hybrid style was performed in the cabarets of interbellum period Egypt and in early Egyptian cinema.
The style is often considered the classical style of belly dance, although that term historically referred to the ghawazi style, and today covers a much wider range of Middle Eastern dance as well as Western styles developed from them.

Born in Kigali, Rwanda to a Rwandan mother and a French father. Rolland and her family fled the country due to safety concerns with the Rwandan Genocide instigating, especially since her mother is Tutsi. In 1990 they moved to the neighboring country of Burundi. With the growing unrest that led to the Burundi Civil War, they emigrated to France in 1994. At the age 13 with her family, Rolland was settled in Burgundy in the small town of Cluny.
In October 1999, Sonia Rolland won the "Miss Burgundy" beauty contest that allowed her to compete for the Miss France 2000 title and at the age of 18 she was the first woman of African descent to win. At the Miss Universe 2000 pageant, which took place in Cyprus, Rolland was a top 10 semi-finalist, placing 9th overall.
Rolland once lived in Paris with Christophe Rocancourt, an impostor, confidence man and gentleman thief who scammed affluent people by masquerading as a French member of the Rockefeller family. They had a daughter together, named Tess. They announced their split on April 10, 2008. Rolland has another daughter, Kahina, with actor and director Jalil Lespert, who is her partner since 2009
At twenty years old after serious acting lessons with renowned actor and businessman Alain Delon, Rolland embarked for a new career as an actress. Following an unsettling incident during which she was attacked in the metro she took kickboxing classes that later proved advantageous as they helped her land the role of Lea in the television series Lea parker that ran for two seasons from 2004 to 2006.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411009/

"Beautiful Dreamer" is a parlor song by Stephen Foster (1826–1864). It was published after Foster's death in March 1864 by Wm. A. Pond & Co. of New York. The first edition states on its title page that it is "the last song ever written by Stephen C. Foster. Composed but a few days prior to his death."Catalogue of first editions of Stephen C. Foster (1826–1864). Library of Congress. p. 9. However, Carol Kimball, the author of Song, points out that the first edition's copyright is dated 1862, which suggests, she writes, that the song was composed and readied for publication two years before Foster's death. There are at least 20 songs, she observes, that claim to be Foster's last, and it is unknown which is indeed his last. The song is set in 9/8 time with a broken chord accompaniment.Carol Kimball. Song: a guide to art song style and literature.  Hal Leonard Corporation. p. 248.Michael Saffle. 2000. Perspectives on American music, 1900-1950 Taylor & Francis. p. 382.
The song tells of a lover serenading a "Beautiful Dreamer" who is oblivious of worldly cares and may actually be dead. Foster's works feature many dead young women, including his sister Charlotte and "Jeanie". Helen Lightner writes, "This sentimental ballad is folk-like in character with its repetitious but lovely melody and its basic harmonic accompaniment… The quiet and calm of this mood is portrayed by the monotony of the arpeggiated accompaniment, by the repetitiveness of the melodic pattern, and by the strophic form itself."Helen Lightner.

[[Trudgen]]

CATEGORIES: Swimming styles

The trudgen is a swimming stroke sometimes known as the racing stroke, or the East Indian stroke. It is named after the English swimmer John Trudgen (1852–1902)New Oxford American Dictionary (Apple OEM implementation) Oxford University Press. and evolved out of sidestroke.Thomas, David G. Advanced swimming: steps to success p. 116 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8OWKyV2lf6sC&pg=PA114&dq=sidestroke+swimming&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6itRT6uTI4XC8QOB0oDxBQ&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=sidestroke%20swimming&f=false
One swims mostly upon one side, making an overhand movement, lifting the arms alternately out of the water. When the left arm is above the head, the legs spread apart for a kick; as the left arm comes down the legs extend and are then brought together with a sharp scissor kick. The right arm is now brought forward over the water, and as it comes down the left arm is extended again. The scissor kick comes every second stroke; it involves spreading the legs, then bringing them together with a sudden "snap" movement.
The swimmer's face is underwater most of the time; the only chance to breathe is when the hand is coming back and just as the elbow passes the face.
This stroke has been developed into the front crawl.
Jarvis records the Trudgen stroke as developing from native swimmers and the text and illustrations show that the stroke is a crude version of what would become known as freestyle. 
The implication is that the speed of the stroke has been recognised world wide and many swimmers, for example in Australia, have adopted and are developing the stroke for competition. 
Importantly, the early analysis of the native stroke concentrated on the arm action and largely ignored the importance of the kick. 
In Australia, after studying a female swimmer in Samoa, Sid Cavill advanced the trudgen technique by lifting the arms higher out of the water. 
- Referee, 24 August 1898, page 6.
Initally, the arm action was seen as the critical source of propulsion and Tums Cavill demonstrated this by competing with his legs tied together. 
- Bulletin, 17 December 1898, page 24.
Subsequently, Tums Cavill turned his attention to the kick in training his younger brother, Dick, who successfully used the combined propulsion sources  in competition. 
- ‘Athletic Notes’, 9 January 1900 from unidentified newspaper, E. S. Marks Collection scrapbook, 
Q74, Mitchell Library, SLNSW, 48.
The style became known as the Australian Crawl, circa 1901. 
- Arrow, 2 March 1901, page 4.
The importance of a sissors kick, vigorously breaking the water surface, would be emphatically demonstrated by  Polynesian surfrider and (untrained) swimmer, Duke Kahanamoku, at the 1912 Olympic Games.

CHAPTER VI. 
The Trudgen Stroke.
To my mind the stroke of the future for racing purposes is the Trudgen stroke, which although a recent introduction to England, has been in vogue for centuries aongst Indians, the natives of South America, on the West Coast of Africa, and in many other places where the aborigines are almost natural swimmers. 
The stroke was practically first into England by J. Trudgeon, who had seen it performed, and practised it himself, in the rivers of South America. 
On August 11th, 1873, he won a 160 yards handicap, and Mr. R. Watson, in his "Swimming Record," refers to the race as follows:- 
"A suprising swimmer carried off the handicap - we allude to Trudgen; this individual swam with both hands entirely out of the water, an action peculiar to Indians. 
His time was very fast, particularly for one who appears to know but little of swimming, and should he become more finished in style, we shall expect him to take a position second to none as a swimmer. 
I question, indeed, if the swimming world ever saw a more peculiar stroke sustained throughout a 160 yards race. 
I have seen many fast exponents retain the action for some distance, but the great exertion compels them to desist, very much fatigued. 
In Truden, however, a totally opposite state of things existed for here we had a man swimming apparently easy, turning very badly, and, when finished, appearing as though he could have gone another 80 yards at the same pace. 
Page 34 
His action reminds an observer of a style parculiar to the Indians; both arms are thrown partly sideways, but very slovenly, and the head held completely above water." 
That was the opinion of an expert of the time, and in one respect he was right, for Trudgen won many races after that, and the peculiar metod of swimming was named after him. 
During the next few years the stroke was practised by many swimmers with varying degress of success, but it was not until the last three or four years that it came into such general use, and of late vast improvements have been made in the stroke. 
In the "Badminton Book of Swimming" the writers state:- 
"It is a very fatiguing method of progression, and rarely used for distances over 200 yards." 
At that period - 1894 - such a statement would be perfectly correct, and it was not anticipated that it would be used for anything approaching long distances. 
But all that is altered now, for the stroke is in common use, and the favoured one with many of the best swimmers of the present day, irrespective of the distance that has to be covered. 
In 1899 Phil Lister swam the whole long distance course with the trudgen stroke, and was eighth, his time being 1hr. 16min. 40secs., as compared with 1hr. 45secs. by the winner. 
This goes to prove that the stroke can be kept up. 
Then again, all the Australian swimmers use the same stroke. 
With regard to the merits and demerits of the stroke, it all amounts to a question of this mode of swimming can keep up their pace in the same ratio that an over-arm swimmer does. 
If that can be done, and I think it will, then the over-arm swimmer will have to take a secondary position in the championships of the future, becausew there ius no doubt which is the faster of the two. 
That day ... 
Page 35 
... will not come at present, unless an extrodinary swimmer is unearthed, but if the improvements made in the stroke of late years are continued in the years to come, then I am firmly convinced that the present records at all distances will be wiped out, and fresh ones put in their place by "trudgers." 
Admittedly the stroke is a more fatiguing one than the over-arm, but with plently of practice this will be lessened by a man in the "pink of condition," and when the stroke is more throughly learned and improved upon. 
The person who beats the present records will have to be a first-class swimmer, but for all that I am certain that the trudgen stroke is the speediest of the two if it can be maintained. 
The stroke is really a kind of double over-arm one, and the best trudgen swimmers use a similar, though shorter, leg kick, to that made when swimming over-arm. 
Starting with the left arm straight in the water and the right arm thrown back, as in Figure 10, the arms are brought round in a circular movement, as shown in Figue 11, care being taken that the palms of the hands are, as far as possible, turned way from the body. 
A good idea of the complete stroke, with regard to the arms, is offered by thye dooted lines in Figure 12. 
The leg stroke should be short and sharp, and the top of the leg kicked well forward. 
At all times the legs should be kept as close to the top of the water as possible without breaking through. 
In practising the trudgen stroke a swimmer should always keep well out of the water, and the less a man rolls in using this method the better it will be for him both as regards keeping his wind and speed.

Latite is an igneous, volcanic rock, with aphanitic-aphyric to aphyric-porphyritic texture. Its mineral assemblage is usually alkali feldspar and plagioclase in approximately equal amounts. Quartz is less than five percent and is absent in a feldspathoid-bearing latite, and olivine is absent in a quartz-bearing latite. When quartz content is greater than five percent the rock is classified as quartz latite.Classification of Igneous Rocks Biotite, hornblende, pyroxene and scarce olivine or quartz are common accessory minerals.
Rhomb porphyries are an unusual variety with gray-white porphyritic rhomb shaped phenocrysts embedded in a very fine grained red-brown matrix.  The composition of rhomb porphyry places it in the trachyte - latite classification of the QAPF diagram.

Andesite [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|d|ə|s|aɪ|t[/tpl] is an extrusive igneous, volcanic rock, of intermediate composition, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and dacite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO2) as illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene and/or hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals.Blatt, Harvey and Robert J.

CATEGORIES: Igneous petrology, Volcanic rocks

Phonolite is a rare extrusive volcanic rock of intermediate chemical composition between felsic and mafic, with texture ranging from aphanitic (fine-grain) to porphyritic (mixed fine- and coarse-grain).
The name phonolite comes from the Greek meaning (more or less) "sounding stone" because of the metallic sound it produces if an unfractured plate is hit; hence the English name clinkstone.

Basanite [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|s|ə|n|aɪ|t[/tpl] is an igneous, volcanic (extrusive) rock with aphanitic to porphyritic texture.
The mineral assembly is usually abundant feldspathoids (nepheline or leucite), plagioclase, and augite, together with olivine and lesser iron-titanium oxides such as ilmenite and magnetite-ulvospinel; minor alkali feldspar may be present, as illustrated by the position of the field for basanite in the QAPF diagram. Clinopyroxene (augite) and olivine are common as phenocrysts and in the matrix. The augite contains significantly greater titanium, aluminium and sodium than that in typical tholeiitic basalt. Quartz is absent, as are orthopyroxene and pigeonite. Chemically, basanites are low in silica (42 to 45% SiO2) and high in alkalis (3 to 5.5% Na2O and K2O) compared to basalt, which typically contains more SiO2, as evident on the diagram used for TAS classification. Nephelinite is yet richer in Na2O plus K2O compared to SiO2.
Basanites occur both on continents and on ocean islands. For example, together with basalts, they are produced by hotspot volcanism in the Hawaiian and the Comoros Islands.Geochemistry and petrology of a miocene trachyte-basanite …

[[Hardcore pornography]]

CATEGORIES: Pornography by genre

Hardcore pornography or hardcore is still photography or video footage that contains explicit and intensive forms of pornography, most commonly  including depictions of sexual acts such as vaginal, anal, and/or oral intercourse, cunnilingus, anilingus, ejaculation, and/or fetish play. Hardcore pornography usually takes the form of photographs, often displayed in magazines or on the Internet, or films. It can also appear as a cartoon. Since the 1990s it has been distributed widely over the Internet. 
The term was coined in the second half of the 20th century to distinguish it from softcore pornography, which may use simulated sex and limits the range and intensity of depictions of sexual activities.

[[Dunite]]

CATEGORIES: Ultramafic rocks, Plutonic rocks, Plate tectonics

Dunite ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|n|aɪ|t[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dj|uː|n|aɪ|t[/tpl]) (aka olivinite, not to be confused with the mineral olivenite) is an igneous, plutonic rock, of ultramafic composition, with coarse-grained or phaneritic texture. The mineral assemblage is greater than 90% olivine, with minor amounts of other minerals such as pyroxene, chromite, magnetite, and pyrope. Dunite is the olivine-rich end-member of the peridotite group of mantle-derived rocks. Dunite and other peridotite rocks are considered the major constituents of the Earth's mantle above a depth of about 400 kilometers. Dunite is rarely found within continental rocks, but where it is found, it typically occurs at the base of ophiolite sequences where slabs of mantle rock from a subduction zone have been thrust onto continental crust by obduction during continental or island arc collisions (orogeny). It is also found in alpine peridotite massifs that represent slivers of sub-continental mantle exposed during collisional orogeny. Dunite typically undergoes retrograde metamorphism in near-surface environments and is altered to serpentinite and soapstone.
Dunite may represent the refractory residue left after the extraction of basaltic magmas in the upper mantle. This is the type of dunite found in the lowermost parts of ophiolites, alpine peridotite massifs, and xenoliths.  However, a more likely method of dunite formation in mantle sections is by interaction between lherzolite or harzburgite and percolating silicate melts, which dissolve orthopyroxene from the surrounding rock, leaving a progressively olivine-enriched residue. Dunite may also form by the accumulation of olivine crystals on the floor of large basaltic or picritic magma chambers. These "cumulate" dunites typically occur in thick layers in layered intrusions,  associated with cumulate layers of wehrlite, olivine pyroxenite, harzburgite, and even chromitite (a cumulate rock consisting largely of chromite). Small layered intrusions may be of any geologic age, for example, the Triassic Palisades Sill in New York and the larger Eocene Skaergaard complex in Greenland. The largest layered mafic intrusions are tens of kilometers in size and almost all are Proterozoic in age, e.g., the Stillwater igneous complex (Montana), the Muskox intrusion (Canada), and the Great Dyke (Zimbabwe). Cumulate dunite may also be found in ophiolite complexes, associated with layers of wehrlite, pyroxenite, and gabbro.
Dunite was named by the German geologist, Ferdinand von Hochstetter in 1859 after Dun Mountain near Nelson, New Zealand. Dun Mountain was given its name because of the dun colour of the underlying ultramafic rocks. This color results from surface weathering that oxidizes the iron in olivine in temperate climates (weathering in tropical climates creates a deep red soil). Dun Mountain is separated from its sister massif, Red Mountain, at the southern end of South Island, New Zealand, by the Alpine Fault, an approximately 600 km long right lateral strike slip fault similar to the San Andreas fault in California, USA. A massive exposure of dunite in the United States can be found as Twin Sisters Mountain, near Mount Baker in the northern Cascade Range of Washington. In southern British Columbia, Canada dunite rocks form the core of an ultramafic rock complex located near the small community of Tulameen. The rocks are locally enriched in platinum group metals, chromite and magnetite.

[[Migmatite]]

CATEGORIES: Petrology, Metamorphic petrology, Metamorphic rocks, Igneous rocks

Migmatite is a rock that is a mixture of metamorphic rock and igneous rock. It is created when a metamorphic rock such as gneiss partially melts, and then that melt recrystallizes into an igneous rock, creating a mixture of the unmelted metamorphic part with the recrystallized igneous part.Marshak, Stephen, Essentials of Geology, W. W. Norton 3rd Ed, 2009 ISBN 978-0393196566 They can also be known as diatexite.
Migmatites form under extreme temperature conditions during prograde metamorphism, where partial melting occurs in pre-existing rocks. Migmatites are not crystallized from a totally molten material, and are not generally the result of solid-state reactions. Commonly, migmatites occur within extremely deformed rocks that represent the base of eroded mountain chains, typically within Precambrian cratonic blocks.
Migmatites often appear as tightly, incoherently folded (ptygmatic folds) dikelets, veins and segregations of light-colored granitic composition called leucosome, within dark-colored amphibole and biotite rich material called the melanosome. If present, the mesosome, intermediate in color between a leucosome and melanosome, is mostly a more or less unmodified remnant of the original parent rock (protolith). The light-colored material has the appearance of having been mobilized or molten.

[[Tonalite]]

CATEGORIES: Felsic rocks, Granitic rocks

Tonalite is an igneous, plutonic (intrusive) rock, of felsic composition, with phaneritic texture. Feldspar is present as plagioclase (typically oligoclase or andesine) with 10% or less alkali feldspar. Quartz is present as more than 20% of the rock. Amphiboles and pyroxenes are common accessory minerals.
In older references tonalite is sometimes used as a synonym for quartz diorite. However the current IUGS classification defines tonalite as having greater than 20% quartz, while quartz diorite varies its quartz content from 5 to 20%.
The name is derived from the type locality of tonalites, adjacent to the Tonale Line, a major structural lineament and mountain pass, Tonale Pass, in the Italian and Austrian Alps.
Trondhjemite is an orthoclase-deficient variety of tonalite with minor biotite as the only mafic mineral, named after Norway's third largest city, Trondheim.

The Hypertext Editing System, or HES, was an early hypertext research project conducted at Brown University in 1967 by Andries van Dam, Ted Nelson, and several Brown students. HES organized data into two main types: links and branching text. The branching text could automatically be arranged into menus and a point within a given area could also have an assigned name, called a label, and be accessed later by that name from the screen. Although HES pioneered many modern hypertext concepts, its emphasis was on text formatting and printing.
HES ran on an IBM System/360/50 mainframe computer, which was inefficient for the processing power required by the system.  The program was used by NASA's Houston Manned Spacecraft Center for documentation on the Apollo space program.van Dam, Andries. (1988, July). Hypertext '87 keynote address.

"Peg o' My Heart" is a popular song written by Alfred Bryan and Fred Fisher. It was published on March 15, 1913 and it featured in the 1913 musical Ziegfeld Follies. 
The song was first performed publicly by Irving Kaufman in 1912 at The College Inn in New York City after he had stumbled across a draft of sheet music on a shelf at the Leo Feist offices. [tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The song was inspired by the main character in the very successful musical comedy of the time  Peg O’ My Heart staring Laurette Taylor in the title role. Taylor appeared on the cover of early published sheet music. 
The song, performed by Max Harris and his Novelty Trio (based on a version by The Harmonicats), was used as the theme of the BBC miniseries The Singing Detective (1986).  When recording engineer Bill Putnam recorded The Harmonicats version of the song, he became the first person to use artificial reverberation creatively on a pop recording, with the use of the first reverb chamber, which had been set up in the studio's bathroom.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

As with the Bézier curve, a Bézier surface is defined by a set of control points. Similar to interpolation in many respects, a key difference is that the surface does not, in general, pass through the central control points; rather, it  is "stretched" toward them as though each were an attractive force. They are  visually intuitive, and for many applications, mathematically convenient.

As of the 2001 UK census, it had a population of about 41,000.
Historically a part of Cheshire, Altrincham was established as a market town in 1290, a time when most communities were based around agriculture rather than trade, and there is still a market in the town today. Further socioeconomic development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849, stimulating industrial activity in the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I listed buildings and a deer park.
Altrincham today is an affluent commuter town, partly because of its transport links. The town has a strong middle class presence; there has been a steady increase in Altrincham's middle classes since the 19th century. It is also home to Altrincham F.C. and two ice hockey clubs, Manchester Phoenix and Trafford Metros.

[[Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis]]

CATEGORIES: Periodontal disorders, Conditions of the mucous membranes, Necrosis

Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG; colloquially known as trench mouth) is a common, non-contagious infection of the gums with sudden onset. The main features are painful, bleeding gums, and ulceration of inter-dental papillae (the sections of gum between adjacent teeth). This disease, along with necrotizing (ulcerative) periodontitis (NP or NUP) is classified as a necrotizing periodontal disease, one of the seven general types of periodontitis. The often severe gingival pain that characterizes ANUG distinguishes it from the more common chronic periodontitis which is rarely painful. ANUG is the acute presentation of necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG), which is the usual course the disease takes. If improperly treated or neglected, NUG may become chronic and/or recurrent. The causative organisms are mostly anaerobic bacteria, particularly Fusobacteria and Spirocaete species. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress and immunosuppression (sub-optimal functioning of the immune system). When the attachments of the teeth to the bone are involved, the term NUP is used. Treatment of ANUG is by debridement (although pain may prevent this) and antibiotics (usually metronidazole) in the acute phase, and improving oral hygiene to prevent recurrence. Although the condition has a rapid onset and is debilitating, it usually resolves quickly and does no serious harm. The synonym "trench mouth" arose during World War I as many soldiers developed the disease, probably because of the poor conditions and extreme psychological stress.

The forehead is quite different in males from females, particularly the areas of the brows and the mid-forehead, and the shape of the skull affects the drape and contour of the skin. Changing the shape of the skull will assist in changing one feature from distinctly male to female."Stan Monstrey, Gennaro Selvaggi and Peter Ceulemans. Surgery: Male-to-Female Patient, Principles of Transgender Medicine and Surgery 105, 111 (Randi Ettner, et al. eds., 2007)
For many transgender women, FFS is medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria.World Professional Association for Transgender Health. WPATH Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008).World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People, Version 7. pg. 58 (2011). It can be just as important or even more important than genital forms of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in reducing gender dysphoria and helping trans women integrate socially as women. Studies have shown that the mental health-related quality of life for trans women who have had FFS is significantly higher than for trans women who have not had FFS. While most FFS patients are transsexual women, some non-transsexual women who feel that their faces are too masculine will also undergo FFS. FFS is occasionally sought by cross-dressers and drag queens.
FFS techniques are derived from maxillofacial and reconstructive surgery as well as general plastic and cosmetic surgery. Douglas Ousterhout pioneered what is now called FFS during the 1980s and 1990s in the U.S.A. There are only a small number of surgeons globally who specialise in FFS.

The Morgenthau Plan, first proposed by United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. in a memorandum entitled Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany, advocated that the Allied occupation of Germany following World War II include measures to eliminate Germany's ability to wage war by eliminating its armament industry, and the removal or destruction of other key industries basic to military strength. This included the removal or destruction of all industrial plants and equipment in the Ruhr area.[tpl]Cite web | last    =Morgenthau | first   =Henry | author-link  = Henry Morgenthau, Jr. | publication-date = 27 May 2004 | year = 1944 | title= Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany original memorandum from 1944, signed by Morgenthau (text and facsimile) | work = Box 31, Folder Germany: Jan.-Sept. 1944 (i297) | publisher = Franklin D.

This means completely disarming the German Army and people (including the removal or destruction of all war material), the total destruction of the whole German armament industry, and the removal or destruction of other key industries which are basic to military strength.[/tpl]
In occupied Germany, the thinking behind the Morgenthau plan was at first reflected in the U.S. occupation directive JCS 1067[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | p = 233[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 520[/tpl] and in the Allied Industrial plans for Germany aimed at "industrial disarmament".[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 520[/tpl] Compared with the Morgenthau Plan, however, JCS 1067 contained a number of deliberate "loopholes", limiting any action to short-term military measures and preventing large-scale destruction of mines and industrial plant, giving wide-ranging discretion to the military governor and Morgenthau's opponents at the War Department.[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | pp =169–170[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Greiner | pp =199–204[/tpl] JCS 1067 was later replaced  by JCS 1779, which aimed at restoring a " stable and productive Germany" and was soon followed by the Marshall Plan.[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | pp =169–170[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Greiner | pp =327–328[/tpl]
The contemporary historical assessment is that the Morgenthau Plan was of no significance for later occupation and policy in Germany, but that Nazi propaganda on the subject had a lasting effect and that it is still used for propaganda purposes by extreme right-wing organizations.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title=Morgenthau-Plan | encyclopedia=Handbuch des Antisemitismus: Judenfeindschaft in Geschichte und Gegenwart | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | accessdate=1 March 2014 | author=Benz, Wolfgang | editor=Saur, K.

It is an idea from the Southern African region which means literally "human-ness," and is often translated as "humanity towards others," but is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".[tpl]cite web |url=https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/about-ubuntu/C/about-ubuntu-name.html |title=About the Name |work=Official Ubuntu Documentation |publisher=Canonical |accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl]
In Southern Africa, it has come to be used as a term for a kind of humanist philosophy, ethic or ideology, also known as Ubuntuism or Hunhuism (the latter after the corresponding Shona term) propagated in the Africanization (transition to majority rule) process of these countries during the 1980s and 1990s.
Since the transition to democracy in South Africa with the Nelson Mandela presidency in 1994, the term has become more widely known outside of Southern Africa, notably popularized to English language readers by Desmond Tutu (1999).

Sondra Gotlieb (born  1936 in Winnipeg, Manitoba)Sondra Gotlieb in The Canadian Encyclopedia. is a Canadian journalist and novelist who lives in Toronto, Ontario.
She is married to Allan Gotlieb, former Canadian ambassador to the United States during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Her book Washington Rollercoaster recounted the Gotliebs' years as glamorous hosts in Washington during the Reagan Era, when she wrote a much-read column for the Washington Post. Vanity Fair magazine called her a "sparkling hostess", and in Washington she quickly became known for her irreverent attitude and sharp tongue. She often attracted attention with remarks considered out-of-character for diplomatic wives. Referring to Canada's image in America as a dull northern neighbour, she remarked: "Maybe we should invade South Dakota".
In 1986, she attracted a blaze of international publicity when reporter Juliet O'Neill caught her slapping her social secretary Connie Gibson Connors at an official dinner she and her husband were hosting in honour of the Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney and U.S. Vice-President George H. W. Bush. The incident, while disgraceful, instantly made her one of the most talked-about women in Washington and invitations to the Gotliebs' parties became highly coveted.
After she and her husband returned to Canada in the early 1990s, they moved to Toronto's exclusive Rosedale neighbourhood and became the centre of establishment society in that city. Allan joined numerous corporate boards, including Conrad Black's Hollinger Inc., while Sondra began writing columns for the Globe and Mail and later the National Post, which was owned by Conrad Black.
She won the Stephen Leacock Prize for her 1978 novel, True Confections, which was subtitled, Or How My Family Arranged My Marriage.
In 2001, she alluded to the infamous "Slap Flap" incident in a series of articles about her recent facelift, published in the National Post. Gotlieb recounted how the idea for cosmetic surgery first came to her after a visit with friends in Washington D.C. "One of them said to me, 'It must be nice living in Toronto. You can slop around without having to bother too much about your appearance. Canadians have such old-fashioned values.' For the second time in my life I felt like slapping someone's face."
She currently writes a regular weekly column for the National Post and resides in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rosedale with her husband, Allan Gotlieb.

He was previously one of the two Vice Presidents of Iraq under the Iraqi Interim Government from 2004 to 2005, and he was the main spokesman for the Islamic Dawa Party. He withdrew his nomination for premiership for the permanent government because he disagreed with some of the Kurdish leaders with regards to securing Kirkuk as part of Iraq. Some members of his own group, the United Iraqi Alliance, conspired with some of the Kurdish personalities and some of the sectarian Sunni politicians and in turn these groups involved the US President George W. Bush and the British Prime Minister Tony Blair to convince al-Jafari to withdraw his nomination. Al-Jafari refused any foreign interference in the Iraqi politics and instead gave the United Iraqi Alliance the choice to decide whom they wanted, be it him or another political figure as Prime Minister.  Al-Jafari refused to use force against any political group in society.

Yonge Street (pronounced "young street") is a major arterial route connecting the shores of Lake Ontario in Toronto to Lake Simcoe, a gateway to the Upper Great Lakes.

Long the southernmost leg of [[Highway 11 (Ontario)|Highway 11]], linking the [[Toronto|capital]] with [[northern Ontario]], Yonge Street has been referred to as "Main Street Ontario". A large part of the route follows an ancient well-established [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal]] trail that linked the Lake Ontario waterfront to northern parts of the region. It was also the site of Canada's [[Yonge–University–Spadina line|first subway line]].
The street was named by Ontario's first colonial administrator, John Graves Simcoe, for his friend Sir George Yonge, an expert on ancient Roman roads. Yonge Street is a commercial main thoroughfare rather than a ceremonial one, with landmarks such as the Eaton Centre, Yonge-Dundas Square and the Hockey Hall of Fame located along its length. In Toronto and York Region, Yonge Street is the north-south baseline from which street numbering is reckoned east and west. The eastern branch of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway line serves nearly the entire length of the street in Toronto and acts as the spine of the Toronto subway and RT, linking to suburban commuter systems such as the Viva Blue BRT.

[[Travel blending]]

CATEGORIES: Transportation planning

Travel Blending is a technique, developed in Australia, for encouraging people to make more efficient and environmentally sound transportation choices.  The technique involves governments encouraging citizens to deal with a greater number of tasks on one given trip rather than making several trips to multiple locations at different times, hopefully thus improving travel efficiency and decreasing the strain on transportation networks.
This technique originated in Sydney as an effort to improve Sydney's air quality before the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.

The Spanish Phalanx of the Assemblies of the National Syndicalist Offensive ([tpl]lang-es|Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista[/tpl], FE de las JONS), known simply as the Falange ([tpl]audio|es_falange_001.ogg|listen[/tpl]), is the name assigned to several Spanish political movements and parties dating from the 1930s, and dovetailed with the Fascist movement in Italy. The word [tpl]lang|es|Falange[/tpl] in Spanish refers to a phalanx formation or front, a political metaphor commonly adopted by modern radicalized movements in the early-to-middle 20th century such as: popular front, national front or vanguard. Members of the party were called Falangists ([tpl]lang-es|Falangistas[/tpl]). Since 1975, Falangists have split into several different political movements that have continued into the 21st century. The main political movement that retained its Falangist heritage and is the continuation of the party is the FE JONS.
In Spain, the Falange was a political organization founded by José Antonio Primo de Rivera in 1933, during the Second Spanish Republic. Primo de Rivera was the son of General Miguel Primo de Rivera, who governed Spain as Prime Minister in the 1920s.
Unlike other members of the Spanish right, the Falange was republican, avant-gardist, and modernist (see Early History below), in a manner similar to the original spirit of Italian Fascism. Its uniform and aesthetic was similar to contemporary European fascist and national socialist movements. After the party was coopted by Francisco Franco and consolidated with the Carlists, it ceased to have a fascist character (which sought a revolutionary  transformation of society whereas Franco was conservative), although it retained many of the external trappings of fascism.Laqueur, Walter Fascism: Past, Present, Future p. 13 1996 Oxford University PressDe Menses, Filipe Ribeiro Franco and the Spanish Civil War, p. 87, RoutledgeGilmour, David, The Transformation of Spain: From Franco to the Constitutional Monarchy, p. 7 1985 Quartet BooksPayne, Stanley Fascism in Spain, 1923-1977, p. 476 1999 Univ of Wisconsin PressPayne, Stanley Fascism in Spain, 1923-1977, p. 347, 476 1999 University of Wisconsin Press
During the Spanish Civil War the doctrine of the Falange was used by General Franco, who virtually took possession of its ideology, while José Antonio Primo de Rivera, arrested before the beginning of the war, was executed by the Spanish Republican Government. During the war, and after its founder's death, the Falange was combined by decree (Unification Decree) with the Carlist party, under the sole command of Franco, forming the core of the sole official political organization in Spain, the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista, or "Spanish Traditionalist Phalanx of the Assemblies of National-Syndicalist Offensive" (FET y de las JONS). This organization, also known as the National Movement (Movimiento Nacional) after 1945, continued until Franco's death in 1975.

[[Shadworth Hodgson]]

CATEGORIES: Metaphysicians, English philosophers, 1832 births, 1912 deaths, Presidents of the Aristotelian Society

Shadworth Hollway Hodgson (1832-1912) was an English philosopher.
He worked independently, without academic affiliation.  He was acknowledged by William James http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/James/James_1912/James_1912_pref.html as a forerunner of Pragmatism, although he viewed his work as a completion of Kant's project.  Hodgson was a member of a London philosophy club with James, called the "Scratch Eight." Hodgson regarded the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as his chief inspirations, and had no academic background, though he was a member of the Metaphysical Society.
He was the first president of the Aristotelian Society and held that post from 1880 to 1894.
His principal work was The Metaphysic of Experience (1898) which prepared the way for New Realism. He objected to the stance of empiricism in its postulating of persons and things, and insisted that neither subject nor object are warranted as initial considerations of philosophy.
Attention to Hodgson was briefly enlivened by an article by Wolfe Mays in a British Phenomenology journal in the 1970s.
The volumes of Hodgson's principal work were often shipped with uncut pages and visits to libraries with these volumes has revealed that sometimes most pages of all 4 volumes remained uncut even one hundred years later.

[[Universal Chess Interface]]
CATEGORIES: Computer chess

The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is an open communication protocol that enables a chess program's engine to communicate with its user interface. 
It was designed and released by Rudolf Huber and Stefan Meyer-Kahlen, the author of Shredder, in November 2000, and can be seen as a rival to the older XBoard/WinBoard Communication protocol. Like the latter, it is free to use without license fees.
Customarily, UCI assigns some tasks to the user interface that have traditionally been handled by the engine itself. Most notably, the opening book is usually expected to be handled by the interface, by simply selecting moves to play until it is out of book, and only then starting up the engine for calculation in the resulting position. (UCI does not specify any on-disk format for the opening book; different UIs usually have their own, proprietary formats.) Also, the user interface may handle endgame tablebases if the engine does not support it itself, although this is often better handled in the engine, as having tablebase information can be useful to consider a possible future position.
Only a few interfaces and engines supported this protocol until Chessbase, the chess software company which markets Fritz, began to support UCI in 2002. [tpl]As of|2007[/tpl], there are well over 100 engines that support UCI.

[[Low-noise amplifier]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic amplifiers

Low-noise amplifier (LNA) is an electronic amplifier used to amplify possibly very weak signals (for example, captured by an antenna). It is usually located very close to the detection device to reduce losses in the feedline. This active antenna arrangement is frequently used in microwave systems like GPS, because coaxial cable feedline is very lossy at microwave frequencies, e.g. a loss of 10% coming from few meters of cable would cause a 10% degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
An LNA is a key component which is placed at the front-end of a radio receiver circuit. Per Friis' formula, the overall noise figure (NF) of the receiver's front-end is dominated by the first few stages (or even the first stage only).
Using an LNA, the effect of noise from subsequent stages of the receive chain is reduced by the gain of the LNA, while the noise of the LNA itself is injected directly into the received signal. Thus, it is necessary for an LNA to boost the desired signal power while adding as little noise and distortion as possible, so that the retrieval of this signal is possible in the later stages in the system. A good LNA has a low NF (e.g. [tpl]nowrap|1 dB[/tpl]), a large enough gain (e.g. [tpl]nowrap|20 dB[/tpl]) and should have large enough intermodulation and compression point (IP3 and P1dB). Further criteria are operating bandwidth, gain flatness, stability and input and output voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR).
For low noise, the amplifier needs to have a high amplification in its first stage. Therefore JFETs and HEMTs are often used. They are driven in a high-current regime, which is not energy-efficient, but reduces the relative amount of shot noise. Input and output matching circuits for narrow-band circuits enhance the gain (see Gain-bandwidth product).

[[Modigliani–Miller theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Capital (economics), Economics theorems, Financial economics

The Modigliani–Miller theorem (of Franco Modigliani, Merton Miller)  is a theorem on capital structure, arguably forming the basis for modern thinking on capital structure. The basic theorem states that, under a certain market price process (the classical random walk), in the absence of taxes, bankruptcy costs, agency costs, and asymmetric information, and in an efficient market, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed.MIT Sloan Lecture Notes, Finance Theory II, Dirk Jenter, 2003 It does not matter if the firm's capital is raised by issuing stock or selling debt.  It does not matter what the firm's dividend policy is. Therefore, the Modigliani–Miller theorem is also often called the capital structure irrelevance principle.
Modigliani was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Economics for this and other contributions.
Miller was a professor at the University of Chicago when he was awarded the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics, along with Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe, for their "work in the theory of financial economics," with Miller specifically cited for "fundamental contributions to the theory of corporate finance."

The Lamborghini Countach is a mid-engined supercar that was produced by Italian automaker Lamborghini from 1974 to 1990. Its design both pioneered and popularized the wedge-shaped, sharply angled look popular in many high-performance sports cars. The "cabin-forward" design concept, which pushes the passenger compartment forward in order to accommodate a larger engine, was also popularized by the Countach.
In 2004, American car magazine Sports Car International named the car number three on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1970s, and it was listed as number ten on their list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s.

John Lent is a Canadian poet and novelist, as well as a college teacher of creative writing and literature. He has published ten books from 1978 to 2012. His book, So It Won't Go Away, was shortlisted for the 2006 Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize. Lent’s fiction and poetry have appeared for years in magazines across Canada, including: The Malahat Review, Event, Dandelion, Grain, The Wascana Review, NeWest Review, Prairie Fire, CV2, New Quarterly, Waves, Matrix, The Fiddlehead, and The Antigonish Review. Lent has read from his work in many cities in Canada, and internationally.  Lent has also published critical articles on the work of Malcolm Lowry, Thomas DeQuincey, Wyndham Lewis, Tom Wayman, Kristjana Gunnars, Mavis Gallant, Dennis Brutus and Wilfred Watson.
“My continuing interest,” Lent says, “is the relationship between consciousness and notions of ‘narrative’ in both fiction and poetry.  So I’m fascinated by what happens when you take a person in a very ordinary, textured world and the story that surfaces actually mimics the process of awareness that is right at the heart of that world…so it’s this wonderful, crazy mix of subjectivity and things that keeps drawing me to more open, more flexible forms of story.  I find that whole process nervy and exciting.”
Lent is also a singer/songwriter and plays in a roots/jazz trio, The Lent/Fraser/Wall Trio, which performs in British Columbia, and has opened for groups as various as Leahey, Chilliwack, Campbell Ryga, Long John Baldry, UHF and others. John Lent lives with his wife, Jude Clarke (painter and writer) in Vernon, British Columbia. Lent is a member of the Writers Union of Canada, SOCAN, the Canadian Songwriters Association, and the Associated Writing Programs (USA).

The Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 ([tpl]USStat|40|411[/tpl], enacted [tpl]date|October 6, 1917[/tpl], codified at [tpl]usc|12|95a[/tpl] et seq.), sometimes abbreviated as TWEA, is a United States federal law to restrict trade with countries hostile to the United States. The law gives the President the power to oversee or restrict any and all trade between the U.S. and its enemies in times of war. In 1933 the U.S. Congress amended the act by the passage of the Emergency Banking Relief Act which extended its scope regarding the hoarding of gold to include any declared national emergency and not just those declared solely during times of war. President Franklin D. Roosevelt then used these new authorities to essentially outlaw gold ownership through the issuance of Executive Order 6102. These restrictions continued until January 1, 1975. The Act has been amended several other times.Cornell Law School
The Trading with the Enemy Act is often confused with the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which grants somewhat broader powers to the President and is invoked during states of emergency when not at war.
As of 2008, Cuba is the only country restricted under the act. North Korea is the most recent country to have the restrictions lifted.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7476625.stm|title=US to ease North Korea sanctions |date=2008-06-26|accessdate=2008-06-27|work=BBC[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Overview of Sanctions with North Korea|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/nkorea.txt|publisher=U.S. Treasury|accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl]

Richard Dyer-Bennet (October 6, 1913, Leicester, England - December 14, 1991, Monterey, Massachusetts) was an English-born American folk singer (or his own preferred term, "minstrel"), recording artist, and voice teacher.
Dyer-Bennet studied voice with Gertrude Wheeler Beckman and Sven Scholander, and from the first made his living singing. During his peak performance years, he gave 50 concerts a year. He recorded extensively for many labels, and eventually founded his own, Dyer-Bennet Records, and recorded in his own living room. The albums he recorded on his own label have been re-released on CD by Smithsonian Folkways. The CD Richard Dyer-Bennet 1 includes a biographical essay written by Dyer-Bennet's daughter, Bonnie, which highlights his progressive politics and his battle with a debilitating stroke in later life (he taught himself to play harp one-handed so that he could continue to perform and teach).  
A biography - Richard Dyer-Bennet: The Last Minstrel - by Paul O Jenkins was published in December 2009 by the University Press of Mississippi.  The book chronicles Dyer-Bennet's eventful life and includes a foreword by his daughter.

The long-tailed Gentoo penguin ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|t|uː[/tpl] [tpl]respell|JEN|too[/tpl]) (Pygoscelis papua) is a penguin species in the genus Pygoscelis, most closely associated with the Adélie penguin (P. adeliae) and the Chinstrap penguin (P. antarcticus). The first scientific description was made in 1781 by Johann Reinhold Forster on the basis of Falkland Islands. They call in a variety of ways, but the most frequently heard is a loud trumpeting which is emitted with its head thrown back.Woods, R.W.

The application of Gentoo to the penguin is unclear. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that Gentoo used to be an Anglo-Indian term used as early as 1638 to distinguish Hindus in India from Muslims. The English term originated from the Portuguese gentio (compare "gentile"); in the 20th century the term came to be regarded as derogatory.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

The Canada Act 1982 (1982 c. 11) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that was passed at the request of the Canadian federal government to "patriate" Canada's constitution, ending the necessity for the country to request certain types of amendment to the Constitution of Canada to be made by the British parliament.  The Act also formally ended the "request and consent" provisions of the Statute of Westminster 1931 in relation to Canada, whereby the British parliament had a general power to pass laws extending to Canada at its own request.
Annexed as Schedule B to the Act is the text of the Constitution Act, 1982, in both of Canada's official languages (i.e. English and French).  Because of the requirements of official bilingualism, the body of the Canada Act itself is also set out in French in Schedule A to the Act, which is declared by s. 3 to have "the same authority in Canada as the English version thereof".Canada Act 1982, s. 3.  As a result, the Canada Act is the only British legislation forming a part of the Constitution of Canada that has an official text in both languages, rather than just in English.

In 2002 his novel Les Ombres errantes won the Prix Goncourt,  France's top literary prize.[tpl]cite journal|date=October 28, 2002 |title=Pascal Quignard wins France's top literary prize|journal=Europe Intelligence Wire|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26532790_ITM[/tpl] Terrasse à Rome (Terrasse in Rome), received the French Academy prize in 2000. In 1980 Carus had been awarded the "Prix des Critiques".
One of Quignard's most commented works are perhaps his eighty-four "Little Treatises", first published in 1991 by Maeght. But his most popular book is probably Tous les matins du monde (All the Mornings in the World), about 17th-century viola de gamba player Marin Marais and his teacher, Sainte-Colombe, which was adapted for the screen in 1991, by director Alain Corneau. Quignard wrote the screenplay of the film, in collaboration with Corneau. Tous les matins du monde, starring Jean-Pierre Marielle, Gérard Depardieu and son Guillaume Depardieu, was a tremendous success in France and sold 2 million tickets in the first year. It was subsequently distributed in 31 countries, and released in 1992 in the United States. The soundtrack was certified platinum (500,000 copies) and contributed to musician Jordi Savall’s international celebrity. 
Quignard has also translated works from the Latin (Albucius, Porcius Latro), Chinese (Kong-souen Long), and Greek (Lycophron).

[[Color of chemicals]]
CATEGORIES: Chemical properties

The color of chemicals is a physical property of chemicals that in most cases comes from the excitation of electrons due to an absorption of energy performed by the chemical. What is seen by the eye is not the color absorbed, but the complementary color from the removal of the absorbed wavelengths.
The study of chemical structure by means of energy absorption and release is generally referred to as spectroscopy.

[[Rhombicosidodecahedron]]

CATEGORIES: Uniform polyhedra, Archimedean solids

In geometry, the rhombicosidodecahedron, or small rhombicosidodecahedron, is an Archimedean solid, one of thirteen convex isogonal nonprismatic solids constructed of two or more types of regular polygon faces.
It has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 regular pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges.
The name rhombicosidodecahedron refers to the fact that the 30 square faces lie in the same planes as the 30 faces of the rhombic triacontahedron which is dual to the icosidodecahedron.
It can also be called an expanded or cantellated dodecahedron or icosahedron, from truncation operations on either uniform polyhedron.

[[Pushout]]

CATEGORIES: School and classroom behaviour

A pushout is a student that leaves their school before graduation, through the encouragement of the school.  A student who leaves of their own accord (e.g., to work or care for a child), rather than through the action of the school, is considered a school dropout.  In typical use, the category of pushouts excludes students who have been formally expelled from school for violating rules (e.g., for being violent).
Students may be pushed out of school because their presence in the school creates difficulty in meeting some goal of the school. For example, in the case where funding for the school is dependent upon scholastic achievement of the students, if the school can get rid of low-performing students, average test scores on academic performance tests will go up, thus increasing funding."To Cut Failure Rate, Schools Shed Students" by Tamar Lewin and Jennifer Medina, New York Times. July 31, 2003.  Schools may pushout truant students, who formally enroll in classes, but then refuse to attend.
In some low-performing schools in Chicago combined dropout/pushout rates have exceeded 25% in one year."Enrollment drops point to pushout effect", Catalyst, Voices of Chicago Educational Reform. June, 1999
Children are also pushed from schools because they present discipline problems. Within youth advocacy and activist communities, pushout is a term that recognizes the intersecting forces of oppression most commonly responsible for high school "drop outs" within marginalized communities of color, allowing for the responsibility to be placed on those forces, rather than the youth impacted by unequal education, economics, disciplinary actions, and racism.

[[CliffsNotes]]
CATEGORIES: Textbooks, John Wiley & Sons, 1958 introductions, John Wiley & Sons books

CliffsNotes (formerly Cliffs Notes, originally Cliff's Notes and often, erroneously, CliffNotes) are a series of student study guides available primarily in the United States. The guides present and explain literary and other works in pamphlet form or online. Detractors of the study guides claim they let students bypass reading the assigned literature. The company claims to promote the reading of the original work, and does not view the study guides as a substitute for that reading.
CliffsNotes was started by a Nebraska native named Cliff Hillegass in 1958. He was working at Nebraska Book Co. of Lincoln, Nebraska, when he met Jack Cole, the co-owner of Coles, a Toronto book business.  Coles was also the publisher of a series of Canadian study guides called Coles Notes. Jack Cole offered the American rights to Hillegass. 
Hillegass and his wife, Catherine, started the business in their basement at 511 Eastridge Drive in Lincoln, with sixteen William Shakespeare titles. CliffsNotes now exist on hundreds of works. The term "Cliff's Notes" has now come into modern usage as a generic noun for similar products.
IDG Books purchased CliffsNotes in 1998. John Wiley & Sons acquired IDG Books (renamed Hungry Minds) in 2001.  In 2011, CliffsNotes announced a joint venture with AOL and reality TV show producer Mark Burnett to introduce a series of 60-second video study guide surveys of literary works.[tpl]Cite web|title=Cliff Notes Goes Digital|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/03/10/pm-cliffsnotes-goes-digital//|accessdate=2011-03-10|publisher=American Public Radio[/tpl] CliffsNotes was acquired by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2012, and—according to the site's "About" page—"the brand lives on today as part of the global learning company, and its mission of changing lives by fostering passionate, curious learners."[tpl]Cite web|title=About CliffsNotes|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com/about-cliffsnotes | accessdate=2013-06-26|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt[/tpl]

Stations are located throughout the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. While Staten Island does have a rail line, the Staten Island Railway, it is not officially considered part of the subway, and does not have any direct rail link with the subway system, so any passengers wishing to visit another borough must take a ferry or bus.
All services pass through Manhattan except for the [tpl]NYCS|G[/tpl], Franklin Avenue Shuttle and Rockaway Park Shuttle. Large portions of the subway outside Manhattan are elevated, on embankments, or in open cuts, and a few stretches of track run at ground level. In total, 40% is at or above ground.
Many lines and stations have both express and local services. These lines have three or four tracks. Normally, the outer two are used for local trains, while the inner one or two are used for express trains. Stations served by express trains are typically major transfer points or destinations. The BMT Jamaica Line uses skip-stop service on portions, where two services (J and Z trains) operate over the line during rush hours in the peak direction and many stations are only served by one of the two.

The Act for the Naturalization of the Most Excellent Princess Sophia, Electress and Duchess Dowager of Hanover, and the Issue of her Body was an Act of the Parliament of England (4 & 5 Ann. c. 16.) in 1705.  It followed the Act of Settlement 1701 whereby Dowager Electress Sophia of Hanover and her Protestant descendants were declared to be in the line of succession to the throne (her son George I later became king).
Sophia, a granddaughter of James I of England, was not considered to be an Englishwoman as she had not been born in England. This Act naturalized her and "the issue of her body", if Protestant, as English subjects. Any person born to a descendant of Sophia could also claim to be the "issue of her body".
This was first tested between 1955 and 1957 when Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover (pretender to the kingdom of Hanover as Ernest Augustus IV, father of the current pretender, Ernst August V) successfully claimed British nationality on this basisAttorney-General v HRH Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover 1957 1 All ER 49 after considerable litigation. See the thorough discussion by A. Lyon at Statute Law Review 20:2 (1999) 174-84.  In 1947 Prince Frederick of Prussia also succeeded in his claim.
The Act was repealed by section 34 of, and Part II of Schedule 4 to, the British Nationality Act 1948. However, any Protestant descendant of the Electress who had already been born when the repealing statute was enacted had already automatically acquired the status of a British subject, and so there are still people alive today who can claim British nationality under the Sophia Naturalization Act. That was the case of Ernest Augustus himself, who was only recognized by the Courts as a British subject in 1957, years after the repeal of the Sophia Naturalization Act; because he was born and was a Protestant when the Act was still in force, the Courts recognized that by that fact he had already acquired citizenship, so that the repeal of the statute did not affect his status.
However, in the present time, most people concerned who would claim citizenship would basically only reach the status of British Overseas citizen.Homeoffice.gov.uk, Electress Sophia of Hanover

William Ætheling (5 August 1103 – 25 November 1120), designated or titled Adelin (alternately rendered as Adelinus, Adelingus, A(u)delin or other Latinized Norman-French variants of Ætheling"Adelin" derives from the Germanic element Adel, meaning "noble", and is equivalent to the Old English word Æthel, "noble". Adelinus is thus equivalent to the term "Ætheling" used for English princes prior to the Norman Conquest. A Latin term meaning "noble", Clito, was sometimes used as an alternate to the two: for example in the case of William Adelin's cousin, William Clito. See Miller, S., "Ætheling" in The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, ed. M. Lapidge, J. Blair, S. Keynes and D. Scragg. Oxford: Blackwell, 2003.

Toronto Rocks was an hour-long television program presenting music videos on CITY-TV in Toronto, Canada in the 1980s, starting in 1984. It aired live at 4PM weekdays and was initially hosted by John Majhor. Majhor was a longtime DJ at 1050 CHUM AM in Toronto and eventually became one of Canada's first "VJs" with the development of music videos. Toronto Rocks was a predecessor to MuchMusic and MTV, and had kids rushing home from school every day to catch their favourite videos of the early 80's. During the show, Majhor played videos by a wide variety of the big name artists of the day. All the way from Michael Jackson's "Beat It", Van Halen's "Jump", Yes' "Owner of a Lonely Heart", to the Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" and other songs released in the 1980s by artists who became commercially popular during the decade. Wednesdays on the show were set aside for "Mid Week Metal Mania", where Majhor played only heavy metal videos from the hard rock and "hair bands" of the day. He also interviewed in-studio guests and had various contests and giveaways.  Over 400 episodes of Toronto Rocks were aired.
Other hosts were Brad Giffen (until 1988), Lance Chilton (1988–90) and JD Roberts also filled in for John Majhor from time to time.

A liquid below its standard freezing point will crystallize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form creating a solid. However, lacking any such nuclei, the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs. Homogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature, but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid will form.
Water normally freezes at 273.15 K (0 °C or 32 °F) however it can also be "supercooled" at standard pressure down to its crystal homogeneous nucleation at almost 224.8 K (−48.3 °C/−55 °F).[tpl]cite journal|last=Moore|first=Emily|coauthors=Valeria Molinero|title=structural transformation in supercooled water controls the crystallization rate of ice|journal=Nature|date=24 November 2011|volume=479|pages=506–508|doi=10.1038/nature10586|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1622|accessdate=24 November 2011|arxiv = 1107.1622 |bibcode = 2011Natur.479..506M [/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Debenedetti|Stanley|2003|p=42[/tpl] The process of supercooling requires that water be pure and free of nucleation sites, which can be achieved by processes like reverse osmosis, but the cooling itself does not require any specialised technique. If water is cooled at a rate on the order of 106 K/s, the crystal nucleation can be avoided and water becomes a glass. Its glass transition temperature is much colder and harder to determine, but studies estimate it at about 165 K (−108 °C/−162.4 °F).[tpl]harvnb|Giovambattista|Angell|Sciortino|Stanley|2004|p=047801-1[/tpl].
Glassy water can be heated up to approximately 150 K (−123 °C/−189.4 °F).
In the range of temperatures between 231 K (−42 °C/−43.6 °F) and 150 K (−123 °C/−189.4 °F) experiments find only crystal ice.
Droplets of supercooled water often exist in stratiform and cumulus clouds. Aircraft flying through these clouds seed an abrupt crystallization of these droplets, which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft's wings or blockage of its instruments and probes, unless the aircraft are equipped with an appropriate de-icing system. Freezing rain is also caused by supercooled droplets.
The process opposite to supercooling, the melting of a solid above the freezing point, is much more difficult, and a solid will almost always melt at the same temperature for a given pressure. For this reason, it is the melting point which is usually identified, using melting point apparatus; even when the subject of a paper is "freezing-point determination", the actual methodology is "the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice"."A new method of freezing-point determination for small quantities", J. A. Ramsay, J. Exp. Biol..1949; 26 It is, however, possible, at a given pressure to superheat a liquid above its boiling point without it becoming gaseous.
Supercooling is often confused with freezing-point depression. Supercooling is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid.  Freezing point depression is when a solution can be cooled below the freezing point of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the solute; an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when sodium chloride is added to pure water.

In 1950, C.B. Sargent suggested that the name of the dynasty should be read as meaning "new", which J.J.L. Duyvendak rejected out of hand. Chauncey S. Goodrich later convincingly argued that it may be possible to assign a semantic reading to xin, but that it ought to be read as renewed or renewal, not simply new.

The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin).  Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos.
In October of AD 23, the capital Chang'an was attacked and the imperial palace ransacked. Wang Mang died in the battle.
The Han dynasty was reestablished in AD 25 when Liu Xiu (Emperor Guangwu) took the throne.

The sole emperor of the Xin dynasty, Wang Mang (王莽), was the nephew of Grand Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun. After the death of her step-grandson Emperor Ai in 1 BC, Wang Mang rose to power. After several years of cultivating a personality cult, he finally proclaimed himself emperor in AD 9. However, while a creative scholar and politician, he was an incompetent ruler, and his capital Chang'an was besieged by peasant rebels in AD 23. He died in the siege, and the Han dynasty was restored by descendants of the former imperial clan.

[[Purusha]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu philosophical concepts

In some lineages of Hinduism, Purusha (Sanskrit [tpl]IAST|puruṣa[/tpl], पुरुष "man, cosmic man", in Sutra literature also called [tpl]IAST|puṃs[/tpl] "man") is the "Self" which pervades the universe.Rigveda 10/81 & Yajurveda 17/19/20, 25 The Vedic divinities are interpretations of the many facets of Purusha. According to the Rigvedic Purusha sukta, Purusha was dismembered by the devas—his mind is the Moon, his eyes are the Sun, and his breath is the wind.
In the Rigveda, Purusha is described as a primeval giant that is sacrificed by the gods (see Purushamedha) and from whose body the world and the varnas (classes) are built. He is described as having a thousand heads and a thousand feet. He emanated Viraj, the female creative principle, from which he is reborn in turn after the world was made out of his parts.
Bhagavata Purana describes that Purusha is the first form of Supreme Lord NarayanaBhagavata Purana 1.3.1 and this Purusha is the source of everything in the universe.  The Purusha in the title of Purusha Sukta refers to the Parama Purusha, Purushottama, Vedic Supreme God Narayana, in his form as the Viraat Purusha (Enormously Huge Being). It describes this form of his as having countless heads, eyes and legs manifested everywhere, and beyond the scope of any limited method of comprehension. All creation is but a fourth part of him. The rest is unmanifested. He is the source of all creation. Purusha along with Prakrti creates the necessary tattvas for the creation of universe.

He was born in Kyoto in a rich merchant  family and died in Edo (now Tokyo). He learned from the  famous potter Nonomura Ninnsei and made his own kiln. In 1712 a nobleman began patronizing his kiln, he moved to the east area of Kyoto.  He was one of the greatest ceramicists of the Tokugawa era. In 1713, he moved to Edo.
Ogata Kenzan produced a distinctive style of freely brushed grasses, blossoms, and birds as decorative motifs for pottery. His pieces were noted for their perfect relation between design and shape. He often collaborated on the decoration of pottery with his older brother, Ogata Korin (1658–1716), after whom the style known as Rimpa (Korin + pa meaning “school”) was named. 
Bernard Leach, the famous studio potter, wrote a book about Ogata Kenzan in 1966 entitled Kenzan and his Tradition, published by Faber & Faber in London.

CATEGORIES: Acari, Building biology, Animals described in 1897

The house dust mite (sometimes referred to by allergists as HDM) is a cosmopolitan guest in human habitation. Dust mites feed on organic detritus such as flakes of shed human skin and flourish in the stable environment of dwellings. House dust mites are a common cause of asthma and allergic symptoms worldwide. The mite's gut contains potent digestive enzymes (notably proteases) that persist in their feces and are major inducers of allergic reactions such as wheezing. The mite's exoskeleton can also contribute to allergic reactions. The European house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) and the American house dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) are two different species, but are not necessarily confined to Europe or North America; a third species Euroglyphus maynei also occurs widely.

[[Golden Horn]]

The Golden Horn (Turkish: Haliç), or Altın Boynuz (literally, "Golden Horn"); is a major urban waterway and the primary inlet of the Bosphorus in Istanbul, Turkey. It is a horn-shaped estuary (hence, the name) that joins Bosphorus Strait at the immediate point where said strait meets the Sea of Marmara, thus forming a narrow, isolated peninsula, the tip of which is "Old Istanbul" (ancient Byzantion and Constantinople), and the promontory of Sarayburnu, or Seraglio Point. The Golden Horn geographically separates the historic center of Istanbul from the rest of the city, and forms a natural, sheltered harbor that has historically protected Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and other maritime trade ships for thousands of years.
While the reference to a "horn" is understood to refer to the inlet's general shape, the significance of the designation "golden" is more obscure, with historians believing it to refer to either the riches brought into the city through the bustling historic harbor located at the Golden Horn, or to romantic historic interpretations of the rich yellow light blazing upon the estuary's waters as the sun sets over the city. Its Greek and English names mean the same, while its Turkish name Haliç, simply means "estuary", and is derived from the Arabic word khaleej, meaning "gulf".
Throughout its storied past, the Golden Horn has witnessed many tumultuous historical incidents, and its dramatic vistas have been the subject of countless works of art.

[[Parallel transport]]

CATEGORIES: Riemannian geometry, Connection (mathematics)

In geometry, parallel transport is a way of transporting geometrical data along smooth curves in a manifold.  If the manifold is equipped with an affine connection (a covariant derivative or connection on the tangent bundle), then this connection allows one to transport vectors of the manifold along curves so that they stay parallel with respect to the connection.  Other notions of connection come equipped with their own parallel transportation systems as well.  For instance, a Koszul connection in a vector bundle also allows for the parallel transport of vectors in much the same way as with a covariant derivative.  An Ehresmann or Cartan connection supplies a lifting of curves from the manifold to the total space of a principal bundle.  Such curve lifting may sometimes be thought of as the parallel transport of reference frames.
The parallel transport for a connection thus supplies a way of, in some sense, moving the local geometry of a manifold along a curve: that is, of connecting the geometries of nearby points.  There may be many notions of parallel transport available, but a specification of one — one way of connecting up the geometries of points on a curve — is tantamount to providing a connection.  In fact, the usual notion of connection is the infinitesimal analog of parallel transport.  Or, vice versa, parallel transport is the local realization of a connection. 
As parallel transport supplies a local realization of the connection, it also supplies a local realization of the curvature known as holonomy.  The Ambrose-Singer theorem makes explicit this relationship between curvature and holonomy.

Prince Alexander was born in London, United Kingdom, to the Duke and Duchess of Teck, and was educated at Eton College before moving on to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, for training as an officer. In 1904, he married Princess Alice and rose in the military ranks through his service in African campaigns and the First World War, receiving numerous honours and decorations, including elevation to the peerage as Earl of Athlone, after he had relinquished his German title of Prince of Teck in the Kingdom of Württemberg. In 1927 he was appointed as South Africa's governor-general by King George V, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, to replace Prince Arthur of Connaught, and he occupied the viceregal post until succeeded by the 6th Earl of Clarendon in 1930.

With a history dating to the 17th century, it is the second oldest surviving bank in the United Kingdom (the Bank of England having been established one year before), and is the only commercial institution created by the Parliament of Scotland to remain in existence. It was also the first bank in Europe to print its own banknotes; it continues to print its own sterling banknotes under legal arrangements which allow Scottish banks to issue currency.
In June 2006, the HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, allowing the bank's structure to be simplified. As a result, The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland became Bank of Scotland plc on 17 September 2007.

Halifax (previously known as Halifax Building Society) is a banking chain in the United Kingdom and a division of Bank of Scotland, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group. It is the UK's largest provider of residential mortgages and savings accounts. 
It is named after the town of Halifax, West Yorkshire where it was founded as a building society in 1853.  By 1913 It had developed into the UK's largest building society and continued to grow and prosper and maintained this position within the UK until 1997 when it de-mutualised. 
In 1997 it became Halifax plc, a public limited company which was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In 2001 Halifax plc merged with The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland, forming HBOS. In 2006, the HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 legally transferred the assets and liabilities of the Halifax chain to Bank of Scotland which became a standard plc, with Halifax becoming a division of Bank of Scotland. A takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB was approved by the Court of Session on 12 January 2009, and on 19 January 2009 Bank of Scotland, including Halifax, formally became part of Lloyds Banking Group.

[[Sectional curvature]]
CATEGORIES: Riemannian geometry, Curvature (mathematics)

In Riemannian geometry, the sectional curvature is one of the ways to describe the curvature of Riemannian manifolds. The sectional curvature K(σp) depends on a two-dimensional plane σp in the tangent space at p. It is the Gaussian curvature of the surface which has the plane σp as a tangent plane at p, obtained from geodesics which start at p in the directions of σp (in other words, the image of σp under the exponential map at p). The sectional curvature is a smooth real-valued function on the 2-Grassmannian bundle over the manifold.
The sectional curvature determines the curvature tensor completely.

End of paragraph.[]

[[Scalar curvature]]

CATEGORIES: Curvature (mathematics)

In Riemannian geometry, the scalar curvature (or the Ricci scalar) is the simplest  curvature invariant of a Riemannian manifold. To each point on a Riemannian manifold,  it assigns a single real number determined by the intrinsic geometry of the manifold near that point.  Specifically, the scalar curvature represents the amount by which the volume of a geodesic ball in a curved Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space.  In two dimensions, the scalar curvature is twice the Gaussian curvature, and completely characterizes the curvature of a surface. In more than two dimensions, however, the curvature of Riemannian manifolds involves more than one functionally independent quantity.
In general relativity, the scalar curvature is the Lagrangian density for the Einstein–Hilbert action.  The Euler–Lagrange equations for this Lagrangian under variations in the metric constitute the vacuum Einstein field equations, and the stationary metrics are known as Einstein metrics. The scalar curvature is defined as the trace of the Ricci tensor, and it can be characterized as a multiple of the average of the sectional curvatures at a point.  Unlike the Ricci tensor and sectional curvature, however, global results involving only the scalar curvature are extremely subtle and difficult.  One of the few is the positive mass theorem of Richard Schoen, Shing-Tung Yau and Edward Witten. Another is the Yamabe problem, which seeks extremal metrics in a given conformal class for which the scalar curvature is constant.

[[Gaussian curvature]]

CATEGORIES: Curvature (mathematics), Differential geometry, Differential geometry of surfaces, Surfaces

In differential geometry, the Gaussian curvature or Gauss curvature of a point on a surface is the product of the principal curvatures, κ1 and κ2, of the given point. It is an intrinsic measure of curvature, i.e., its value depends only on distances that are measured on the surface, not on the way it is isometrically embedded in space. This result is the content of Gauss's Theorema egregium.
Symbolically, the Gaussian curvature Κ is defined as
where κ1 and κ2 are the principal curvatures.

Marketing warfare strategies are a type of strategies, used in business and marketing, that try to draw parallels between business and warfare, and then apply the principles of military strategy to business situations, with competing firms considered as analogous to sides in a military conflict, and market share considered as analogous to the territory which is being fought over [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]. It is argued that, in mature, low-growth markets, and when real GDP growth is negative or low, business operates as a zero-sum game. One person’s gain is possible only at another person’s expense.

Suck on This is a live album by the band Primus, released in 1989. At the time of recording, the featured lineup of bassist/vocalist Les Claypool, guitarist Larry LaLonde and drummer Tim Alexander had only been playing together for "about two months".Liner notes, Suck on This (reissue), Prawn Song Records 2002. This along with Jane's Addiction's self-titled live album, are seen as popularizing the then underground alternative metal genre, which in turn spawned nu metal & inspired the groove metal genre.http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/alternative-metal-d2697
The album was recorded live at the Berkeley Square in Berkeley, California on February 25 and March 5, 1989, on a TASCAM quarter-inch 8-track Portastudio and mixed on Hi-Fi VHS. The band borrowed $3,000 from Claypool's father to cover the recording and pressing of one thousand copies of the album for its initial limited run. They released the record in November 1989 through their own independent label under the name Prawn Song Records before licensing it to Caroline Records in 1990,Illustrated Discography, Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People DVD, Interscope Records 2003. and later Interscope Records.Suck on This at Discogs. On April 23, 2002, Prawn Song reissued the album with remastered audio, together with the follow-up studio album Frizzle Fry.
All of the songs would eventually be released as studio recordings: "Tommy the Cat" on Sailing the Seas of Cheese in 1991, "Pressman" on Pork Soda in 1993, "Jellikit" on the Airheads soundtrack in 1994 as "Bastardizing Jellikit", and "The Heckler" on Antipop in 1999 as a hidden track. All other tracks were included on the band's debut studio album Frizzle Fry in 1990.
The original liner notes give "hugs and kisses" to a number of bands and local businesses, including Faith No More and Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys, followed by "special hugs and kisses" to a number of individuals, including early Primus members Todd Huth, Jay Lane, Vince Parker and Tim Wright, and "Pops" (Claypool's father) "for kickin' down the corn".Liner notes, Suck on This, Interscope Records 1990. For the 2002 reissue, these sections were omitted in favour of a paragraph written by Claypool detailing the history of the record, leaving only "special thanks" to Claypool's father.

CATEGORIES: History of Hungary, Hungarian language, Runiform scripts, Unicode proposals

The Old Hungarian script is an alphabetic writing system used by the Hungarians in the Middle Ages.
The Hungarians settled the Carpathian Basin in 896. After the establishment of the Christian Hungarian kingdom, the script fell into disuse because Latin alphabet was adopted. In remote regions of Transylvania, however, the script remained in marginal use by the Székely Magyars at least until the 17th century, giving its Hungarian name székely rovásírás.
The Old Hungarian script has also been described as "runic" or "runiform" because it is superficially reminiscent of the Germanic runic alphabet.Everson & Szelp (2012) The English name in ISO 15924 is Old Hungarian (Hungarian Runic).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/codechanges.html|publisher=ISO 15924|title=ISO 15924/RA Notice of Changes[/tpl]Code request for the Rovas script in ISO 15924 (2012-10-20)

The Council of the North was an administrative body set up in 1472 by King Edward IV of England, the first Yorkist monarch to hold the Crown of England, to improve government control and economic prosperity, to benefit all of Northern England. Edward's brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III) was its first Lord President.Richard III Timeline 
The Council was based in Yorkshire throughout its history: first at Sheriff Hutton Castle and at Sandal Castle, and then at King's Manor, York. Henry VIII re-established the Council after the English Reformation, when the north became identified with Roman Catholicism. It was abolished in the preamble to the English Civil War.

He opened his first AME church in 1794 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was elected the first bishop of the AME Church in 1816. Allen was one of America's most active and influential black leaders.  He focused on organizing a denomination where free blacks could worship without racial oppression and where slaves could find a measure of dignity.  He worked to upgrade the social status of the black community, organizing Sabbath schools to teach literacy, and promoting national organizations to develop political strategies.Suzanne Niemeyer, editor, Research Guide to American Historical Biography: vol. IV (1990) pp. 1779–1782
Born into slavery, Allen had no formal education. As a young man in Delaware, he worked to buy his freedom.  He went to Philadelphia in 1786, licensed as a Methodist preacher.  He belonged for a time to St. George's Methodist Church, but he and his supporters resented its segregation and decided to leave the church. In 1787 he and Absalom Jones founded the Free African Society (FAS), a non-denominational, mutual aid society for blacks in Philadelphia, which particularly helped widows and children. Eventually they each founded independent black congregations in 1794.

The title of Earl of Athlone has been created three times. It was created first in the Peerage of Ireland in 1692 by King William III for the Dutch General Baron Godard van Reede, Lord of Ginkel, to honour him for his successful battles in Ireland. The title also had the subsidiary title of Baron Aghrim.  These titles became extinct in 1844 upon the death of the 9th Earl. The Earls did bear the Dutch nobility title Baron van Reede as well (hereditary in male line; still existing in the Netherlands).
The second creation was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, as a subsidiary title of the Dukedom of Clarence and Avondale, and was conferred in 1890 upon HRH Prince Albert Victor of Wales, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. When he died in 1892, the title became extinct. 
The third creation was in 1917, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom for the former Prince Alexander of Teck, younger brother of Queen Mary, along with the subsidiary title of Viscount Trematon.

Raven Oak (born December 21, 1977 in Riverside, California) is an American author, whose written works range from science fiction & fantasy to mystery and young adult literature. She wrote her first novel, a 320 page fantasy work at age twelve.Oak, Raven., Official Website Biography. She is also a singer, pianist and songwriter, whose musical works deal with the survival side of life. 
She grew up in many places around the U.S. including Michigan, Oklahoma, Florida, and Texas, where she eventually attended Richland College and later the University of North Texas as a music major. She received both her Bachelor of Science Degree and Master of Science Degree in CECS from UNT.
Her first CD, "Walls, Boxes, & Jars", was written when her attempts at writing music for college music classes resulted in being "shoved into one category or another." Her CD's sales donated to RAINN, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network. RAINN, founded by singer/pianist Tori Amos, is America's only national hotline for rape and abuse.http://www.safe4all.org/resource-list/view/36322.
"After working through the horrors in my life, I really wanted to give back to a resource that helps so many people. Victims tend to stay victims—I wanted to learn how to be a survivor. RAINN helped with that."
Of Raven's music, Score! Music says: "Perfectly stunning musical compositions that, though they lack vocals, do not lack in emotional impact; it’s as though one can venture inside Raven’s being through her beautiful piano work. Think Tori Amos unplugged and without lyrics."Score! Music Magazine., Jeanne. October 2002.

The OX-5 was an early V-8 American liquid-cooled aircraft engine built by Curtiss. It was the first US-designed engine to enter mass production, although it was considered obsolete when it did so in 1917.Smith, 1981, page 46 It nevertheless found widespread use on a number of aircraft, perhaps the most famous being the JN-4 "Jenny".  Some 12,600 units were built through early 1919. The wide availability of the engine in the surplus market made it common until the 1930s, although it was considered unreliable for most of its service life. Today the engine can be found powering many Edwardian automobile racing specials on the historic racing scene.

Walls, Boxes, & Jars (2001), featuring the popular songs "Tidal Wave Goodbye" and "Ligeia", was the debut album of writer and pianist Raven Oak. Written while facing the constraints of college music classes, this album explores the depths of the categories, labels, and boxes society often forces upon survivors. This album helped pave the way for Raven Oak, a survivor of rape and abuse, to freely express herself, no longer a silent victim.
From gentle mourning, to fire filled anger, this album truly shows the complex range of emotions available through means of a piano. One track, "MZB", was written just after author Marion Zimmer Bradley (of The Mists of Avalon) died as a tribute to her works.
This album also donates to RAINN, the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network.

The principle of indifference (also called principle of insufficient reason) is a rule for assigning epistemic probabilities.
Suppose that there are n > 1 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive possibilities.
The principle of indifference states that if the n possibilities are indistinguishable except for their names,
then each possibility should be assigned a probability equal to 1/n.
In Bayesian probability, this is the simplest non-informative prior.
The principle of indifference is meaningless under the frequency interpretation of probability,[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] in which probabilities are relative frequencies rather than degrees of belief in uncertain propositions, conditional upon state information.

Their common name velvet ant refers to their dense pile of hair which most often is bright scarlet or orange, but may also be black, white, silver, or gold. Black and white specimens are sometimes known as panda ants due to their hair coloration resembling that of the Chinese giant panda. Their bright colours serve as aposematic signals. They are known for their extremely painful stings, hence the common name cow killer or cow ant. Unlike a real ant, they do not have drones, workers, and queens.

Géza I ([tpl]IPA-hu|ˈɡeːzɒ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-hu|I. Géza[/tpl]; [tpl]circa[/tpl] 1040[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]25 April 1077) was King of Hungary from 1074 until his death. He was the eldest son of King Béla I. His baptismal name was Magnus. When his father died in 1063, Géza's cousin Solomon acquired the crown with German assistance, forcing Géza to leave Hungary. Géza returned with Polish reinforcements and signed a treaty with Solomon in early 1064. In the treaty, Géza and his brother, Ladislaus acknowledged the rule of Solomon, who granted them their father's former duchy, which encompassed one-third of the Kingdom of Hungary.
Géza closely cooperated with Solomon, but their relationship became tense from 1071. The king invaded the duchy in February 1074 and defeated Géza in a battle. However, Géza was victorious at the decisive battle of Mogyoród on 14 March 1074. He soon acquired the throne, although Solomon maintained his rule in the regions of Moson and Pressburg (Bratislava, Slovakia) for years. Géza initiated peace negotiations with his dethroned cousin in the last months of his life. Géza's sons were minors when he died and he was succeeded by his brother Ladislaus.

[[Last mile]]

CATEGORIES: Local loop, Network access, Internet architecture

The last mile or last kilometer is a phrase used by the telecommunications, cable television and internet industries to refer to the final leg of the telecommunications networks delivering communications connectivity to retail customers, the part that actually reaches the customer.  Examples are the copper wire subscriber lines connecting telephones to the local telephone exchange, coaxial cable service drops carrying cable television signals from utility poles to subscribers' homes, and cell towers linking local cell phones to the cellular network.  The word "mile" is used metaphorically; the length of the last mile link may be more or less than a mile.  Because the last mile of a network to the user is also the first mile from the user to the world when he is sending data (such as uploading), the term first mile is sometimes used.
The last mile is typically the speed bottleneck in communication networks; its bandwidth limits the bandwidth of data that can be delivered to the customer.  This is because retail telecommunication networks have the topology of "trees", with relatively few high capacity "trunk" communication channels branching out to feed many final mile "leaves".  The final mile links, as the most numerous and thus most expensive part of the system, are the most difficult to upgrade to new technology. For example, telephone trunklines that carry phone calls between switching centers are made of modern optical fiber, but the last mile twisted pair telephone wiring that provides service to customer premises has not changed much in 100 years.
To solve the problem of providing enhanced services over the last mile, some firms have been mixing networks for decades. One example is fixed wireless access, where a wireless network is used instead of wires to connect a stationary terminal to the wireline network. Various solutions are being developed which are seen as an alternative to the last mile of standard incumbent local exchange carriers. These include WiMAX and broadband over power lines applications.

Wenceslaus was the last of the male Přemyslid rulers of Bohemia. His sister Elizabeth married John of Luxembourg, who was elected King of Bohemia four years after his death.

A milestone is one of a series of numbered markers placed along a road or boundary at intervals of one mile or occasionally, parts of a mile. They are typically located at the side of the road or in a median. They are alternatively known as mile markers, mileposts or mile posts (sometimes abbreviated MPs). Mileage is the distance along the road from a fixed commencement point.
Milestones are constructed to provide reference points along the road. This can be used to reassure travellers that the proper path is being followed, and to indicate either distance travelled or the remaining distance to a destination. Such references are also used by maintenance engineers and emergency services to direct them to specific points where their presence is required. This term is sometimes used to denote a location on a road even if no physical sign is present. This is useful for accident reporting and other record keeping (e.g., "an accident occurred at the 13 mile mark" even if the road is only marked with a stone once every 10 miles).

[[Thalassemia]]

CATEGORIES: Autosomal recessive disorders, Hereditary hemolytic anemias, Disorders of globin and globulin proteins

Thalassemia (British English: thalassaemia) are forms of inherited autosomal recessive blood disorders that originated in the Mediterranean region. In thalassemia, the disorder is caused by the weakening and destruction of red blood cells.  Thalassemia is caused by variant or missing genes that affect how the body makes hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. People with thalassemia make less hemoglobin and have fewer circulating red blood cells than normal, which results in mild or severe anemia. Thalassemia will be present as microcytic anemia.
Thalassemia can cause significant complications, including iron overload, bone deformities and cardiovascular illness. However this same inherited disease of red blood cells may confer a degree of protection against malaria, which is or was prevalent in the regions where the trait is common.  This selective survival advantage of carriers (known as heterozygous advantage) may be responsible for perpetuating the mutation in populations. In that respect, the various thalassemias resemble another genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin, sickle-cell disease.[tpl]cite book |last=Weatherall |first=David J |chapter=Ch. 47: The Thalassemias: Disorders of Globin Synthesis |chapterurl=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=358&sectionid=39835865 |editor=Lichtman MA, Kipps TJ, Seligsohn U, Kaushansky K, Prchal, JT |title=Williams Hematology |edition=8e |url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/book.aspx?bookid=358[/tpl]

The Appomattox Courthouse is the current courthouse in Appomattox, Virginia built in  1892. It is located in the middle of the state about three miles (5 km) southwest of the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, once known as Clover Hill - home of the original Old Appomattox Court House. The "new" Appomattox Courthouse is near the Appomattox Station and where the regional county government is located.

[[Limit of a function]]

CATEGORIES: Limits (mathematics), Functions and mappings

 
  
  
 Although the function (sin x)/x is not defined at zero, as x becomes closer and closer to zero, (sin x)/x becomes arbitrarily close to 1. In other words, the limit of (sin x)/x as x approaches zero equals 1.

In mathematics, the limit of a function is a fundamental concept in calculus and analysis concerning the behavior of that function near a particular input.
Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f(x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f(x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist.
The notion of a limit has many applications in modern calculus.  In particular, the many definitions of continuity employ the limit: roughly, a function is continuous if all of its limits agree with the values of the function.  It also appears in the definition of the derivative: in the calculus of one variable, this is the limiting value of the slope of secant lines to the graph of a function.

[[Limit of a sequence]]

CATEGORIES: Limits (mathematics), Sequences and series

 
  
  
 
 
 As the positive integer n becomes larger and larger, the value n sin(1/n) becomes arbitrarily close to 1. We say that "the limit of the sequence n sin(1/n) equals 1."

In mathematics, the limit of a sequence is the value that the terms of a sequence "tend to".Courant (1961), p. 29.  If such a limit exists, the sequence is called convergent. A sequence which does not converge is said to be divergent.Courant (1961), p. 39. The limit of a sequence is said to be the fundamental notion on which the whole of analysis ultimately rests.
Limits can be defined in any metric or topological space, but are usually first encountered in the real numbers.

[[Reverse migration (birds)]]

CATEGORIES: Bird migration, Ornithological terminology

Reverse migration is a phenomenon in bird migration. Although some large birds such as swans learn migration routes from their parents, in most small species, such as passerines, the route is genetically programmed, and young birds can innately navigate to their wintering area. 
 Reverse Migration 
Sometimes this programming goes wrong, and the young bird, in its first autumn, migrates on a route 180° from the correct route. This is shown in the diagram, where the breeding range of a hypothetical Asian species is shown in yellow. The correct migration route to the wintering grounds in south east Asia is indicated in red.
If a bird sets off in the opposite direction, shown by the orange arrow, it will end up in Western Europe instead of South East Asia. This is a mechanism that leads to birds such as Pallas's Warbler turning up thousands of kilometres from where they should be. Keith Vinicombe suggested that birds from east of Lake Baikal in Siberia (circled) could not occur in western Europe because the migration routes were too north-south.
Most of these lost young birds perish in unsuitable wintering grounds, but there is some evidence that a few survive, and either re-orient in successive winters, or even return to the same area.
An article in British Birds by James Gilroy and Alexander Lees in September 2003 suggested that misorientation occurs in random directions, but differential survival in different directions combined with asymmetric observer coverage leads to the observed distribution of vagrants. Although "reverse migration" per se certainly does occur, and has been documented well in numerous instances, it does not account for the occurrence in Europe in autumn of Asian vagrants that winter in East Africa, for instance, or the rarity of many southern European species in the UK that winter in West Africa.

[[Toon Hermans]]

CATEGORIES: 1916 births, 2000 deaths, Dutch comedians, Dutch male singers, Dutch comedy musicians, Dutch cabaret performers, People from Sittard

Antoine G. T. "Toon" Hermans (17 December 1916 – 22 April 2000) was a noted Dutch comedian, singer and writer. He was born in Sittard, now part of the municipality of Sittard-Geleen.
Toon Hermans began performing in the 1930s, achieving local, regional and, eventually, national fame in the Netherlands as a comedian during the post-war decades. Together with Wim SonneveldWim Sonneveld Dutch wikipedia and Wim KanWim Kan, Dutch wikipedia he was considered one of the "Great Three" (grote drie) of Dutch cabaret during the 1950s and 1960s.
While Sonneveld became known for more serious, more searching kinds of cabaret as well as expansion into other areas of amusement such as musicals, and while Kan focussed more and more on purely political satire, Toon Hermans remained true to his one lifetime love: simple home-grown humor, the ability to make people laugh. His humor was of a disarmingly genuine kind. His one-man shows usually consisted of stories he would tell, often based on the life of his youth in a small town in Limburg, with a typical panoplia of family members, neighbours, friends (some enemies), cats and dogs, which he presented in an irresistibly hilarious manner; and interspersed with simple, charming, crystal clear songs about life, love, and happiness.
Subsequent generations of Dutch cabaret artists, and the theater critics of the 1970s and 1980s, were not much impressed by Toon Hermans' unpretentious, politically and socially disengaged entertainment, but his fan base remained very large and his road shows continued to attract very large crowds.
As was the case for other cabaret artists, the transition from theatrical performance to television shows was associated with ups and downs, and some believe that the most deeply felt and enduring appeal of his shows was lost in the latter medium, but he nevertheless achieved significant successes even on television, his one-man show in 1967 supposedly having been watched by 6 million, that is half the population of Holland at the time.
After the death of his wife and lifelong companion in 1991 it appeared that his career had ended, but in 1992 he surprised friends and foes by starting a new tour with a whole new show, different in nature from any he had done before. While the second half of the program was the same kind of straightforward, nonsensical humor that had always been his hallmark, the first half of the new show entitled "Ik heb je lief" (a deeper statement than "I love you", not unlike "I love thee") consisted only of songs, in a mixture of simple jazz and French-style "chanson", that were tributes to love and, indirectly, to his late wife. To the delight of his fans, he toured with this show for about one year, when one evening in Haarlem he broke down during the program and had to cancel the remainder of the tour. As he himself explained, the sadness over his loss had finally caught up with him. He was nonetheless able to return to the stage a few years later with a new show, and remained active for several more years until his death in 2000.
Many of his shows have been recorded, starting with his one-man show in 1958. There have also been quite a number of publications of collections of poems of his hand. These collection started with simple poems, or rather, rhymes, that were humorous but sometimes contained a more serious note; but later it appeared that Toon Hermans may have tried to create more serious poetry, which was not altogether successful (and perhaps it was not he, but his publishers, who tried to put this spin on things).
Toon Hermans' humor was typically Dutch, or rather, typical for the southern part of the Netherlands; and was also appreciated in Flanders. Moreover, during the late 1950s and 1960s he had considerable success touring in Germany and Austria with a German-language show. He also produced an English-language show in the late 1960s that was test-run in Canada but it appears that the show never made it to Broadway.
Among his many memorable contributions, perhaps none are as widely recognized as the song "Vierentwintig rozen" – "Twenty-four roses", included in many of his one-man shows over the decades. This song consists of a long listing of completely unrelated but numbered items "three little boys playing football in the alley way – 16 sailboats anchored in the sun-lit bay" and on and on and on (and different ones for each new version of his show); and then ending with "and Twenty-four roses, Twenty-four roses, Twenty-four roses – for you". It became almost as a ritual when the first notes of this song were played by the orchestra, the audiences would erupt in a loud ovation, and Toon Hermans would once again delight his audience with his signature mixture of humor, genuine feeling, mastery of words, love of the theater, and love of life.

[[Radio Kabul]]

CATEGORIES: Afghan media, Radio stations in Afghanistan, Media in Kabul

Radio Kabul is the official radio station of Afghanistan.  The name Radio Kabul has been given to many different incarnations of the state-run radio station since the first radio transmitters were installed in Kabul in the 1920s.
In 1925, a 200 watt Russian transmitter operating at AM 833 kHz was installed in Kabul Palace by King Amanullah Khan.  This transmitter was destroyed in the 1929 uprising against the king.  The transmitter was replaced in 1931 by the new king Mohammed Nadir Shah, and was upgraded in 1940 when a new 20 kilowatt transmitter was installed in its place, operating at 600 kHz.  This is generally considered the official birth of Radio Kabul.  Programs were broadcast in Pashto, Dari-Persian, Hindi, English, and French.
Throughout the modern history of Afghanistan, the radio has been controlled by (and renamed by) the currently ruling party.  As King Mohammed Zahir Shah tried to reinforce his goal of pan-Afghan unity, the station's name was changed in 1953 to the Afghan Broadcasting System, and again in 1960 to Radio Afghanistan.  During times of relative peace in the 1960s and 70s, Radio Kabul hosted a whole generation of traditional and modern Afghan artists such as Ustad Mohammad Hussain Sarahang, Ustad Farida Mahwash, and Ustad Mohammad Hashem Cheshti.  These master musicians were revered not only in Afghanistan but also in India, Pakistan, and the entire Middle East.
In 1973, when the King was overthrown in a coup, the change of government was announced by the new leaders over the radio station.  After the Soviet Union installed a puppet government in 1979, Radio Kabul was controlled by the Soviet-backed government and was used to rebroadcast pro-Soviet propaganda directly from the Soviet Union.
During the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1990, the radio station was damaged several times during the fighting, changing hands as different factions gained control of Kabul.  In 1996, when the Taliban gained control of Kabul, the station's name was changed to Shariat Ghagh, which means Voice of Sharia.  As the Taliban consolidated their power throughout the country, the radio station was used to rally Taliban supporters and to broadcast new edicts by the ruling mullahs.
The Taliban banned music on the new station and ordered the destruction of the radio archives, which contained irreplaceable tapes of Radio Kabul music and political programs going back over forty years.  The tapes were presumed to have been lost forever, but in 2002 the BBC reported that, miraculously, the archives survived not only the Taliban but the utter destruction of the Radio Kabul building by American bombs during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001.Kabul's radio treasure trove BBC Online
After the Taliban were driven from power, Radio Kabul resumed its music and political programs.

It breeds in Africa south of the Sahara, in both wet and arid habitats, often near human habitation, especially waste tips. It is sometimes called the "Undertaker Bird" due to its shape from behind: cloak-like wings and back, skinny white legs, and sometimes a large white mass of "hair".

[[File:Use of Sharia by country.svg|250px|thumb|India with respect to [[Application of sharia by country|other
countries by use of Sharia law]]:

]]
Uniform civil code in India is the debate to replace the existing personal laws, which are based on the scriptures and customs of each major religious community in the country, with a common set governing every citizen. These laws are distinguished from public law and cover marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption and maintenance.  Article 44 of the Directive Principles in India sets the implementation of a uniform civil code throughout the country as duty of the State. It became one of the most controversial topics in contemporary Indian politics during the Shah Bano case in 1985, where a divorced Muslim woman sought maintenance from her husband. The debate then focused on the Muslim Personal Law, which is partially based on the Sharia law and remains unreformed since 1937, permitting unilateral divorce and polygamy in the country. The demand for it was first put forward by women activists in the beginning of the twentieth century, with the objective of women's rights, equality and secularism in India. The Bano case made it a politicised public issue focused on identity politics—by means of attacking specific religious minorities versus protecting its cultural identity. The Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janta Party and the Left support it while the Congress Party and All India Muslim Personal Law Board oppose it.
The personal laws were first framed during the British Raj, mainly for Hindu and Muslim citizens. The Hindu orthodox law discriminated against women by depriving them of inheritance, remarriage and divorce. The British feared opposition from community leaders and refrained from interfering with this domestic sphere of the Indian citizens. Till Independence in 1947, a few law reforms were passed to improve their condition, especially that of Hindu widows. In 1956, the Indian Parliament passed Hindu Code Bill amidst significant opposition. Though a demand for a uniform civil code was made by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, his supporters and women activists, they had to finally accept the compromise of it being added to the Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution. The Shah Bano case resulted in her being granted maintenance under the All India Criminal Code. Amidst the political debate that followed, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986 was passed, which exempted Muslims from the Criminal Code—a setback to family law uniformity.

In 1953, Ilon applied for a job as illustrator at Rabén & Sjögren. She was met by Astrid, who had just finished writing the book Mio, my Son and who could see immediately that Ilon was able to “draw fairytales”. Ilon did a test-drawing for the book and after that her collaboration with Astrid Lindgren continued.
Ilon has said that Astrid’s writing continually makes her see inner pictures. She also derives inspiration for her pictures from real life. In the same way that Astrid Lindgren wrote for “the child within her”, Ilon often also draws for the child within her.

[[People's Chamber]]
CATEGORIES: Government of East Germany, Defunct unicameral legislatures, 1949 establishments in East Germany, 1990 disestablishments in Germany

The People's Chamber  (German: Volkskammer) was the unicameral legislature of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).  From its founding in 1949 until the first free elections on 18 March 1990, all members of the Volkskammer were elected on a slate controlled by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), called the National Front. Despite the appearance of a multi-party system, all these Bloc parties were completely subservient to the SED. In addition, seats were also allocated to various mass organizations affiliated with the SED, such as the Free German Youth.
Initially, it was the lower house of a bicameral legislature.  The upper chamber was the Chamber of States, or Länderkammer, but in 1952 the states of East Germany were dissolved, and the chamber was abolished in 1958.
In theory, the Volkskammer was the highest organ of state power in the GDR. Both GDR constitutions vested it with great lawmaking powers.  It also formally appointed the Council of State (after 1960), the Council of Ministers, and the National Defence Council.  All other branches of government—including the judiciary—were theoretically responsible to it.
In practice, like most other legislatures in Communist countries, the People's Chamber did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the SED and its Politburo.  All parties were expected to respect the principles of democratic centralism and the leading role of the SED.  As a result, all but two measures put before it before the Peaceful Revolution passed unanimously.  A 1972 vote on liberalising abortion laws saw 14 CDU representatives vote nay and eight abstain, and the 1989 vote to confirm Egon Krenz as head of state saw 26 nays and 26 abstentions.
During People's Chamber elections, voters were presented with a single list from the National Front, with seats allocated based on a set quota rather than actual vote totals.Eugene Register-Guard October 29, 1989. p. 5A.  By ensuring that its candidates dominated the list, the SED effectively predetermined the composition of the legislature.
The "democratic centralist" principle extended to the ballot box as well. A voter simply took the ballot paper, which contained only one name, and dropped it into the ballot box.  A voter could vote against the candidate by crossing out his or her name, but had to do so in a separate voting booth without any secrecy. The consequences for such an act of defiance were severe—loss of one's job or expulsion from school, and close surveillance by the Stasi.[tpl]cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2[/tpl]
A typical slate was as follows:
In 1976, the Volkskammer moved into a specially-constructed building on Marx-Engels-Platz (now Schloßplatz again), the Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic).
After the 1990 elections, the disposition of the parties was as follows:

Mbuti (Bambuti) mythology is the mythology of the African Mbuti (also known as Bambuti) Pygmies of Congo.
The most important god of the Bambuti pantheon is Khonvoum (also Khonuum, Kmvoum, Chorum), a god of the hunt who wields a bow made from two snakes that together appear to humans as a rainbow.  After sunset every day, Khonvoum gathers fragments of the stars and throws them into the sun to revitalize it for the next day.  He occasionally contacts mortals through Gor (a thunder god who is also an elephant) or a chameleon (similar to the divine messenger used by Orish-nla of Yoruba mythology).  Khonvoum created mankind from clay.  Black people were made from black clay, white people came from white clay, and the Pygmies themselves came from red clay.  He also creates the animals that are needed by hunters.
Arebati is a lunar deity and Sky Father.  In some sources, he was said to have created humanity from clay, instead of Khonvoum.
Tore is a god of the forests who supplies animals to hunters.  He is also a thunder god who appears as a storm and hides in rainbows.  Most importantly, Tore appears as a leopard in the initiation rites.  The first Pygmies stole fire from Tore; he chased them but could not catch them, and when he returned home, his mother had died.  As punishment, he decreed that humans would also die, and he thus became the death god.
Negoogunogumbar is a child-eating giant.  Obrigwabibikwa is a dwarf who can change himself into a reptile.

The Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 19–20, 1944) was a decisive naval battle of World War II which eliminated the Imperial Japanese Navy's ability to conduct  large-scale carrier actions.  It took place during the United States' amphibious invasion of the Mariana Islands during the Pacific War.  The battle was the last of five major "carrier-versus-carrier" engagements between American and Japanese naval forces, and involved elements of the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet as well as ships and land-based aircraft from the  Imperial Japanese Navy's Mobile Fleet and nearby island garrisons.
The battle was nicknamed the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot by American aviators for the severely disproportional loss ratio inflicted upon Japanese aircraft by American pilots and anti-aircraft gunners.Shores, p. 189.  During a debriefing after the first two air battles a pilot from [tpl]USS|Lexington|CV-16|6[/tpl] remarked "Why, hell, it was just like an old-time turkey shoot down home!"[tpl]sfn|Potter|1990|p=160[/tpl] The outcome is generally attributed to American improvements in pilot and crew training and tactics, war technology, and ship and aircraft design.[tpl]#tag:ref|The Americans now used and were becoming practiced with the new radar-based Command Information Center, and anti-air defensive firepower was delivered on target.

A séance [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|.|ɑː|n|s[/tpl] or seance is an attempt to communicate with spirits. The word "séance" comes from the French word for "seat," "session" or "sitting," from the Old French "seoir," "to sit." In French, the word's meaning is quite general: one may, for example, speak of "une séance de cinéma" ("a movie session"). In English, however, the word came to be used specifically for a meeting of people who are gathered to receive messages from spirits or to listen to a spirit medium discourse with or relay messages from spirits; many people, including skeptics and non-believers, treat it as a form of entertainment. In modern English usage, participants need not be seated while engaged in a séance.
One of the earliest books on the subject of communication amongst deceased persons was Communitation With the Other Side by George, First Baron Lyttelton, published in England in 1760.[tpl]cite book|last=Lyttleton |first=George |last2=Montegue |first2=Eizabeth |title=Dialogues with the Dead |publisher=W. Sandby |location=London |year=1760 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17667/17667-h/17667-h.htm [/tpl] Among the notable spirits quoted in this volume are Peter the Great, Pericles, a "North-American Savage," William Penn, and Christina, Queen of Sweden. The popularity of séances grew dramatically with the founding of the religion of Spiritualism in the mid-nineteenth century. Perhaps the best-known series of séances conducted at that time were those of Mary Todd Lincoln who, grieving the loss of her son, organized Spiritualist séances in the White House, which were attended by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln, and other prominent members of society.[tpl]cite web|title=Telegrams from the Dead |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/TelegramsfromtheDead/ |year=1994 [/tpl] The 1887 Seybert Commission report marred the credibility of Spiritualism at the height of its popularity by publishing exposures of fraud and showmanship among secular séance leaders.Preliminary Report of the Commission Appointed by the University of Pennsylvania, The Seybert Commission, 1887. 1 April 2004. Modern séances continue to be a part of the religious services of Spiritualist, Spiritist, and Espiritismo churches today, where a greater emphasis is placed on spiritual values versus showmanship.

[[Fractal dimension]]
CATEGORIES: Chaos theory, Dynamical systems, Dimension theory, Fractals

A fractal dimension is a ratio providing a statistical index of complexity comparing how detail in a pattern (strictly speaking, a fractal pattern) changes with the scale at which it is measured. It has also been characterized as a measure of the space-filling capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently from the space it is embedded in; a fractal dimension does not have to be an integer.[tpl]cite book | last = Vicsek | first = Tamás | title = Fractal growth phenomena | publisher = World Scientific | location = Singapore New Jersey | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-981-02-0668-0 | page=10[/tpl]
The essential idea of "fractured" dimensions has a long history in mathematics, but the term itself was brought to the fore by Benoit Mandelbrot based on his 1967 paper on self-similarity in which he discussed fractional dimensions.[tpl]cite doi|10.1126/science.156.3775.636[/tpl] In that paper, Mandelbrot cited previous work by Lewis Fry Richardson describing the counter-intuitive notion that a coastline's measured length changes with the length of the measuring stick used (see Fig. 1). In terms of that notion, the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick. There are several formal mathematical definitions of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale.
One non-trivial example is the fractal dimension of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but it is by no means a rectifiable curve: the length of the curve between any two points on the Koch Snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional.[tpl]cite book | last = Harte | first = David | title = Multifractals | publisher = Chapman & Hall | location = London | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1-58488-154-4 |pages=3–4[/tpl] Therefore its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which in this case is a number between one and two.

A gentleman thief or lady thief, or [tpl]Nihongo|phantom thief|怪盗|Kaitō[/tpl] in the East, is a particularly well-behaving and apparently well bred thief.    A "gentleman or lady" is usually, but not always, a person with an inherited title of nobility and inherited wealth, who need not work for a living.  Such a person steals not in order to gain material wealth, but for adventure; they act without malice. These thieves rarely bother with anonymity or force, preferring to rely on their charisma, physical attractiveness, and clever misdirection to steal the most unobtainable objects — sometimes for their own support, but mostly for the thrill of the act itself.

[[Autoinjector]]

CATEGORIES: Medical equipment, Drug delivery devices

An autoinjector (or auto-injector) is a medical device designed to deliver a single dose of a particular (typically life-saving) drug.
Most autoinjectors are spring-loaded syringes. By design, autoinjectors are easy to use and are intended for self-administration by patients, or administration by untrained personnel. The site of injection depends on the drug loaded, but it typically is administered into the thigh or the buttocks. The injectors were initially designed to overcome the hesitation associated with self-administration of the needle-based drug delivery device.

Chilean Matorral. Ed. Mark McGinley. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC
It is sometimes referred to as the brush-tailed rat, and is also called the common degu, to distinguish it from the other members of the genus Octodon. Other members are also called degus, but they are distinguished by additional names. The name "degu" on its own, however, indicates either the genus Octodon or, more usually, O. degus. Degus are in the parvorder Caviomorpha of the infraorder Hystricognathi, along with the chinchilla and guinea pig. The word degu comes from the Mapudungun dewü (mouse, rat).[tpl]Citation |last= |first= |title=Diccionario Mapuche: Mapudungun/Español, Español/Mapudungun |language=Spanish |edition=2nd |year=2006 |editor=Muñoz Urrutia, Rafael |location=Santiago, Chile |isbn=956-8287-99-X |pages=104, 105, 141 |publisher=Editorial Centro Gráfico[/tpl]

[[Golden Horns of Gallehus]]
CATEGORIES: Archaeology of Denmark, Germanic paganism, Germanic art, Proto-Norse language, Elder Futhark inscriptions, Archaeological artifacts, Gold objects

The Golden Horns of Gallehus were two horns made of sheet gold,  discovered in Gallehus, north of Møgeltønder in Southern Jutland, Denmark.Official Danish news (DR) page with fact box regarding the subject [tpl]da icon[/tpl]; The horns are also identified as Tunderense  in older literature,   a learned Latin adjective formation of  Tundern, the old name of Tønder.
The horns date to the early 5th century, i.e. the beginning of the Germanic Iron Age.
The horns were found in 1639 and in 1734, respectively, at locations only some 15–20 metres apart. They were composed of segments of double sheet gold. The two horns were found incomplete; the longer one found in 1639 had seven segments with ornaments, to which six plain segments and a plain rim were added, possibly by the 17th-century restorer. The shorter horn found in 1734 had six segments, a narrow one bearing a Proto-Norse Elder Futhark inscription at the rim and five ornamented with images. It is uncertain whether the horns were intended as drinking horns, or as blowing horns, although drinking horns have more pronounced history as luxury items made from precious metal.
The original horns were stolen and melted down in 1802. Casts made of the horns in the late 18th century were also lost. Replicas of the horns must thus rely on 17th and 18th-century drawings exclusively and are accordingly fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless,  replicas of the original horns were produced and are exhibited at the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen, and the Moesgaard Museum, near Aarhus, Denmark. These replicas also have a history of having been stolen and retrieved twice, in 1993 and in 2007.

On the recommendation of a scriptwriter friend from junior high, Takashi Oda, he joined the script department at Shōchiku after the Great Kanto Earthquake. He soon became one of the studio's central screenwriters, penning for instance Aizen katsura (1938), one of its biggest prewar hits.
He is most known for his collaborations with Ozu, which began with Noda supplying the script for the director's first feature Sword of Penitence (1927) and led to such postwar masterpieces as Tokyo Story (1953). He co-wrote thirteen of Ozu's fifteen postwar films.
When the Writers Association of Japan was formed in 1950, Noda served as its first chair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.j-writersguild.org/society/history.html|title=Enkaku|publisher=Kyōdō kumiai Nihon shinario sakka kyōkai|language=Japanese|accessdate=30 November 2010[/tpl]

Love & Pop was filmed almost entirely on hand-held digital cameras, and contains some very unusual camera work, including many different mounted camera positions, such as on a model train riding on tracks. The film also flips from widescreen to 4:3 aspect, distorts (with effects such as a fisheye lens), confuses, and makes use of overlays stacked in layers to convey the character's emotions.

[[Email art]]

CATEGORIES: Computer networking, Email

Email art refers to artistic communication using the medium of email.  It includes computer graphics, animations, screensavers, digital scans of artwork in other media, and even ASCII art.  When exhibited, Email art can be either displayed on a computer screen or similar type of display device, or the work can be printed out and displayed.
Email art is an evolution of the networking Mail Art movement and began during the early 1990s. Chuck Welch, also known as Cracker Jack Kid, connected with early online artists and created a net-worker telenetlink. The historical evolution of the term "Email art" is documented in Chuck Welch's Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology published and edited by University of Calgary Press.http://www.actlab.utexas.edu/emma/Library/eternalnetwork.html  
There is an ongoing debate among some artists as to what the relationship of Email art to Mail Art should be, questioning whether it is a valid or meaningful genre of art, and asking if any digital art that is emailed constitutes "Email art". Guy Bleus (Ed.), Re: The E-Mail-Art & Internet-Art Manifesto, E-Pêle-Mêle: Electronic Mail-Art Netzine, Vol.III, #1, T.A.C.-42.292, Hasselt, 1997 There has been particular criticism by traditionally-minded mailartists who have perceived Email art to be akin to mass media or regarded it as spam.  Other criticisms of Email art from a mailartist perspective have focused on the lack of dimensionality of the attachment, the lack of intimacy compared with physical mail.
Nevertherless, by the end of the 1990s many mailartists, aware of increasing postal rates and cheaper internet access, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, inexpensive forms of digital communication. The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of Mail Art calls (invitations), Mail Art blogs and websites have become commonly used to display contributions and online documentation, and an increasing number of projects include an invitation to submit Email art digitally, either as the preferred channel or as an alternative to sending contributions by post.
In 2006, Ramzi Turki, a Tunisian artist, has received an e-mail containing a scanned work of Belgian artist Luc Fierens. He has emailed  this work to nearly 7000 e-mail addresses artists to solicit their interactions. This, makes he obtain about 200 contributions and answers.

[[Unicellular organism]]
CATEGORIES: Microorganisms

A unicellular organism, also known as a single-celled organism, is an organism that consists of only one cell, unlike a multicellular organism that consists of multiple cells. Historically the simple single celled organisms have sometimes been referred to as monads.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Monad|title=Monad|publisher=Biology online|accessdate=2011-06-30[/tpl] The main groups of unicellular organisms are bacteria, archaea, protozoa, unicellular algae and unicellular fungi. Unicellular organisms fall into two general categories: prokaryotic organisms and eukaryotic organisms. Unicellular organisms are believed to be the oldest form of life, possibly existing 3.8 billion years ago.[tpl]citation|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/27819/ch1_5.shtml|title=An Introduction to Cells|publisher=ThinkQuest|accessdate=2013-05-30[/tpl]
Prokaryotes, most Protista, and some fungi, are unicellular. Although some of these organisms live in colonies, they are still unicellular. These organisms live together, and each cell in the colony is the same. However, each individual cell must carry out all life processes to survive. In contrast, even the simplest multicellular organisms have cells that depend on each other to survive.
Some organisms are partially uni- and multicellular, like Dictyostelium discoideum. The other can be unicellular and multinucleate, like Myxogastria and Plasmodium.
‘Candidatus Magnetoglobus multicellularis’, related to Deltaproteobacteria, is a multicellular prokaryote. It is neither unicellular, nor a colony.
Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic size and are thus classified as microorganisms. However, some unicellular protists and bacteria are macroscopic and visible to the naked eye.Max Planck Society Research News Release Accessed 21 May 2009 Examples include:

Rocky Mountain National Park is a national park located in the north-central region of the U.S. state of Colorado.
It features majestic mountain views, mountain lakes, a variety of wildlife, varied climates and environments—from wooded forests to mountain tundra—and easy access to back-country trails and campsites. The park is located northwest of Boulder, Colorado, in the Rockies, and includes the Continental Divide and the headwaters of the Colorado River.
The park has five visitor centers. The park headquarters, Beaver Meadows Visitor Center, is a National Historic Landmark, designed by the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture at Taliesin West.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/miniguides/mgresults.cfm?destination=rocky_mountain@622&cur_section=sig&property_id=341490 |title=Beaver Meadows Visitor Center Review | Rocky Mountain NP | Fodor's Travel Guides |publisher=Fodors.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04[/tpl]
The park may be accessed by three roads: U.S. Highway 34, 36, and State Highway 7. Highway 7 enters the park for less than a mile, where it provides access to the Lily Lake Visitor Center which is closed indefinitely.  Farther south, spurs from route 7 lead to campgrounds and trail heads around Longs Peak and Wild Basin.  Highway 36 enters the park on the east side, where it terminates after a few miles at Highway 34.  Highway 34, known as Trail Ridge Road through the park, runs from the town of Estes Park on the east to Grand Lake on the southwest.  The road reaches an elevation of [tpl]convert|12183|ft|m[/tpl], and is closed by snow in winter.
The California Zephyr serves Granby (near the west entrance of the park) by rail from Denver, crossing the Continental Divide through the Moffat Tunnel well south of the park.  The park's website suggests Granby as an appropriate rail terminus for visitors,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/directions.htm |title=Rocky Mountains National Park directions page |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2013-05-24 |accessdate=2013-06-04[/tpl] although it lies about sixteen miles from the park without public transportation connections.

Situated ethics, often confused with situational ethics, is a view of applied ethics in which abstract standards from a culture or theory are considered to be far less important than the ongoing processes in which one is personally and physically involved, e.g. climate, ecosystem, etc.  It is one of several theories of ethics within the philosophy of action. 
There are also situated theories of economics, e.g. most green economics, and of knowledge, usually based on some situated ethics.  All emphasize the actual physical, geographical, ecological and infrastructural state the actor is in, which determines that actor's actions or range of actions - all deny that there is any one point of view from which to apply standards of or by authority.  This makes such theories unpopular with authority, and popular with those who advocate political decentralisation.

Gerlinde Obermeier (1942-1984) was feminist writer known for her critiques on mental health care.
She wrote I Will Not and San Francisco, of Course (or Positively San Francisco as she herself translated the title).
Obermeier has been credited by some critics with mystical insights in her writing. This perhaps makes too much of a visit to India. In 1976 she spent three weeks in India with Swami Paramananda Saraswati. This visit is detailed in Malachi O'Doherty's memoir, I Was A Teenage Catholic. It seems more appropriate to read her explorations of madness as relating to a celebration of anarchic thinking than as grounded in Eastern religion.
She died by suicide in her early forties in Vienna in 1984.

He gained his first followers in Asia, and gained many more during his march to the Euphrates. He later fled to Parthia and tried to gain their support by claiming that they owed him (claiming as Nero) some requital for the return of Armenia.

CATEGORIES: Modular forms, Analytic number theory, Moduli theory, Special functions

In mathematics, a modular form is a (complex) analytic function on the upper half-plane satisfying a certain kind of functional equation with respect to the group action of the modular group, and also satisfying a growth condition. The theory of modular forms therefore belongs to complex analysis but the main importance of the theory has traditionally been in its connections with number theory. Modular forms appear in other areas, such as algebraic topology and string theory.
A modular function is a modular form invariant with respect to the modular group but without the condition that f(z) be holomorphic at infinity. Instead, modular functions are meromorphic at infinity. 
Modular form theory is a special case of the more general theory of automorphic forms, and therefore can now be seen as just the most concrete part of a rich theory of discrete groups.

Lipolysis [tpl]IPAc-en|l|ɨ|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ɨ|s|ɪ|s[/tpl] is the breakdown of lipids and involves hydrolysis of triglycerides into glycerol and free fatty acids. The following hormones induce lipolysis: epinephrine, norepinephrine, ghrelin, growth hormone, testosterone, and cortisol. These trigger 7TM receptors (G protein-coupled receptors), which activate adenylate cyclase. This results in increased production of cAMP, which activates protein kinase A, which subsequently activates lipases found in adipose tissue.
Triglycerides are transported through the blood to appropriate tissues (adipose, muscle, etc.) by lipoproteins such as VLDL (Very-Low-Density-Lipoproteins). Triglycerides present on the VLDL undergo lipolysis by the cellular lipases of target tissues, which yields glycerol and free fatty acids.  Free fatty acids released into the blood are then available for cellular uptake.[tpl]cite web|url=http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/fatty-acid-oxidation.html|title=Oxidation of Fatty Acids|accessdate=9 April 2012|author=Michael W King, PhD|publisher=themedicalbiochemistrypage.org, LLC[/tpl]  Free fatty acids not immediately taken up by cells may bind to albumin for transport to surrounding tissues that require energy. Serum albumin is the major carrier of free fatty acids in the blood.Tom Brody, Nutritional Biochemistry, (Academic Press, 2nd edition 1999), 215-216. ISBN 0121348369  The glycerol also enters the bloodstream and is absorbed by the liver or kidney where it is converted to glycerol 3-phosphate by the enzyme glycerol kinase. Hepatic glycerol 3-phosphate is converted mostly into dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) and then glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) to rejoin the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway.
While lipolysis is triglyceride hydrolysis (the process by which triglycerides are broken down), esterification is the process by which triglycerides are formed. Esterification and lipolysis are, in essence, reversals of one another.[tpl]cite book |author=Baldwin, Kenneth David Sutherland; Brooks, George H.; Fahey, Thomas D. |title=Exercise physiology: human bioenergetics and its applications |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-07-255642-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]

The USS ''Franklin'' (CV/CVA/CVS-13, AVT-8), nicknamed "Big Ben," was one of 24 [tpl]Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier[/tpl]s built during World War II for the United States Navy, and the fifth US Navy ship to bear the name. Commissioned in January 1944, she served in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning four battle stars. She was badly damaged by a Japanese air attack in March 1945, with the loss of over 800 of her crew, becoming the most heavily damaged United States carrier to survive the war.Friedman, p. 232 Movie footage of the actual attack was included in the 1949 film Task Force starring Gary Cooper.
After the attack, she returned to the U.S. mainland for repairs, missing the rest of the war; she was decommissioned in 1947. While in reserve, she was reclassified as an attack carrier (CVA), then an antisubmarine carrier (CVS), and finally an aircraft transport (AVT), but was never modernized and never saw active service again. Franklin and [tpl]USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|2[/tpl] (damaged by a kamikaze) were the only Essex-class carriers not to see active service as aircraft carriers after World War II.Friedman, p. 156 The Franklin was sold for scrap in 1966.

[[Platonic love]]

CATEGORIES: Friendship, Love, Non-sexuality, Philosophy of love

Platonic love is a type of love that is chaste and non-sexual. The term is named after Plato, who philosophized about the nature of love. Platonic love in this original sense of the term is examined in Plato's dialogue the Symposium, which has as its topic the subject of love or Eros generally. It explains the possibilities of how the feeling of love began and how it has evolved—both sexually and non-sexually. Of particular importance is the speech of  Socrates, relating the ideas attributed to the prophetess Diotima, which present love as a means of ascent to contemplation of the divine. For Diotima, and for Plato generally, the most correct use of love of other human beings is to direct one's mind to love of divinity. 
In short, with genuine platonic love, the beautiful or lovely other person inspires the mind and the soul and directs one's attention to spiritual things. Socrates, in Plato's "Symposium", explained two types of love or Eros—Vulgar Eros or earthly love and Divine Eros or divine love. Vulgar Eros is nothing but mere material attraction towards a beautiful body for physical pleasure and reproduction. Divine Eros begins the journey from physical attraction i.e. attraction towards beautiful form or body but transcends gradually to love for Supreme Beauty. This concept of Divine Eros is later transformed into the term Platonic love.
The English term dates back as far as William Davenant's The Platonic Lovers (performed in 1635); a critique of the philosophy of platonic love which was popular at Charles I's court. It is derived from the concept in Plato's Symposium of the love of the idea of good which lies at the root of all virtue and truth. For a brief period, Platonic love was a fashionable subject at the English royal court, especially in the circle around Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of King Charles I. Platonic love was the theme of some of the courtly masques performed in the Caroline era—though the fashion soon waned under pressures of social and political change.

[[Decantation]]

CATEGORIES: Separation processes, Laboratory techniques

Decantation is a process for the separation of mixtures, by removing a top layer of liquid from which a precipitate has settled. Usually a small amount of solution must be left in the container, and care must be taken to prevent a small amount of precipitate from flowing with the solution out of the container. It is frequently used to purify a liquid by separating it from a suspension of insoluble particles (e.g. in red wine, where the wine is decanted from the potassium bitartrate crystals). For example, to obtain a sample of clear water from muddy water, muddy water is left in a container until the mud settles, and then the clear water is poured into another container.
A mixture of two immiscible liquids can also be separated by decantation. For example, the oil and water extracted from fish  may be decanted to obtain the oil. A mixture of kerosene and water can also be separated through decantation.
A centrifuge may be useful in successfully decanting a solution. The centrifuge causes the precipitate to be forced to the bottom of the container; if the force is high enough, the precipitate may form a compact solid. Then the liquid can be more easily poured away, as the precipitate will likely remain in its compressed form. A mixture of an insoluble solid in liquid is allowed to stand. The solid is insoluble and settles at the bottom if kept undisturbed for some time.  This process is called sedimentation. The clear liquid is then poured off carefully.  This process is called decantation.
Another example of decantation is the regeneration of used chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP to be decanted is gently mixed in a container with a compatible solvent to form a suspension. The suspension is allowed to rest for a period of time, after which the supernatant is carefully poured off. The supernatant contains the undesirable constituents of the former suspension, while the leftover sediment in the container is clean, reusable CSP.
Decantation should be done directly after sedimentation.
This process is also used in extracting pure iron from iron ore.

[[Centrifugation]]

CATEGORIES: Centrifugation

Centrifugation is a process that involves the use of the centrifugal force for the sedimentation of heterogeneous mixtures with a centrifuge, used in industry and in laboratory settings. This process is used to separate two immiscible liquids. More-dense components of the mixture migrate away from the axis of the centrifuge, while less-dense components of the mixture migrate towards the axis. Chemists and biologists may increase the effective gravitational force on a test tube so as to more rapidly and completely cause the precipitate ("pellet") to gather on the bottom of the tube. The remaining solution is properly called the "supernate" or "supernatant liquid". The supernatant liquid is then either quickly decanted from the tube without disturbing the precipitate, or withdrawn with a Pasteur pipette.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
The rate of centrifugation is specified by the angular velocity measured in revolutions per minute (RPM), or acceleration expressed as g. The conversion factor between RPM and g depends on the radius of the sample in the centrifuge rotor. The particles' settling velocity in centrifugation is a function of their size and shape, centrifugal acceleration, the volume fraction of solids present, the density difference between the particle and the liquid, and the viscosity. The most common application is the separation of solid from highly concentrated suspensions, which is use in the treatment of sewage sludges for dewatering where less consistent sediment is produced.Article on "Centrifugation" retrieved on 15th October 2013 from http://www.lenntech.com/library/clarification/clarification/centrifugation.htm
In the chemical and food industries, special centrifuges can process a continuous stream of particle-laden liquid.
Centrifugation is the most common method used for uranium enrichment, relying on the slight mass difference between atoms of U238 and U235 in uranium hexafluoride gas.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

[[Velotype]]
CATEGORIES: Computer keyboards, Physical ergonomics

Velotype is the old trademark for a type of keyboard for typing text known as a syllabic chord keyboard, an invention of the Dutchmen Nico Berkelmans and Marius den Outer. The current tradename is Veyboard. Veyboard is a Dutch company.
Contrary to traditional QWERTY type keyboards, on which a typist usually presses one key at a time to create one character at a time, a Veyboard requires the user to press several keys simultaneously, producing syllables rather than letters. 
A practiced "veyboarder" can produce more text than on a traditional keyboard, as much as 200 words per minute, double the rate of a fast traditional typist. Because of this, Veyboards are often used for live applications, such as subtitling for television and for the hearing impaired.
The keyboard is an orthographic chord keyboard, very different from chorded phonetic keyboards used for verbatim transcription, like the Stenotype. Chorded phonetic keyboards, such as those manufactured by Stenograph, produce an intermediate shorthand format in which a combination of phonetics- and spelling-based strokes are translated by software to produce the output. Orthographic keyboards, on the other hand, allow the operator to rely on more traditional spelling in shaping the output, hence the term "orthographic" as opposed to "phonetic". Stenographic keyboards are generally more difficult to learn than the Veyboard, but trained Stenotype operators can go faster, even upwards of 300 words per minute. However, if strange (foreign) words appear, the Stenotype loses in time, while the Velotypist(veyboard, velotype-pro) can go on with the same speed, which can also go up to 200 words per minute.

Her worship is prescribed to acquire supernatural powers, especially gaining control over enemies, attracting people to oneself, acquiring mastery over the arts and gaining supreme knowledge.
Matangi is often associated with pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society, which is embodied in her most popular form, known as Ucchishta-Chandalini or Ucchishta-Matangini.Kinsley (1997) p. 217 She is described as an outcaste (Chandalini) and offered left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) with unwashed hands or food after eating, both of which are considered to be impure in classical Hinduism.
Matangi is often represented as emerald green in colour. While Ucchishta-Matangini carries a noose, sword, goad, and club, her other well-known form, Raja-Matangi, plays the veena and is often pictured with a parrot.

Chhinnamasta ([tpl]lang-sa|छिन्नमस्ता[/tpl], Bengali: ছিন্নমস্তা(অর্থাৎ যার মস্তক ছিন্ন), [tpl]IAST|Chinnamastā[/tpl], "She whose head is severed"), often spelled Chinnamasta and also called Chhinnamastika and Prachanda Chandika, is one of the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and a ferocious aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. Chhinnamasta can be easily identified by her fearsome iconography. The self-decapitated goddess holds her own severed head in one hand, a scimitar in another. Three jets of blood spurt out of her bleeding neck and are drunk by her severed head and two attendants. Chhinnamasta is usually depicted standing on a copulating couple.
Chhinnamasta is associated with the concept of self-sacrifice as well as the awakening of the kundalini – spiritual energy. She is considered both as a symbol of self-control on sexual desire as well as an embodiment of sexual energy, depending upon interpretation. She symbolizes both aspects of Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. Her legends emphasize her sacrifice – sometimes with a maternal element, her sexual dominance and her self-destructive fury. Though she enjoys patronage as part of the Mahavidyas, her individual temples – mostly found in Northern India and Nepal – and individual public worship is rare, due to her ferocious nature and her reputation of being dangerous to approach and worship. Her individual worship is restricted to heroic, Tantric worship by Tantrikas, yogis and world renouncers.
Chhinnamasta is recognized by both Hindus and Buddhists. She is closely related to Chinnamunda – the severed-headed form of the Tibetan Buddhist goddess Vajrayogini.

[[Mixture]]
CATEGORIES: Chemical mixtures, Physical chemistry, Chemistry

In chemistry, a mixture is  a material system made up of two or more different substances which are mixed but are not combined chemically. A mixture refers to the physical combination of two or more substances on which the identities are retained and are mixed in the form of solutions, suspensions, and colloids.
Mixtures are the one product of a mechanical blending or mixing of chemical substances like elements and compounds, without chemical bonding or other chemical change, so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup.Atkins' Physical Chemistry, 7th Ed. by Julio De Paula, P.W. Atkins ISBN 0-19-879285-9 Despite that there are no chemical changes to its constituents, the physical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point, may differ from those of the components. Some mixtures can be separated into their components by physical (mechanical or thermal) means. Azeotropes can be considered as a kind of mixture which usually pose considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents (physical or chemical processes or, even a blend of them).

[[Digital intermediate]]
CATEGORIES: Special effects, Film and video technology, Digital media, Film and video terminology

Digital intermediate (typically abbreviated to DI) is a motion picture finishing process which classically involves digitizing a motion picture and manipulating the color and other image characteristics. It often replaces or augments the photochemical timing process and is usually the final creative adjustment to a movie before distribution in theaters. It is distinguished from the telecine process in which film is scanned and color is manipulated early in the process to facilitate editing. However the lines between telecine and DI are continually blurred and are often executed on the same hardware by colorists of the same background. These two steps are typically part of the overall color management process in a motion picture at different points in time. A digital intermediate is also customarily done at higher resolution and with greater color fidelity than telecine transfers.
Although originally used to describe a process that started with film scanning and ended with film recording, digital intermediate is also used to describe color correction and color grading and even final mastering when a digital camera is used as the image source and/or when the final movie is not output to film. This is due to recent advances in digital cinematography and digital projection[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] technologies that strive to match film origination and film projection.
In traditional photochemical film finishing, an intermediate is produced by exposing film to the original camera negative. The intermediate is then used to mass-produce the films that get distributed to theaters. Color grading is done by varying the amount of red, green, and blue light used to expose the intermediate. This seeks to be able to replace or augment the photochemical approach to creating this intermediate.
The digital intermediate process uses digital tools to color grade, which allows for much finer control of individual colors and areas of the image, and allows for the adjustment of image structure (grain, sharpness, etc.). The intermediate for film reproduction can then be produced by means of a film recorder. The physical intermediate film that is a result of the recording process is sometimes also called a digital intermediate, and is usually recorded to internegative (IN) stock, which is inherently finer-grain than camera negative (OCN).
One of the key technical achievements that made the transition to DI possible was the use of the 3D look-up tables (aka "3D LUTs"), which could be used to mimic how the digital image would look once it was printed onto release print stock. This removed a large amount of skilled guesswork from the film-making process, and allowed greater freedom in the colour grading process while reducing risk.
The digital master is often used as a source for a DCI-compliant distribution of the motion picture for digital projection[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]. For archival purposes, the digital master created during the Digital Intermediate process can still be recorded to very stable high dynamic range yellow-cyan-magenta (YCM) separations on black-and-white film with an expected 100-year or longer life. This archival format, long used in the industry prior to the invention of DI, still provides an archival medium that is independent of changes in digital data recording technologies and file formats that might otherwise render digitally archived material unreadable in the long term.

[[The Alexandria Quartet]]

CATEGORIES: British novels, Alexandria in popular culture, Novels by Lawrence Durrell, Novel sequences, Tetralogies, Novels set in Egypt, Quantum fiction novels

The Alexandria Quartet is a tetralogy of novels by British writer Lawrence Durrell, published between 1957 and 1960. A critical and commercial success, the first three books present three perspectives on a single set of events and characters in Alexandria (Egypt), before and during World War II. The fourth book is set six years later.
As Durrell explains in his preface to Balthazar, the four novels are an exploration of relativity and the notions of continuum and subject–object relation, with modern love as the theme. The Quartet's first three books  offer the same sequence of events through several points of view, allowing individual perspectives of a single set of events. The fourth book shows change over time.
The four novels are:
In a 1959 Paris Review interview,[ref]
 pp. 26–27.[/ref] Durrell described the ideas behind the Quartet in terms of a convergence of Eastern and Western metaphysics, based on Einstein's overturning of the old view of the material universe, and Freud's doing the same for the concept of stable personalities, yielding a new concept of reality.
In 1998, the Modern Library ranked The Alexandria Quartet #70 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.
In 2000, Susan H. Young presented a dissertation retrospectively classifying Durrell's works published in 1957-1960 as some of the first literature to reflect the influence of quantum mechanics in creative writing, which emerged in the late 20th century as the literary genre quantum fiction.Quantum Fiction: Relativity and Postmodernism in Lawrence Durrell's The Alexandria Quartet, by Susan H.

The Rover Company is a former British car manufacturing company founded as Starley & Sutton Co. of Coventry in 1878.  It is the direct ancestor of the present day Land Rover company, which is a subsidiary of Jaguar Land Rover, in turn owned by the Tata Group.
The company traded as Rover, manufacturing cars, between 1904 and 1967, when it was sold to Leyland Motor Corporation, becoming the Rover marque. The Rover marque was used on cars produced by British Leyland (BL), who separated the assets of the  original Rover Company as Land Rover in 1978 whilst the Rover trademark continued to be used on vehicles produced by its successor companies - the Austin Rover Group (1982-1986), the Rover Group (1986-2000), and then finally MG Rover (2000-2005).  Following MG Rover's collapse in 2005, the Rover marque became dormant, and was subsequently sold to Ford, by now the owners of Land Rover, a move which effectively reunited the Rover trademark with the original company.
After developing the template for the modern bicycle with its Rover Safety Bicycle of 1885, the company moved into the automotive industry. It started building motorcycles and Rover cars, using their established marque with the iconic Viking Longship, from 1904 onwards. Land Rover vehicles were added from 1948 onwards, with all production moving to the Solihull plant after World War II.
The Polish word now most commonly used for bicycle – rower originates from Rover bicycles which had both wheels of the same size (previous models usually had one bigger, one smaller – see Penny-farthing, and were called in Polish bicykl, from English bicycle).

[[Château Clique]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties in Lower Canada, Lower Canada Rebellion, Political history of Quebec, Anglicanism

The Clique du Château or Château Clique was a group of wealthy families in Lower Canada in the early 19th century. They were the Lower Canadian equivalent of the Family Compact in Upper Canada. They were also known on the electoral scene as the Parti bureaucrate (Bureaucratic Party, also known as the British Party or the Tory Party).
Like the Family Compact, the Château Clique gained most of its influence after the War of 1812. Most of the families in the Clique were British merchants, although some were French Canadian seigneurs who felt that their own interests were best served by an affiliation with this group. Some of the most prominent members were brewer John Molson and James McGill, founder of McGill University. Generally, they wanted the French Canadian majority of Lower Canada to assimilate to English culture. This included the abolition of the seigneurial system, replacing French civil law with British common law, and replacing the established Roman Catholic Church with the Anglican Church. Their efforts led to the Act of Union (1840), which ultimately failed to assimilate all French Canadians but succeeded in preventing their[tpl]who|date=November 2012[/tpl] political and economic interests from prevailing over those of Britain. The Château Clique also had control over the Crown Lands and the Clergy Reserves, albeit much less than the Family Compact because of the already existing Seigniorial system implemented. 
The Constitutional Act of 1791 had established three branches of government: the Legislative Assembly, an elected lower house; the Legislative Council, an appointed upper house; and the Executive Council, which acted as a kind of cabinet for the lieutenant governor. The governor was appointed by the British Crown, and he appointed members of the Clique as his advisers. The Clique was also able to establish itself in the Legislative Council, leaving the Legislative Assembly, made up of a majority of French-Canadian representatives, with little or no power.
Louis-Joseph Papineau, as a reformer in the Assembly, was one of the fiercest opponents of the Chateau Clique. His struggles against the Clique and the Lieutenant Governor, Lord Gosford, led to the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1837. 
After the rebellion, Upper and Lower Canada were united as the Province of Canada, but the Château Clique did not disappear like the Family Compact. While the English-speaking population became the majority, the British-appointed governors still attempted to force the French Canadian population to assimilate. Canada East, as Lower Canada was called after the union, eventually gained some political independence with the union government of Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine.

[[Metaphysical Society]]

CATEGORIES: Metaphysics, Modern philosophy, Philosophy organizations

The Metaphysical Society was a British society, founded in 1869 by James Knowles.  Many of its members were prominent clergymen.
Papers were read and discussed at meetings on such subjects as the ultimate grounds of belief in the objective and moral sciences, the immortality of the soul, etc. A description of one of the meetings was given by Magee (then Bishop of Peterborough) in a letter of February 13, 1873:
 
 "Archbishop Manning in the chair was flanked by two Protestant bishops right and left; on my right was Hutton, editor of the Spectator, an Arian; then came Father Dalgairns, a very able Roman Catholic priest; opposite him Lord A. Russell, a Deist; then two Scotch metaphysical writers, Freethinkers; then Knowles, the very broad editor of the Contemporary; then, dressed as a layman and looking like a country squire, was Ward, formerly Rev. Ward, and earliest of the perverts to Rome; then Greg, author of The Creed of Christendom, a Deist; then Froude, the historian, once a deacon in our Church, now a Deist; then Roden Noël, an actual Atheist and red republican, and looking very like one! Lastly Ruskin, who read a paper on miracles, which we discussed for an hour and a half! Nothing could be calmer, fairer, or even, on the whole, more reverent than the discussion. In my opinion, we, the Christians, had much the best of it. Dalgairns, the priest, was very masterly; Manning, clever and precise and weighty; Froude, very acute, and so was Greg. We only wanted a Jew and a Muslim to make our Religious Museum complete" (Life, i. 284).

The last meeting of the society was held on May 16, 1880 and it was dissolved later in November of that year.Christopher A. Kent, "Metaphysical Society (act. 1869–1880)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, (http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/45584), 2004. Retrieved 15 April 2013.

The Colorado Springs Sky Sox are a minor league baseball team in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The team's colors are red and blue. The team plays in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and are the Triple-A affiliate of the major league Colorado Rockies. The Sky Sox won the PCL title in 1992 and again in 1995.
Originally, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox were a Class A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in the Western League from 1950–1958, when the league folded. The Sky Sox's nickname originated with their affiliation with the White Sox.
The Pikes Peak region was without professional baseball for thirty years until 1988, when the Hawaii Islanders of the PCL relocated to Colorado Springs and became the second incarnation of the Sky Sox. From 1988–1992 the Sky Sox were the Triple-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. When Denver was awarded a major league franchise for the 1993 season, the new Colorado Rockies arranged for the Sky Sox to become their top farm team. Through the 2013 season, the Sky Sox have been the only Triple-A affiliate of the Rockies. 
During their first season, the Sky Sox moved from Spurgeon Stadium (in Memorial Park) to the brand new Sky Sox Stadium, now known as Security Service Field. The ballpark, on the eastern edge of Colorado Springs, originally cost $3.7 million to build and seats 8,500 spectators. In recent years, the Sky Sox have invested over $8 million on ballpark renovations which included a new video scoreboard, redesigned entrance plaza, new picnic facility and banquet hall.  It is not the highest professional ballpark in North America; its natural grass field sits at [tpl]convert|6531|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level, but Foro Sol in Mexico City is higher.

In fictional works, a force field, sometimes known as an energy shield, force shield, or deflector shield, is a barrier made up of energy or particles to protect a person, area or object from attacks or intrusions. This fictional technology is created as a field of energy without mass that acts as a wall, so that objects affected by the particular force relating to the field are unable to pass through the field and reach the other side. It is a concept popular in science fiction and fantasy works. Scientific research into real energy shields is ongoing, primarily to protect against radiation.

Jean Cantius Garand ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ær|ən|d[/tpl]; January 1, 1888 – February 16, 1974) was a Canadian-American designer of firearms best known for creating the first successful semi-automatic rifle to be widely used in active military service, the M1 Garand.
Garand was born in St. Rémi, Quebec in a French Canadian family,All the Garand in North America have Pierre Garand (~1643 - 1700) from Rouen France, as common ancestor. See also Pierre Garand, Canadian modern singer. and moved as a child to Jewett City, Connecticut.  He attended school until he was 11 years old, and then became employed in a textile mill, where he was later promoted to machinist.  After gaining the necessary experience, he was hired by a tool factory in Providence, Rhode Island.
His fondness for machinery and target shooting blended naturally into a hobby of designing guns, which however took a more vocational turn in 1917.  That year the United States Army took bids on designs for a light machine gun, and Garand's design was eventually selected by the War Department.  Garand was appointed to a position with the United States Bureau of Standards with the task of perfecting the weapon.  The first model was not built until 1919, too late for use in World War I, but the government kept Garand on in a position as consulting engineer with the Springfield Armory.
In this position he was tasked with designing a semi-automatic infantry rifle and carbine. Designing the rifle took several preliminary designs and quite a bit of detail work stretching over fifteen years to perfect the model to Army specifications. The resulting M1 Garand was patented by Garand in 1934 and began mass production in 1936.  In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Garand had designed and built a prototype bullpup rifle.  It fired the same cartridge as the M1 rifle, but the magazine, action and shape were completely different.  It was a select-fire design, and had a firing rate of about 600rpm.  When Garand retired in 1953, the second version of the T31 was incomplete, and remained so. The project was scrapped, and the gun was retired to the Springfield Armory museum in 1961.
For his work with the Springfield Armory, Garand was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1941, and the first Medal for Merit (together with Albert Hoyt Taylor) on March 28, 1944.[tpl]cite journal |date=April 7, 1944 |title=Scientific Notes and News |journal=Science |volume=99 |issue=2571 |page=p.276 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |doi=10.1126/science.99.2571.276 |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/99/2571/276.extract |accessdate=November 6, 2011 [/tpl] Garand never received any royalties from his design. A bill was introduced in Congress to award him $100,000 in appreciation, but did not pass. Garand remained in his consulting position until his retirement in 1953, and died in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1974.
Garand married French Canadian widow Nellie Bruce Shepard (3 Aug 1900 - 25 Feb 1986) on 6 Sep 1930 in Albany, NY. She had two daughters by her previous marriage, and they had a daughter and a son of their own.1930 US Census; 7 Apr 1930; Springfield, MA; Sheet 5B; line 981940 US Census; 16 Apr 1940; Springfield, MA; Sheet 13B; line 72Wedding announcement; The Springfield Republican; 5 Oct 1930; page 6John C.

Trust in Luton is a registered industrial and provident society which acts as the supporters' trust, a democratic cooperative, for fans of the English football club Luton Town. 
Trust in Luton was established in June 2003 by a group of supporters following the highly controversial takeover of Luton Town by John Gurney. Luton's current Managing Director, Gary Sweet, was a founding member and former director of the Trust, and was part of the movement that successfully forced Gurney out by deliberately placing the club into administrative receivership. 
The Trust owns 50,000 shares in the club's holding company, Luton Town Football Club 2020 Limited, and currently holds the right of veto over any changes to the club's identity – the only such organisation that has this right in English professional football. The Trust is also a member of Supporters Direct, a government-led trust initiative.

PT-109 was a PT boat (Patrol Torpedo boat) last commanded by Lieutenant, junior grade (LTJG) John F. Kennedy (later President of the United States) in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Kennedy's actions to save his surviving crew after the sinking of PT-109 made him a war hero, which proved helpful in his political career.
The incident may have also contributed to Kennedy's long-term back problems. After he became president, the incident became a cultural phenomenon, inspiring a song, many books, movies, various television series, collectible objects, scale model replicas and toys. Interest was revived in May 2002, with the discovery of the wreck by Robert Ballard. PT-109 earned two battle stars during World War II operations.

USS ''La Jolla'' (SSN-701), a Los Angeles-class submarine, is named for La Jolla, California. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 10 December 1973 and her keel was laid down on 16 October 1976.  She was launched on 11 August 1979 sponsored by Mrs. Bob Wilson, and commissioned on 24 October 1981,http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/l/ssn-701/1981.pdf with Captain James R. Lang in command.
During the sea trials for the La Jolla, an incident where there was a loss of ship control and subsequent depth excursion led to the retirement of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover.Old Admiral Too Reckless, They're Trying to Beach Him
In late 1982, about 30 miles  out of San Francisco, La Jolla, while at periscope depth, collided with Permit (SSN-594), operating on the surface.  La Jolla suffered minor rudder damage, while putting a ten-foot (3 m) long, three-foot (1 m) wide scrape in the paint on Permit’s keel.
La Jolla was the first to successfully test fire a Tomahawk cruise missile while submerged at the Pacific Missile Test Center on 29 April 1983.  Her commanding officer at the time was Cdr. Garnet C. "Skip" Beard, who was later promoted to Navy Captain (O6).  Capt. Beard appeared in the movie Crimson Tide, and was listed in the credits as a consultant to that film.
The first West Pacific (West-Pac) cruise was between August 1984 and February 1985, in which the La Jolla visited ports in Olongapo Philippines, Hong Kong, Chinhae Korea, and Yokosuka, Japan.  All crew members participating in the second half of the 1984–85 West-Pac cruise received the Navy Expeditionary Medal for operations in the Sea of Japan.
On 11 February 1998, about 9 miles out of Chinhae, South Korea, La Jolla accidentally ran into and sank a 27-ton fishing trawler. The five crewmembers of the trawler were rescued by the crew of La Jolla.Accidents of the USS La Jolla on NavySite.de
In 2000, La Jolla was modified to carry a Dry Deck Shelter (DDS).
On 23 August 2004, La Jolla returned to Pearl Harbor after a six-month deployment in the Pacific Ocean.  She conducted port visits in Korea, Japan, Singapore, Saipan, and Guam, and participated in five international exercises, including Pacific Reach 2004.
On 30 October 2009 while the sub was undergoing repair at Pearl Harbor, the ship's skipper, Commander Doug Sampson, was relieved of duty by Submarine Squadron 1 Commodore Captain Stanley Robertson.  Robertson cited a "loss of confidence in his Sampson's ability to command" and that "La Jolla's in-port planning, operations and administrations, which fell short of high Navy standards" as reasons for the relief.

While others used test boxes and programs, Providence was the first submarine to launch a Tomahawk cruise missile from the VLS system using its combat system CCS MK1 and associated software C4.1.
Providence has been deployed several times to the Western Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf. Some of the ports visited have included Port Canaveral (Cocoa Beach, Florida) and Port Everglades (Fort Lauderdale, Florida), Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, Tromsø in Norway, Halifax in Nova Scotia, Gibraltar, Toulon in France, Souda Bay in Crete, La Maddalena in Italy, and Koper in Slovenia, in the Mediterranean, and al-Manama, Bahrain, and both Dubai and Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf. The submarine has made transits of the Suez Canal in 1998, 2001, and 2003 and participated in Operation Southern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, where she earned the nickname "Big dog of the Red Sea wolf pack."
She has since been retrofitted with numerous upgrades including the AN/BYG-1 Fire Control system and AN/BQQ-10 ARCI Sonar suite.  Her astounding achievements continued in 2006–2007 as she has also completed an around-the-world deployment to the Western Pacific Ocean earning the coveted Order of Magellan certificate, participating in Exercise MALABAR 2006, and many other significant assignments.  Port visits included Singapore, Yokosuka and Okinawa in Japan, Goa in India, as well as transits through both the Suez Canal and Panama Canal.  In 2008, she completed yet another deployment to the Western Pacific Ocean, only this time taking a northern route, successfully transiting under the arctic ice cap.

[[Glyceride]]

CATEGORIES: Lipids

Glycerides, more correctly known as acylglycerols, are esters formed from glycerol and fatty acids.
Glycerol has three hydroxyl functional groups, which can be esterified with one, two, or three fatty acids to form monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides.
Vegetable oils and animal fats contain mostly triglycerides, but are broken down by natural enzymes (lipases) into mono and diglycerides and free fatty acids.
Soaps are formed from the reaction of glycerides with sodium hydroxide. The product of the reaction is glycerol and salts of fatty acids. Fatty acids in the soap emulsify the oils in dirt, enabling the removal of oily dirt with water.
Partial glycerides are esters of glycerol with fatty acids, where not all the
hydroxyl groups are esterified. Since some of its hydroxyl groups are free the molecule is polar. 
Short chain partial glycerides are more
highly polarized, and have excellent solvent properties for many hard-to-solubilize drugs.Sasol Olefins & Surfactants - Excipients for Pharmaceuticals. Partial glycerides (page 10)

[[Absorption law]]
CATEGORIES: Abstract algebra, Boolean algebra, Theorems in propositional logic, Lattice theory

In algebra, the absorption law or absorption identity is an identity linking a pair of binary operations.
Two binary operations, ¤ and ⁂, are said to be connected by the absorption law if:
Examples of lattices include Boolean algebras, the set of sets with union and intersection operators, Heyting algebras, and ordered sets with min and max operations.
The absorption law does not hold in many other algebraic structures, such as commutative rings, e.g. the field of real numbers, relevance logics, linear logics, and substructural logics. In the last case, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the free variables of the defining pair of identities.

The Army Comrades Association (ACA), later named the National Guard and better known by the nickname The Blueshirts ([tpl]lang-ga|Na Léinte Gorma[/tpl]), was an Irish extra-parliamentary security organisation active in the 1930s. It consisted largely of former members of the Irish Republican Army who were pro-Treaty during the Irish Civil War. The purpose of the organisation was to provide physical protection for political groups such as the Cumann na nGaedheal from intimidation by the anti-Treaty IRA.
Because of the later attraction of the group's leader Eoin O'Duffy to authoritarian nationalist movements on the European Continent, they are sometimes compared to the MVSN (Blackshirts) of Italy and to some extent performed a similar function.See, for example, here and here.

Some of the Blueshirts later went to fight for Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War and were anti-communist in nature, however historian R.M. Douglas has stated that it is dubious to portray them as an "Irish manifestation of fascism". 
Most of the political parties whose meetings the ACA protected would merge to become Fine Gael, and members of that party are sometimes nicknamed "Blueshirts" to this day.

[[Flash evaporation]]

CATEGORIES: Evaporators, Chemical processes, Fluid dynamics, Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning, Thermodynamics, Unit operations, Gases

Flash (or partial) evaporation is the partial vapor that occurs when a saturated liquid stream undergoes a reduction in pressure by passing through a throttling valve or other throttling device. This process is one of the simplest unit operations. If the throttling valve or device is located at the entry into a pressure vessel so that the flash evaporation occurs within the vessel, then the vessel is often referred to as a flash drum.[tpl]cite book|author=Gas Processing Suppliers Association (GPSA)|title=Engineering Data Book|edition=10th Edition, Vol. 1|publisher=Gas Processing Suppliers Association, Tulsa, Oklahoma|date=1987|id=[/tpl]
If the saturated liquid is a single-component liquid (for example,  liquid propane or liquid ammonia), a part of the liquid immediately "flashes" into vapor. Both the vapor and the residual liquid are cooled to the saturation temperature of the liquid at the reduced pressure. This is often referred to as "auto-refrigeration" and is the basis of most conventional vapor compression refrigeration systems.
If the saturated liquid is a multi-component liquid (for example, a mixture of propane, isobutane and normal butane), the flashed vapor is richer in the more volatile components than is the remaining liquid.
Uncontrolled flash evaporation can result in a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE).

[[Sodium silicate]]

CATEGORIES: Cement, Concrete, Drilling technology, Glass compositions, Inorganic silicon compounds, Sodium compounds, Silicates

Sodium silicate is the common name for compounds with the formula Na2(SiO2)nO.  A well known member of this series is sodium metasilicate, Na2SiO3.  Also known as waterglass or liquid glass, these materials are available in aqueous solution and in solid form.  The pure compositions are colourless or white, but commercial samples are often greenish or blue owing to the presence of iron-containing impurities.
They are used in cements, passive fire protection, textile and lumber processing, refractories, and automobiles. Sodium carbonate and silicon dioxide react when molten to form sodium silicate and carbon dioxide:[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl]
Anhydrous sodium silicate contains a chain polymeric anion composed of corner shared {SiO4} tetrahedral, and not a discrete SiO32−  ion. In addition to the anhydrous form, there are hydrates with the formula Na2SiO3·nH2O (where n = 5, 6, 8, 9) which contain the discrete, approximately tetrahedral anion SiO2(OH)22− with water of hydration. For example, the commercially available sodium silicate pentahydrate Na2SiO3·5H2O is formulated as Na2SiO2(OH)2·4H2O and the nonahydrate Na2SiO3·9H2O is formulated as Na2SiO2(OH)2·8H2O.Wells A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry 5th edition Oxford Science Publications ISBN 0-19-855370-6
In industry, the various grades of sodium silicate are characterized by their SiO2:Na2O ratio, which can vary between 2:1 and 3.75:1.Gerhard Lagaly, Werner Tufar, A. Minihan, A. Lovell "Silicates" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_661[/tpl] Grades with this ratio below 2.85:1 are termed 'alkaline'.

[[Precipitation]]

CATEGORIES: Basic meteorological concepts and phenomena, Precipitation

In meteorology, precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that falls under gravity.[tpl]cite web | work = Glossary of Meteorology | year = 2009 | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=precipitation1 | title = Precipitation | publisher = American Meteorological Society | accessdate = 2009-01-02 [/tpl]  The main forms of precipitation include  drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, graupel and hail.  Precipitation occurs when a local portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapour, so that the water condenses and "precipitates".  Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions, because the water vapour does not condense sufficiently to precipitate.  Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapour to the air. Generally, precipitation will fall to the surface; an exception is virga which evaporates before reaching the surface.   Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud.  Rain drops range in size from oblate, pancake-like shapes for larger drops, to small spheres for smaller drops. Unlike raindrops, snowflakes grow in a variety of different shapes and patterns, determined by the temperature and humidity characteristics of the air the snowflake moves through on its way to the ground.  While snow and ice pellets require temperatures close to the ground to be near or below freezing, hail can occur during much warmer temperature regimes due to the process of its formation.
Moisture overriding associated with weather fronts is an overall major method of precipitation production.  If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds such as cumulonimbus and can organize into narrow rainbands.  Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example due to water evaporation from lakes, lake-effect snowfall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones.  Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy.  Thundersnow is possible within a cyclone's comma head and within lake effect precipitation bands.  In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation.  On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating.  The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.
Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle, and is responsible for depositing the fresh water on the planet. Approximately [tpl]convert|505000|km3|mi3[/tpl] of water falls as precipitation each year; [tpl]convert|398000|km3|mi3[/tpl] of it over the oceans and [tpl]convert|107000|km3|mi3[/tpl] over land.[tpl]cite web|author=Dr. Chowdhury's Guide to Planet Earth|year=2005|url=http://www.planetguide.net/book/chapter_2/water_cycle.html|title=The Water Cycle|publisher=WestEd|accessdate=2006-10-24[/tpl] Given the Earth's surface area, that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is [tpl]convert|990|mm|in[/tpl], but over land it is only [tpl]convert|715|mm|in[/tpl]. Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.
The urban heat island effect may lead to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally.
Precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies, e.g. when it gets cold, Mars has precipitation which most likely takes the form of ice needles, rather than rain or snow.[tpl]cite web|author=Dr. Jim Lochner|year=1998|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980403c.html|title=Ask an Astrophysicist|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=2009-01-16[/tpl]

[[Precipitation (chemistry)]]
CATEGORIES: Separation processes

Precipitation is the creation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction or by diffusion in a solid. When the reaction occurs in a liquid solution, the solid formed is called the precipitate. The chemical that causes the solid to form is called the precipitant. Without sufficient force of gravity (settling) to bring the solid particles together, the precipitate remains in suspension.  After sedimentation, especially when using a centrifuge to press it into a compact mass, the precipitate may be referred to as a pellet. The precipitate-free liquid remaining above the solid is called the supernate or supernatant.  Powders derived from precipitation have also historically been known as flowers.
Precipitation may occur if the concentration of a compound exceeds its solubility (such as when mixing solvents or changing their temperature).  Precipitation may occur rapidly from a supersaturated solution.
In solids, precipitation occurs if the concentration of one solid is above the solubility limit in the host solid, due to e.g. rapid quenching or
ion implantation, and the temperature is high enough that diffusion can lead to segregation into precipitates. Precipitation in solids is routinely used to synthesize nanoclusters.[tpl]cite journal |first=S. |last=Dhara |title=Formation, Dynamics, and Characterization of Nanostructures by Ion Beam Irradiation |journal=Critical Reviews in Solid State and Materials Sciences |volume=32 |year=2007 |issue=1 |pages=1–50 |doi=10.1080/10408430601187624 [/tpl]
An important stage of the precipitation process is the onset of nucleation.  The creation of a hypothetical solid particle includes the formation of an interface, which requires some energy based on the relative surface energy of the solid and the solution.  If this energy is not available, and no suitable nucleation surface is available, supersaturation occurs.

Stalker ([tpl]lang-rus|Сталкер|p=ˈstɑlkʲɪr[/tpl]) is a 1979 art film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, with a screenplay written by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, loosely based on their novel Roadside Picnic. It depicts an expedition led by the Stalker to bring his two clients to a site known as the Zone, which has the supposed potential to fulfill a person's innermost desires.
The title of the film, which is the same in Russian and English, is derived from the English word to stalk in the long-standing meaning of approaching furtively, much like a hunter. In the film a stalker is a professional guide to the zone, someone who crosses the border into the forbidden zone with a specific goal.[tpl]citation|last=Gianvito|first=John|title=Andrei Tarkovsky: Interviews|publisher=University Press of Mississippi |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WKp-hAuQ_2oC&printsec=frontcover#PPA50,M1 |year=2006 |page=50–54 |isbn=1-57806-220-9[/tpl] The meaning of the word 'stalk' was derived from its use by the Strugatsky brothers for their novel Roadside Picnic (1972), as an allusion to Rudyard Kipling's character Stalky from the "Stalky & Co." stories. Сталки (stálki) was well remembered by the Strugatskys from their childhood, when they read the stories in their Russian translation. In the Roadside Picnic, сталкер was a common nickname for men engaged in the illegal trade of prospecting for and smuggling of alien artifacts from the mysterious and dangerous "Zone".[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%80 |title=сталкер - Wiktionary |publisher=En.wiktionary.org |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2014-01-19[/tpl]

The Greens advance a broad multi-issue political platform that reflects its core values of ecological wisdom,  social justice, grassroots democracy and non-violence. It has been led by Elizabeth May since August 26, 2006.
The party broke 1% of the popular vote in the 2004 federal election, when it received 4.3% and qualified for federal funding. Its support has ranged between 3.1% and 14% since the 2006 federal election. In the 2008 federal election, the Green Party of Canada was invited to the debates for the first time and achieved a high mark of 6.8% of the popular vote.

[[Vanity press]]

CATEGORIES: Publishing terms

A vanity press, vanity publisher, or subsidy publisher is a term describing a publishing house in which authors pay to have their books published.[tpl]cite book|last=Glatthorn|first=Alan A.|title=Publish or Perish - The Educator's Imperative: Strategies for Writing Effectively for Your Profession and Your School|date=June 15, 2002|publisher=Corwin Press|isbn= 9780761978671|page=84|chapter=9. Publishing (Vanity Press)[/tpl] The term appears in mainstream U.S. publications as early as 1941.Time Magazine "Books: Literary Rotolactor" In contrast, mainstream publishers, whether major companies or small presses, derive their profit from sales of the book to the general public. Publishers must therefore be cautious and deliberate in choosing to publish works that will sell, particularly as they must recoup their investment in the book (such as  an advance payment and royalties to the author, editorial guidance, promotion, marketing, or advertising).[tpl]or|date=March 2014[/tpl] In order to sell books, commercial publishers may also be selective in order to cultivate a reputation for high-quality work, or to specialize in a particular genre.
Because vanity presses are not selective,[tpl]or|date=March 2014[/tpl] publication by a vanity press is typically not seen as conferring the same recognition or prestige as commercial publication.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Vanity presses do offer more independence for the author than does the mainstream publishing industry; however, their fees can be higher than the fees normally charged for similar printing services, and sometimes restrictive contracts are required.
While a commercial publisher's intended market is the general public, a vanity publisher's intended market is the author and a very small number of interested members of the general public. In some cases, authors of a book that is vanity published will buy a substantial number of copies of their book, so that they can give it away as a promotional tool.

[[Scriptorium]]

CATEGORIES: Book terminology, Manuscripts, History of books, Medieval literature, Textual scholarship

Scriptorium,Scriptorium, from the medieval Latin script-, scribere (to write), where -orium is the neuter singular ending for adjectives describing place. literally "a place for writing", is commonly used to refer to a room in medieval European monasteries devoted to the copying of manuscripts by monastic scribes. Written accounts, surviving buildings, and archaeological excavations all show, however, that contrary to popular belief[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] such rooms rarely existed: most monastic writing was done in cubicle-like recesses in the cloister, or in the monks' own cells. References in modern scholarly writings to 'scriptoria' more usually refer to the collective written output of a monastery, rather than to a physical room.
A scriptorium was a necessary adjunct to a library; wherever there was a library it can ordinarily be assumed that there was a scriptorium."Since the early medieval days of the foundling monastic orders, the library and the scriptorium had been linked. for the most part, the library  was a storage space. Reading was done elsewhere." (Christopher S. Celenza, "Creating Canons in Fifteenth-Century Ferrara: Angelo Decembrio's "De politia litteraria," 1.10" Renaissance Quarterly 57.1 (Spring 2004:43-98) p. 48 Scriptoria in the conventional sense of a room set aside for the purpose probably only existed for limited periods of time, when an institution or individual wanted a large number of texts copied to stock a library; once the library was stocked, there was no further need for a designated room. By the start of the 13th century secular copy-shops developed; professional scribes may have had special rooms set aside for writing, but in most cases they probably simply had a writing-desk next to a window in their own house.

The Guide system became the third hypertext system to be sold commercially, marketed by Office Workstations Ltd (OWL) in 1984 and later by InfoAccess. "Guide" won Brown the British Computer Society's award for technical innovation in 1988. He retired in 1999 and died of cancer in 2007, according to a tribute page at the University of Kent website.http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/news/2007/PeterBrown/
Ian Ritchie, founder of OWL, presented a Ted talk in 2011 describing his missed opportunity to convert Guide to a graphical browser for the Web at its inception in 1990, titled "The day I turned down Tim Berners-Lee." http://www.ted.com/talks/ian_ritchie_the_day_i_turned_down_tim_berners_lee.html
In September 1986, Guide was ported by OWL to the Apple Macintosh, and in July 1987 to Microsoft Windows. (In 1987 Apple had begun giving away its own graphical programming system, HyperCard, which had some hypertext features.) According to news reports in 1988,"IBM goes head to head with Apple on HyperCard" http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19880204&id=HxFZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QZADAAAAIBAJ&pg=4749,979201 OWL announced plans to release a version of Guide for the IBM PS/2 line of computers under the name "Hyper Document," in competition with Hypercard on the Apple Macintosh.
OWL gradually shifted the focus of Guide from a low-cost "hypertext word processor" to a more expensive CD-ROM multimedia development system.
Unlike most hypertext systems, the main link mechanism in Guide is based on replacement, meaning that when following a link, the current node breaks open, making room for the destination node. The anchor of the link is replaced by the contents of the destination node. One can close the destination node, which means that it is once again replaced by the text of the anchor. Thus, the basic method of navigation using Guide was the expansion button, in which a section was replaced when selected and in which an expansion would provide additional levels of detail. This allowed the user, whether they were a document author or a reader, to expand and contract a document, viewing the desired level at any time, not unlike viewing methods used in Adobe Acrobat files. Using this method means that the structure of the document must be strictly hierarchical.
Guide supported pop-ups for small annotations, and so-called jumps, which behave like the follow-link operation in most hypertexts (as in van Dam's FRESS system). The jumps allow for the creation of non-hierarchical links.

[[Diaphoresis]]

CATEGORIES: Symptoms and signs: Skin and subcutaneous tissue

'''
Diaphoretic is the state of perspiring profusely, or something that has the power to cause increased perspiration.
Diaphoresis is the medical term for profuse sweating or perspiring. It is performed by the skin's sweat glands as they release a salty fluid and aid in fever management. Sweating is an essential function that helps the body stay cool and commonly occurs under the arms, on the feet, and on the palms of the hands.Sweating: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia, Retrieved on 2010-01-25.  There are approximately two to four million sweat glands throughout the body that will become completely active during puberty. Although women tend to have more sweat glands, men's are generally more active. 
When the body temperature rises, the autonomic nervous system stimulates the eccrine glands to secrete fluid onto the surface of the skin, where it cools the body as it evaporates.Sweating and body odor: Causes - MayoClinic.com, Retrieved on 2010-01-25.

In Catholic theology, an indulgence technically is a remission of the temporalThe difference between temporal and eternal punishment due to sin, according to this theology, is explained below, under "Catholic teaching". punishment inflicted by the Church for a previously forgiven sin.William Kent, "Indulgences", in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910)Code of Canon Law, canon 992Indulgentiarum doctrina, Norm 1 An indulgence thus does not forgive the guilt of sin nor releases from the eternal punishment which Church doctrine associates to unforgiven mortal sins. It is not a permit to commit sin, a pardon of future sin, nor a guarantee of salvation for oneself or for another.[tpl]cite web|title=Myths about Indulgences|url=http://www.catholic.com/tracts/myths-about-indulgences|publisher=Catholic Answers[/tpl] Ordinarily, forgiveness of mortal sins is obtained through Confession (i.e., penance or reconciliation).
Indulgences have replaced the remission of the severe penances of the early Church which was granted at the intercession of Christians awaiting martyrdom or at least imprisoned for the faith.Cross, F.

[[Pneumothorax]]

CATEGORIES: Chest trauma, Diseases involving the fasciae, Medical emergencies, Diseases of pleura

A pneumothorax (pneumo- + thorax; plural pneumothoraces) is an abnormal collection of air or gas in the pleural space that separates the lung from the chest wall. Like pleural effusion (liquid buildup in that space), pneumothorax may interfere with normal breathing.
A primary pneumothorax is one that occurs without an apparent cause and in the absence of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung pathology. In a minority of cases, the amount of air in the chest increases markedly when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition is a medical emergency that can cause steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, these sequelae can progress and cause death.
Pneumothoraces can be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including blast injury), or as a complication of medical or surgical intervention. Symptoms typically include chest pain and shortness of breath. Diagnosis of a pneumothorax by physical examination alone can be difficult or inconclusive (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces), so a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan is usually used to confirm its presence.
Small spontaneous pneumothoraces typically resolve without treatment and require only monitoring. This approach may be most appropriate in subjects who have no significant underlying lung disease. In larger pneumothoraces, or when there are marked symptoms, the air may be extracted with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgical interventions are required when tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes).

The Ford Crown Victoria (or simply Crown Vic) is a rear-wheel drive full-size sedan that was marketed and manufactured by Ford Motor Company; it was produced from the 1992 to the 2012 model years over two generations. The name "Crown Victoria" was first used for a 1955 version of the Fairlane. Discontinued in the 2011 model year, it had been in production since 1991 at Ford's St. Thomas Assembly plant in Talbotville, Ontario, Canada.  Dropping its previous LTD prefix, Crown Victoria revived a nameplate used by Ford on a two-door version of the Fairlane sold in the North American market during the mid-1950s.
The Crown Victoria shared the Ford Panther platform and major powertrain and suspension components with the Lincoln Town Car and Mercury Grand Marquis.  Along with its rebadged Mercury and Lincoln variants, the Crown Victoria was the final full-frame rear-wheel-drive passenger sedan produced in North America.  The durability associated with its layout popularized the use of the Crown Victoria with taxicab and fleet owners going on to become one of the most commonly used police patrol/pursuit vehicles in North America.

In contrast to the conclusions of the Warren Commission, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded in 1978 that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.[tpl]sfn|Stokes|1979|p=2[/tpl] The HSCA found the original FBI investigation and the Warren Commission Report to be seriously flawed. While agreeing with the Commission that Oswald fired all the shots which caused the wounds to Kennedy and Connally, the HSCA stated that there were at least four shots fired (only three of which could be linked to Oswald) and that there was "...a high probability that two gunmen fired at the President."[tpl]sfn|Stokes|1979|pp=90–93[/tpl]House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report, pp. 65-75. 
The HSCA did not identify any other person or group involved in the assassination besides Oswald, but they did specifically say the CIA, the Soviet Union, organized crime, and several other groups were not involved, although they could not rule out the involvement of individual members of those groups. Kennedy's assassination is still the subject of widespread debate and has spawned numerous conspiracy theories and alternative scenarios.

[[Culture of North Korea]]
CATEGORIES: North Korean culture

The contemporary culture of North Korea is based on traditional Korean culture, but developed since the establishment of North Korea in 1948.
Juche's ideology asserts Korea's cultural distinctiveness and creativity as well as the productive powers of the working masses.
Art in North Korea is primarily didactic; cultural expression serves as an instrument for inculcating Juche ideology and the need to continue the struggle for revolution and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. Foreign governments and citizens, especially the Japanese and the Americans, are depicted negatively as imperialists; revolutionary heroes and heroines are seen as saintly figures who act from the purest of motives. The three most consistent themes are martyrdom during the revolutionary struggle (depicted in literature such as The Sea of Blood), the happiness of the present society, and the genius of the leader.
Kim Il-sung himself is described as a writer of "classical masterpieces" during the anti-Japanese struggle. Novels created under his direction include The Flower Girl, The Sea of Blood, The Fate of a Self-Defense Corps Man, and The Song of Korea; these are considered "prototypes and models of Juche literature and art." A 1992 newspaper report describes Kim in semi-retirement as writing his memoirs—"a heroic epic dedicated to the freedom and happiness of the people."
The population has little or no exposure to foreign cultural influences apart from performances by song-and-dance groups and other entertainers brought in periodically for limited audiences. These performances, such as the Spring Friendship Art Festival held annually in April, are designed to show that the peoples of the world, like the North Koreans themselves, love and respect the country's leader. During the 1980s and the early 1990s, the North Korean media gave Kim Jong-il credit for working ceaselessly to make the country a "kingdom of art" where a cultural renaissance unmatched in other countries was taking place. Indeed, the younger Kim was personally responsible for cultural policy.
P'yŏngyang and other large cities offer the broadest selection of cultural expression. "Art propaganda squads" travel to production sites in the provinces to perform poetry readings, one-act plays, and songs in order to "congratulate workers on their successes" and "inspire them to greater successes through their artistic agitation." Such squads are prominent in the countryside during the harvest season and whenever "speed battles" to increase productivity are held.

Chain of custody (CoC), in legal contexts, refers to the chronological documentation or paper trail, showing the seizure, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic evidence. 
Particularly important in criminal cases, the concept is also applied in civil litigation – and sometimes more broadly in drug testing of athletes, traceability of food products and to provide assurances that wood products originate from sustainably managed forests.
The term is also sometimes used in the fields of history, art history, and archives as a synonym for provenance (meaning the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object, document or group of documents), which may be an important factor in determining authenticity.

Tracheotomy ([tpl]IPAc-en|US|ˌ|t|r|eɪ|k|i|ˈ|ɒ|t|əm|i[/tpl] [tpl]respell|tray-kee|AW|tə-mee[/tpl]) is a surgical procedure which consists of making an incision on the anterior aspect of the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea (windpipe). The resulting stoma (hole), or tracheostomy, can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his or her nose or mouth. Both surgical and percutaneous techniques are widely used in current surgical practice.  It is among the oldest described procedures.

Bowers v. Hardwick, [tpl]ussc|478|186|1986[/tpl], is a United States Supreme Court decision, overturned in 2003, that upheld, in a 5–4 ruling, the constitutionality of a Georgia sodomy law criminalizing oral and anal sex in private between consenting adults when applied to homosexuals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0478_0186_ZO.html |title=Bowers v. Hardwick |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2011-06-01[/tpl]
The majority opinion, written by Justice Byron White, argued that the Constitution did not confer "a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy." A concurring opinion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger cited the "ancient roots" of prohibitions against homosexual sex, quoting William Blackstone's description of homosexual sex as an "infamous crime against nature", worse than rape, and "a crime not fit to be named." Burger concluded: "To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching." Justice Lewis F. Powell later said he regretted joining the majority, but thought the case of little importance at the time.
The dissent, authored by Justice Harry Blackmun, framed the issue as revolving around the right to privacy. Blackmun's dissent accused the Court of an "almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity" and an "overall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases." In response to invocations of religious taboos against homosexuality, Blackmun wrote: "That certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry. The legitimacy of secular legislation depends, instead, on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0478_0186_ZD.html | title = Bowers v.

Seventeen years after Bowers v. Hardwick, the Supreme Court directly overruled its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), and held that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional. In overruling Bowers v. Hardwick, the Court stated that "Bowers was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today."

Ruhnama (The Book of the Soul), is a book written by Saparmurat Niyazov, who was President of Turkmenistan from 1990 to 2006, combining spiritual/moral guidance, autobiography and revisionist history; much of it is of dubious or disputed factuality and accuracy. The text includes many stories and poems, including those by Sufi poet Magtymguly Pyragy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] It was intended as the "spiritual guidance of the nation" and the basis of the nation's arts and literature, by creating a positive image of the Turkmen people, a heroic interpretation of its history, the review of Turkmen customs and the definition of "moral, family, social and religious norms for modern Turkmens".
The Ruhnama was introduced to Turkmen culture in a gradual but eventually pervasive way. Niyazov first placed copies in the nation's schools and libraries but eventually went as far as to make an exam on its teachings an element of the driving test. It was mandatory to read Ruhnama in schools, universities and governmental organizations. New governmental employees were tested on the book at job interviews.
In March 2006, Niyazov was recorded as saying that he had interceded with God to ensure that any student who read the book three times would automatically get into heaven.[tpl]cite news|title=Read My Words, Go to Heaven, Leader Says|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/21/world/fg-briefs21.5|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 21, 2006[/tpl]  After the death of Niyazov in December 2006, its popularity remained high.ENTERTAINMENT - The Denver Post[tpl]Dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] In December 2009, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov still strongly recommended that the government use the Ruhnama as an instrument of youth education.

Settling is the process by which particulates settle to the bottom of a liquid and form a sediment. Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity or due to centrifugal motion will tend to move in a uniform manner in the direction exerted by that force. For gravity settling, this means that the particles will tend to fall to the bottom of the vessel, forming a slurry at the vessel base. 
Settling is an important operation in many applications, such as mining, wastewater treatment, biological science, space propellant reignition,[ref]

Michel Chamillart or Chamillard (2 January 1652 – 14 April 1721) was a French statesman, a minister of King Louis XIV of France.
He was born in Paris of a family recently raised to the nobility.  Following the usual career of a statesman of his time he became in turn councillor of the parlement of Paris (1676), master of requests (1686), and intendant of the generality of Rouen (January 1689). His attractive personality won the confidence of Madame de Maintenon and pleased the king. In 1690 he was made intendant of finances, and on 5 September 1699 the king appointed him Controller-General of Finances, to which he added on the following 7 January the ministry of war. From the first, Chamillart's position was a difficult one. The deficit was more than 53 million livres, and the credit of the state was almost exhausted. Chamillart lacked the intelligence and energy necessary for the situation, and was unable to moderate the king's warlike tastes, or to inaugurate economic reforms. He could only employ the usual expedients of the time—the immoderate sale of offices, the debasement of the coinage (five times in six years), reduction of the rate of interest on state debts, and increased taxation.
He attempted to force into circulation a kind of paper money, billets de monnaie, with disastrous results owing to the state of credit. He studied Vauban's project for the royal tithe, and Boisguillebert's proposition for the taille, but did not adopt them. In October 1706 he showed the king that the debts immediately due amounted to 288 millions, and that the deficit already foreseen for 1707 was 160 millions. In October 1707 he saw with consternation that the revenue for 1708 was already entirely eaten up by anticipation, so that neither money nor credit remained for 1708. In these conditions Chamillart, who had often complained of the overwhelming burden he was carrying, and who had already wished to retire in 1706, resigned his office of controller-general. Public opinion attributed to him the ruin of the country, though he had tried in 1700 to improve the condition of commerce by the creation of a council of commerce.
As secretary of state for war he was responsible for raising an army for the War of the Spanish Succession, and had to reorganize it three times, after the defeats of 1704, 1706 and 1708. With an empty treasury he succeeded only in part, and he warned the king that the enemy would soon be able to dictate the terms of peace. He was reproached with having secured the command of the army which besieged Turin (1706) for his son-in-law, the incapable duc de la Feuillade. Even Madame de Maintenon became hostile to him, and he was dismissed from his position on 9 June 1709, retiring to his estates.
Chamillart's papers were published by G Esnault, [tpl]lang|fr|Michel Chamillart, contrôleur général et secrétaire d'état de la guerre, correspondance et papiers inédits[/tpl] (2 vols, Paris, 1885); and by A de Boislisle in vol. 2 of his [tpl]lang|fr|Correspondance des controleurs généraux[/tpl] (1883).

[[Hydrothermal circulation]]
CATEGORIES: Geological processes, Physical oceanography

Hydrothermal circulation in its most general sense is the circulation of hot water (Ancient Greek ὕδωρ, water,Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. and θέρμη, heat ). Hydrothermal circulation occurs most often in the vicinity of sources of heat within the Earth's crust. In general, this occurs near volcanic activity, but can occur in the deep crust related to the intrusion of granite, or as the result of orogeny or metamorphism.

The "Scramble for Africa" (also known as the "Race for Africa" or the Partition of Africa) was the invasion, occupation, colonization, and annexation of African territory by European powers during the period of New Imperialism between 1881 and 1914. In 1870, 10% of Africa was under European control; by 1914 it was 90%, with only Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and Liberia still independent.  The Berlin Conference of 1884, which regulated European colonization and trade in Africa, is often cited as a convenient starting point.[tpl]cite journal |last=Brantlinger |first=Patrick |year=1985 |title=Victorians and Africans: The Genealogy of the Myth of the Dark Continent |journal=Critical Inquiry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=166–203 |jstor=1343467 |doi=10.1086/448326[/tpl] Consequent to the political and economic rivalries among the European empires, in the last quarter of the 19th century, the partitioning of Africa was how the Europeans avoided warring amongst themselves over Africa.R.

The Baghdad Battery, sometimes referred to as the Parthian Battery, is the common name for a number of artifacts created in Mesopotamia, during the dynasties of Parthian or Sassanid or Persian Empire period (the early centuries AD), and probably discovered in 1936 in the village of Khuyut Rabbou'a, near Baghdad, Iraq. These artifacts came to wider attention in 1938 when Wilhelm König, the German director of the National Museum of Iraq, found the objects in the museum's collections. In 1940, König published a paper speculating that they may have been galvanic cells, perhaps used for electroplating gold onto silver objects.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2804257.stm | title=Riddle of 'Baghdad's batteries' | publisher=BBC News | date=February 27, 2003 | accessdate=April 6, 2012 | author=Frood, Arran | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66jb0KoWa | archivedate=April 6, 2012[/tpl]The Baghdad Battery, Museum of Unnatural Mystery website.  This interpretation is far from having widespread acceptance,  but continues to be considered as at least a hypothetical possibility by some scientists.

The existence of such a battery is not mere speculation; it is supported by ... fundamentally similar cell batteries... the so called Baghdad Battery...  " in particular, a chapter on the batteries appeared in Erich von Däniken's discredited book Chariots of the Gods?, leading to the theory being publicly described as a myth, and considered impossible or irrelevant.Baghdad batteries on the Bad Archaeology Network website. Along with other theories and explanations presented by von Däniken, it is considered by the mainstream archaeological academy as fringe science or even charlatanism, assuming von Däniken knows his presentations are skewed and mostly not true, but still advocating the theories for money or fame."Erich von Däniken's Chariots of the Gods: Science or Charlatanism?", Robert Sheaffer.

Arne Carl-August Beurling (3 February 1905 – 20 November 1986) was a Swedish mathematician and professor of mathematics at Uppsala University (1937–1954) and later at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.
Beurling worked extensively in harmonic analysis, complex analysis and potential theory.  The "Beurling factorization" helped mathematical scientists to understand the Wold decomposition, and inspired further work on the invariant subspaces of linear operators and operator algebras, e.g. Håkan Hedenmalm's factorization theorem for Bergman spaces.
In the summer of 1940 he single-handedly deciphered and reverse-engineered an early version of the Siemens and Halske T52 also known as the Geheimfernschreiber ("secret teletypewriter") used by Nazi Germany in World War II for sending ciphered messages.[tpl]cite book|last=Beckman|first=B.|title=Codebreakers: Arne Beurling and the Swedish crypto program during World War II.|location=Providence, RI|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2002[/tpl] The T52 was one of the so-called "Fish cyphers", that, using transposition, created nearly one quintillion (893,622,318,929,520,960) different variations. It took Beurling two weeks to solve the problem using pen and paper. Using Beurling's work, a device was created that enabled Sweden to decipher German teleprinter traffic passing through Sweden from Norway on a cable. In this way, Swedish authorities knew about Operation Barbarossa before it occurred. Since the Swedes would not reveal how this knowledge was attained, the Swedish warning was not treated as credible by Soviets.
This became the foundation for the Swedish National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA). The cypher in the Geheimfernschreiber is generally considered to be more complex than the cypher used in the Enigma machines.[ref]

Beurling was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970.[tpl]cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=25 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110725002054/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf| archivedate= 25 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] He was the doctoral advisor of Lennart Carleson and Carl-Gustav Esseen.
Beurling was married to Karin V. Beurling, who was a distinguished PhD student from Uppsala University. When they lived in Princeton, she worked in a biochemistry lab at Princeton University.http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Search/historysearch.cgi?SUGGESTION=Arne+Beurling&CONTEXT=1

American Juniors is an American reality television singing competition series that was broadcast for one season, in 2003, on the Fox Network. The series was a spin-off of American Idol, but with younger contestants, and had the same production team as American Idol: it was created by Simon Fuller and 19 Entertainment, along with FremantleMedia, and directed by Bruce Gowers, and produced by Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick. However, unlike American Idol, the goal of the competition was not to find a single winner, but rather to create a singing group of five of the contestants. In this way, American Juniors more closely resembled the British series S Club Search, which had produced the group S Club Juniors. The only season of American Juniors aired in the summer of 2003.

[[Flag of Brazil]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Brazil, National flags, National symbols of Brazil, Southern Cross Flags

The national flag of Brazil ([tpl]lang-pt|Bandeira do Brasil[/tpl]) is a blue disc depicting a starry sky spanned by a curved band inscribed with the national motto, within a yellow rhombus, on a green field. Brazil officially adopted this design for its national flag on November 19, 1889, replacing the flag of the second Empire of Brazil. The concept was the work of Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, with the collaboration of Miguel Lemos, Manuel Pereira Reis and Décio Villares.
The green field and the yellow rhombus from the previous imperial flag were preserved – the green and yellow colors representing the reigning House of Braganza and the house of the consort of the first emperor, Habsburg.The World Factbook: Brazil – Flag description CIA. Retrieved on 2010-10-08. A blue circle with 27 white five-pointed stars replaced the arms of the Empire of Brazil. The stars, whose position in the flag reflect the sky over Rio de Janeiro on November 15, 1889, represent the union's federated units – each star representing a specific State, plus one for the Federal District. The motto "Ordem e Progresso" ("Order and Progress") is inspired by Auguste Comte's motto of positivism: "L’amour pour principe et l’ordre pour base; le progrès pour but" ("Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal").Bandeiras e significados Historianet.

[[Thomas Abbt]]

CATEGORIES: 1738 births, 1766 deaths, People from Ulm, German philosophers, University of Halle alumni, Viadrina European University faculty

Thomas Abbt (25 November 1738 – 3 November 1766) was a German mathematician and writer.
Born in Ulm,"Abbt, Thomas" in Chambers's Encyclopædia. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 1, p. 5. Abbt visited a secondary school in Ulm, then moved in 1756 to study theology,  philosophy and mathematics at the University of Halle, receiving a Magister degree in 1758. In 1760 he was appointed as an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Frankfurt (Oder), where he wrote his most well-known work Vom Tode für's Vaterland (1761).
This highly patriotic tract thematises Frederick II's defeat at Kunersdorf. It also drew the attention of the editors of the famous Literaturbriefe (Literary Letters), started by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. He contributed a large number of historical, political, esthetical and philosophical essays. Abbt was a fervent admirer of Lessing and seconded his educational, prosaic style of writing.
In autumn 1761 he was appointed as the full professor of mathematics in Rinteln. In 1763, he entered a competition that was sponsored by the Berlin Academy for an essay on the application of mathematical proofs to metaphysics. Among the competitors were Moses Mendelssohn, who won, and Immanuel Kant. While in Rinteln, Abbt wrote his other famous work, Vom Verdienste (1765).
He travelled for nine months to France, where he was able to speak with Voltaire in Ferney. He also climbed in the Alps of Savoy. This travel and the disapproval of the life at the university raised his urge to trade the Theory for the Life.
While dealing with the idea to become a historian, he was offered in 1765 at the same time a professorship at the University of Marburg and a post as Councillor of the Court at the court of Count Wilhelm von Schaumburg-Lippe. He decided for the latter.
The count was highly interested in the plans of Thomas Abbt, which included a history of Maximilian and a translation of Sallust among others.
However in 1766, the twenty-seven-year-old Abbt suddenly died of an intestinal illness in Bückeburg. Of him Herder wrote that he "died for Germany and for his language too early!"

Charnia is the genus name given to a frond-like Ediacaran lifeform with segmented ridges branching alternately to the right and left from a zig-zag medial suture. The genus Charnia was named after Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, England, where the first fossilised specimen was found.
The living organism was a type of fractal life form that grew on the sea floor and is believed to have fed on nutrients in the water. Despite Charnia's fern-like appearance, it is not a plant or alga because the nature of the fossilbeds where specimens have been found demonstrate that it originally lived in deep water, well below the photic zone where photosynthesis can occur.

The German orthography reform of 1996 (Rechtschreibreform) was an attempt to simplify the spelling of the German language and thus to make it easier to learn,[tpl]cite journal|last=Upward|first= Chris|title= Spelling Reform in German | journal = Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society|year=1997|volume=J21|pages=22–24, 36|url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j21/german.php[/tpl] without substantially changing the rules familiar to all living users of the language. 
The reform was based on an international agreement signed in Vienna in July 1996 by the governments of the German-speaking countries of Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Luxembourg did not participate despite having German as one of the three official languages, having regarded itself "as a non-German-speaking country not to be a contributory determinant upon the German system of spelling". Luxembourg later unilaterally adopted the reform.
The reformed orthography became obligatory in schools and in public administration. However, there was a campaign against the reform and in the resulting public debate the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany was called upon to delineate the extent of reform.  In 1998[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rs19980714_1bvr164097.html | title = Bundesverfassungsgericht, Urteil vom 14.

In March 2006, the Council for German Orthography agreed unanimously to remove the most controversial changes from the reform; this was accepted by media organizations such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that had previously opposed the reform.[tpl]Citation | first = Dagmar | last = Giersberg | url = http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/siw/en630493.htm | title = Chronicle of a Long Debate: The Spelling Reform |date=December 2007 | accessdate = 29 September 2011 | publisher = Gœthe | place = DE[/tpl].

[[Monsieur Zenith]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional characters with albinism

Monsieur Zenith the Albino is an ambiguous villain created by writer Anthony Skene for the "Sexton Blake" series of detective pulp fiction.
Zenith is an albino, world-weary gentleman thief, originally Romanian nobility but in exile for undetermined reasons. He is full of an ennui which can only be relieved by opium, danger and adventure. Zenith sets himself against Blake not out of avarice but for the joy of the game, and treats Blake with sportsmanship rather than anger or hatred.
Zenith is influenced as much by the anti-heroes of Gothic fiction as he is by the master villains of 20th century pulp fiction, notably Fantômas. Zenith remains one of Blake's most popular adversaries.
M. Zenith was an important influence in the creation of the fantasy character Elric of Melniboné. Elric's creator Michael Moorcock in turn influenced the re-publication of Skene's sole novel, Monsieur Zenith: The Albino (ISBN 0861301099), for which he wrote an introduction,World Famous Comics >> Baker's Dozen - Bill Baker, Jan 05, 2005 and reused the characters in The Metatemporal Detective.

Web colors are colors used in designing web pages, and the methods for describing and specifying those colors. Colors may be specified as an RGB triplet or in hexadecimal format (a hex triplet). They may also be specified according to their common English names in some cases. Often a color tool or other graphics software is used to generate color values. In some uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading number sign (#).[tpl]cite book | last = Niederst Robbins | first = Jennifer | title = Web Design in a Nutshell | publisher = O'Reilly |date=February 2006 |page=830 | isbn = 978-0-596-00987-8 |chapter=Appendix D: Specifying Color [/tpl]York, Richard.

[[Supporters' trust]]
CATEGORIES: Supporters' trusts

In British sports, a supporters' trust is a formal, democratic and not-for-profit organisation of fans who attempt to strengthen the influence of supporters over the running of the club they support. There are over 140 supporters’ trusts across England, Wales and Scotland and the majority of these are affiliated to football clubs, however trusts also exist for Rugby League and Rugby Union.
With government and with cross-party support, Supporters Direct was established to encourage the formation of supporters' trusts to promote democratic supporter ownership. Supporters Direct encourages these bodies to be formed as Industrial and Provident Societies (IPSs) and assists with their formation, legal and start-up costs.  
Supporters' trusts were commonly founded in response to a financial crisis which threatens the future of a team, as was the case at Chesterfield, Lincoln City and York City. Their involvement has reportedly ensured the survival of over 20 different clubs entering into administration, particularly during the period of crisis as a result of the collapse of ITV Digital. Supporters' trusts are now more commonly founded in order to increase influence at clubs through a financial stake in the club.
The first trust established was at Northampton Town in January 1992. The largest is the Manchester United Supporters Trust, which used to be known as Shareholders United and currently has over 200,000 members.http://action.joinmust.org/index.php/content/splash Other large trusts such as Leeds, Exeter City, Dundee United, Reading, Spurs and Glasgow Rangers have between 3,000 and 7,000 members.

[[Deweyism]]
CATEGORIES: Pedagogy, Critical pedagogy, Education

Deweyism is the system of education expounded by John Dewey in his 1897 book, My Pedagogic Creed.Dewey, J. (1897). My Pedagogic Creed. School Journal, vol. 54 (3) p. 77-80. It emphasized social interaction and group learning over individual education, and became the dominant model in American education. (Dewey himself was an avowed socialist.)
An important component of Deweyism was the "look-say" method of learning to read. It replaced the method of phonics previously used. The look-say method was the source of some controversy; it has been argued that it causes dyslexia or even illiteracy.

The East Village is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York City, lying east of Greenwich Village, south of Gramercy Park and Stuyvesant Town, and north of the Lower East Side.
The area was once generally considered to be part of the Lower East Side, but began to develop its own identity and culture in the late 1960s, when many artists, musicians, students and hippies began to move into the area, attracted by cheap rents and the base of Beatniks who had lived there since the 1950s. The neighborhood has become a center of the counterculture in New York, and is known as the birthplace and historical home of many artistic movements, including punk rockIn Rocking East Village, The Beat Never Stops, Karen Schoemer, The New York Times, June 8, 1990. and the Nuyorican literary movement.Another Nuyorican Icon Fades, Santiago Nieves, New York Latino Journal, May 13, 2005. It has also been the site of protests and riots.
The East Village is still known for its diverse community, vibrant nightlife and artistic sensibility, although in recent decades it has been argued that gentrification has changed the character of the neighborhood.Kugel, Seth, "An 80-Block Slice of City Life", The New York Times, September 19, 2007.

The literacy rate in Albania for the total population, age 9 or older, is about 99%. Elementary education is compulsory (grades 1-9), but most students continue at least until a secondary education. Students must pass graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade and at the end of the 12th grade in order to continue their education.
Most schools are public and financed through the government, but recently several private schools of various levels have been opened. There are about 5000 schools throughout the country. The academic year is divided into two semesters. The school week begins on Monday and ends on Friday. Depending on the academic level, the school year usually begins in mid-September or October and finishes in early June or July. There is a winter break of about two weeks.

CATEGORIES: Combustion, Threshold temperatures

[tpl]Other uses|Flashpoint (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Flashpoint[/tpl]
The flash point of a volatile material is the lowest temperature at which it can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air. Measuring a flash point requires an ignition source. At the flash point, the vapor may cease to burn when the source of ignition is removed.
The flash point is not to be confused with the autoignition temperature, which does not require an ignition source, or the fire point, the temperature at which the vapor continues to burn after being ignited. Neither the flash point nor the fire point is dependent on the temperature of the ignition source, which is much higher.
The flash point is often used as a descriptive characteristic of liquid fuel, and it is also used to help characterize the fire hazards of liquids. “Flash point” refers to both flammable liquids and combustible liquids. There are various standards for defining each term. Liquids with a flash point less than [tpl]convert|60.5|or|37.8|C|F[/tpl] — depending upon the standard being applied — are considered flammable, while liquids with a flash point above those temperatures are considered combustible.NFPA 30: Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, 2012 Edition Retrieved January 4, 2014.

The Symphony No. 10 by Gustav Mahler was written in the summer of 1910, and was his final composition. At the time of Mahler's death the composition was substantially complete in the form of a continuous draft; but not being fully elaborated at every point, and mostly not orchestrated, it was not performable in that state.  Only the first movement is regarded as reasonably complete and performable as Mahler intended.  Perhaps as a reflection of the inner turmoil he was dealing with at the time (Mahler knew he had a failing heart and his wife had committed infidelity), the 10th Symphony is arguably his most musically dissonant work.

[[Leg before wicket]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket laws and regulations, Cricket terminology

Leg before wicket (lbw) is one of the ways in which a batsman can be dismissed in the sport of cricket. The basis of the law is that, following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket but was intercepted by any part of the batsman's body except the hand holding his bat. The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets and whether the batsman was offering a shot.
Lbw first appeared in the laws in 1774, as batsmen began to use their pads to prevent the ball hitting their wicket. Over several years, refinements were made to clarify where the ball should pitch and to remove the element of interpreting the batsman's intentions. The 1839 version of the law used a wording that remained in place for nearly 100 years. However, from the latter part of the 19th century, batsmen became increasingly expert at "pad-play" to reduce the risk of their dismissal. Following a number of failed proposals for reform, in 1935 the law was expanded, such that batsmen could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of off stump. Critics felt this change made the game unattractive as it encouraged negative tactics at the expense of leg spin bowling.
After considerable debate and various experiments, the law was changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, which is used to this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.
In his 1995 survey of cricket laws, Gerald Brodribb states: "No dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw; it has caused trouble from its earliest days". Owing to its complexity, the law is widely misunderstood among the general public and has proven controversial among spectators, administrators and commentators; lbw decisions have sometimes caused crowd trouble. Since the law's introduction, the proportion of lbw dismissals has risen steadily through the years. Statistics reveal that the probability of a batsman being dismissed lbw in a Test match varies depending on where the match is played and which teams are playing.

The Major League Soccer All-Star Game is an annual soccer game held by Major League Soccer featuring select players from the league against an international club. MLS initially adopted a traditional all-star game format used by other North American sports leagues where the Eastern Conference squared off against the Western Conference. This eventually evolved into the current system where the league annually invites a club from abroad to play against a league all-star team. The MLS All-Stars hold a 6–4 record in the competition marking the season's midpoint. Players are awarded rosters spots through a combination of fan voting and selections by the appointed manager and league commissioner.

[[England, Half-English]]

CATEGORIES: Billy Bragg albums, 2002 albums, Albums produced by Grant Showbiz, Elektra Records albums

England, Half English is a 2002 album by English political singer-songwriter Billy Bragg and The Blokes, and a song from that album.  The song is about racism in England and the anti-immigration feelings and racist abuse of asylum seekers fuelled by the tabloid press, particularly the Daily Mail.  The song uses examples such as the lions on the English football team's shirts, Britannia and the English patron saint, St. George (from Lebanon), the hyphen in Anglo-Saxon and the nation's favourite dish (curry) to convey his message that everything about English culture is shaped and influenced by the waves of immigration that have taken place in the past.
The title is taken from England, Half English, a 1961 collection of essays and articles by Colin MacInnes, which includes a 1957 article called "Young England, Half English" about the influence of American pop music on English teenagers.
"Take Down The Union Jack", a song from the album that protests against the monarchy, Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee and argues for English and Scottish independence. It reached number 22 in the UK singles chart in May 2002.

CATEGORIES: Black hat search engine optimization, Culture jamming, Google, Internet slang, Marketing techniques, Political campaign techniques

The terms Google bomb and Googlewashing refer to the practice of causing a web page to rank highly in search engine results for unrelated or off-topic search terms by linking heavily. In contrast, search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of improving the search engine listings of web pages for relevant search terms.
It is done for either business, political, or comedic purposes (or some combination thereof).[tpl]cite news|first=Tom Jr.|last=Zeller|title=A New Campaign Tactic: Manipulating Google Data|work=The New York Times (Late Edition (East Coast))|date=October 26, 2006|page=A.20|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/26/us/politics/26googlebomb.html[/tpl] (Note: payment required, weblink goes to abstract.) Google's search-rank algorithm ranks pages higher for a particular search phrase if enough other pages linked to it use similar anchor text (linking text such as "miserable failure"). By January 2007, however, Google tweaked its search algorithm to counter popular Google bombs such as "miserable failure" leading to George W. Bush and Michael Moore; now, search results list pages about the Google bomb itself. As of April 1, 2014, the first result in a Google search for "miserable failure" is this Wikipedia article, defining Google bomb, although at least four of the following results show links related to Bush. Used both as a verb and a noun, "Google bombing" was introduced to the New Oxford American Dictionary in May 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050516-184202|title=Google and Google Bombing Now Included New Oxford American Dictionary|work=Search Engine Watch|first=Gary|last=Price|date=May 16, 2005|accessdate=January 29, 2007[/tpl].
Google bombing is related to spamdexing, the practice of deliberately modifying HTML to increase the chance of their website being placed close to the beginning of search engine results, or to influence the category to which the page is assigned in a misleading or dishonest manner.
The term Googlewashing was coined by Andrew Orlowski in 2003 to describe the use of media manipulation to change the perception of a term, or push out competition from search engine results pages (SERPs).[tpl]cite news|last=Orlowski|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Orlowski|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/03/antiwar_slogan_coined_repurposed/|title=Anti-war slogan coined, repurposed and Googlewashed ... in 42 days.|date=April 3, 2003|work=The Register|accessdate=January 6, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Andrew A.

Elite is a seminal space trading video game, originally published by Acornsoft in 1984 for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers.  The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of "Elite". It was written and developed by David Braben and Ian Bell, who had met while they were both undergraduates at Jesus College, Cambridge.

Elite was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden line removal. Another novelty was the inclusion of The Dark Wheel, a novella by Robert Holdstock which influenced new players with insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire.

[[Touchpad]]

CATEGORIES: Computing input devices, History of human–computer interaction, Pointing devices

A touchpad [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʌ|tʃ|p|æ|d[/tpl] or trackpad [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|æ|k|p|æ|d[/tpl] is a pointing device featuring a tactile sensor, a specialized surface that can translate the motion and position of a user's fingers to a relative position on the operating system that is outputted to the screen.  Touchpads are a common feature of laptop computers, and are also used as a substitute for a mouse where desk space is scarce. Because they vary in size, they can also be found on personal digital assistants (PDAs) and some portable media players. Wireless touchpads are also available as detached accessories. In recent years the term "touchpad" is falling out of favor in exchange for "trackpad," as the term "touchpad" is often confused with tablet PCs or "convertible" touchscreen laptop computers.

Abdas, (also Abda, Abdias, and Audas) was bishop of Susa in Iran (Socrates of Constantinople also calls him "bishop of Persia"Socrates Scholasticus, Ecclesiastical  history, vii. 8). He was born in fourth-century Chaldor to a Zoroastrian mother. The latter educated him in good virtues, which made him loved by everyone. 
After Abda has gained an excellent education and grown up in virtuous life, he was ordained a priest, and built up in his hometown a monastery and a school, which he took personal care of and which grew to have around 60 teachers, as some say. Abda baptized for Jesus many lambs in Chaldor, and brought others to the true faith, which caused the magi to arrest him. In his prison, Abda endured humiliations, hunger and pain, persevering in his faith in Jesus, until his miraculous release.
During the persecution that was led by Shapur II against the Christians, a tree-cross grew up from the ground and caused numerous miracles. This tree brought many people around it, where they built a monastery, which Abda later joined and used as a base to preach the Gospel of Life. Abda became a bishop over Kaskhar (Susa), and many people followed in his footsteps, becoming disciples of him. 
Engaged in a dispute with the  local magi in AD 420, he was accused of burning down one of their temples, a pyramid of Ahura Mazda. King Yazdegerd ordered the bishop to restore and repair the building at his own expense, upon Abdas' refusal the King ordered the destruction of the churches. These events soured the relationship between the Christian church and the Persian government which had previously been good, and caused a wave of persecution against the Christians in Persia.Theodoret,  v. 39 Other than he is supposed to have helped Maruthas in driving out a demon from Yezdegerd's,Socrates Scholasticus,  vii. 8 nothing else certain is known of him. Tradition adds to this that he was one of the first martyred in the persecution (he was clubbed to death), and for this he is considered a saint.  His companions in the killings included the priests Hashu and Isaac, the secretary Ephrem, the hypodeacon Papa, the laymen Daduk and Durdan, and Papa, a brother of Abda himself. His feast day is 5 September or 16 May[tpl]cite web|title=St. Abdas - Catholic Online|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1067|publisher=Catholic Online|accessdate=2007-09-08[/tpl] in the Roman Catholic Church, and March 31 in the Syrian church.

The third USS ''Indianapolis'' (SSN-697), a Los Angeles-class submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Indianapolis, Indiana. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 24 January 1972 and her keel was laid down on 19 October 1974.  She was launched on 30 July 1977 sponsored by Mrs. William G. Bray, and commissioned on 5 January 1980, with Commander Harry P. Salmon, Jr., in command.
When the submarine Indianapolis was commissioned, many survivors of the cruiser Indianapolis were present for the official ceremony.
A smaller group of survivors of the cruiser were also present when the Indianapolis was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 December 1998 and stored in Pearl Harbor until disposed of by submarine recycling. The last captain of the Indianapolis was William J. Toti, who also wrote the forward and afterward to Thomas Helm's Ordeal by the Sea : The Tragedy of the U.S.S Indianapolis. Because of Captain's Toti willingness to defend Captain Charles Butler McVay III who had been court-martialed for the sinking of the Portland class Cruiser in 1945, Captain Toti has been held in high esteem by the survivors of the 1945 sinking.

[[Galilean invariance]]
CATEGORIES: Classical mechanics, Galileo Galilei

Galilean invariance or Galilean relativity states that the laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames.  Galileo Galilei first described this principle in 1632 in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems using the example of a ship travelling at constant velocity, without rocking, on a smooth sea; any observer doing experiments below the deck would not be able to tell whether the ship was moving or stationary. The fact that the Earth orbits around the sun at approximately 30 km/s offers a somewhat more dramatic example, though it is technically not an inertial reference frame.

[[The Colophon, A Book Collectors' Quarterly]]

CATEGORIES: Book design, Hobby magazines, Defunct magazines of the United States, Publications established in 1929, Publications disestablished in 1950

The publication titled The Colophon, subtitled A Book Collectors' Quarterly or A quarterly for booklovers, was a limited edition quarterly periodical begun late in 1929 and continuing in various guises until 1950. It was the brainchild of Elmer Adler (1884–1962), founder of Pynson Printers of New York City. His idea was that various printers around the world would be willing to contribute their time and expertise to produce signatures (articles) using their own choice of papers, typography and illustration. These articles would then be bound together in boards by Pynson Printers and marketed to 2,000 subscribers.
Some articles comment on a current or historical issue related to printing, publishing or art. Other articles were themselves intended to be an example of printing or a work of art. As each article or item was normally a short section produced by a different designer and printer, a typical issue included a range of styles, papers, and typography, often using unusual or experimental approaches not widely seen in longer or mainstream printed items.
Each issue would also include an original piece of graphic art, some signed by the artist, many produced by using etching, lithography, or engraving. Some of these are rare and valuable; as a result, some copies of the bound volumes have been vandalized to remove the prints.
Adler gathered around him an editorial board of John Winterich, Alfred Stanford and F.B. Adams, Jr. and contributing editors including Rockwell Kent, W. A. Dwiggins, Frederic Goudy, Dard Hunter, Bruce Rogers, A. Edward Newton and many others who were well known in the book world. It was their responsibility to provide not only editorial expertise but articles (and in the case of Rockwell Kent, The Colophon logos and colophons).
Beginning in early 1930, this "adventure in enthusiasm", as Adler called it, was greeted with public enthusiasm as well and subscribers clamoured for it. However, it soon ran into difficulty as the Depression made the then costly subscription price of $15 per year difficult for many. By 1935, only 1,700 subscribers could be found. Nonetheless, the quality of The Colophon remained unsurpassed—through the good will of printers, authors and artists—as well as with the help of a number of anonymous financial gifts. From 1935 to 1938, The Colophon entered a new phase with less lofty production values (at a price of $4 per year), before returning to a higher level of quality in 1939 with the 'New Graphic Series'. Starting again in 1948, the name The New Colophon: A Book Collectors' Quarterly was used by Philip Duschnes and the quarterly was entirely printed by the Anthoensen Press of Portland, Maine, continuing publication until 1950 in a fourth and final format.
Many of the writers of the day, such as Sherwood Anderson and Edith Wharton, wrote autobiographical articles about their first books and many artists now famous, such as Paul Landacre, Howard Cook, and Emil Ganso, provided original prints.
Sets of this periodical can still be found in many major public and college libraries, often in rare book and special collections libraries.

[[Trauma center]]

CATEGORIES: Traumatology, Emergency medicine

A trauma center is a hospital equipped and staffed to provide comprehensive emergency medical services to patients suffering traumatic injuries. Trauma centers grew into existence out of the realization that traumatic injury is a disease process unto itself requiring specialized and experienced multidisciplinary treatment and specialized resources.
According to the CDC, injuries are the leading cause of death for American children and adults ages 1–44. The leading causes of trauma are motor vehicle accidents, falls, and assaults with a deadly weapon.
In the United States, a hospital can receive trauma center verification by meeting specific criteria established by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and passing a site review by the Verification Review Committee.Verification Review Committee Official designation as a trauma center is determined by individual state law provisions. Trauma centers vary in their specific capabilities and are identified by "Level" designation: Level-I (Level-1) being the highest, to Level-III (Level-3) being the lowest (some states have five designated levels, in which case Level-V (Level-5) is the lowest).
Higher levels of trauma centers will have trauma surgeons available, including those trained in such specialties as Neurosurgery and Orthopedic surgery,[tpl]cite book |author=Andrew B., MD Peitzman; Andrew B. Peitzman; Michael, MD Sabom; Donald M., MD Yearly; Timothy C., MD Fabian |title=The Trauma Manual |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2002 |pages=3 |isbn=0-7817-2641-7[/tpl] a nurse specialist in trauma care,Consultation/Verification Program Reference Guide of Suggested Classification[tpl]cite book| author=American College of Surgeons | title=Consultation/Verification Program, Reference Guide of Suggested Classification|publisher=American College of Surgeons | year=2006|pages=3 |isbn=0-7817-2641-7[/tpl] as well as highly sophisticated medical diagnostic equipment.  Lower levels of trauma centers may only be able to provide initial care and stabilization of a traumatic injury and arrange for transfer of the victim to a higher level of trauma care.
The operation of a trauma center is extremely expensive. Some areas—especially rural regions—are under-served by trauma centers because of this expense. As there is no way to schedule the need for emergency services, patient traffic at trauma centers can vary widely. A variety of different methods have been developed for dealing with this.
A trauma center will often have a helipad for receiving patients that have been airlifted to the hospital. In many cases, persons injured in remote areas and transported to a distant trauma center by helicopter can receive faster and better medical care than if they had been transported by ground ambulance to a closer hospital that does not have a designated trauma center. The trauma level certification can directly affect the patient's outcome and determine if the patient needs to be transferred to a higher level trauma center.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]

He accompanied Lord Amherst on his mission to China in 1816-17 as the embassy's chief medical officer and naturalist, on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks. The mission was Britain's second unsuccessful attempt to establish diplomatic relations with China and involved travelling to the capital Pekin (Beijing) and the famous botanical gardens of Fa Tee near Canton. While in China, Abel collected specimens and seeds of the plant that carries his name, Abelia chinensis, described by Banks' botanical secretary Robert Brown, "with friendly partiality". However a shipwreck and an attack by pirates on the way back to his home in Britain caused him to lose all of his specimens. Abel's Narrative of a Journey in the Interior of China, 1818, gives a detailed account of the collection's misfortunes. Fortunately, he had left some specimens with sir George Staunton at Canton, who was kind enough to return them to him; living specimens of the Chinese Abelia that we know today were introduced by Robert Fortune in 1844.Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v. "Abelia".
In March, 1819 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society[tpl]cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27abel%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 5 December 2010[/tpl] He was also a member of the Geological Society.According to the title page of his Narrative 1818.

[[Golden hour (medicine)]]

In emergency medicine, the golden hour (also known as golden time) refers to a time period lasting for one hour following traumatic injury being sustained by a casualty or medical emergency, during which there is the highest likelihood that prompt medical treatment will prevent death.[tpl]cite book |author=American College of Surgeons |title=Atls, Advanced Trauma Life Support Program for Doctors |publisher=Amer College of Surgeons |year=2008 |isbn= 978-1880696316[/tpl] It is well established that the patient's chances of survival are greatest if they receive care within a short period of time after a severe injury; however, there is no evidence to suggest that survival rates drop off after 60 minutes. Some have come to use the term to refer to the core principle of rapid intervention in trauma cases, rather than the narrow meaning of a critical one-hour time period.

A catalytic converter  is a vehicle emissions control device that converts toxic pollutants in exhaust gas to less toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction (oxidation or reduction). Catalytic converters are used in internal combustion engines fueled by either petrol (gasoline) or diesel—including lean burn engines.
The first widespread introduction of catalytic converters was in the United States automobile market. Manufacturers of 1975 model year equipped gasoline-powered vehicles with catalytic converters to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's stricter regulation of exhaust emissions.[tpl]cite journal | title = Doing the Impossible | journal = Invention & Technology | date = Winter 2004 | first = Tim | last = Palucka | volume = 19 | issue = 3| url = http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/3/2004_3_22.shtml| accessdate = 2011-12-14 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081203124718/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/3/2004_3_22.shtml | archivedate = 2008-12-03[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last1 = Petersen Publishing | title = The Petersen Automotive Troubleshooting & Repair Manual | chapter = The Catalytic Converter | editors = Erwin M.

In 1981, two-way catalytic converters were rendered obsolete by “three-way” converters that also reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx); however, two-way converters are still used for lean burn engines.
Although catalytic converters are most commonly applied to exhaust systems in automobiles, they are also used on electrical generators, forklifts, mining equipment, trucks, buses, locomotives, motorcycles, and airplanes. They are also used on some wood stoves to control emissions.[tpl]Cite web|title= Choosing the Right Wood Stove|url=http://www.epa.gov/burnwise/woodstoves.html|work=Burn Wise|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl]  This is usually in response to government regulation, either through direct environmental regulation or through health and safety regulations.

A marine park is a park consisting of an area of sea (or lake) sometimes protected for recreational use, but more often set aside to preserve a specific habitat and ensure the ecosystem is sustained for the organisms that exist there.  Most marine parks are designated by governments, and organized like 'watery' national parks.
The largest marine park used to be the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia, at 350,000 km² until 2010, when the United Kingdom announced the opening of the Chagos Marine Park or Chagos Archipelago.
Although for many uses it is sufficient to designate the boundaries of the marine park and to inform commercial fishing boats and other maritime enterprises, some parks have gone to additional effort to make their wonders accessible to visitors.  These can range from glass-bottomed boats and small submarines, to windowed undersea tubes.
In New Zealand a marine reserve is an area which has a higher degree of legal protection than marine parks for conservation purposes.
In New South Wales, there are planned marine parks which will stretch along the coastline of the entire state.

(January 15, 1919[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]September 19, 2011), was the first Prime Minister of Belize and is considered to have been one of the principal architects of the country's independence.  Today he is referred to by many as "the Father of the Nation".
Born in Belize City, in what was then British Honduras, to William and Irene (née Escalante) Price, he entered politics in 1947 with his election to the Belize City Council.

Beverly Sills (May 25, 1929[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]July 2, 2007) was an American operatic soprano whose peak career was between the 1950s and 1970s. In her prime she was the only real rival to Joan Sutherland as the leading bel canto stylist.Matthew Boyden. The Rough Guide to Opera 3rd Edition London: Rough Guides Ltd., 2002
Although she sang a repertoire from Handel and Mozart to Puccini, Massenet and Verdi, she was known for her performances in coloratura soprano roles in live opera and recordings. Sills was largely associated with the operas of Donizetti, of which she performed and recorded many roles. Her signature roles include the title role in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, the title role in Massenet's Manon, Marie in Donizetti's La fille du régiment, the three heroines in Offenbach's Les contes d'Hoffmann, Rosina in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, Violetta in Verdi's La traviata, and most notably Elisabetta in Roberto Devereux.
After retiring from singing in 1980, she became the general manager of the New York City Opera. In 1994, she became the Chairman of Lincoln Center and then, in 2002, of the Metropolitan Opera, stepping down in 2005. Sills lent her celebrity to further her charity work for the prevention and treatment of birth defects.

[[Grand Tour]]
CATEGORIES: Types of tourism, Types of travel

The Grand Tour was the traditional trip of Europe undertaken by mainly upper-class European young men of means. The custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transit in the 1840s, and was associated with a standard itinerary. It served as an educational rite of passage. Though primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of Protestant Northern European nations on the Continent, and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, U.S., and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey less of a burden, and Thomas Cook made the "Cook's Tour" a byword.
The New York Times recently described the Grand Tour in this way:
The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, lay in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent. In addition, it provided the only opportunity to view specific works of art, and possibly the only chance to hear certain music. A grand tour could last from several months to several years. It was commonly undertaken in the company of a Cicerone, a knowledgeable guide or tutor. The Grand Tour had more than superficial cultural importance; as E. P. Thompson stated, "ruling-class control in the 18th century was located primarily in a cultural hegemony, and only secondarily in an expression of economic or physical (military) power."Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class 1991:43.
In essence the Grand Tour was neither a scholar's pilgrimage nor a religious one,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12085a.htm |title=Pilgrimages |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20[/tpl] though a pleasurable stay in Venice and a cautious residence in Rome were essential. Catholic Grand Tourists followed the same routes as Protestant Whigs.  Since the 17th century a tour to such places was also considered essential for budding young artists to understand proper painting and sculpture techniques, though the trappings of the Grand Tour— valets and coachmen, perhaps a cook, certainly a "bear-leader" or scholarly guide— were beyond their reach. The advent of popular guides, such as the Richardsons', did much to popularize such trips, and following the artists themselves, the elite considered travel to such centres as necessary rites of passage. For gentlemen, some works of art were essential to demonstrate the breadth and polish they had received from their tour: in Rome antiquaries like Thomas Jenkins provided access to private collections of antiquities, among which enough proved to be for sale that the English market raised the price of such things, as well as for coins and medals, which formed more portable souvenirs and a respected gentleman's guide to ancient history. Pompeo Batoni made a career of painting English milordi posed with graceful ease among Roman antiquities. Many continued on to Naples, where they viewed Herculaneum and Pompeii, but few ventured far into southern Italy and fewer still to Greece, still under Turkish rule.

[[Duchy of Brittany]]

CATEGORIES: History of Brittany, Dukes of Brittany, Former monarchies of Europe

The Duchy of Brittany (Breton: Dugelezh Breizh, French: Duché de Bretagne) was a medieval feudal state that existed between approximately 939[tpl]efn|This was the date of the Battle of Trans-Fôret[/tpl] and 1547.[tpl]efn|The year the titles of King of France and Duke of Brittany were joined in one ruler, Henri II of France[/tpl] Its territory covered the northwestern peninsula of Europe, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the west and the English Channel to the north, and less definitively by the Loire River to the south and Normandy and other French provinces to the east. The duchy was established after the expulsion of Viking armies from the region around 939. The Duchy of the 10th and 11th century was politically unstable, with the dukes only holding limited power outside their own personal lands. The duchy had mixed relationships with the neighbouring Duchy of Normandy, sometimes allying itself with Normandy, and at other times, such as the Breton-Norman War, entering into open conflict.
Henry II of England invaded Brittany at the end of the 12th century, making his son, Geoffrey, the Duke. The Angevins remained in control until the collapse of their empire in northern France in 1204 and the conquest of the Duchy by Philip II of France. The French Crown maintained its influence over the Duchy for the rest of the 13th century. Monastic orders supported by the Breton aristocracy spread across the Duchy in the 11th and 12th centuries, and in the 13th the first of the mendicant orders established themselves in Brittany's major towns. Civil war broke out in the 14th century, as rival claimants for the Duchy vied for power during the Breton War of Succession, with different factions supported by England and France.
The independent sovereign nature of the Duchy began to come to an end upon the death of Francis II in 1488. The Duchy was inherited by his daughter, Anne, but King Charles VIII of France had her existing marriage annulled and then married her himself. As a result, the King of France acquired the title of Duke of Brittany jure uxoris. The Duchy was finally merged into the Kingdom of France in 1532 through a vote of the Estates of Brittany.
Following the French Revolution, and as a result of the various republican forms of French government since 1792, the duchy was replaced by the French system of [tpl]lang|fr|départements[/tpl] (or Departments) which continues under the Fifth Republic of France. In modern times the departments have also joined into administrative regions[tpl]efn| The creation of regions in modern France occurred pursuant to the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982)[/tpl] although the administrative region of Brittany does not encompass the entirety of the medieval duchy.

Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is the third studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan. It was produced by Pierre Marchand in Montreal, released on October 22, 1993 on Nettwerk in Canada and February 5, 1994 on Arista Records in the United States.
The album was an immediate hit in Canada, where McLachlan was already an established star. Over the next two years, it became her breakthrough album internationally as well. However, in some countries, most notably the United States, the album was a steady seller that stayed in the middle ranges of the pop charts for almost two years. As of November 2003, the album has sold 2.8 million copies in the United States."Ask Billboard - FUMBLING TOWARDS SALES". Billboard. Retrieved 28 May 2009.
"Possession", the album's first single, is written from the point of view of an obsessed fan.  Following the album's release, a fan named Uwe Vandrei sued McLachlan for songwriting credit, claiming that his letters were used as the basis of the song. The case never made it to trial as Vandrei was found dead of apparent suicide in November 1994.
Some editions contain an album version of McLachlan's 1995 single used for The Brothers McMullen soundtrack, "I Will Remember You". The track's lyrics do not appear in the booklet, nor strangely does the track's crediting information.
August 5, 2008 saw the release of the 15th anniversary 3-disc edition the album. The set includes the original remastered album, The Freedom Sessions and a DVD that includes live performances, music videos and more. The album was released by Legacy Recordings.

[[Merry England]]

CATEGORIES: English culture, Pseudohistory, Utopias, Social history of England, National romanticism

"Merry England", or in more jocular, archaic spelling "Merrie England" (also styled as "Merrie Olde England"), refers to an English autostereotype, a utopian conception of English society and culture based on an idyllic pastoral way of life that was allegedly prevalent at some time between the Middle Ages and the onset of the Industrial Revolution. More broadly, it connotes a putative essential Englishness with nostalgic overtones, incorporating such cultural symbols as the thatched cottage, the country inn, the cup of tea and the Sunday roast. Children's storybooks and fairytales written in the Victorian period often used this as a setting as it is seen as a mythical utopia. They often contain nature-loving mythological creatures such as elves and fairies, as well as Robin Hood. It may be treated both as a product of the sentimental nostalgic imagination and as an ideological or political construct, often underwriting various sorts of conservative world-views.
"Merry England" is not a wholly consistent vision but rather a revisited England which Oxford folklorist Roy Judge described as "a world that has never actually existed, a visionary, mythical landscape, where it is difficult to take normal historical bearings."Roy Judge, "May Day and Merrie England" Folklore 102.2 (1991, pp. 131-148) p 131. By contrast, Ronald Hutton's study of churchwardens' accountsHutton, The Rise and Fall of Merrie England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700. places the creation of "Merry England" in the years between 1350 and 1520, with the newly elaborative annual festive round of the liturgical year, with candles and pageants, processions and games, boy bishops and decorated rood lofts. Hutton discovered that, far from being pagan survivals, many of the activities of popular piety criticised by sixteenth-century reformers were actually creations of the later Middle Ages and that "Merry England" reflects historical aspects of rural English folklore that were lost during industrialization.Tom Hodgkinson, The Guardian, 17 November 2006 - "Hutton's work confirms my belief that Britain was a merrier place before the Puritans came along with their black hats and hatred of fun. Merry England was not a myth. They really did used to dance around the maypole, feast all day and drink beer all night. And not only was it more merry, the merry-making was actually encouraged by the Church, particularly in the later medieval period. This was because the Church had realised that merry-making could be a source of funds - the profits of the bar went to church upkeep - and also because it helped bind communities."  Favourable perceptions of Merry England reveal a nostalgia for aspects of an earlier society that are missing in modern times.

[[The Interactive Encyclopedia System]]

CATEGORIES: Hypertext, 1983 introductions

The Interactive Encyclopedia System, or TIES, was a hypertext system developed at the University of Maryland, College Park by Ben Shneiderman in 1983. The earliest versions of TIES ran in DOS text mode, using the cursor arrow keys for navigating through information. A later version of HyperTIES for the Sun workstation was developed using the NeWS window system, with an authoring tool based on UniPress's Gosling Emacs text editor. 
The TIES program has evolved into the HyperTies commercial product, sold by the Cognetics Corporation. HyperTies has a small feature set and has touch-screen support which makes it optimal for public displays and information kiosks. As for navigation types, only reference links are supported, which can be either text or graphics. The mouse pointer also highlights anchors when passing over them.

[[Book collecting]]

CATEGORIES: Book collecting

Book collecting is the collecting of books, including seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever books are of interest to a given individual collector.  The love of books is bibliophilia, and someone who loves to read, admire, and collect books is a bibliophile.
Bibliophile book collecting is distinct from casual book ownership and the accumulation of books for reading.  It can probably be said to have begun with the collections of illuminated manuscripts, both commissioned and second-hand, by the elites of Burgundy and France in particular, which became common in the 15th century.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy appears to have had the largest private collection of his day, with about six hundred volumes. With the advent of printing with movable type books became considerably cheaper, and book collecting received a particular impetus in England and elsewhere during the Reformation when many monastic libraries were broken up, and their contents often destroyed.  There was an English antiquarian reaction to  Henry VIII's dissolution of the Monasteries.  The commissioners of Edward VI plundered and stripped university, college, and monastic libraries, so to save books from being destroyed, those who could began to collect them.
Book collecting can be easy and inexpensive: there are millions of new and used books, and thousands of bookstores, including online booksellers like Abebooks, Alibris, Amazon, and Biblio.com.  Only the wealthiest book collectors pursue the great rarities: the Gutenberg Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio are, for example, both famous and extremely valuable.  Collectors of average means may collect works by a favorite author, first editions of modern authors, or books on a given subject.  Book prices generally depend on the demand for a given book, the number of copies available, and the book's condition. There are associations that collectors may join. The Fine Press Book Association is aimed at collectors of modern fine printing, and produces its journal, Parenthesis, twice a year. The Private Libraries Association covers modern fine printing too, but is much more general in its outlook and produces a quarterly journal, the Private Library.

Albert Allick Bowlly (7 January 1898[tpl]bfidb name|429904[/tpl] – 17 April 1941) was a Mozambican born South African singer, songwriter, composer and band leader, who became a popular jazz crooner during the British dance band era of the 1930s and later worked in the United States. He recorded more than 1,000 records between 1927 and 1941. His most popular songs include "Midnight, the Stars and You", "Goodnight, Sweetheart", "The Very Thought of You", "Guilty" and "Love Is the Sweetest Thing".
Born in Lourenço Marques in the then-Portuguese colony of Mozambique, Bowlly gained his musical experience singing for a dance band led by Edgar Adeler on a tour of South Africa, Rhodesia, India and Indonesia during the mid-1920s. He was then employed by Jimmy Liquime to perform in India, Calcutta, Singapore and the Raffles Hotel. In 1928, he arrived in the United Kingdom and briefly worked with Percival Mackey's band before being made redundant due to the 1930s depression. In 1930, he was spotted and signed to accompany Roy Fox's and Ray Noble's orchestras that November. The signing with Noble led to a successful association between the two that resulted in more than 500 records being produced over a four-year period.
In 1933, Bowlly began to collaborate with Lew Stone and had further success producing some of the most popular jazz records of the 1930s. A year later, Bowlly travelled abroad to  New York which resulted in further success, and an introduction into the American charts. During the mid-1930s, Bowlly recorded "Blue Moon", "Easy to Love", "I've Got You Under My Skin" and "My Melancholy Baby" which were all sizable successes.
By 1938, Bowlly began to suffer problems with his throat and was forced to return to London. His absence from the United Kingdom had damaged his popularity with British audiences and he toured regional theatres and continued his recording career, performing with different orchestras in order to make a living. In 1940, he formed a double act with Jimmy Messene and took part in Radio Stars with Two Guitars, performing in theatres across London. His last recorded song was a duet with Messene of Irving Berlin's satirical song on Hitler, entitled "When That Man Is Dead and Gone". It was his last venture before his death in an air raid in April 1941.

[[NoteCards]]

CATEGORIES: Hypertext, HyperCard products

NoteCards was a hypertext personal knowledge basesystem developed at Xerox PARC by Randall Trigg, Frank Halasz and Thomas Moran in 1984. NoteCards developed after Trigg became the first to write a Ph.D. thesis on hypertext while at the University of Maryland College Park in 1983. NoteCards is one of the best known hypertext projects in the research world due to its design being well documented.
NoteCards is built on the model of there being four basic kinds of objects: notecards, links, browser card, and a filebox. Each window is an analog of a cue card; window sizes may vary, but contents cannot scroll. As such, the windowing model is not fully supported. Local and global maps are available through browsers. There are over 40 different nodes which support various media.

NoteCards was implemented in LISP on Xerox D-machine workstations, which used large, high-resolution displays. The NoteCards interface is event-driven. One interesting feature of NoteCards is that authors may use LISP commands to customize or create entirely new node types. The powerful programming language allows almost complete customization of the entire NoteCards work environment.
Notecards has been referred to as a "second generation" hypertext system.

The duo, having been featured in numerous stage and television shows, currently headline a show in Las Vegas at The Rio. Penn Jillette serves as the act's orator and raconteur. Teller, however, generally does not speak while performing, and instead communicates through mime and nonverbals, although his voice can occasionally be heard during their show.  Besides magic, the pair have recently become associated with their advocacy of atheism, scientific skepticism, and libertarianism, particularly through their television show Penn & Teller: Bullshit!.

[[Alderman]]
CATEGORIES: Titles, Government occupations, Local government in the United States, Local government in the United Kingdom

An alderman is a member of a municipal assembly or council in many jurisdictions founded upon English law. The term may be titular, denoting a high-ranking member of a borough or county council, a council member chosen by the elected members themselves rather than by popular vote, or a council member elected by voters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alderman|title=Alderman|year=2010|work= Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. 2010.  |accessdate=11 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100221213127/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alderman| archivedate= 21 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The title is derived from the Old English title of ealdorman, literally meaning "elder man", and was used by the chief nobles presiding over shires.
Similar titles exist in Germany and in Scandinavian countries, such as the German Ältermann, the Swedish Ålderman and the Danish Olderman, which all mean "elder man" or "wise man".
It is possible that this harkens back to tribal societies, but since these often lie before written history, it is unknown how far back it goes.
An Olderman could be a retired chieftain, or otherwise important member of the tribe that had retired due to old age.
It has the advantage of retaining the knowledge of the old leader within a field, without challenging the new leader.

[[Symbolics Document Examiner]]

CATEGORIES: Hypertext

Symbolics Document Examiner was a powerful and early hypertext system developed at Symbolics (a manufacturer of high-end workstations) by Janet Walker in 1985. The Symbolics Document Examiner was first used for a hypertext implementation of the Symbolics manual in the sixth release of the Genera operating system, and was well liked, winning an award from the Society of Technical Documentation."The Document Examiner included with Release 6 won an award from the Society of Technical Documentation. The Symbolics Graphics Division introduced S-Paint, S! ! -Geometry, S-Render, and S-Dynamics as part of an integrated video-compatible image-making and image-processing facility." "Symbolics Technical Summary", 1985
The Symbolics manual was an 8,000 page document that was represented in a 10,000 node "hyperdocument" containing 23,000 links in all. The entire manual required 10 MB of storage space - a significant amount in 1985, even on the Lisp machines Symbolics sold. The Symbolics Document Examiner used a hierarchical structure, which differed from other experimental hypertext systems; it apparently was partially inspired by an even earlier hypertext system, the precursor to Texinfo which originated with Emacs"We saw no reason to have the underlying information structure be reflected in the user interface model unless that structure was a good model for interacting with information.   My experience in trying to help users with a tree-structured   information interface (the INFO subsystem in EMACS) led me to believe that a book-like interface would be more palatable for many people." pg 8 of Janet H. Walker's "Document Examiner: Delivery Interface for Hypertext Documents". 1987, Proceeding of the ACM conference on Hypertext
Symbolics Document Examiner users could add bookmarks, which allowed returning to specific items easier; this method was later incorporated in graphical web browsers. The system also supported on-line substring searching. The biggest drawback to the Symbolics Document Examiner was that users could not make changes to any information or to a document's navigation.
The authoring environment for the Document Examiner was Symbolics Concordia. With Symbolics Concordia it was possible to edit all documentation.

[[Self-organization]]
CATEGORIES: Cybernetics, Self-organization, Sociocultural evolution, Systems theory, Concepts in physics

Self-organization is a process where some form of global order or coordination arises out of the local interactions between the components of an initially disordered system. This process is spontaneous: it is not directed or controlled by any agent or subsystem inside or outside of the system; however, the laws followed by the process and its initial conditions may have been chosen or caused by an agent. It is often triggered by random fluctuations that are amplified by positive feedback. The resulting organization is wholly decentralized or  distributed over all the components of the system. As such it is typically very robust and able to survive and self-repair substantial damage or perturbations. In chaos theory it is discussed in terms of islands of predictability in a sea of chaotic unpredictability.
Self-organization occurs in a variety of physical, chemical, biological, social and cognitive systems. Common examples are crystallization, the emergence of convection patterns in a liquid heated from below, chemical oscillators, swarming in groups of animals, and the way neural networks learn to recognize complex patterns.

Mainland is a name given to a large landmass in a region (as contrasted with a nearby island or islands), or to the largest of a group of islands in an archipelago. Sometimes its residents are called "Mainlanders". Because of its larger area, a mainland almost always has a much larger population than its associated islands, and mainlander culture and politics sometimes threaten to dominate those of the islands.
Prominent uses of the term include:
The term is used on multiple levels. To someone in Tasmania, continental Australia is the mainland; but to residents of King Island, Flinders Island, and the other surrounding islands, Tasmania itself is the mainland.

Canadian content (abbreviated CanCon, cancon or can-con) refers to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) requirements, derived from the Broadcasting Act of Canada, that radio and television broadcasters (including cable and satellite specialty channels) must air a certain percentage of content that was at least partly written, produced, presented, or otherwise contributed to by persons from Canada. It also refers to that content itself, and, more generally, to cultural and creative content that is Canadian in nature.
Other countries employ similar quota systems. Australian broadcasters are required to broadcast a certain percentage of Australasian content. Similar domestic content quota laws also exist in the Philippines, Mexico, Nigeria, Israel, South Africa, Jamaica, Venezuela, and New Zealand. Quotas also apply in the Republic of Ireland and France (which now have a European Union content rule rather than domestic ones.) The United States does not restrict the broadcasting of foreign content; given the domestic and global strength of the US media, such content restrictions would be unnecessary.

The Sanderling (Calidris alba) is a small wading bird. It is a circumpolar Arctic breeder, and is a long-distance migrant, wintering south to South America, South Europe, Africa, and Australia. It is highly gregarious in winter, sometimes forming large flocks on coastal mudflats or sandy beaches.
It is somewhat unlike other sandpipers in appearance, which has led to the suggestion that it should be placed into a monotypic genus Crocethia. A more recent review (Thomas et al., 2004) indicates, however, that the Sanderling is a fairly typical "stint" or small sandpiper and should be separated from the large knots with its closest relatives in a distinct genus.
This bird is similar in size to a Dunlin, but stouter, with a thick bill. It shows a strong white wingbar in flight, and runs along the sandy beaches it prefers with a characteristic "bicycling" action, stopping frequently to pick small food items. It eats small crabs and other small invertebrates. In spring, birds migrating north from South America consume large numbers of horseshoe crab eggs in the Delaware Bay area.
In spring, the birds arrive on the High Arctic breeding grounds (see map), where they lay 3–4 eggs in a ground scrape. On the nesting grounds, these birds mainly eat insects and some plant material.
The Sanderling is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

[[Stint]]
CATEGORIES: Calidris

A stint is one of several very small waders in the paraphyletic "Calidris" assemblage - often separated in Erolia - which in  North America are known as peeps. They are scolopacid waders much similar in ecomorphology to their distant relatives, the charadriid plovers.
Some of these birds are difficult to identify because of the similarity between species, and various breeding, non-breeding, juvenile and moulting plumages. In addition, some plovers are also similarly patterned, especially in winter. With a few exceptions, stints usually have a fairly stereotypical color pattern, being brownish above and lighter - usually white - on much of the underside. The breast sides are almost[tpl]Verify source|date=January 2008[/tpl] always colored like the upperside, and there is usually a lighter supercilium above brownish cheeks. Notably, golden or orangey colors - common in plovers - are absent[tpl]Verify source|date=January 2008[/tpl].

[[Bin packing problem]]
CATEGORIES: Optimization algorithms and methods, Packing problem, Strongly NP-complete problems

In the bin packing problem, objects of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of volume V in a way that minimizes the number of bins used. In computational complexity theory, it is a combinatorial NP-hard problem. 
There are many variations of this problem, such as 2D packing, linear packing, packing by weight, packing by cost, and so on. They have many applications, such as filling up containers, loading trucks with weight capacity constraints, creating file backups in  media and technology mapping in Field-programmable gate array semiconductor chip design.
The bin packing problem can also be seen as a special case of the cutting stock problem. When the number of bins is restricted to 1 and each item is characterised by both a volume and a value, the problem of maximising the value of items that can fit in the bin is known as the knapsack problem.
Despite the fact that the bin packing problem has an NP-hard computational complexity, optimal solutions to very large instances of the problem can be produced with sophisticated algorithms. In addition, many heuristics have been developed: for example, the first fit algorithm provides a fast but often non-optimal solution, involving placing each item into the first bin in which it will fit. It requires Θ(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements to be packed. The algorithm can be made much more effective by first sorting the list of elements into decreasing order (sometimes known as the first-fit decreasing algorithm), although this still does not guarantee an optimal solution, and for longer lists may increase the running time of the algorithm. It is known, however, that there always exists at least one ordering of items that allows first-fit to produce an optimal solution.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Rhyd|title=A General-Purpose Hill-Climbing Method for Order Independent Minimum Grouping Problems: A Case Study in Graph Colouring and Bin Packing|journal=Computers and Operations Research|year=2009|volume=36|issue=7|pages=2295-2310|doi=10.1016/j.cor.2008.09.004[/tpl]
A variant of bin packing that occurs in practice is when items can share space when packed into a bin. Specifically,  a set of items could occupy less space when packed together than the sum of their individual sizes. This variant is known as VM packing[tpl]harvnb|Sindelar|Sitaraman|Shenoy|2011|pp=367–378[/tpl] since when virtual machines (VMs) are packed in a server, their total memory requirement could decrease due to pages shared by the VMs that need only be stored once. If items can share space in arbitrary ways, the bin packing problem is hard to even approximate. However, if the space sharing fits into a hierarchy, as is the case with memory sharing in virtual machines, the bin packing problem can be efficiently approximated.

A pagoda is a tiered tower built in the traditions originating in historic East Asia or with respect to those traditions, with multiple eaves common in Nepal, India, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Burma and other parts of Asia. Some pagodas are used as Taoist houses of worship. Most pagodas were built to have a religious function, most commonly Buddhist, and were often located in or near viharas. This term may refer to other religious structures in some countries. In Vietnam and Cambodia, due to French translation, the English term pagoda is a more generic term referring to a place of worship, although pagoda is not an accurate word to describe a Buddhist vihara. The modern pagoda is an evolution of the Ancient Nepal stupa, a tomb-like structure where sacred relics could be kept safe and venerated.The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.

Don Estelle (22 May 1933 – 2 August 2003) was a British actor and singer.
Born Ronald Edwards  in Crumpsall, Manchester, he was brought up in a house on Russell Street, Crumpsall.[tpl]cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/rochdaleobserver/news/s/333428_farewell_to_screen_star_lofty_don.html|title=Farewell to screen star 'Lofty' Don|work=Rochdale Observer|date=5 August 2003|last=Byrne|first=Michael|publisher=M.E.N. Media[/tpl] During World War II, at the age of eight, he was evacuated to Darwen, Lancashire, twenty miles away from his home, to escape the German bombing of the city. It was there he found his voice as a treble at the local Holy Trinity Parish Church (now called St Peter's), and on returning home after the war, he continued singing at St Mary's Church, Crumpsall. He later joined a charity group, the Manchester Kentucky Minstrels, and performed with them the Mario Lanza hit "Granada" in the talent show What Makes a Star? in 1954 at BBC Radio's northern studios in Manchester.
Estelle gained experience by singing one song 12 times a week in the show The Backyard Kids at the Hulme Hippodrome in Manchester. He later toured the northern club circuit, where he met the comedy actor Windsor Davies whom he teamed with and toured for four years. In the 1960s, Estelle had cameo roles in Coronation Street and Dad's Army (in the latter he played a Pickfords man in one episode (1969), and an ARP Warden called Gerald in three more (1970)). He eventually landed the role of Gunner "Lofty" Sugden in the 1970s British sitcom, It Ain't Half Hot Mum. The character was given the ironic nickname of "Lofty" because of Estelle's stature (4 ft 9in). He had a powerful tenor voice and as a spin-off from the series, he and co-star Windsor Davies had a Number 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1975 with a semi-comic version of "Whispering Grass". Estelle also acted in the films Not Now Comrade, A Private Function (1984) and Santa Claus: The Movie (1984). Don and Windsor also released a 14-track LP album called 'Sing Lofty' in 1979.
In the first series of The League of Gentlemen, he made brief appearances in two episodes as Little Don, the keeper of the Roundabout Zoo (a zoo on the island of a roundabout).
In 2001, he appeared in an episode of Linda Smith's A Brief History of Timewasting as "Little Don" of the "East End Art Mafia".http://home.comcast.net/~jal2.02/a2e/brief-history-timewasting.pdf
In his autobiography Sing Lofty: Thoughts Of A Gemini, Estelle was extremely bitter about modern-day entertainment, attacking those who refused to rerun It Ain't Half Hot Mum as "tight-crutched, white-trousered morons". According to his obituary in The Independent, "in recent years Estelle cut a slightly sorry figure, dressed in his "Lofty" outfit, setting out a stall of his tapes and singing to passers-by in shopping centres. Similarly, he played a dirty old man in the promotional video for The Sun Page Three Girl Jo Hicks's single "Yakety Sax" (2001) (The Benny Hill Show theme).Independent obituary One of the stalls he performed at for a time was in the Boston, Lincolnshire branch of Woolworths. He could also be seen performing in Cwmbran town centre in South Wales.
Estelle's last years were in Christchurch, New Zealand, where he spent countless hours working with the founder of 10-piece blues band, Blutopia. Says Malcolm Bishop, "Lofty was looking for someone to believe in and bless in their own career and he picked me! He was extremely generous with time and resources." Bishop recalls sitting with Estelle until 4am the night before he returned to the UK, as Estelle gave him invaluable advice.
Estelle returned to the UK only weeks before his death. He died in Rochdale Infirmary, on 2 August 2003 and was buried in Rochdale, with the oversized pith helmet he wore as Gunner "Lofty" Sugden.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3162925.stm|title=Actor Don Estelle buried|work=BBC News|date=19 August 2003[/tpl] He was survived by his second wife Elizabeth.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1011731,00.html|title=Don Estelle|work=The Guardian|date=4 August 2003|last=Barker|first=Dennis|location=London[/tpl]

An expatriate (sometimes shortened to expat) is a person temporarily or permanently residing in a country other than that of the person's upbringing. The word comes from the Latin terms ex ("out of") and patria ("country, fatherland").
In common usage, the term is often used in the context of professionals or skilled workers sent abroad by their companies,[tpl]cite book|last=Castree|first=Noel|title=A Dictionary of human geography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, Eng.|isbn=9780199599868|edition=1. ed.|coauthors=Kitchen, Rob; Rogers, Alisdair[/tpl] rather than for all 'immigrants' or 'migrant workers'. The differentiation found in common usage usually comes down to socio-economic factors, so skilled professionals working in another country are described as expatriates, whereas a manual labourer who has moved to another country to earn more money might be labelled an 'immigrant' or 'migrant worker'.
There is no set definition and usage varies with context, for example the same person may be seen as an "expatriate" by his home country and a "migrant worker" where he works. Retirement abroad, in contrast, usually makes one an "expatriate".

Myra Breckinridge is a 1968 satirical novel by Gore Vidal written in the form of a diary. It was made into a movie in 1970. Described by the critic Dennis Altman as "part of a major cultural assault on the assumed norms of gender and sexuality which swept the western world in the late 1960s and early 1970s,"Altman, Dennis. Gore Vidal's America. Cambridge UK: Polity Press, 2005. P. 132. the book's major themes are  feminism, transsexuality, American expressions of machismo and patriarchy, and deviant sexual practices, as filtered through an aggressively camp sensibility. Set in Hollywood in the 1960s, the novel also contains candid and irreverent glimpses into the machinations within the film industry.
The book was dismissed by some of the era's more conservative critics as pornographic at the time of its first publication in February 1968, but nevertheless immediately became a worldwide bestseller and has since come to be considered a classic in some circles. "It is tempting to argue that Vidal said more to subvert the dominant rules of sex and gender in Myra than is contained in a shelf of queer theory treatises," wrote Dennis Altman.Altman, Dennis. Gore Vidal's America. Cambridge UK: Polity Press, 2005. P. 148. Critic Harold Bloom cites Myra Breckinridge as a canonical work in his book The Western Canon.Bloom, Harold. The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1994. P. 534. In 1974 Vidal published a sequel, Myron.
In his memoir Palimpsest, Vidal would suggest that the voice of Myra may have been inspired by the "megalomania" of Anaïs Nin's diaries.[tpl]cite book|last=Vidal|first=Gore|title=Palimpsest : a memoir|year=1996|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, N.Y., U.S.A.|isbn=0140260897|pages=108[/tpl]

[[Françoise Bertaut de Motteville]]

CATEGORIES: 1621 births, 1689 deaths, French untitled nobility, 17th-century French writers, French memoirists, French women writers

Françoise Bertaut de Motteville (c. 1621 – 1689), French memoir writer, was the daughter of Pierre Bertaut, a gentleman of the king's chamber, and niece of the bishop-poet Jean Bertaut.
Her mother, a Spaniard, was the friend and private secretary of Anne of Austria, wife of Louis XIII. At the age of seven Françoise was also made a member of the queen's household and given a pension. The influence of Richelieu, however, who wished to separate the queen from her Spanish connexions, exiled mother and daughter to Normandy, where in 1639 the young girl was married to Nicolas Langlois, seigneur de Motteville, president of the Chambre des Comptes of Rouen.
He died two years later at the age of eighty-two, and in 1642 the queen summoned Mme de Motteville to court, being now her own mistress by the death of Richelieu and Louis XIII. Through all the intrigues and troubles of the Fronde Mme de Motteville preserved the honourable reputation of being devoted to her mistress without any party ties or interests.
Some letters of hers are preserved, especially a curious correspondence with Anne, Duchess of Montpensier "La Grande Mademoiselle" on marriage, but her chief work is her Mémoires, which are in effect a history of Anne of Austria, written briefly till the date of Mme de Motteville's return to court, and then with fullness. They give a faithful picture of the life of the court at that time.
The best edition of her Mémoires is that of MF Riaux (2nd ed., Paris, 1891, 4 vols.), containing the essay by Sainte-Beuve from vol. v. of his Causeries du lundi. The Mémoires were translated into English in 1726 and again by KP Wormeley in 3 vols., 1902. For details concerning her family see Recherches sur Madame de Motteville et sur sa famille, by Charles de Beaurepaire (Rouen, 1900).

Its design emphasizes the studio workflow efficiency required for live news production. Following its initial launch in 1981, it revolutionised the production of television graphics.
The first generation Paintbox was principally custom-designed hardware, while the second generation V-Series introduced in 1989 was able to take advantage of general purpose computer hardware combined with custom hardware elements.

In the late 1980s Quantel embarked on lawsuits against the Adobe "Photoshop" software package and the Spaceward Graphics "Matisse" system in an attempt to protect patented aspects of the Paintbox system. They won the initial case against Spaceward in 1990, but finally lost the case against Adobe in 1997 following depositions and demonstrations by a number of Computer Graphics pioneers including Alvy Ray Smith and Dick Phillips. Richard Shoup ported his 1973 paint program Superpaint to Windows for demonstration purposes, and was able to demonstrate that Superpaint had particular features before Quantel's Paintbox.

Jean Bertaut (1552 – 8 June 1611), French poet, was born at Caen.
He figures with Philippe Desportes in the disdainful couplet of Boileau on Ronsard:
 
 "Ce poëte orgueilleux, trébuché de si haut,

Rendit plus retenus Desportes et Bertaut."

He wrote light verse to celebrate the incidents of court life in the manner of Desportes, but his verse is more fantastic and fuller of conceits than his master’s. He early entered the church, and had a share in the conversion of Henry IV, a circumstance which assured his career. He was successively councillor of the parlement of Grenoble, secretary to the king, almoner to Marie de' Medici, abbot of Aulnay[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] and finally, in 1606, bishop of Sées.
After his elevation to the bishopric he ceased to produce the light verse in which he excelled, though his scruples[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] did not prevent him from preparing a new edition of his Recueil de quelques vers amoureux (1602) in 1606. The serious poems in which he celebrated the public events of his later years are dull and lifeless. Bertaut died at Sées on the 8th of June 1611. His works were edited by M. Ad. Cheneviêres in 1891.

[[Closed timelike curve]]

CATEGORIES: Time travel, Lorentzian manifolds

In mathematical physics, a closed timelike curve (CTC) is a world line in a Lorentzian manifold, of a material particle in spacetime that is "closed", returning to its starting point. This possibility was first raised[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] by Kurt Gödel in 1949, who discovered a solution to the equations of general relativity (GR) allowing CTCs known as the Gödel metric; and since then other GR solutions containing CTCs have been found, such as the Tipler cylinder and traversable wormholes. If CTCs exist, their existence would seem to imply at least the theoretical possibility of time travel backwards in time, raising the spectre of the grandfather paradox, although the Novikov self-consistency principle seems to show that such paradoxes could be avoided. Some physicists speculate that the CTCs which appear in certain GR solutions might be ruled out by a future theory of quantum gravity which would replace GR, an idea which Stephen Hawking has labeled the chronology protection conjecture. Others note that if every closed timelike curve in a given space-time passes through an event horizon, a property which can be called chronological censorship, then that space-time with event horizons excised would still be causally well behaved and an observer might not be able to detect the causal violation.[tpl]cite journal | doi= 10.1007/s10701-008-9254-9 | author= H.

[[Jean Herauld Gourville]]

CATEGORIES: 1625 births, 1703 deaths, People from Charente

Jean Herauld Gourville (July 10, 1625 – June 14, 1703) was a French adventurer.
He was born in La Rochefoucauld, in today's Charente département. At the age of eighteen he entered the house of La Rochefoucauld as a servant, and in 1646 became secretary to François de La Rochefoucauld, author of the Maximes. Resourceful and quick-witted, he rendered services to his master during the Fronde, in his intrigues with the parliament, the court or the princes. In these negotiations he made the acquaintance of Condé, whom he wished to help to escape from the château of Vincennes; of Mazarin, for whom he negotiated the reconciliation with the princes; and of Nicolas Fouquet.
After the Fronde he engaged in financial affairs, thanks to Fouquet. In 1658 he farmed the taille in Guienne. He bought depreciated rentes and had them raised to their nominal value by the treasury; he extorted gifts from the financiers for his protection, being Fouquet's confidant in many operations of which he shared the profits. In three years he accumulated an enormous fortune, still further increased by his unfailing good fortune at cards, playing even with the king. He was involved in the trial of Fouquet, and in April 1663 was condemned to death for peculation and embezzlement of public funds; but escaping, was executed in effigy. He sent a valet one night to take the effigy down from the gallows in the court of the Palais de Justice, and then fled the country.
He remained five years abroad, being excepted in 1665 from the amnesty accorded by Louis XIV to the condemned financiers. Having returned secretly to France, he entered the service of Condé, who, unable to meet his creditors, had need of a clever manager to put his affairs in order. In this way he was able to reappear at court, to assist at the campaigns of the war with Holland, and to offer himself for all the delicate negotiations for his master or the king. He received diplomatic missions in Germany, in Holland, and especially in Spain, though it was only in 1694, that he was freed from the condemnation pronounced against him by the chamber of justice. From 1696 he fell ill and withdrew to his estate, where he dictated to his secretary, in four months and a half, his Mémoires, an important source for the history of his time. In spite of several errors, introduced purposely, they give a clear idea of the life and morals of a financier of the age of Fouquet, and throw light on certain points of the diplomatic history. They were first published in 1724.
Gourville died in Paris on June 14, 1703.

Information ([tpl]IPA-da|enfɒmæˈɕoːˀn[/tpl]), full name: Dagbladet Information ([tpl]IPA-da|ˈdɑʊ̯ˌblæˀð enfɒmæˈɕoːˀn|[/tpl]), is a Danish newspaper published Monday through Saturday.
Originally established and edited by Børge Outze and published during World War II by the Danish resistance movement. Information was illegal during the war as it was not regulated by the German occupying power. As of May 5, 1945 (Day of German retreat), Dagbladet Information was a reality and the newspaper itself was officially founded in August 1945. Outze continued to work as the paper's editor in chief to his death in 1980.
Dagbladet Information is the youngest still-surviving newspaper in Denmark and remains independent of the larger publishing houses. As of 2009, it has a daily circulation of 22,313, making it the smallest newspaper in Denmark. It has around 116,000 daily readers and is available on the internet, although access to articles is limited to non-subscribers for a set amount of time. It is the biggest Danish newspaper on Facebook.
The newspaper, which despite being politically independent, it is often regarded as leftist, despite it being equally critical in its point of view of all political organizations. It prints letters from prominent conservative figures and it usually puts great focus in enlightening both sides of a case. The tone is very serious and the amount of charts and pictures is very limited and comparable to the French newspaper Le Monde. Information has a syndication agreement with the British newspaper the Guardian (London), and often collaborates with The Independent for articles and reports.
The corporation also publishes books and has its own publishing house.
On September 8, 2006, the newspaper printed six of the less offensive entries from the Iranian Holocaust cartoon exhibition, which was a response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. The editor chose the cartoons after consulting the main rabbi in Copenhagen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5327852.stm|title=Paper reprints Holocaust cartoons|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-09-08|accessdate=2006-09-08[/tpl]

The Mirandese language (autonym: mirandés or lhéngua mirandesa; [tpl]lang-pt|mirandês[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|pt|língua mirandesa[/tpl]) is a Romance language belonging to the Astur-Leonese linguistic group, sparsely spoken in a small area of northeastern Portugal, in the municipalities of Miranda do Douro, Mogadouro and Vimioso. The Portuguese Parliament granted it co-official recognition (along with the Portuguese language) for local matters on 17 September 1998 with the law 7/99 of 29 January 1999.
Mirandese has a distinct phonology, morphology and syntax, and has been distinct at least since the formation of Portugal in the 12th century.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] It has its roots in the spoken Latin of the north of the Iberian Peninsula (Portuguese developed in the northwest). 
It is a descendant of the ancient Astur-Leonese language of northern Iberia, the last remnant of the ancient language of the Kingdom of León, and closely related to the modern Astur-Leonese languages in Spain. However, these amalgamations in the Spanish territory did not affect Mirandese, which preserves distinct linguistic differences in relation to both Portuguese and Spanish. It shares a great deal of lexicon with regional Portuguese dialects.

[[Charles Collé]]

CATEGORIES: 1709 births, 1783 deaths, Writers from Paris, French dramatists and playwrights

Charles Collé (April 14, 1709 – November 3, 1783) was a French dramatist and songwriter.
The son of a notary, he was born in Paris. He became interested in the rhymes of Jean Heguanier, the most famous writer of couplets in Paris. From a notary's office, Collé was transferred to that of the receiver-general of finance, where he remained for nearly twenty years. When about seventeen, however, he made the acquaintance of Alexis Piron, and afterwards, through Gallet (1698?-1757), of Panard. The example of these three masters of the vaudeville decided his future but also made him diffident; and for some time he composed nothing but amphigouris—verses whose merit was measured by their unintelligibility. The friendship of the younger Crébillon helped broaden his horizons, and the establishment in 1729 of the famous "Caveau" gave him a field for the display of his fine talent for popular song.
In 1739 the Society of the Caveau, which numbered among its members Helvétius, Charles Pinot Duclos, Pierre Joseph Bernard, called Gentil-Bernard, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Alexis Piron, and the two Crébillons, was dissolved, and was not reconstituted till twenty years afterwards. His first and his best comedy, La Vérité dans le vin, appeared in 1747.
Meanwhile, Philippe II of Orléans, who was an excellent comic actor, particularly in representations of low life, and had been looking out for an author to write suitable parts for him, made Collé his reader. It was for the duke and his associates that Collé composed the greater part of his Théâtre de société. In 1763 Collé produced at the Théâtre Français Dupuis et Desronais, a successful sentimental comedy, which was followed in 1771 by La Veuve, which was a complete failure. In 1774 appeared La Partie de chasse de Henri Quatre (partly taken from Dodsley's King and the Miller of Mansfield), Collé's last and best play.
From 1748 to 1772, besides these and a multitude of songs, Collé was writing his Journal, a curious collection of literary and personal strictures on his companions as well as on their enemies, on Piron as on Voltaire, on La Harpe as on Pierre Corneille.
Collé's lyrics are frank and jovial, though often licentious. The subjects are love and wine; occasionally, however, as in the famous lyric (1756) On the capture of Port Mahon, for which the author received a pension of 600 livres, the note of patriotism is struck with no unskilful hand, while in many others Collé shows considerable epigrammatic force.

[[Alexis Piron]]

CATEGORIES: 1689 births, 1773 deaths, People from Dijon, French writers

Alexis Piron (July 9, 1689 – January 21, 1773) was a French epigrammatist and dramatist.
He was born at Dijon, where his father, Aimé Piron, was an apothecary.  Piron senior wrote verse in the Burgundian language. Alexis began life as clerk and secretary to a banker, and then studied law. In 1719, when nearly thirty years old, he went to Paris, where an accident brought him money and notoriety. The jealousy of the regular actors produced an edict restricting the Théâtre de la Foire, or licensed booths at fair times, to a single character on the stage. None of the ordinary writers for this theatre would attempt a monologue-drama for the purpose, and Piron made a great success with a piece called Arlequin Deucalion, representing Deucalion immediately after the Deluge, amusing himself with recreating in succession the different types of man.
In 1728 he produced Les Fils ingrats (known later as L'Ecole des pères) at the Comédie-Française. He attempted tragedy in Callisthene (1730), Gustave Vasa (1733) and Fernand Cortes (1744), but none of these succeeded, and Piron returned to comedy with La Metromanie (1738), in which the hero, Damis, suffers from the verse mania.
His most intimate associates at this time were Mademoiselle Quinault, the actress, and her friend Marie Thérèse Quénaudon, known as Mlle de Bar. This lady was slightly older than Piron and not beautiful, but after twenty years' acquaintance he married her in 1741. He was elected in 1753 to the Académie française, but his enemies raked up a certain Ode à Priape, dating from his early days, and induced Louis XV to interpose his veto. Piron was nevertheless given a pension, and during the last fifty years of his life was never in want. His best title to remembrance lies in his epigrams. The burlesque epitaph on himself, in which he ridicules the Academy--"Ci-gît Piron qui ne fut rien/Pas même académicien"—is well-known, while many others are as brilliant. Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm called him a "machine a saillies." He was later (1762) elected to membership in the Académie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon.
Piron published his own theatrical works in 1758, and after his death his friend and literary executor, Rigoley de Juvigny, published his Œuvres completes. M. Bonhomme produced a critical edition in 1859, completed by Poésies choisies et pièces inédites in 1879.
Piron is compared to the Elder in The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Pavlovich as a compliment of wit.

Jacques Cazotte (17 October 1719 – 25 September 1792) was a French author.
Born at Dijon, he was educated by the Jesuits. Cazotte then worked for the French Ministry of
the Marine and at the age of 27 he obtained a public office at Martinique.
[ref]The Arabian nights : A Companion. by Robert Irwin.
London, Allen Lane, 1994, ISBN 0-7139-9105-4 (pp. 260–5).[/ref]  It was not till his return to Paris in 1760 with the rank of commissioner-general that he made his public debut as an author. His first attempts, a mock romance and a coarse song, gained so much popularity, both in the Court and among the people, that he was encouraged to try something more ambitious. He accordingly produced his romance, Les Prouesses inimitables d'Ollivier, marquis d'Edesse.
He also wrote a number of fantastic oriental tales, such as his children's fairy tale La patte du chat
(The Cat's Paw, 1741) and the humorous Mille et une fadaises, Contes a dormir debout
(The Thousand and One Follies, Tales to Sleep Upright 1742).  His first success was with a "poem" in twelve cantos, and in prose intermixed with verse, entitled Ollivier (2 vols, 1762), followed in 1771 by another romance, the Lord Impromptu. But the most popular of his works was  Le Diable amoureux (The Devil in Love, 1772), a fantastic tale in which the hero raises the devil.[ref]Wells Chamberlin,
"Jacques Cazotte" in Supernatural Fiction Writers, edited by E. F. Bleiler. New York: Scribner's, 1985, ISBN 0-684-17808-7 (pp.29–35).[/ref] The value of the story lies in the picturesque setting, and the skill with which its details are carried out. With the help of the Syrian priest Dom Denis Chavis, he translated some Arabian legends into French for the fairy tale anthology Le Cabinet des fées (1788–1790).[ref]The Arabian Nights in Transnational Perspective
edited  by Ulrich Marzolph. Wayne State University Press, 2007 ISBN	0814332870 (p.34).[/ref]
Cazotte possessed extreme facility and is said to have dashed off a seventh canto of Voltaire's Guerre civile de Genève in a single night. About 1775 Cazotte embraced the views of the Illuminati,  declaring himself possessed of the power of prophecy. It was upon this event that Jean-François de la Harpe based his famous jeu d'esprit, in which he represents Cazotte as prophesying the most minute events of the French Revolution. Near
the end of his life, Cazotte became a follower of the Martinist mysticism of Martinez de Pasqually, and became a "mystical monarchist".
 On the discovery of some of his counter-revolutionary letters in August 1792, Cazotte was arrested; and though he escaped for a time through the efforts of his daughter, he was guillotined the following month.
A complete edition of his work was published as the Œuvres badines et morales, historiques et philosophiques de Jacques Cazotte (4 vols, 1816–1817), though more than one collection appeared during his lifetime. Cazotte's work was an influence on later fantasy writers
such as E. T. A. Hoffmann, Charles Nodier, Gérard de Nerval and Théophile Gautier.[ref]Charlotte Trinquet, "Cazotte, Jacques" in

The nyala (Nyala angasii or Tragelaphus angasii), also called inyala, is a spiral-horned antelope native to southern Africa. It is a species of the family Bovidae and genus Nyala, also considered to be in the genus Tragelaphus. It was first described in 1849 by George French Angas. The body length is [tpl]convert|135|–|195|cm|abbr=on[/tpl], and it weighs [tpl]convert|55|–|140|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. The coat is rusty or rufous brown in females and juveniles, but grows a dark brown or slate grey, often tinged with blue, in adult males. Females and young males have ten or more white stripes on their sides. Only males have horns, [tpl]convert|60|-|83|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] long and yellow-tipped. It exhibits the highest sexual dimorphism among the spiral-horned antelopes.
The nyala is mainly active in the early morning and the late afternoon. It generally browses during the day if temperatures are [tpl]convert|20|-|30|C|F[/tpl] and during the night in rainy season. As a herbivore, the nyala feeds upon foliage, fruits and grasses, with sufficient fresh water. A shy animal, it prefers water holes rather than open spaces. The nyala does not show signs of territoriality, and individual areas can overlap each other. They are very cautious creatures. Old males live alone, but single sex or mixed family groups of up to 10 individuals can be found. These inhabit thickets within dense and dry savanna woodlands. The main predators of the nyala are lion, leopard and Cape hunting dog, while baboons and raptorial birds hunt for the juveniles. Mating peaks during spring and autumn. Males and females are sexually mature at 18 and 11–12 months of age respectively, though they are socially immature until five years old. After a gestational period of seven months, a single calf is born.
The nyala's range includes Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. It has been introduced to Botswana and Namibia, and reintroduced to Swaziland, where it was extinct since the 1950s. Its population is stable and it has been listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The principal threats to the species are poaching and habitat loss resulting from human settlement. The males are highly demanded as game animals in Africa.

[[Gray (unit)]]

CATEGORIES: SI derived units, Nuclear physics, Units of radiation dose, Radioactivity

The gray (symbol: Gy) is a  derived unit of ionizing radiation dose in the International System of Units (SI). It is a measure of the absorbed dose and is defined as the absorption of one joule of radiation energy by one kilogram of  matter.
It is a physical quantity, and does not take into account any biological context, and unlike the pre-1971 non-SI roentgen unit of dose, the gray is defined independently for any target material. The gray is also used to measure specific energy (imparted), and kerma. When measuring kerma, the reference target material must be defined explicitly, usually dry air at standard temperature and pressure.
The gray was named after the British physicist Louis Harold Gray, a pioneer in the field of measurement of radium radiation and X-rays and their effects on living tissue, and was adopted as part of SI by the 15th CGPM in 1975. The SI unit is similar to the traditional cgs unit, the rad (equivalent to 0.01 Gy), which remains common in industry in the United States, while "strongly discouraged" in the style guide for U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology authors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#5.2 |title=NIST Guide to SI Units - Units temporarily accepted for use with the SI[/tpl]

[[88 modern constellations]]

CATEGORIES: Constellations, Lists of constellations

Each culture divides the stars of the night sky into its own set of constellations, usually based on mythology. This article covers the 88 constellations used in modern astronomy, which properly speaking are not patterns of stars, as in the common use of the word, but areas of the sky (the celestial sphere), and include the constellations of the zodiac.
The ancient Sumerians, and later the Greeks (as recorded by Ptolemy), established most of the northern constellations in international use today. When explorers mapped the stars of the southern skies, European and American astronomers proposed new constellations for that region, as well as ones to fill gaps between the traditional constellations. Not all of these proposals caught on, but in 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted the modern list of 88 constellations.  After this, Eugène Joseph Delporte drew up precise boundaries for each constellation,[tpl]cite web|title=The Constellations|url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/|publisher=International Astronomical Union|accessdate=4 November 2012[/tpl] so that every point in the sky belonged to exactly one constellation.

Brian Cowen (born  10 January 1960) is a former Irish politician who served as Taoiseach of Ireland from 7 May 2008 to 9 March 2011. He was head of a coalition government led by Fianna Fáil which until 23 January 2011 had the support of the Green Party and independent TDs.The Progressive Democrats party was part of the coalition government from May 2008 until the partys dissolution in November 2009.
Cowen was also leader of Fianna Fáil from 7 May 2008 until 22 January 2011, when he resigned under political pressure after a failed and highly controversial attempt at a cabinet reshuffle.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0122/politics.html |title=Cowen resigns as FF leader, remains Taoiseach |work=RTÉ News |date=22 January 2011[/tpl]

He became leader of Fianna Fáil on the resignation of Bertie Ahern. On 7 May 2008, following the resignation of Ahern as Taoiseach, Cowen was nominated by Dáil Éireann to replace him and was appointed by the President later that day.
Cowen's administration coincided with the Irish financial and banking crises. He has received substantial criticism for his failure to stem the tide of either crisis, ultimately culminating in his government's formal request for financial rescue from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, widely seen in Ireland as a national humiliation.Recapturing relevance a huge challenge for FF Cowen has brought record low levels of public support for Fianna Fáil, his government, and the Taoiseach himself. With approval at 8 percent by the time the 30th Dáil was dissolved,  he was the least popular incumbent politician in the history of Irish opinion polling. "As Taoiseach," said The Sunday Times, "he has proved to be a dismal failure." In 2011, the Irish Independent called Cowen the "worst Taoiseach in the history of the State."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/the-worst-week-for-the-worst-taoiseach-in-the-states-history-2507517.html |title=The worst week for the worst Taoiseach in the State's history |work=The Irish Independent |date=23 January 2011 |accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl]

Sansoen Phra Barami or Sanrasoen Phra Barami ([tpl]lang-th|สรรเสริญพระบารมี[/tpl], lit: Glorify his prestige.) is the royal anthem of Thailand. The lyrics were composed by Prince Narisaranuvadtivongs, around 1913, and were later revised by King Rama VI. 
There is no certainty about the identity of the song's composer. The music may have been  composed by a Russian composer named Pyotr Schurovsky[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl], while other sources mention several Thai musicians and the Dutch musician Heutzen as the authors.
http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dh3j7mb_1gt6knfvf Phleng Sansoen Phra Barami was the national anthem of Siam until 1932, when it was replaced by Phleng Chat. The royal anthem is performed during state occasions, as well as when a high-ranking member of the royal family is present for a function.  In addition, the royal anthem is still played before the beginning of each film in movie theatres, as well as before the commencement of the first act in plays, musicals, concerts, and most other live performances of music or theatre in Thailand. At the beginning and closing of television and radio programing, the anthem is also played. For example, Channel 7 airs a video of the anthem, with pictures of King Bhumibol Adulyadej from his birth to the present day shown.
In April, 2008, it was reported that a Thai citizen was facing criminal charges of lèse majesté for failing to stand for the playing of the Royal Anthem at a movie theatre in Bangkok.http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/23Apr2008_news04.php

Although this image only shows the integers from −9 to 9, the line includes all real numbers, continuing forever in each direction, and also numbers not marked that are between the integers. It is often used as an aid in teaching simple addition and subtraction, especially involving negative numbers.
It is divided into two symmetric halves by the origin, that is the number zero.
In advanced mathematics, the expressions real number line, or real line are typically used to indicate the above-mentioned concept that every point on a straight line corresponds to a single real number, and vice versa.

[[Pierre Adolphe Chéruel]]

CATEGORIES: French historians, Members of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques, 1809 births, 1891 deaths, École Normale Supérieure alumni

Pierre Adolphe Chéruel (January 17, 1809 – May 1, 1891) was a French historian.
He was born at Rouen and educated at the École Normale Supérieure, becoming a fellow (agregé) in 1830. His early studies were concerned with local history. His Histoire de Rouen sous la domination anglaise au XVe siècle (1840) and Histoire de Rouen pendant l'époque communale, 1550-1382 (Rouen, 1843-1844), are major productions for a time when the archives were neither catalogued nor classified, and contain useful documents previously unpublished. His theses for the degree of doctor, De l'administration de Louis XIV d'après les Mémoires inédits d'Olivier d'Ormesson and De Maria Stuarta et Henrico III (1849), led him to the study of general history. The former was expanded afterwards under the title Histoire de l'administration monarchique en France depuis l'avènement de Philippe-Auguste jusqu'à la mort de Louis XIV (1855), and in 1855 he also published his Dictionnaire historique des institutions, mœurs et coutumes de la France, of which many editions have appeared.
These works may still be consulted for the 17th century, the period upon which Chéruel concentrated all his scientific activity. He edited successively the Journal d'Olivier Lefèvre d'Ormesson (1860–1862), interesting for the history of the parlement of Paris during the minority of King Louis XIV; Lettres du cardinal Mazarin pendant son ministère (6 vols, 1870-1891), continued by the vicomte G. d'Avenel; and Mémoires du duc de Saint-Simon, published for the first time according to the original manuscripts (2 editions, 1856-1858 and 1878-1881).
To Saint-Simon he devoted two critical studies, which are acute but not definitive: Saint-Simon considéré comme historien de Louis XIV (1865) and Notice sur la vie et sur les mémoires du duc de Saint-Simon (1876). The latter may be considered as an introduction to the famous Mémoires. Among his later writings were the Histoire de la France pendant la minorité de Louis XIV (4 vols, 1880) and Histoire de la France sous le ministère de Mazarin (1882–1883). These two works are valuable for abundance of facts, precision of details, and clear and intelligent arrangement, but are characterized by a slightly frigid style. In their compilation Chéruel used a fair number of unpublished documents. To the student of the second half of the 17th century in France, the works of Chéruel are a mine of information.

In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain.  In this case, the theorem gives a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse.  There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth.

Maprotiline (sold as Deprilept, Ludiomil, Psymion) is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA). However, Maprotiline's fourth ring is spurious, as formed by a bridge across the central tricyclic ring. It is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with only weak effects on serotonin and dopamine reuptake.[tpl]cite journal|last=Peng|first=Wen-Huang|coauthors=Kuan-Lin Lo, Yi-Hsuen Lee, Tai-Huang Hung, Ying-Chih Lin|title=Berberine produces antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test and in the tail suspension test in mice|journal=Life Sciences|year=2007|volume=81|issue=11|pages=933–938|doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2007.08.003|pmid=17804020[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=DRUGDEX Evaluations - Maprotiline|url=http://www.micromedexsolutions.com/micromedex2/librarian/ND_T/evidencexpert/ND_PR/evidencexpert/CS/1BD385/ND_AppProduct/evidencexpert/DUPLICATIONSHIELDSYNC/DA7BFE/ND_PG/evidencexpert/ND_B/evidencexpert/ND_P/evidencexpert/PFActionId/evidencexpert.DisplayDrugdexDocument?docId=2586&contentSetId=31&title=Maprotiline+Hydrochloride&servicesTitle=Maprotiline+Hydrochloride|accessdate=25 April 2013[/tpl]It exerts strong blocking effect at H1 receptors, moderate at 5-HT2 and  alpha1 and  weak  blocking effect at D2 and mACh postsynaptic receptors.

The pharmacologic profile of Maprotiline explains its antidepressant, sedative, anxiolytic, and sympathomimetic activities. In accordance to the pharmacological characteristics it is used in the treatment of  depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety. Additionally, it shows a strong antagonism against Reserpine-induced effects in animal studies, as do the other 'classical' antidepressants. Although Maprotiline behaves in most regards as a 'first generation antidepressant' it is commonly referred to as 'second generation antidepressant'.

George Michael Steinbrenner III (July 4, 1930[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]July 13, 2010) was an American businessman who was the principal owner and managing partner of Major League Baseball's New York Yankees. During Steinbrenner's 37-year ownership from 1973 to his death in July 2010, the longest in club history, the Yankees earned seven World Series titles and 11 pennants. His outspokenness and role in driving up player salaries made him one of the sport's most controversial figures. Steinbrenner was also involved in the Great Lakes shipping industry.
Known as a hands-on baseball executive, Steinbrenner earned the nickname "The Boss". He had a tendency to meddle in daily on-field decisions, and to hire and fire (and sometimes re-hire) managers.

The Great Depression in the United Kingdom, also known as the Great Slump, was a period of national economic downturn in the 1930s, which had its origins in the global Great Depression. It was Britain's largest and most profound economic depression of the 20th century. The Great Depression originated in the United States in late 1929 and quickly spread to the world. Britain had never experienced the boom that had characterized the U.S., Germany, Canada and Australia in the 1920s, so its bust appeared less severe.H. W. Richardson, "The Economic Significance of the Depression in Britain," Journal of Contemporary History (1969) 4#4 pp. 3-19 in JSTOR Britain's  world trade fell by half (1929–33), the output of heavy industry fell by a third, employment profits plunged in nearly all sectors. At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million, and many more had only part-time employment. 
Particularly hardest hit by economic problems were the industrial and mining areas in the north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Unemployment reached 70% in some areas at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally) and many families depended entirely on payments from local government known as the dole.  Politically the Conservative Party dominated the era and the Labour Party was seriously hurt.

Robert Hyde Greg (24 September 1795 – 21 February 1875), was an English industrialist, economist and antiquary.
Born in Manchester, the son of Samuel Greg, the creator of Quarry Bank Mill, he was brother to William Rathbone Greg and the junior Samuel Greg. His mother, Hannah, was a descendant of Philip Henry. He attended the University of Edinburgh and, after the obligatory Grand Tour of the antiquities of Continental Europe, joined his father's textile manufacturing enterprise.
He was active in Manchester intellectual life as a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and was a founder of the Mechanics' Institute. He was an active member of the Liberal Party and the Anti-Corn Law League. Though he was elected to Parliament for Manchester in 1839, it was without his consent and he resigned in the following year. He was an opponent of factory reform, trades unions and worker health and safety legislation.
He died at Norcliffe Hall, Styal, Cheshire and is buried at the Dean Row Unitarian Chapel, Wilmslow.

Percy Greg, like his father, wrote about politics, but his views were violently reactionary: his History of the United States to the Reconstruction of the Union (1887) can be said to be more of a polemic, rather than a history.
His Across the Zodiac (1880) is an early science fiction novel, said to be the progenitor of the sword-and-planet genre. For that novel, Greg created what may have been the first artistic language that was described with linguistic and grammatical terminology.Ekman, F: "The Martial Language of Percy Greg", Invented Languages Summer 2008, p. 11.

With an average mortality rate of less than 5% in untreated cases.
Treatment is usually designed to help relieve the symptoms and hence do not directly alter the course of the disease. This treatment usually consists of drugs like ibuprofen or aspirin. In cases where the condition develops on a progressive and/or life-threatening course the treatment is most often steroid treatment with prednisone or prednisolone. Alternatively, drugs that are most commonly used to treat cancer and suppress the immune system, such as methotrexate, azathioprine and leflunomide may be used.
In the United States it most commonly affects people of Northern European (especially Scandinavian or Icelandish) or African (especially African American) ancestry between the ages of 20 and 29, although any race or age group can be affected. Japan has a lower rate of sarcoidosis than the United States, although in these people the disease is usually more aggressive in its course with the heart often affected. Japanese individuals also have a different peak age for sarcoidosis, namely 25–40 years of age.[tpl]cite web|title=Sarcoidosis|url=http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/publications/solddc-chapters/sarcoidosis.pdf|work=State of Lung Disease in Diverse Communities|publisher=American Lung Association|accessdate=21 February 2014|format=PDF|year=2010[/tpl] It occurs more commonly in women too, with the female-to-male being roughly 2:1, it also usually takes a more aggressive course in women.

[[Photoflash capacitor]]

CATEGORIES: Capacitors, Flash photography

A photoflash capacitor is an electrolytic capacitor used in flash cameras, professional flashes, and also in solid-state laser power supplies. Their usual purpose is to briefly power a high-voltage flash tube, used to illuminate a photographic subject or optically pump a laser rod. As flash tubes require very high current for a very short time to operate, photoflash capacitors are designed to supply high discharge current pulses without excessve internal heating.  
The principal properties of a capacitor are capacitance, working voltage, equivalent series resistance (ESR), equivalent series inductance (ESL), and working temperature
Compared with electrolytic capacitors usually used for power supply filtering at power frequency, a photoflash capacitor is designed to have lower ESR, ESL, and capacitance manufacturing tolerance, but does not need as high a working temperature.
The light energy emitted by a flash is supplied by the capacitor, and is proportional to the product of the capacitance and the voltage squared; photoflash capacitors have capacitance in the range 80-160 microfarads (µF) and voltages from 180–330 volts for flash units built into small disposable and compact cameras, increasing for units delivering higher light energy.Forrest M. Mims, III, Forrest Mims' Circuit Scrapbook II, Howard W. Sams & Co., Indianapolis IN, ISBN 0-672-22552-2, page 149. Mims gives the rating of the Kodak Disc camera flash as 160 µF and 180 volts. A typical manufacturer's range includes capacitors operating at 330–380V, with capacitance from 80 to 1,500 µFHitachi Photo Flash Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors Photoflash capacitors are not subject to the high temperatures of cased electronic equipment in continuous operation, with nearby components and sometimes the capacitors themselves dissipating heat; they are often rated at a maximum operating temperature rate of typically 55 °C, compared to 85 °C–105 °C or more for capacitors for continuous use in electronic equipment. In most electronic applications an electrolytic capacitor can have a capacitance much larger than its nominal value without detracting from circuit performance; general-purpose electrolytics are often specified to have capacitance between 20% below and 80% above rated value, although tighter tolerances are available. The light energy of a flash is proportional to the capacitance and large variations are not acceptable, typical tolerance is -10+20%.
Photoflash capacitors are designed to deliver a brief pulse of very high current, and are consequently sometimes used in railgun and coilgun designs.

He is now best known as one of the most successful diplomats of his time. His long career in public service began as a commissioner to Syria in 1860, where his skillful diplomacy maintained British interests while preventing France from instituting a client state in Lebanon. After his success in Syria, Dufferin served in the Government of the United Kingdom as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Under-Secretary of State for War. In 1872 he became the third Governor General of Canada, bolstering imperial ties in the early years of the Dominion, and in 1884 he reached the pinnacle of his diplomatic career as eighth Viceroy of India.
Following his retirement from the diplomatic service in 1896, his final years were marred by personal tragedy and a misguided attempt to secure his family's financial position. His eldest son was killed in the Second Boer War and another son badly wounded. He was chairman of a mining firm that went bankrupt after swindling people, although he was ignorant of the matter. His biographer Davenport-Hines says he was "imaginative, sympathetic, warm-hearted, and gloriously versatile."Davenport-Hines, 2004  He was an effective leader in Lebanon, Canada and India, averted war with Russia, and annexed Burma. He was careless of money but charming in high society in three continents.

Alfred Manuel "Billy" Martin, Jr. (May 16, 1928 – December 25, 1989) was an American Major League Baseball second baseman and manager. He is best known as the manager of the New York Yankees, a position he held five different times. As Yankees manager, he led the team to consecutive American League pennants in [tpl]By|1976[/tpl] and [tpl]By|1977[/tpl]; the Yankees were swept in the 1976 World Series by the Cincinnati Reds but triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games in the 1977 World Series. He also had notable managerial tenures with several other AL squads, leading four of them to division championships.
As a manager, Martin was known for turning losing teams into winners, and for arguing animatedly with umpires, including a widely parodied routine in which he kicked dust on their feet. However, he was criticized for not getting along with veteran players and owners, burning out young pitchers, and for having an addiction to alcohol. During the 1969 through 1988 period as a manager, Martin totaled 1,253 victories with a .553 winning percentage.

[[Transcendence degree]]
CATEGORIES: Field theory, Algebraic varieties, Matroid theory, Transcendental numbers

In abstract algebra, the transcendence degree of a field extension L /K is a certain rather coarse measure of the "size" of the extension. Specifically, it is defined as the largest cardinality of an algebraically independent subset of L over K.
A subset S of L is a transcendence basis of L /K if it is algebraically independent over K and if furthermore L is an algebraic extension of the field K(S) (the field obtained by adjoining the elements of S to K). One can show that every field extension has a transcendence basis, and that all transcendence bases have the same cardinality; this cardinality is equal to the transcendence degree of the extension and is denoted trdegK L or trdeg(L /K). 
If no field K is specified, the transcendence degree of a field L is its degree relative to the prime field of the same characteristic, i.e., Q if L is of characteristic 0 and Fp if L is of characteristic p.
The field extension L /K is purely transcendental if there is a subset S of L that is algebraically independent over K and such that L = K(S).

[[Karl von Abel]]

CATEGORIES: 1788 births, 1859 deaths, People from Wetzlar, German Roman Catholics, Bavarian politicians, Ministers-President of Bavaria

Karl von Abel (September 17, 1788 – September 3, 1859) was a Bavarian statesman. 
Born in Wetzlar, Abel was the son of a procurator at the superior Court of Justice. He studied law in Gießen from 1806-1809, and became a civil servant of Bavaria in 1810. 
In 1817 he was appointed city and police commissar in Bamberg, in 1819, Governmental Councillor in Munich, and in 1827 promoted to Senior Legal Secretary. In the Diet of 1831 he gave a speech in favour of freedom of the press and against censorship.
In the following year, Abel was assigned by King Ludwig I to be a part of the delegation accompanying the young King Otto to Greece. He joined with Georg Ludwig von Maurer in opposing the head of the delegation, Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg who he felt was too susceptible to the wishes of the English diplomats. However, the count was able to mobilise his supporters in Munich and have Abel and Maurer unseated from the delegation. Abel once again became Legal Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior. He married Friederike von Rinecker in 1836, a very religious woman who had much influence on him.
On 1 November 1837, Abel became Privy Councillor in place of Ludwig, Fürst von Wallerstein and began to lead the Ministry of the Interior. At this time, the Church Conflict of Colonia excited the masses on religious and political levels. Soon enough the Ministry under Abel proved to be strictly Catholic, following the traditions of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The status of the clergy was raised and large sums were spent for religious issues. This was followed by several edicts, for example prescribing that Protestant soldiers must also genuflect during a Catholic service. The formation of Evangelic communities and the execution of their services was made complicated and restricted and strict censorship applied to all opposing movements. 
In other issues Abel showed his absolutist and ultramontane position. He authorized an edict disallowing the use of all modern terms, which try to foist the principle of classes with a representative one. As an example, the term of Ministry of the State was forbidden as the king must unite all power in himself. Several affronts against his precursor Wallerstein resulted in a duel which he lost. 
Wallerstein lead the opposition forming mainly in the newly acquired provinces of the kingdom against the paternalism of the Ministry. In the Diet of 1846 he openly fought the existing system. Abel could not avert the claims that he had broken the principle of parity, and that the Christian party was in contact with radical elements. For this the King lost his trust in Abel, and removed him as Ministry of Culture and Education.
Abel was dismissed from power on 17 February 1847 when he and the other ministers opposed the naturalisation of the Kings' young lady Lola Montez. Afterwards, he had not only to suffer the disgrace of the king he had served for a long time, but was also repudiated by the members of his own party. In 1848 Abel was voted into the Second Chamber, but refused to take the charge until the reign of Maximilian II of Bavaria, due to heavy attacks from all sides.
Abel was recalled in 1850 and retired from the political life. Until his death in 1859 he lived on his tenure Stamsried manor in Upper Palatinate.
He died in Munich.

[[Giovanni Francesco Abela]]
CATEGORIES: 1582 births, 1655 deaths, Maltese historians

right|Abela Coat of armsGiovanni Francesco Abela (1582–1655) was a Maltese of noble birth who in the early 17th century wrote an important work on Malta, Della Descrittione di Malta isola nel Mare Siciliano: con le sue antichità, ed altre notizie, "description of Malta, island in the Sicilian sea, with its antiquities, and other information".
Abela was born in Valletta to Marco Abela and Benarda Vella whose great great grandfather was Barone di Pietra Lunga and whose ancestors ruled Malta on more than one occasion and were part of the royal family of Spain. (Abela Family Tree 2006)
Malta illustrated is still an important source of first-hand information on a number of subjects of Melitensia, such as folklore, placenames, the Maltese language, history of Malta and archaeology. His description of the Maltese Islands was translated into Latin by G.A. Seinero in 1725, Latin being the universal language of science and culture of that time. This translation was incorporated in Johann Georg Graevius Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae. 
He became Auditor of Grand Master de Paula, Chaplain and finally Vice Chancellor of the Knights Hospitaller. He is also remembered as the promoter of the first Notarial Archives for Malta.
Gian Francesco Abela visited archaeological sites on the islands and made some valuable observations. He appears to have been the first to note that the ancient temple of Hercules was to be identified with the remains on the hill at Tas-Silg rather than those of Borg in-Nadur. At Tas-Silg he observed foundations and courses of stones ‘ben lavorate e messe insieme,’ and in support of his identification he recorded the discovery of ‘medaglie, pezzi di statue d’idoletti, e d’altre cose, minimi avanzi di quella vana gentilità e falsa religione, quivi ritrovate sotto il Magistero del Principe Wignacourt, mentre alcuni nell’istesso luogo cavando, scioccamente pensavano far acquisto di ricco tesoro.’
In the early 17th century Abela converted his house at Marsa to a historical museum, the first on Malta. Many of its artefacts are now stored in Malta's National Museum of Archaeology.Marsa Local Council - Town at a Crossroad: History of Marsa
He is buried in the Chapel of Our Lady of Filermos (today the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament) in the Co-Cathedral of St. John in Valletta. The Junior College in Msida is named after Abela.
