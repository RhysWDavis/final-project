CATEGORIES: Castles, Types of towns

A castle town is a settlement built adjacent to or surrounding a castle. Castle towns were common in Medieval Europe.  Some examples include small towns like Alnwick and Arundel, which are still dominated by their castles. In Western Europe, and England particularly, it is common for cities and towns that were not castle towns to instead have been organized around cathedrals.
Towns organized around Japanese castles are called jōkamachi [tpl]Nihongo||城下町|[/tpl].

[[Eight-thousander]]
CATEGORIES: Peak bagging, Lists of mountains, Eight-thousanders, Mountaineering

The eight-thousanders are the 14 independentIn making any "highest mountains" list, one needs to use a criterion to exclude subpeaks and only list independent mountains. There is no universally agreed-upon such criterion. However the (generally accepted) list of 14 eight-thousanders is obtained if one uses a topographic prominence cutoff of between 200 and 500 metres (610 and 1524 feet). Some eight-thousand metre subpeaks have been climbed as goals in themselves, for example Lhotse Middle, but this is quite rare. mountains on Earth that are more than [tpl]convert|8000|m|ft|0[/tpl] high above sea level. All eight-thousanders are located in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges in Asia.
The first recorded attempt on an eight-thousander was when Albert F. Mummery and J. Norman Collie tried to climb Kashmir's Nanga Parbat (present-day Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan) in 1895. Mummery and two Gurkhas, Ragobir and Goman Singh, were killed by an avalanche, and the attempt failed.
The first recorded successful ascent of an eight-thousander was by Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal, who reached the summit of Annapurna on June 3, 1950.
The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was Reinhold Messner, who completed this task on October 16, 1986. A year later, in 1987, Jerzy Kukuczka became the second climber to accomplish this feat. Messner had summitted each of the 14 peaks without the aid of supplemental oxygen. This feat was not repeated until nine years later by Erhard Loretan in 1995. [tpl]As of|2011[/tpl], a total of 26 people have summitted all 14 peaks undisputed. This is an extremely hazardous feat; at least four people have died while in pursuit of this goal.

Giovanni Giolitti ([tpl]IPA-it|dʒoˈvanni dʒoˈlitti[/tpl]; October 27, 1842 – July 17, 1928) was an Italian statesman. He was the Prime Minister of Italy five times between 1892 and 1921. He is the second-longest serving Prime Minister in Italian history, after Benito Mussolini.
Giolitti was a master in the political art of Trasformismo, the method of making a flexible, centrist coalition of government which isolated the extremes of the left and the right in Italian politics after the unification. Under his influence, the Italian Liberals did not develop as a structured party. They were, instead, a series of informal personal groupings with no formal links to political constituencies.Amoore, The Global Resistance Reader, p. 39 The period between the start of the 20th century and the start of World War I, when he was Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior from 1901 to 1914 with only brief interruptions, is often called the Giolittian Era.Barański & West, The Cambridge companion to modern Italian culture, p. 44Killinger, The history of Italy, p. 127–28
A left-wing liberal, with strong ethical concerns,Coppa 1970 Giolitti's periods in office were notable for the passage of a wide range of progressive social reforms which improved the living standards of ordinary Italians, together with the enactment of several policies of government intervention.Sarti, Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present, pp. 46–48 Besides putting in place several tariffs, subsidies and government projects, Giolitti also nationalized the private telephone and railroad operators. Liberal proponents of free trade criticized the "Giolittian System", although Giolitti himself saw the development of the national economy as essential in the production of wealth.Coppa 1971

Monte Albán is a large pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Santa Cruz Xoxocotlán Municipality in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca (17.043° N, 96.767°W). The site is located on a low mountainous range rising above the plain in the central section of the Valley of Oaxaca where the latter's northern Etla, eastern Tlacolula, and southern Zimatlán & Ocotlán (or Valle Grande) branches meet. The present-day state capital Oaxaca City is located approximately [tpl]convert|9|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Monte Albán.
The partially excavated civic-ceremonial center of the Monte Albán site is situated atop an artificially-leveled ridge, which with an elevation of about [tpl]convert|1940|m|ft|-2|abbr=on[/tpl] above mean sea level rises some [tpl]convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on[/tpl] from the valley floor, in an easily defensible location. In addition to the aforementioned monumental core, the site is characterized by several hundred artificial terraces, and a dozen clusters of mounded architecture covering the entire ridgeline and surrounding flanks (Blanton 1978). The archaeological ruins on the nearby Atzompa and El Gallo hills to the north are traditionally considered to be an integral part of the ancient city as well.
Besides being one of the earliest cities of Mesoamerica, Monte Albán's importance stems also from its role as the pre-eminent Zapotec socio-political and economic center for close to a thousand years. Founded toward the end of the Middle Formative period at around 500 BC, by the Terminal Formative (ca.100 BC-AD 200) Monte Albán had become the capital of a large-scale expansionist polity that dominated much of the Oaxacan highlands and interacted with other Mesoamerican regional states such as Teotihuacan to the north (Paddock 1983; Marcus 1983). The city had lost its political pre-eminence by the end of the Late Classic (ca. AD 500-750) and soon thereafter was largely abandoned. Small-scale reoccupation, opportunistic reutilization of earlier structures and tombs, and ritual visitations marked the archaeological history of the site into the Colonial period.
The etymology of the site's present-day name is unclear, and tentative suggestions regarding its origin range from a presumed corruption of a native Zapotec name such as “Danibaan” (Sacred Hill) to a colonial-era reference to a Spanish soldier by the name Montalbán or to the Alban Hills of Italy. The ancient Zapotec name of the city is not known, as abandonment occurred centuries before the writing of the earliest available ethnohistorical sources.

In dry climates, it is likely to be found in moist areas or near streams. Three subspecies can be distinguished: the California alligator lizard (E. m. multicarinata), the San Diego alligator lizard (E. m. webbii), and the Oregon alligator lizard (E. m. scincicauda).Stebbins, Robert (2003):331. A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians, Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0-395-98272-3
The southern alligator lizard has a long, somewhat prehensile tail, up to twice the length of its body.  Like many lizards, however, it can drop its tail if attacked, possibly giving it a chance to flee; the tail will regenerate, but will never be as long or richly colored as the original.[tpl]fact|date=June 2013[/tpl]  Individuals with intact tails can reach up to about 11in total length.[tpl]fact|date=June 2013[/tpl]
The lizards can frequently be found near human habitation and are notable for their fearless self-defense; they will often bite and defecate if handled. In the wild they eat small arthropods, slugs, lizards, small mammals and occasionally young birds and eggs.

John Franklin "Home Run" Baker (March 13, 1886 – June 28, 1963) was an American professional baseball player. A third baseman, Baker played in Major League Baseball from 1908 to 1922, for the Philadelphia Athletics and the New York Yankees. Baker has been called the "original home run king of the majors".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19500120&id=TYgtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mJwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3224,5961772|title=Home Run Baker Accepts Bid to Banquet Here: Oldtimers To Honor Swat King of Past|newspaper=Reading Eagle|page=20|date=January 20, 1950|accessdate=April 22, 2014[/tpl]
Baker was a member of the Athletics' $100,000 infield. He helped the Athletics win the 1910, 1911 and 1913 World Series. After a contract dispute, the Athletics sold Baker to the Yankees, where he and Wally Pipp helped the Yankees' offense. Baker appeared with the Yankees in the 1921 and 1922 World Series, though the Yankees lost both series, before retiring.
Baker led the American League in home runs for four consecutive years, from 1911 through 1914. He had a batting average over .300 in six seasons, had three seasons with more than 100 runs batted in, and two seasons with over 100 runs scored. Baker's legacy has grown over the years, and he is regarded by many as one of the best power hitters of the deadball era. During his 13 years as a major league player, Baker never played a single inning at any position other than third base. Baker was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1955.

David James Bancroft (April 20, 1891 – October 9, 1972) was an American baseball shortstop and manager. Nicknamed "Beauty" for his penchant for calling good pitches "beauties", he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1915 to 1930, for the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Giants, Boston Braves, and Brooklyn Robins.
Born in Sioux City, Iowa, Bancroft played in minor league baseball from 1909 through 1914, at which point he was bought by the Phillies. The Giants traded for Bancroft during the 1920 season. After playing for the Giants through the 1923 season, he became player-manager of the Braves, serving in that role for four years. After he was fired by the Braves, Bancroft played two seasons for the Robins and ended his playing career with the Giants the next season. He coached with the Giants, then managed in the minor leagues and the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.
Bancroft was part of the Giants' World Series championship teams in 1921 and 1922. He was also a part of the National League pennant-winning teams of 1915 and 1923. Considered an excellent defensive shortstop and a smart ball player, Bancroft was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971. However, his election was not without controversy, as the Veterans Committee included former teammates of Bancroft, resulting in charges of cronyism against the Veterans Committee.

Ernest "Ernie" Banks (born January 31, 1931), nicknamed "Mr. Cub" and "Mr. Sunshine", is a retired American professional baseball player. He was a Major League Baseball (MLB) shortstop and first baseman for 19 seasons,  1953 through 1971. He spent his entire MLB career with the Chicago Cubs. He was a National League (NL) All-Star for 11 seasons, playing in 14 All-Star Games.Sportsdata.Midsummer Classics: Celebrating MLB's All-Star Game. "there were two games a year from 1959 to 1962"... "all players who were named to the AL or NL roster were credited with one appearance per season." Retrieved July 17, 2013.
Banks was born and raised in Dallas. He entered Negro league baseball in 1950, playing for the Kansas City Monarchs. He served in the military for two years and returned to the Monarchs before beginning his major league career in September 1953. He made his first MLB All-Star Game appearance in 1955. Banks had his best seasons in 1958 and 1959, when he received back-to-back National League Most Valuable Player awards.

During the 1961 season, Banks was transferred to left field followed by a final position change to first base. Cubs manager Leo Durocher became frustrated with Banks in the mid-1960s, saying that the slugger's performance was faltering, but he felt that he was unable to remove Banks from the lineup due to the star's popularity among Cubs fans. Banks was a player-coach from 1967 through 1971. In 1970, he hit his 500th career home run. In 1972, he joined the Cubs coaching staff after his retirement as a player.

He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977. In 1999, he was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2013, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contribution to sports. Banks lives in the Los Angeles area.

Xochicalco ([tpl]IPA-nah|ʃot͡ʃiˈkaɬko[/tpl]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Municipality of Miacatlán in the western part of the Mexican state of Morelos. The name Xochicalco may be translated from Nahuatl as "in the house of Flowers". The site is located 38 km southwest of Cuernavaca, about 76 miles by road from Mexico City. The site is open to visitors all week, from 10 am to 5 pm, although access to the observatory is only allowed after noon. The apogee of Xochicalco came after the fall of Teotihuacan and it has been speculated that Xochicalco may have played a part in the fall of the Teotihuacan empire.
The architecture and iconography of Xochicalco show affinities with Teotihuacan, the Maya area, and the Matlatzinca culture of the Toluca Valley. Today the residents of the nearby village of Cuentepec speak Nahuatl.
The main ceremonial center is atop an artificially leveled hill, with remains of residential structures, mostly unexcavated, on long terraces covering the slopes. The site was first occupied by 200 BC, but did not develop into an urban center until the Epiclassic period (AD 700 – 900). Nearly all the standing architecture at the site was built at this time. At its peak, the city may have had a population of up to 20,000 people.

The Treaty of Greenville was signed at Fort Greenville  — now Greenville, Ohio — on August 3, 1795 following the Indian loss at the Battle of Fallen Timbers the previous year.  The parties to the treaty were a coalition of Indian tribes, known as the Western Confederacy, and the local frontiermen of the United States. It ended the Northwest Indian War in the Ohio Country. 
The United States was represented by General "Mad Anthony" Wayne, who led the victory at Fallen Timbers.  In exchange for goods to the value of $20,000 (such as blankets, utensils, and domestic animals), the Indian tribes ceded to the United States large parts of modern-day Ohio, the future site of downtown Chicago,[tpl]#tag:ref|Six square miles centered at the mouth of the Chicago River.

Indian leaders who signed the treaty included leaders of these bands and tribes:
The treaty established what became known as the "Greenville Treaty Line," which was for several years a boundary between Indian territory and lands open to European-American settlers.  The latter frequently disregarded the treaty line as they continued to encroach on Indian lands guaranteed by the treaty.

[[London dispersion force]]
CATEGORIES: Intermolecular forces, Chemical bonding

London dispersion forces (LDF, also known as dispersion forces, London forces, instantaneous dipole–induced dipole forces, or loosely van der Waals forces) are a type of force acting between atoms and molecules.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWHUUBsNFbY |title=Chemguy Chemistry P5T8S9 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01[/tpl] They are part of the van der Waals forces. The LDF is named after the German-American physicist Fritz London.
The LDF is a weak intermolecular force arising from quantum-induced instantaneous polarization multipoles in molecules. They can therefore act between molecules without permanent multipole moments.
London forces are exhibited by nonpolar molecules because of the correlated movements of the electrons in interacting molecules. Because the electrons in adjacent molecules "flee" as they repel each other, electron density in a molecule becomes redistributed in proximity to another molecule (see quantum mechanical theory of dispersion forces). This is frequently described as the formation of instantaneous dipoles that attract each other. London forces are present between all chemical groups, and usually represent the main part of the total interaction force in condensed matter, even though they are generally weaker than ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds.
London forces become stronger as the atom in question becomes larger, and to a smaller degree for large molecules. This is due to the increased polarizability of molecules with larger, more dispersed electron clouds. This trend is exemplified by the halogens (from smallest to largest: F2, Cl2, Br2, I2). Fluorine and chlorine are gases at room temperature, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid. The London forces also become stronger with larger amounts of surface contact. Greater surface area means closer interaction between different molecules.

Brother Bear is a 2003 American animated adventure comedy-drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 44th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. In the film, an Inuit boy named Kenai pursues a bear in revenge for a battle that he provoked in which his oldest brother Sitka is killed.  He tracks down the bear and kills it, but the Spirits, angered by this needless death, change Kenai into a bear himself as punishment.[tpl]cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons  Third Edition|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=0-8160-6599-3[/tpl] In order to be human again, Kenai must learn to see through another's eyes, feel through another's heart, and discover the meaning of brotherhood. It was the third and final Disney animated feature produced primarily by the Feature Animation studio at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida; the studio was shut down in March 2004, not long after the release of this film in favor of computer animated features. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature, but lost to Pixar's Finding Nemo. A direct-to-video sequel, Brother Bear 2, was released on August 29, 2006.

The Takeda vanguard, which included Baba Nobuharu, was hard-pressed; Shingen himself led up the Takeda main body. The battle turned in favor of the Takeda when Yamagata Masakage launched a furious counterattack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Hôjô. The Hôjô were defeated and forced to retreat north, allowing the Takeda to return to Kai - though leaving behind some 900 dead.

It is notable as the first battle that involved the alliance between Nobunaga and Ieyasu, liberated the Oda clan from its unbalanced alliance with the Azai, and saw Nobunaga's prodigious use of firearms. Nobunaga's loyal retainer, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was assigned to lead troops into open battle for the first time.
The battle came as a reaction to Oda Nobunaga's sieges of the castles of Odani and Yokoyama, which belonged to the Azai and Asakura clans. It was also referred to as the Battle of Nomura (野村合戦 Nomura Kassen) by the Oda and Azai clans and the Battle of Mitamura (三田村合戦 Mitamura Kassen) by the Asakura clan.

Nobumoto sided with Oda Nobuhide in 1542, having switched his allegiance from the Imagawa family, but soon changing sides once more, to serve under the Matsudaira family. He was assigned Kariya Castle to defend. Oda Nobunaga blamed Nobumoto of selling rice to Akiyama Nobutomo (a rival Takeda officer), in 1576. Tokugawa Ieyasu thus sent Hiraiwa Chikayoshi to kill him. Nobumoto's brother, Mizuno Tadashige then went on to take Nobutomo's place.

The Mōri clan (毛利氏 Mōri-shi) was a family of daimyō, descended from Ōe no Hiromoto and established themselves in Aki Province. Their name was derived from a shōen in Mōri, Aikō District, Sagami Province. The generation of Hiromoto began to name themselves Mōri.
After the Jōkyū War, Mōri was appointed to the jitō office of a shoen in Aki Province. During the Kamakura period Mōri was one of prominent Gokenin family due to the fame of their ancestor Hiromoto. At the end of Kamakura Shogunate, Mōri was distant from the Shogunate and showed a favorable attitude to Ashikaga Takauji. 
In the Sengoku period, Mōri Motonari succeeded to expand their power to the whole Aki province and then other neighboring provinces. In his generation, Mōri became the daimyo from a local Gokenin.
During the war with the Oda clan and the Ikkō-ikki, the Mori helped the Ikkō-ikki clan by establishing a naval trade route between each other's provincial docks and harbours, the Oda eventually nullified this by laying siege to the trade ships between the two clans and went to further disrupt trade by attempting to destroy the Mōri fleet, failing on their first encounter in 1571, the second battle took place in 1579 with the Oda sending eight O' Ataka Bune (heavily armoured ships with iron-clad plating) warships to finally destroy the Mori naval threat.
After a struggle between Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who led his army as a general of Oda Nobunaga, the two sides made peace and Mori remained as a daimyo who kept five provinces in Chūgoku. In 1600 Mōri Terumoto led the West Army in the Battle of Sekigahara nominally. The West Army lost the battle and the Mōri clan lost three eastern provinces and moved their capital from Hiroshima to currentday Hagi, Yamaguchi. The newer fief, Mōri han consisted in two provinces: Nagato province and Suo province. Derived from the former, Mōri han was referred often Chōshū han.
After Meiji Restoration the system of han and daimyo was abolished, Mōri was titled as duke.

Prince Morikuni (守邦親王) (1301–1333; r. June 19, 1308–September 25, 1333) was the ninth shogun of the Kamakura shogunate of Japan.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Morikuni Shinnō" in [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia, p. 660|page=660[/tpl].

[tpl]nihongo|Prince Moriyoshi|護良親王|Moriyoshi Shinnō|also called Prince Morinaga[/tpl] (1308 – August 12, 1335) was a son of Emperor Go-Daigo and Minamoto no Chikako executed by Ashikaga Tadayoshi in 1335.
When Moriyoshi was 18, Go-Daigo had him named the head abbot of the Enryakuji temple on Mount Hiei.
When Go-Daigo's attempt to seize power in 1331 failed (the Genkō War), Moriyoshi fled Enryakuji to the province of Kii, meeting up with Kusunoki Masashige. They tenaciously defended the small fortress of Akasaka before finally being forced to withdraw.
He then moved to Mount Yoshino.
Masashige's heroics defending Chihaya, together with Moriyoshi's efforts to rally troops, brought a large number of warriors to the loyalist cause. By 1333, Ashikaga Takauji and Nitta Yoshisada had joined the cause. The Hōjō shogunate was soon destroyed.
Restored to the throne, Go-Daigo started the Kemmu Restoration. After refusing to appoint Ashikaga Takauji to the post of seii taishōgun, he made the double mistake of giving the title to his sons Prince Moriyoshi and Norinaga, two civilians, thus alienating Takauji and the warrior class, who felt he, as a military man and a descendant of the Minamoto, should have been shogun instead.
Takauji made false charges that Moriyoshi was planning to overthrow his father, and forced Go-Daigo to hand him over. Moriyoshi was then sent to Takauji's brother Tadayoshi in Kamakura and imprisoned in a cave near Kamakura for eight months. The cave is now within the premises of a Shinto shrine in Kamakura named Kamakura-gū. A rebellion headed by Hōjō Tokiyuki forced Tadayoshi to retreat from Kamakura. Being unable to take the prince along, Tadayoshi had him beheaded on July 23, 1335. Kamakura-gū, built around the cave where Prince Moriyoshi was imprisoned, was dedicated to him by Emperor Meiji in 1869.

[tpl]Unreferenced|date=March 2007[/tpl]Mōri Terumoto (毛利 輝元, February 4, 1553 – June 2, 1625), son of Mōri Takamoto and grandson and successor of the great warlord Mōri Motonari, fought against Toyotomi Hideyoshi but was eventually overcome, participated in the Kyūshū campaign (1587) on Hideyoshi's side and built Hiroshima Castle, thus essentially founding Hiroshima.
Terumoto was a member of the council of Five Elders appointed by Hideyoshi.  At the height of his power in late 16th century, Terumoto controlled 1.2 million koku.  This means he could mobilize more than 120,000 men to a battle.
He sided against Tokugawa Ieyasu but was not present at the Battle of Sekigahara.  Terumoto was in Osaka Castle defending Toyotomi Hideyori at the time and surrendered to Ieyasu soon after Sekigahara. Ieyasu reduced Terumoto's domains, leaving him only Nagato and Suō Provinces, worth 369,000 koku in total.
He is believed to have been a below-average general on and off the battlefield, having lacked motivation and will.  He made little impact in these final years of the Sengoku period, as he often had his subordinates and lesser members of the clan fight instead.  It is believed that if he had fought at Sekigahara or brought Hideyori to the battlefield, Ieyasu would have been defeated.  However, he managed his domain well and successfully held the Mōri clan together even when his domain was reduced to a third.
He was succeeded by Mori Hidenari.

[[Labna]]

CATEGORIES: Maya sites in Yucatán, Visitor attractions in Yucatán

Labna (or Labná in Spanish orthography)  is a Mesoamerican archaeological site and ceremonial center of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization, located in the Puuc Hills region of the Yucatán Peninsula. It is situated to the south of the large Maya site of Uxmal, in the southwest of the present-day state of Yucatán, Mexico. It was incorporated with Uxmal as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.
The site is a comparatively small and compact one. Among its notable structures is a large two-storey 'palace' ("El Palacio"), which is one of the longest contiguous structures in the Puuc region at approximately 120 m (393.7 ft) in length. From the palace, a ceremonial road (sacbe) extends to an elaborately decorated gateway arch ("El Arco"). This structure is 3 m (9.8 ft) wide and 6 m high, with well-reserved bas-reliefs. The arch is not an entrance to the city, but rather is a passageway between public areas.Labná :: The Mayan Kingdom  Next to this gateway stands "El Mirador", a pyramid-like structure surmounted by a temple. Also on the site is the Temple of the Columns.
The structural design and motifs of the site's buildings are in the Maya architecture regional style known as Puuc. This makes extensive use of well-cut stone forming patterns and depictions, including masks of the long-nosed rain-god Chaac.
The site was built in the Late and Terminal Classic era. A date corresponding to AD 862 is inscribed in the palace.
The first written report of Labna was by John Lloyd Stephens who visited it with artist Frederick Catherwood in 1842.
The site is open to visitors.
As the relations between India and Mexico are warming up, India has recently unveiled a replica of the Arch at Garden of Five Senses, New Delhi as a goodwill gesture .

Nagashima, in Owari Province along Japan's Pacific coast, was the location of a string of river island fortresses and defensive works controlled by the Ikkō-ikki, which surrounded their Ganshō-ji monastery and which included Nagashima Castle, which they had captured previously. Oda Nobunaga attacked three times over the course of four years, before finally destroying the entire Nagashima complex. These sieges were executed concurrently with Nobunaga's eleven-year siege against the Ikki's primary fortress of Ishiyama Hongan-ji.

Following the Muslim conquest of Hispania, Al-Andalus was divided into five administrative units, corresponding roughly to modern Andalusia, Galicia and Portugal, Castile and León, Aragon, county of Barcelona and Septimania.Joseph F. O'Callaghan, A History of Medieval Spain , Cornell University Press, 1983, p.142 As a political domain, it successively constituted a province of the Umayyad Caliphate, initiated by the Caliph Al-Walid I (711–750); the Emirate of Córdoba (c. 750–929); the Caliphate of Córdoba (929–1031); and the Caliphate of Córdoba's taifa (successor) kingdoms. Rule under these kingdoms saw a rise in cultural exchange and cooperation between Muslims and Christians, with Christians and Jews considered as protected people who paid a tax to the state but enjoyed "internal autonomy'.Lewis, Bernard. The Jews of Islam. PrincetMeyrick, Fredrick.  The Doctrine of the Church of England on the Holy Communion.on, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984.pg. 14. "Under the ruling Caliph (the descendant of Mohammed--the prophet of G-d on earth), the Jews were able to preserve their rites and traditions.  Peaceful coexistence led to their economic and social expansion.  Their status was that of Dhimmis, non-Muslims living in a land governed by Muslims.  The Jews had limited autonomy, but full rights to practice their religion, as well as full protection by their Muslim rulers; but this did not occur for free.  There was a specific tax called the jizya that Dhimmis had to pay to receive these benefits.  Having its origin in the Qur'an, it states Dhimmis who did not pay this tax, should either convert to Islam, or face the death penalty (Qur'an 9, 29).  This tax, higher than the tax Muslims had to pay, was in several occasions one of the most important sources of income for the kingdom.  The jizya was not only a tax, but also a symbolic expression of subordination (Lewis 14)."It is a common misapprehension that the holy war meant that the Muslims gave their opponents a choice 'between Islam and the sword'. This was sometimes the case, but only when the opponents were polytheist and idol-worshippers. For Jews, Christians, and other 'People of the Book'.there was a third possibility, they might become a 'protected group', paying a tax or tribute to the Muslims but enjoying internal autonomy" (Watt 144) It is noted that under the Caliphate of Córdoba, al-Andalus was a beacon of learning, and the city of Córdoba became one of the leading cultural and economic centres in both the Mediterranean Basin and the Islamic world.
For much of its history, Al-Andalus existed in conflict with Christian kingdoms to the north. After the fall of the Umayyad Andalusian kingdom, Al-Andalus was fragmented into a number of minor states and principalities, most notably the Emirate of Granada. Attacks from the Christian Castillians intensified, led by Alfonso VI. The Almoravid empire intervened and repelled the Christian attacks on the region, deposing the weak Andalusian Muslim princes and including Al-Andalus under direct Berber rule. In succeeding centuries, Al-Andalus became a province of the Berber Muslim empires of the Almoravids and Almohads, both based in Marrakesh.
Ultimately the Christian kingdoms of the north overpowered their Muslim neighbors. In 1085, Alfonso VI captured Toledo, starting a gradual Muslim decline. With the fall of Córdoba in 1236, the Emirate of Granada was the only Muslim territory in what is now Spain. The Portuguese Reconquista culminated in 1249 with the conquest of the Algarve by Afonso III. In 1238, the Emirate of Granada officially became a tributary state to the Kingdom of Castile, then ruled by King Ferdinand III. Finally, on January 2, 1492, Emir Muhammad XII surrendered the Emirate of Granada to Queen Isabella I of Castile, who along with her husband King Ferdinand II of Aragon were known as the "Catholic Monarchs." The surrender ended Al-Andalus as a political entity, though aspects of Islamic culture are still evident in the region.

Forces under Takeda Katsuyori (武田勝頼) had besieged the castle since the 17 June; Okudaira Sadamasa (奥平貞昌), a Tokugawa vassal, commanded the defending force. The Takeda forces attacked the castle because it threatened Takeda's supply lines.
Both Tokugawa Ieyasu (徳川家康) and Oda Nobunaga (織田信長) sent troops to break the siege and their combined forces defeated Takeda Katsuyori (武田勝頼). Nobunaga's skillful use of firearms to defeat Takeda's cavalry tactics is often cited as a turning point in Japanese warfare; many cite it as the first 'modern' Japanese battle. In fact, the cavalry charge had been introduced only a generation earlier by Katsuyori's father, Takeda Shingen (武田信玄). Furthermore, firearms had already been used in other battles. Oda Nobunaga's innovation was the wooden stockades and rotating volleys of fire which led to a decisive victory at Nagashino.

[[Distinguished Service Order]]

The Distinguished Service Order (DSO) is a military decoration of the United Kingdom, and formerly of other parts of the Commonwealth of Nations and British Empire, awarded for meritorious or distinguished service by officers of the armed forces during wartime, typically in actual combat.
Instituted on 6 September 1886 by Queen Victoria in a Royal Warrant published in the London Gazette on 9 November,[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=25641|startpage=5385|endpage=5386| date=9 November 1886|accessdate=28 March 2008[/tpl] the first DSOs awarded were dated 25 November 1886.[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=25650|startpage=5975|endpage=5976|date=9 November 1886|accessdate= 28 March 2008[/tpl] It is typically awarded to officers ranked Major (or its equivalent) or higher, but the honour has sometimes been awarded to especially valorous junior officers. 8,981 DSOs were awarded during the First World War, each award being announced in the London Gazette.
The order was established for rewarding individual instances of meritorious or distinguished service in war. It was a military order, until recently for officers only, and normally given for service under fire or under conditions equivalent to service in actual combat with the enemy, although it was awarded between 1914 and 1916 under circumstances which could not be regarded as under fire (often to staff officers, which caused resentment among front-line officers). After 1 January 1917, commanders in the field were instructed to recommend this award only for those serving under fire. Prior to 1943, the order could be given only to someone Mentioned in Despatches. The order is generally given to officers in command, above the rank of Captain. A number of more junior officers were awarded the DSO, and this was often regarded as an acknowledgement that the officer had only just missed out on the award of the Victoria Cross.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=17 February 2010|title=Orders and Decorations – Distinguished Service Order|publisher=Veterans Affairs Canada|url=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group01/dso[/tpl]
In 1942, the award of the DSO was extended to officers of the Merchant Navy who had performed acts of gallantry while under enemy attack.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=17 February 2010|publisher= New Zealand defence force|title=British Commonwealth Gallantry, Meritorious and Distinguished Service Awards – Companion of the Distinguished Service Order|url=http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/category/i/i3.html[/tpl]
Since 1993, its award has been restricted solely for distinguished service (i.e. leadership and command by any rank), with the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross being introduced as the second highest award for gallantry. It has, however, despite some very fierce campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained an officers only award and it has yet to be awarded to a non-commissioned rank.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=17 February 2010|title=Distinguished Service Order| publisher=Ministry of Defence|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceFor/Veterans/Medals/DistinguishedServiceOrder.htm[/tpl]
Recipients of the order are officially known as Companions of the Distinguished Service Order. They are entitled to use the post-nominal letters "DSO". One or more gold medal bars ornamented by the Crown may be issued to DSO holders performing further acts of such leadership which would have merited award of the DSO. The bars are worn as clasps on the medal ribbon of the original award.

All Betacam variants from (plain) analog recording Betacam to Betacam SP and digital recording Digital Betacam (and additionally, HDCAM & HDCAM SR), use the same shape videocassettes, meaning vaults and other storage facilities do not have to be changed, when upgrading to a new format. The cassettes are available in two sizes: S and L. The Betacam camcorder can only load S magnetic tapes, while television studio sized video tape recorders (VTR) designed for video editing can play both S and L tapes. The cassette shell and case for each Betacam cassette is colored differently depending on the format, allowing for easy visual identification. There is also a mechanical key, that allows a video tape recorder to identify which format has been inserted. The small cassettes use the same form factor as Betamax.
The format supplanted the three-quarter inch U-Matic format, which Sony had introduced in 1971. In addition to improvements in video quality, the Betacam configuration of an integrated professional video camera/recorder led to its rapid adoption by electronic news gathering (ENG) organizations.
DigiBeta, the common name for Digital Betacam, went on to become the single most successful professional broadcast digital recording video tape format in history.
Even though Betacam remains popular in the field and for archiving, new digital products such as the Multi Access Video Disk Recorder are leading to a phasing out of Betacam products in a television studio environment.

Miguel Barbachano y Tarrazo (29 September 1807 – 17 December 1859) (Baqueiro 1896) was a liberal Yucatecan politician, who was 5 times governor of Yucatán between 1841 and 1853.
Miguel Barbachano y Tarrazo was born in the city of Campeche, a son of Manuel Barbachano and his wife, the former Maria Josefa Tarrazo.
He was one of the staunchest advocates for the independence of Yucatán from Mexico, but historical circumstances led to Yucatán twice declaring its independence while Barbachano was out of power, and twice Barbachano arranged for Yucatán's reunification with Mexico.
He generally alternated in power with the centrist Santiago Méndez, who was more in favor of union with Mexico but was driven to declare independence by the excesses of Mexican dictator Antonio López de Santa Anna.
The final reunification was due to the crisis of the Caste War of Yucatán.

The Northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) is one of two species of the genus Glaucomys, the only flying squirrels found in North America (the other is the somewhat smaller Southern flying squirrel, G. volans). Unlike most members of their family, flying squirrels are strictly nocturnal. 
The Northern flying squirrel is found in coniferous and mixed forests across the top of North America, from Alaska to Nova Scotia, south to the mountains of North Carolina and west to California. Populations from the Pacific Coast of the United States are genetically distinct from those of G. sabrinus found elsewhere in North America, although they are considered to belong to the same species.
Two subspecies are found in the southern Appalachians, the Carolina Northern flying squirrel, G. s. coloratus, and the Virginia Northern flying squirrel G. s. fuscus, both of which are endangered, although the Virginia subspecies has recovered enough that it was delisted in August 2008.USFWS Delisting Report dated 8/09
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service put the flying squirrel back under protection on June 6, 2011.

The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle is an order of chivalry associated with Scotland.  The current version of the Order was founded in 1687 by King James VII of Scotland (also known as James II of England and Ireland) who asserted that he was reviving an earlier Order. The Order consists of the Sovereign and sixteen Knights and Ladies, as well as certain "extra" knights (members of the British Royal Family and foreign monarchs). The Sovereign alone grants membership of the Order; he or she is not advised by the Government, as occurs with most other Orders.
The Order's primary emblem is the thistle, the national flower of Scotland. The motto is Nemo me impune lacessit (Latin for "No one provokes me with impunity").1687 Statutes, quoted in Statutes (1987), p6 The same motto appears on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom for use in Scotland and some pound coins, and is also the motto of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, Scots Guards, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. The patron saint of the Order is St Andrew.
Most British orders of chivalry cover the whole United Kingdom, but the three most exalted ones each pertain to one constituent country only. The Order of the Thistle, which pertains to Scotland, is the second-most senior in precedence. Its equivalent in England, The Most Noble Order of the Garter, is the oldest documented order of chivalry in the United Kingdom, dating to the middle fourteenth century. In 1783 an Irish equivalent, The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick, was founded, but has now fallen dormant.

The movement is often described as related to, including, or synonymous with Wahhabism, but Salafists consider the term "Wahhabi" derogatory.For example, the Ahl-i Hadith which "have been active since the nineteenth century on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ... though designated as Wahhabis by their adversaries, ... prefer to call themselves 'Salafis.'" (from The Failure of Political Islam, by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk, Harvard University Press, 1994, pp. 118–9) At other times, Salafism has been deemed a hybrid of Wahhabism and other post-1960s movements.Stephane Lacroix, Al-Albani's Revolutionary Approach to Hadith.

Senior Minister (abbreviation: SM) is a political office in the Cabinet of Singapore. It is taken by a retired Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister. This, however, implies a reliance on a dominant-party system, and several opposition critics find this as evidence for contempt for the political opposition in Singapore.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Currently, this political post has been renamed as Emeritus Senior Minister (since May 2011), which is a new political post being taken by Singapore's second Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
The position of Senior Minister has only been held by four persons -- Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, who were the first and second Prime Ministers of Singapore respectively; and S. Rajaratnam and S. Jayakumar, who served as Deputy Prime Ministers. Lee Kuan Yew was Senior Minister from 1990 to 2004, after which he became Minister Mentor in the Cabinet of Singapore's third Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Goh Chok Tong replaced Lee Kuan Yew as Senior Minister in Lee Hsien Loong's Cabinet. On 26 March 2009, Lee Hsien Loong announced that S. Jayakumar would relinquish his post as Deputy Prime Minister and be appointed Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office.
S. Rajaratnam retired from political office in 1988 and died in 2006. S. Jayakumar retired from politics prior to the 2011 General Elections. Seven days after the elections, on 14 May 2011, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew announced their retirement from the Cabinet.[ref]

[[Education in Scotland]]
CATEGORIES: Education in Scotland, Secondary education by country, Public bodies of the Scottish Government, Scottish Government Learning and Justice Directorate

Scotland has a long history of universal provision of public education, and the Scottish education system is distinctly different from those in the other countries of the United Kingdom. The Scotland Act 1998 gives the Scottish Parliament legislative control over all education matters, and the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is the principal legislation governing education in Scotland.
Traditionally, the Scottish system at secondary school level has emphasised breadth across a range of subjects, while the English, Welsh and Northern Irish systems have emphasised greater depth of education over a smaller range of subjects.
Following this, Scottish universities generally have courses a year longer (typically 4 years) than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, though it is often possible for students to take more advanced specialised exams and join the courses at the second year. One unique aspect is that the ancient universities of Scotland issue a Master of Arts as the first degree in humanities.
State schools are owned and operated by the local authorities which act as Education Authorities, and the compulsory phase is divided into primary school and secondary school (often called high school).  Schools are supported in delivering learning and teaching by Education Scotland (formerly Learning and Teaching Scotland).
There are also private schools across the country, although the distribution is uneven with such schools in 22 of the 32 Local Authority areas. At September 2011 the total pupil population in Scotland was 702,104, of which 31,425 pupils, or 4.5%, were being educated in independent schools.Scottish Independent Schools 'Pupil Number Comparisons by Local Authority Area 2011/12' http://www.scis.org.uk/assets/files/2011%20Local%20Authority%20comparisons%20by%20region.pdf accessed 21 Feb 2012
Qualifications at the secondary school and post-secondary (further education) level are provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which is the national awarding and accrediting body in Scotland, and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres.  Political responsibility for education at all levels is vested in the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Education and Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Departments.
Inspections and audits of educational standards are conducted by three bodies: Care Inspectorate inspects care standards in pre-school provision; Education Scotland (formerly Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education) for pre-school, primary, education, further and community  education; with the Scottish office of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA Scotland) responsible for higher education.

[[Education in Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Education in Wales, Secondary education by country

Education in Wales differs in certain respects from education elsewhere in the United Kingdom. For example, a significant minority of students all over Wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of Welsh: in 2008/09, 22 per cent of classes in maintained primary schools used Welsh as the sole or main medium of instruction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/topics/statistics/headlines/schools2009/hdw200910293/?lang=en|title=Schools in Wales: General Statistics 2009|date=October 2009|publisher=Welsh Assembly Government|accessdate=13 February 2010[/tpl] Welsh medium education is available to all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges and universities and in adult education; lessons in the language itself are compulsory for all pupils until the age of 16.
Since devolution, education policy in the four constituent countries of the UK has diverged: for example, England has pursued reforms based on diversity of school types and parental choice; Wales (and Scotland) remain more committed to the concept of the community-based comprehensive school. Systems of governance and regulation - the arrangements for planning, funding, quality-assuring and regulating learning, and for its local administration - are becoming increasingly differentiated across the four home countries.Raffe, D. and Byrne, D. (2005) Policy Learning From ‘Home International’ Comparisons. Centre for Educational Sociology briefing. Education researcher David Reynolds claims that policy in Wales is driven by a "producerist" paradigm emphasising collaboration between educational partners. He also alludes to lower funding in Welsh schools compared to England, echoing similar concerns at university level. He concludes that performance data do not suggest that Wales has improved more rapidly than England, although there are considerable difficulties in making these kinds of assessments.Reynolds, D.

[[Texas annexation]]

The Texas annexation was the 1845 incorporation into the United States of America of the Republic of Texas, which was admitted to the Union as the 28th state.
After declaring their independence from the Republic of Mexico in 1836, the vast majority of Texas citizens favored the annexation of the Lone Star Republic by the United States.Malone, 1960, p. 545: "... Texas was now actually free after ... the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2, 1836 ... and its people avidly desired annexation by the United States." But, the leaders of both major American political parties (the Democrats and the Whigs) strenuously objected to introducing Texas, a vast slave-holding region, into the volatile political climate of the pro- and anti-slavery sectional controversies in Congress.Wilentz, 2008, p. 558: "... the heightening of sectional tensions in Congress made it imperative that Whigs find some compromise ground in the 1844 election ... the same intersectional logic held true for the Democrats ..." and p. 560: 'Texas annexation had long been a taboo subject for Whigs and Democrats alike." Moreover, they wished to avoid a war with Mexico, whose government refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of its rebellious northern province.Freehling, 1991, p. 355: "Immediately before annexation, both major parties remained frozen in their decade-long position that Texas was not worth a foreign war or sectional combat." With Texas's economic fortunes declining by the early 1840s, the President of the Texas Republic, Sam Houston, arranged talks with Mexico to explore the possibility of securing official recognition of independence, with Great Britain mediating.Freehling, 1991, p. 369: "Sam Houston ... the Texas president apparently swerved from seeking an apparently unattainable annexation the US" and "would negotiate independence from Mexico. England, Houston hoped, might aid in the negotiations."Wilentz, 2009, p. 566: "President Sam Houston truly was interested in the British option negotiate a peace with Mexico and was pursuing it vigorously and openly."
In 1843, President of the United States John Tyler, unaligned with any political party, decided, as chief executive, to independently pursue the annexation of Texas in a bid to gain a base of popular support for another four years in office.Varon, 2008, p. 166: "President Tyler cherished annexation as a measure that could redeem his administration and enable him to build a loyal political constituency in the South." His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government to promote a general emancipation of slaves in Texas that would weaken the institution of human bondage in the United States.Freehling, 1991, p. 398: "Tyler and of State Upshur opted for annexation only after a public parliamentary exchange confirmed ... that England had 'earnestly' pressed Mexico to pressure Texas towards abolition slavery."Merk, 1978, p. 308: "The course of Texas history was changed by new forces: the emergence in the South of the doctrine that slavery was a beneficent form of labor – that it was necessary to the southern economy, to southern democracy, and to well-being of the slaves – a way of life threatened by international abolitionism." Initiating and impelling secret annexation negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844.
Pro-Texas annexationist southern Democratic delegates denied their anti-annexationist leader Martin Van Buren the nomination at their party's convention in May 1844. In alliance with pro-expansionist northern Democratic colleagues, they secured the unanimous nomination of James K. Polk, who ran on a pro-Texas Manifest Destiny platform.Merk, 1978, p. 308: In the early 1840s "there developed in the Northwest and in eastern urban centers the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which could be brought to the support of slavery expansion."
In June 1844, the Senate, with its Whig majority, soundly rejected the Tyler-Texas treaty. The pro-annexationist Democrat Polk would defeat the anti-annexationist Whig Henry Clay for the presidency by a small margin in November of 1844. In December 1844, the lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house.Wilentz, 2008, p. 575: "Tyler and Calhoun, determined to win of Texas before leaving office, arrived at the ... constitutionally dubious strategy of immediately annexing Texas by joint congressional resolution, which would require a mere simple majority in both houses of Congress." The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery provisions of the Tyler treaty. The Senate's minority Democrats narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill, with critical support from several southern Whigs, designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the option to effect immediate annexation of Texas or open new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House amended bill.
On March 3, 1845, shortly after signing the legislation, President Tyler preempted Polk and forwarded the House legislative alternative to Texas, offering immediate annexation to the republic. When Polk entered the White House the next day, he proceeded to encourage Texas to accept the Tyler offer. The Lone Star Republic ratified the treaty with popular approval from Texans. The bill was signed by United States President Polk on December 29, 1845, accepting Texas as the 28th state of the Union. Texas formally relinquished its sovereignty to the United States on February 14, 1846.Merk, 1978, p.308: "In Texas, on February 14, 1846, President Anson Jones presided over the ceremony of the transfer of his state's sovereignty to the United States."

CATEGORIES: Visual journalism, Photography by genre, Photojournalism, Stock photography, Journalism genres, Journalism occupations, Documentaries

Photojournalism is a particular form of journalism (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that creates images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, street photography or celebrity photography) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work is both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media.
Like a writer, a photojournalist is a reporter but he or she must often make decisions instantly and carry photographic equipment, often while exposed to significant obstacles (e.g., physical danger, weather, crowds).

[[Masurian dialect]]

CATEGORIES: Culture of Prussia, Languages of Germany, Lechitic languages, Languages of Poland, Polish dialects, Extinct languages of Europe

Masurian ([tpl]lang-pl|Mazurski[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-de|Masurisch[/tpl]) was a dialect group of the Polish language, spoken by Masurians in a part of East Prussia that belongs to today's Poland. Masurians are regarded as being descendants of Masovians.
Since the 14th century, some settlers from Masovia started to settle in southern Prussia, which had been devastated by the crusades of the Teutonic Knights against the native Old Prussians. According to other sources, people from Masovia did not move to southern Prussia until the time of the Protestant Reformation, Prussia having become Lutheran in 1525. The Masurians were mostly of the Protestant faith, in contrast to the neighboring Roman Catholic people of the Duchy of Masovia, which was incorporated into the Polish kingdom in 1526. A new dialect developed in Prussia, isolated from the remaining Polish language area. The Masurian dialect group has many Low Saxon, German and Old Prussian words mixed in with Polish-language endings.[tpl]cite book|last=Braun|first=Hermann|authorlink=Herrmann Broun|title=Alte und neue Bilder aus Masuren: Eine Geschichte der Stadt und des Kreises Angerburg|year=1888/1925[/tpl]
Beginning in the 1870s, Imperial German officials restricted the usage of languages other than German in Prussia's eastern provinces.[tpl]cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600–1947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|pages=776|isbn=0-674-02385-4[/tpl]
While in 1880 Masurians were still treated as Poles by German Empire, at the turn of century the German authorities undertook several measures to Germanise and separate them from the Polish nation by creating a separate identity.Becoming German: Lessons from the Past for the Present'' Brian McCook in Leitkultur and Nationalstolz-Tabu -German Phenomena? Bonn, April 2002 Alexander von Humboldt Foundation pages 33-42 After World War I the East Prussian plebiscite was held on July 11, 1920 according to the Treaty of Versailles, in which the Masurians had to decide whether they wanted to be part of the Second Polish Republic or remain in German East Prussia; about 98% voted for Germany.
By the early 20th century, most Masurians were at least bilingual and could speak Low Saxon and German; in some areas about half of them still spoke Masurian, at least at home. In 1925, only 40,869 people gave Masurian as their native tongue, many considering German their first language, considering Masurian merely as their domestic dialect. In the early 1930s, support for the Nazi Party was high in Masuria, especially in elections in 1932 and 1933. Nazi political rallies were organized in the Masurian dialect during the campaigning.
The replacement of Masurian in favor of German was not completed by the time the Soviet Red Army conquered Masurian East Prussia in January 1945, in World War II. The territory was transferred to Poland according to the postwar Potsdam Conference. During the wartime fighting and post-war deportations in the subsequent decades, most Masurian-speakers left Masuria for western Germany, especially to post-war West Germany, where they were quickly assimilated into the German mainstream. As a result the Masurian dialect virtually died out.

[[King Eider]]

CATEGORIES: Ducks, Birds of Canada, Somateria, Merginae

The King Eider (pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|'|ai|.|d|@r[/tpl]) (Somateria spectabilis) is a large sea duck that breeds along Northern Hemisphere Arctic coasts of northeast Europe, North America and Asia. The birds spend most of the year in coastal marine ecosystems at high latitudes, and migrate to Arctic tundra to breed in June and July. They lay four to seven eggs in a scrape on the ground lined with grass and down.
The King Eider winters in arctic and subarctic marine areas, most notably in the Bering Sea, the west coast of Greenland, eastern Canada and northern Norway. It also occurs annually off the northeastern United States, Scotland and Kamchatka. Breeding areas include the Arctic coastal tundra of the north coast of Alaska. This species dives for benthic invertebrates, such as crustaceans, polychaete worms, and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. Wintering birds can form large flocks on suitable coastal waters, with some flocks exceeding 100,000 birds.
This species is smaller than the Common Eider. The male is unmistakable with its black body, white breast and multicoloured head. The drake's call is a deep cooing, and hens give various croaks and quacks.
The female (occasionally colloquially referred to as a "Queen Eider"See e.g) is a brown bird, but can still be readily distinguished from all ducks except other eider species on size and structure. The head is shorter than in the Common Eider, and the feathering extension onto the bill is rounded, not triangular in shape.
An immature drake is typically all dark with a white breast and a yellow bill patch. Eclipse adult drakes are similar but lack the white breast.
The King Eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

[[Egg white]]

CATEGORIES: Eggs, Biological matter

Egg white is the common name for the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. In chickens it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen's oviduct during the passage of the egg.Ornithology, Volume 1994 By Frank B. Gill p. 361 It forms around either fertilized or unfertilized egg yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for the growth of the embryo (when fertilized). 
Egg white consists primarily of about 90% water into which is dissolved 10% proteins (including albumins, mucoproteins, and globulins). Unlike the yolk, which is high in lipids (fats), egg white contains almost no fat, and carbohydrate content is less than 1%. Egg whites contain just over 50% of the protein in the egg. Egg white has many uses in food (e.g. mousse) and also many other uses (e.g. in the preparation of vaccines such as those for influenza).

[[Aviator call sign]]

CATEGORIES: Call signs, Military communications, Nicknames

An aviator call sign or callsign is a nickname given to a military pilot, flight officer, and even some enlisted aviators.  This call sign is a substitute for the aviator's given name, and is used on flight suit and flight jacket name tags, painted/displayed beneath the officer's or enlisted aircrewman's name on aircraft fuselages or canopy rails, and in radio conversations.  They are most commonly used in tactical jet aircraft communities (i.e., fighter and attack) than in other aircraft communities (i.e., airlift, mobility, maritime patrol), but their use is not totally exclusive to the former. Many NASA Astronauts with military aviator backgrounds are referred to during spaceflights by their call signs rather than their first names.
The origins of aviator call signs are varied. Most call signs play on or reference on the aviator's surname. Other inspirations for call signs may include personality traits, middle name, references to historical figures, or past exploits during the pilot's career. Aviator call signs nearly always must come from a member or members of the aviator's squadron, training class, or other cohort.  
It is considered bad form to try to give oneself a callsign and it is also common for aviators to be given a fairly derogatory callsign, and the more they complain about it, the more likely it is to stick.  Some stick with the aviator forever, while in other cases an aviator might have a series of call signs throughout his or her career. For example, the late Lieutenant Kara Hultgreen, USN, was originally given the callsign 'Hulk,' because of her habitual weight training; later, after a television appearance in which she wore detectable makeup, she received the callsign "Revlon" (her biography is entitled Call Sign Revlon).

Catalogue for exhibition at Victoria and Albert Museum for Berlioz centenary. Art Council, London, 1969, p46, exhibit 131 (orchestral manuscript score). Berlioz wrote the French libretto himself, based closely on Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing.
Berlioz had been interested in setting Shakespeare's comedy since his return from Italy in 1833, but only composed the score of Béatrice et Bénédict following the completion of Les Troyens in 1858.
It was first performed at the Theater der Stadt, Baden-Baden on 9 August 1862.Holoman DK. Béatrice et Bénédict. In: The New Grove Dictonary of Opera. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. Berlioz conducted the first two performances of a German version in Weimar in 1863, where, as he wrote in his memoirs, he was "overwhelmed by all sorts of kind attention."
It is the first notable version of Shakespeare's play in operatic form, and was followed by works by among others Árpád Doppler, Paul Puget and Reynaldo Hahn.Wilson CR. Shakespeare. In: The New Grove Dictonary of Opera. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.
Berlioz biographer David Cairns has written "Listening to the score's exuberant gaiety, only momentarily touched by sadness, one would never guess that its composer was in pain when he wrote it and impatient for death".Cairns, D.

[[Outline of discrete mathematics]]
CATEGORIES: Outlines, Discrete mathematics, Mathematics-related lists

The following outline is presented as an overview of and topical guide to discrete mathematics:
Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.  In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers,  graphs, and statements in logicRichard Johnsonbaugh, Discrete Mathematics, Prentice Hall, 2008. – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.[tpl]MathWorld |title=Discrete mathematics |urlname=DiscreteMathematics[/tpl] Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus and analysis.
Included below are many of the standard terms used routinely in university-level courses and in research papers. This is not, however, intended as a complete list of mathematical terms; just a selection of typical terms of art that may be encountered.

CATEGORIES: 1893 operas, Operas by Engelbert Humperdinck, German-language operas, Children's operas, Operas, Works based on Hansel and Gretel

Hansel and Gretel (German: [tpl]Lang|de|Hänsel und Gretel[/tpl]) is an opera by nineteenth-century composer Engelbert Humperdinck, who described it as a [tpl]Lang|de|Märchenoper[/tpl] (fairy tale opera). The libretto was written by Humperdinck's sister, Adelheid Wette, based on the Grimm brothers' fairy tale "Hansel and Gretel". It is much admired for its folk music-inspired themes, one of the most famous being the "[tpl]Lang|de|Abendsegen[/tpl]" ("Evening Benediction") from act 2.
The idea for the opera was proposed to Humperdinck by his sister, who approached him about writing music for songs that she had written for her children for Christmas based on "Hansel and Gretel". After several revisions, the musical sketches and the songs were turned into a full-scale opera.
Humperdinck composed Hansel and Gretel in Frankfurt in 1891 and 1892.Plaque: Scheffelstraße 1, Frankfurt am Main: "In this house in the years 1891 and 1892 Engelbert Humperdinck composed the opera Hänsel und Gretel" The opera was first performed in Hoftheater in Weimar on 23 December 1893, conducted by Richard Strauss. It has been associated with Christmas since its earliest performances and today it is still most often performed at Christmas time.

Daniel Ceccaldi (25 July 1927 – 27 March 2003) was a French actor.
He was born in Meaux, Seine-et-Marne, France. The mild-mannered Daniel Ceccaldi is famous as Claude Jade's father Lucien Darbon in François Truffaut's movies Stolen Kisses and Bed and Board. Note: Christine refers to him twice as "Lucien", not papa, indicating perhaps that he is not her biological father, echoing Truffaut's own experience. The American critic Bob Wade wrote about Ceccaldi in 'Stolen Kisses': "Claude Jade's parents are memorably played by Daniel Ceccaldi and Claire Duhamel. Ceccaldi’s role may represent the most pleasant and neurosis-free father in any movie of the era. He overflows with Dickensian warmth and geniality."

Uschi Glas (born Helga Ursula Glas; 2 March 1944) is a German film and television actress.
Born in Landau an der Isar, Bavaria, Glas started appearing in films in 1965. Her breakthrough role was that of Barbara in the unconventional 1968 movie Zur Sache, Schätzchen (Go for It, Baby), which captured the spirit of the times in that it presented youthful protest against the German establishment and hinted at the loosening of morals in the wake of the sexual revolution. From then on, the tabloid press would refer to Glas frequently as "Schätzchen".
In the late 60s and early 70s, Glas appeared in many slapstick movies, notably in three films of the seven-part series (1967–72) Die Lümmel von der ersten Bank (The Brats on the Front Bench Row).
In the 1980s and 1990s Glas concentrated on her television work, appearing in a succession of TV series tailored to her person, playing, among other characters, a veterinarian in Tierärztin Christine (1993), an energetic businesswoman in Anna Maria – Eine Frau geht ihren Weg (Anna Maria – A Woman Does it Her Way, 1995–1996), and the ideal teacher in Sylvia – Eine Klasse für sich (Sylvia – A Class of her Own, 1998–2000). She also appeared in many feature-length made-for-TV movies. In total, Glas appeared in more than 75 film and TV productions.
Glas was married to the actor [tpl]ill|de|Bernd Tewaag[/tpl] from 1981 until their divorce in 2003; they had three children. In 2005 Glas married the consultant Dieter Herrmann.
In 2004, Glas published a memoir, Mit einem Lächeln (With a Smile).

[[The Killjoys (Australian band)]]
CATEGORIES: ARIA Award winners, Victoria (Australia) musical groups

The Killjoys was a band formed in Melbourne, Australia, in the late 1980s. The core of the band was Anna Burley (vocals) and Craig Pilkington (guitar and vocals). The Killjoys attracted a wide following in the vibrant Melbourne pub scene at the time.
The Killjoys were one of a number of promising Melbourne bands that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s that also included, amongst others, Sea Stories, The Fauves, The Hollowmen, The Glory Box, Ripe, Autohaze and Pray TV.
Their music incorporated string sections and vibraphone. They were formed out of the demise of another band, Wild Science. Wild Science essentially split into two different outfits, the Killjoys and Violet Town. Violet Town's members were Wayne (Buz) Hissock on guitar and vocals, Warren Pitts on keyboards and vocals, Peter Van on drums, and Luke Blackburn on bass and vocals.
Violet Town had a very eclectic sound, inspired by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and the Wreckery. Violet Town were featured on compilation albums on Chase Records, Melbourne Stuff and later featured on compilation records by ID Records Australia. Supporting INXS on their Kick tour, after winning triple J's best unsigned band.
Peter Van went on to create Grand Jury, a band with a sound like Hoo Doo Gurus combined with Whitlams, intelligent and quirky lyrics, supported by a range of session musicians and strong vocalists. They independently released a 1st album, with a cult following, and then disbanded.
The Killjoys up until 2001 were still a performing entity with the two core members Anna Burley and Craig Pilkington.
The Killjoys' first full-length album, Ruby, won the ARIA Award in 1991 for Best Independent Release. Sun Bright Deep was later nominated for the same award in 1998.
In 2006 the band released the album Stealing Horses, the group's fifth full-length album and first in seven years.
The band released another album entitled Pearl in 2011, five years after their previous release. It is considered somewhat of a sequel to the band's iconic Ruby album, which was remastered and re-released alongside Pearl.

[[Equal opportunity]]

CATEGORIES: Discrimination, Disability rights, Anti-racism, Equality rights, Egalitarianism, Liberalism, Social inequality

Equal opportunity is a stipulation that all people should be treated similarly, unhampered by artificial barriers or prejudices or preferences, except when particular distinctions can be explicitly justified. The aim according to this often complex and contested concept is that important jobs should go to those “most qualified” – persons most likely to perform ably in a given task – and not go to persons for arbitrary or irrelevant reasons, such as circumstances of birth, upbringing, friendship ties to whoever is in power, religion, sex, ethnicity, race, caste, or involuntary personal attributes such as disability, age, gender, or sexual orientation. Chances for advancement should be open to everybody interested such that they have “an equal chance to compete within the framework of goals and the structure of rules established.” The idea is to remove arbitrariness from the selection process and base it on some “pre-agreed basis of fairness, with the assessment process being related to the type of position,” and emphasizing procedural and legal means. Individuals should succeed or fail based on their own efforts and not extraneous circumstances such as having well-connected parents. It is opposed to nepotism and plays a role in whether a social structure is seen as legitimate.

The Stridsvagn 103 (Strv 103), "Strv" is the Swedish military abbreviation of Stridsvagn which means tank in Swedish. also known as the S-Tank,from the procurement name, see history section. was a Swedish post-war main battle tank.[tpl]cite book |last=chant, c & Jones, R |title=Tanks: Over 250 of the World's Tanks and Armoured Fighting Vehicles |year=2004 |publisher=Summertime Publishing Ltd |isbn=0-7603-1871-9 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8CwgxzMqrv0C&pg=PA156&dq=&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=9 February 2011|page=156[/tpl] It was known for its unconventional turretless design, with a fixed gun traversed by engaging the tracks and elevated by adjusting the hull suspension. Turretless armoured fighting vehicles are usually classified as assault guns or tank destroyers, but the Strv 103 is considered a tank because of its gun laying ability and designated combat role match those of other tanks. It is the only main battle tank and the only tank of any kind since the World War I era to dispense with a turret.
The Strv 103 was designed and manufactured in Sweden. It was developed in the 1950s and was the first main battle tank to use a turbine engine. The result was a very low-profile design with an emphasis on defence and heightened crew protection level. Strv 103s formed a major portion of the Swedish armoured forces from the 1960s to part of the 1990s, but have since been removed from service in favour of the Stridsvagn 122.

[[Epoxide]]
CATEGORIES: Functional groups, Epoxides

An epoxide is a cyclic ether with three ring atoms.  This ring approximately defines an equilateral triangle, which makes it highly strained.  The strained ring makes epoxides more reactive than other ethers. Simple epoxides are named from the parent compound ethylene oxide or oxirane, such as in chloromethyloxirane. As a functional group, epoxides feature the epoxy prefix, such as in the compound 1,2-epoxycycloheptane, which can also be called cycloheptene epoxide, or simply cycloheptene oxide.
A polymer formed by reacting epoxide units is called a polyepoxide or an epoxy. Epoxy resins are used as adhesives and structural materials. Polymerization of an epoxide gives a polyether, for example ethylene oxide polymerizes to give polyethylene glycol, also known as polyethylene oxide.

[[The Crystal Set]]

CATEGORIES: Australian indie rock groups

The Crystal Set was a Sydney-based Australian indie rock band formed in the early 1980s featuring Russell Kilbey (bass and lead vocals), Phillip Maher (guitar & vocals), Davey Ray Moor (keyboards & vocals) and Tim Seckhold (drums). 
The Crystal Set released its first single, "A Drop In The Ocean", independently. It was signed to Red Eye Records owned by John Foy and the first single was re-issued through Red Eye. Their next two singles, "Wholly Holy" and "Benefit Of The Doubt", were moderate indie hits via rotational airplay on then Sydney-based government-supported FM radio station JJJ.
With the departure of Moor, Craig Hooper (formerly of The Reels) joined Kilbey, Maher, and Seckhold and the collective released "Cluster". One side of the Red Eye released EP featured songs recorded with Moor while the other side featured compositions with Hooper. Upon Hooper's departure, Russell Kilbey assumed guitar duties and vocals and Luke Blackburn, a Melbourne musician, joined as bassist and vocalist.
When Red Eye Records signed a distribution deal with Polydor Australia in 1990, The Crystal Set's second album, Almost Pure, signalled the band's migration from an independent act to one associated with a major label. As a result, the release found moderate national success in 1991 with the singles, "Thrive" and "She Spits Out Stars". Their Red Eye/Polydor label-mates were The Cruel Sea, The Clouds, Steve Kilbey (Russell's brother and lead singer and bassist from successful Australian band The Church), Jack Frost aka Steve Kilbey and Grant McLennan (The Go-Betweens), The Bhagavad Guitars, Curious (Yellow) and The Beasts of Bourbon.
In 1991, Russell Kilbey and Phillip Maher relocated to Melbourne. Darren 'Fud' Ryan (Drums) and Paul Agar (Bass and Backing Vocals) were recruited as new members. Tour support for the album 'Almost Pure' saw the band doing support slots for U.K. band The Wonderstuff as well as solo shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.
The Crystal Set disbanded at the end of 1991. Russell Kilbey went on to collaborate with David Thrussell from techno-industrial outfit Snog in a collaboration called Sex Industrie. The duo released a cover version of the classic AC/DC song "Jailbreak".
The Crystal Set album Umbrella has been re-released on Cd with an extra track.
Russell P. Kilbey collaborations with Steve Kilbey as a duo named Gilt Trip include the albums Gilt Trip and Egyptian Register. 
He has also collaborated with his brother John Kilbey as Warp Factor 9, releasing the album 5 Days in a Photon Belt.

Lake Sakakawea is a reservoir in the Missouri River basin in central North Dakota. Named for the Shoshone-Hidatsa woman Sakakawea, it is the largest man-made lake in North Dakota and the third largest in the United States, after Lake Mead and Lake Powell. The lake lies in parts of six counties in western North Dakota: Dunn, McKenzie, McLean, Mercer, Mountrail, and Williams. A map centered around the Van Hook Arm [tpl]coord|47|53|00|N|102|21|14|W|scale:1000000[/tpl] of the lake perhaps better shows its westward extent from its origin at the Garrison Dam.
It is located about [tpl]convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Bismarck, North Dakota; the distance by the river is about [tpl]convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. The lake averages between [tpl]convert|2|and|3|mi|km[/tpl] in width and is [tpl]convert|14|mi|km[/tpl] wide at its widest point (Van Hook Arm). Lake Sakakawea marks the maximum southwest extent of glaciation during the ice age.
The reservoir was created with the completion of Garrison Dam in 1956, the second (and largest) of six main-stem dams on the Missouri River built and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, hydroelectric power, navigation and irrigation.
The creation of the lake displaced members of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation from the villages of Van Hook and (Old) Sanish, forcing the creation of New Town and Mandaree. Incidentally, one name that had been proposed for New Town was Vanish (a portmanteau of the two previous towns' names). A third reservation town, Elbowoods (Arikara: hiswíkat hiswíkAt), where the agency headquarters, boarding school, hospital and jail were located, was also lost to the lake. These three towns are commemorated in the names of the three campground sections at Lake Sakakawea State Park, a state park located adjacent to Garrison Dam.
Lake Sakakawea is also home to many summer camps, including Triangle Y Camp and Camp of the Cross.

[[Administratium]]

CATEGORIES: Political satire, Jokes, Fictional materials

Administratium is a well-known joke in scientific circles, and is a spoof both on the bureaucracy of scientific establishments and on descriptions of newly discovered chemical elements. 
In 1991, Thomas Kyle (the supposed discoverer of this element) was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for physics, making him one of only three fictional people to have won the award.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V111/N40/ignobe.40n.html |title=Ig Nobel Prizes Debut |publisher=The Tech |first=Alice |last=Gilchrist |issue=40 |volume=111 |date=October 4, 1991 |accessdate=2007-02-01[/tpl]
A spoof was written by William DeBuvitz in 1988 and first appeared in print in the January 1989 issue of The Physics Teacher.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/administ.htm |title=Administratium. New chemical Element Discovered |first=William |last=DeBuvitz |publisher= The Physics Teacher |date=January 1989 |accessdate=2011-11-18[/tpl] It spread rapidly among university campuses and research centers, and many versions surfaced, often customized to the contributor's situation.
A similar joke concerns Administrontium which was referenced in print in 1993.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ebeltz.net/resume/jir.html |title=Physics Non-Department First to Photograph New Element. |first=Ellin |last=Beltz |publisher=NEIU Independent |date=June 21, 1993 |accessdate=2007-02-01[/tpl]
Another variation on the same joke is "Bureaucratium". A commonly heard description describes it as "having a negative half-life", in other words the more time passes, the more massive "Bureaucratium" becomes; it only grows larger and more sluggish. This obviously refers to the bureaucratic system, which is generally perceived as a system in which bureaucratic procedures accumulate and whatever needs to get done takes increasingly longer to get done as soon as it touches the bureaucracy.

Antichrist Superstar is the second full-length studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on October 8, 1996 in the US through Nothing and Interscope Records. The record's success in mainstream charts turned the band overnight into a household name and its frontman into a bonafide rock icon. This led to numerous protests from religious and civic groups such as the American Family Association due to the band's perceived anti-Christian stance as well as the transgressive and confrontational nature of their music, performance and appearance.
A rock opera concept album, it is the first installment in a trilogy which includes Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death). After the release of Holy Wood, Manson said that the overarching story within the trilogy is presented in reverse chronological order; Antichrist Superstar, therefore, is the finale despite being the first to be chronologically released.[tpl]cite journal |first=Tom|last=Lanham |date=November 2000 |title=Marilyn Manson: Absinthe Makes The Heart Grow Fonder |journal=Alternative Press |issue=#148 |pages=76‐86 |publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc.

Alvin and the Chipmunks is an American animated music group created by Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. for a novelty record in 1958. The group consists of three singing animated anthropomorphic chipmunks: Alvin, the mischievous troublemaker, who quickly became the star of the group; Simon, the tall, bespectacled intellectual; and Theodore, the chubby, impressionable one. The trio is managed by their human adoptive father, David (Dave) Seville. In reality, "David Seville" was Bagdasarian's stage name, and the Chipmunks themselves are named after the executives of their original record label. The characters became a success, and the singing Chipmunks and their manager were given life in several animated cartoon productions, using redrawn, anthropomorphic chipmunks, and eventually films.
The voices of the group were all performed by Bagdasarian, who sped up the playback to create high-pitched voices. This oft-used process was not entirely new to Bagdasarian, who had also used it for two previous novelty songs, including "Witch Doctor", but it was so unusual and well-executed it earned the record two Grammy Awards for engineering. Bagdasarian, performing as the Chipmunks, released a long line of albums and singles, with "The Chipmunk Song" becoming a number-one single in the United States. After the death of Bagdasarian in 1972, the characters' voices were performed by his son Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and the latter's wife Janice Karman in the subsequent incarnations of the 1980s and 1990s.
In the 2007 CGI/live-action movie adaptation and its 2009 sequel, they were voiced in dialogue by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney. Bagdasarian, Jr. and Karman continue to perform the singing voices for Alvin, Theodore and the Chipettes, but Steve Vining does Simon's singing voice. The project has earned five Grammy awards, an American Music Award, a Golden Reel Award, and three Kids' Choice Awards, and has been nominated for three Emmy awards.
A third movie installment, Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, was released in theaters on December 16, 2011.
A CGI-animated TV series revival, titled ALVINNN!!! and the Chipmunks, is currently in production. Scheduled to run for 52 11-minute episodes, it will premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. After a 25-year hiatus, the premiere of this series will mark its first television debut since their last TV appearance ended in 1990.
Fox 2000 Pictures and Regency Enterprises announced a fourth installment, titled Alvin and the Chipmunks 4, scheduled to be released on December 11, 2015.

Lord Reith maintained that broadcasting should be a public service which enriches the intellectual and cultural life of the nation. It is in this spirit that the BBC each year invites a leading figure to deliver a series of lectures on radio. The aim is to advance public understanding and debate about significant issues of contemporary interest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/the-reith-lectures/about/ |title=Radio 4 - The Reith Lectures - About Reith |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02[/tpl]

Marie Ennemond Camille Jordan (5 January 1838 – 22 January 1922) was a French mathematician, known both for his foundational work in group theory and for his influential Cours d'analyse. He was born in Lyon and educated at the École polytechnique. He was an engineer by profession; later in life he taught at the École polytechnique and the Collège de France, where he had a reputation for eccentric choices of notation.
He is remembered now by name in a number of foundational results:
Jordan's work did much to bring Galois theory into the mainstream. He also investigated the Mathieu groups, the first examples of sporadic groups. His Traité des substitutions, on permutation groups, was published in 1870; this treatise won for Jordan the 1870 prix Poncelet.[tpl]cite book|chapter=Prix|title=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences|year=1872|page=1302|location=Paris|publisher=Gauthier-Villars|volume=Tome 75, Juillet à Décembre 1872|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xIBQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1302[/tpl]

Susan Sto Helit (also spelled Sto-Helit), once referred to as Susan Death, is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series of fantasy novels. She is the "granddaughter" of Death, the Disc's Grim Reaper, and, as such, has "inherited" a number of his abilities. She has appeared in three Discworld novels to date: Soul Music, Hogfather, and Thief of Time. She is also referred to (though not by name) at the end of Mort, when her father invites Death to her christening. She is one of the Discworld series' principal protagonists. Being both human and supernatural, Susan is frequently (and reluctantly) forced away from her "normal" life to do battle with various malign supernatural forces or, barring that, to take on her grandfather's job in his absence. Death tends to employ her in his battles against the Auditors of Reality, particularly in situations where he has no power or influence. As the series progresses, she also begins to take on roles educating children, so that, as Pratchett mentions in The Art of Discworld, she has "ended up, via that unconscious evolution that dogs characters, a kind of Goth Mary Poppins".

Brian Holland (born February 15, 1941) is an American songwriter and record producer, best known as a member of Holland–Dozier–Holland, the songwriting and production team that was responsible for much of the Motown sound and numerous hit records by artists such as Martha and the Vandellas, The Supremes, The Four Tops, and The Isley Brothers. Holland, along with Lamont Dozier, served as the team's musical arranger and producer.

Holland was born in Detroit, Michigan.  For a short time, he partnered Robert Bateman, and together they were known as "Brianbert", collaborating on such hits as "Please Mr. Postman" for the The Marvelettes.
Holland has also had an on-and-off career as a performer.  He released a solo single in 1958 under the name of "Briant Holland". He and longtime friend and future songwriting partner Freddie Gorman were in a short-lived group called The Fidalatones, and was later (1960–62) a member of Motown recording act The Satintones as well as being a member of The Rayber Voices, a quartet that backed up several early Motown recording acts.  He partnered with Lamont Dozier under the name "Holland-Dozier", releasing a lone single for Motown in 1963, then was inactive for a number of years, and was then revived in the early and mid-1970s, scoring a number of medium-sized R&B hits.  Holland resumed his solo recording career in 1974, hitting the charts as a solo artist in '74 and '75.

UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) is a simple agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering method. It is one of the most popular methods in ecology for the classification of sampling units (such as vegetation plots) on the basis of their pairwise similarities in relevant descriptor variables (such as species composition).Legendre, P. and Legendre, L. 1998. Numerical Ecology. Second English Edition. Developments in Environmental Modelling 20. Elsevier, Amsterdam. In bioinformatics, UPGMA is used for the creation of phenetic trees (phenograms). In a phylogenetic context, UPGMA assumes a constant rate of evolution (molecular clock hypothesis), and is not a well-regarded method for inferring relationships unless this assumption has been tested and justified for the data set being used. UPGMA was initially designed for use in protein electrophoresis studies, but is currently most often used to produce guide trees for more sophisticated phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms.
The UPGMA algorithm constructs a rooted tree (dendrogram) that reflects the structure present in a pairwise similarity matrix (or a dissimilarity matrix).
At each step, the nearest two clusters are combined into a higher-level cluster. The distance between any two clusters A and B is taken to be the average of all distances between pairs of objects "x" in A and "y" in B, that is, the mean distance between elements of each cluster:

[[Call and response]]
CATEGORIES: African culture, African-American culture, Communication

Call and response is a form of "spontaneous verbal and non-verbal interaction between speaker and listener in which all of the statements ('calls') are punctuated by expressions ('responses') from the listener."
In African cultures, call-and-response is a pervasive pattern of democratic participation—in public gatherings, in the discussion of civic affairs, in religious rituals, as well as in vocal and instrumental musical expression (see call and response in music). It is this tradition that African bondsmen and women have transmitted over the years in various forms of expression—in religious observance; public gatherings; even in children's rhymes; and, most notably, in music in its multiple forms: gospel, blues, rhythm and blues, jazz, hip-hop and go-go.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] In contemporary African American worship services, where call and response is pervasive, a pastor will call out to his congregants to engage an enthusiastic response.  For example:
Call and response is inherently connected to the historical African religious roots, which served as the foundation for African American religious thought and behavior. It was even noticed by slave masters as early as the arrival of the first slave ships in Virginia in the 1600s.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
While slave masters worked diligently to convert their slaves to Christianity, the African slaves still practiced their own form of religious celebration which was called Slave Christianity.  Several analysts[tpl]who?|date=May 2011[/tpl] assessed the ecstatic spirituality of these slaves and noted two major actions during this celebration:

The June Movement ([tpl]lang-da|JuniBevægelsen[/tpl]) was a Danish eurosceptic political organisation founded 23 August 1992. It took its name from the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty that took place in Denmark in June of that year. The movement was a member of the European political party EUDemocrats - Alliance for a Europe of Democracies.
The June Movement acknowledged Denmark's membership of the European Union, but opposed the process of tighter European integration including the Lisbon Treaty, and in general the movement wanted the EU to deal with only cross-border issues such as environmental and trade policies. The movement participated in elections for the European Parliament, but neither in local elections nor in elections for the Parliament of Denmark.
In 2009 the movement lost its representation in the European Parliament and disbanded on 5 September 2009.http://www.j.dk

Graham Colin Swift FRSL (born 4 May 1949) is an English writer. Born in London, England, he was educated at Dulwich College, London, Queens' College, Cambridge, and later the University of York.
Some of Swift's books have been filmed, including Last Orders, starring Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins and Waterland, starring Jeremy Irons. Last Orders was joint-winner of the 1996 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction and a mildly controversial winner of the 1996 Booker Prize, owing to the superficial similarities in plot to William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. Waterland is set in The Fens; a novel of landscape, history and family, it is often cited as one of the outstanding post-war British novels and has been a set text on the English literature syllabus in British schools. Writer Patrick McGrath asked Swift about the “feeling for magic” in Waterland during an interview. Swift responds that “The phrase everybody comes up with is magic realism, which I think has now become a little tired. But on the other hand there’s no doubt that English writers of my generation have been very much influenced by writers from outside who in one way or another have got this magical, surreal quality, such as Borges, Márquez, Grass, and that that has been stimulating. I think in general it’s been a good thing. Because we are, as ever, terribly parochial, self-absorbed and isolated, culturally, in this country. It’s about time we began to absorb things from outside."McGrath, Patrick. "Graham Swift", BOMB Magazine Spring, 1986. Retrieved 2012-11-26.

[[Close quarters combat]]

CATEGORIES: Land warfare

Close Quarters Combat (CQC), Close Quarters Battle (CQB) or Close Combat Fighting is a physical confrontation between two or more combatants.U.S. Marine Close Combat Fighting Handbook - Skyhorse Publishing Inc., 2011 - Overview It can take place between military units, police and criminals, and other similar actions. In warfare it usually consists of small units or teams engage the enemy with personal weapons at very short range, up to 30 meters, from proximity hand-to-hand combat to close quarter target negotiation with short range firearms. In the typical close quarters combat scenario, the attackers try a very fast, violent takeover of a vehicle or structure controlled by the defenders, who usually have no easy way to withdraw. Because enemies, hostages/civilians, and fellow operators can be closely intermingled, close quarters combat demands a rapid assault and a precise application of lethal force. The operators need great proficiency with their weapons, and the ability to make split-second decisions in order to minimize accidental casualties. 
Criminals sometimes use close quarters combat techniques, such as in an armed robbery or jailbreak, but most of the terminology comes from training used to prepare soldiers, police, and other authorities. Therefore, much material relating to close quarters combat is written from the perspective of the authorities who must break into the stronghold where the opposing force (OPFOR) has barricaded itself. Typical examples would be commando operations behind enemy lines and hostage rescues.
Although there is considerable overlap, close quarters combat is not synonymous with urban warfare, now sometimes known by the military acronyms MOUT (military operations in urban terrain), FIBUA (fighting in built-up areas) or OBUA (Operations in Built Up Areas) in the West. Urban warfare is a much larger field, including logistics and the role of crew-served weapons like heavy machine guns, mortars, and mounted grenade launchers, as well as artillery, armor, and air support. In close quarters combat, the emphasis is on small infantry units using light, compact weapons that one person can carry and use easily in tight spaces, such as carbines, submachine guns, shotguns, pistols, knives, and bayonets. As such, close quarters combat is a tactical concept that forms a part of the strategic concept of urban warfare, but not every instance of close quarters combat is necessarily urban warfare—for example, a jungle is potentially a stage for close quarters combat.

Associate Justice or Associate Judge is the title for a member of a judicial panel who is not the Chief Justice in some jurisdictions.

Micronesia, January 28, 2010 In other common law jurisdictions, the equivalent position is called "Puisne Justice".
In the United States, judicial panels are non-hierarchical, so an Associate Judge has the same responsibilities with respect to cases as the Chief Judge. 
An Associate Judge usually has fewer or different administrative responsibilities than the Chief. Famously, on the Supreme Court of the United States, the most junior Associate Justice (currently Justice Elena Kagan), has the task of answering the door when the Justices are in private conference.[tpl]fact|date=December 2013[/tpl]

[[Chief Justice]]
CATEGORIES: Judges, Chief justices, Legal professions

The Chief Justice is the name for the presiding member of a supreme court in many countries with a justice system based on English common law, such as the Supreme Court of Canada, the Constitutional Court of South Africa, the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong, the Supreme Court of India, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Supreme Court of Nepal, the Supreme Court of Ireland, the Supreme Court of New Zealand, the High Court of Australia, the Supreme Court of the United States, and provincial or state supreme courts. 
The situation is slightly different in the three legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom.  The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales; in Northern Ireland's courts, the equivalent position is the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland and in Scottish courts, the equivalent is the Lord President of the Court of Session. These three judges are not, though, part of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, which operates across all three jurisdictions and is headed by the President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.
The Chief Justice can be selected in many ways, but, in many nations, the position is given to the most senior justice of the court, while, in the United States, it is often the President's most important political nomination, subject to approval by the United States Senate. Although the title of this top American jurist is, by statute, Chief Justice of the United States, the term "Chief Justice of the Supreme Court" is often used unofficially.
In some courts, the Chief Justice has a different title, e.g. President of the Supreme Court.
In other courts, the title of Chief Justice is used, but the court has a different name, e.g. the Supreme Court of Judicature in colonial (British) Ceylon, and the Maryland Court of Appeals (in the US state of Maryland).

Christian Union – Reformed Political Party ([tpl]lang-nl|ChristenUnie – Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij[/tpl]) was a parliamentary party in the European Parliament formed by two Dutch orthodox Protestant parties: the ChristianUnion and the Reformed Political Party. The parliamentary party existed between 2001 and 2009.
The CU-SGP was formed in 2001 as a successor of the RPF-GPV-SGP parliamentary party that had existed since the 1984 European Parliament elections. After the merger of the Reformed Political Party (RPF) and the Reformed Political Alliance (GPV) into the ChristianUnion, the group was renamed ChristianUnion-SGP.
Both parties, ChristianUnionand SGP are eurosceptic and morally conservative. Since 1984 the RPF, GPV, later ChristianUnion and SGP had participated in the European parliament elections with one combined list which has candidates from all parties. Since 2004, the party currently had two MEPs, Johannes Blokland for the Christian Union and Bastiaan Belder for the Reformed Political Party. The ChristenUnie–SGP was part of the Independence and Democracy group.
In June 2009, the group broke up, as the ChristianUnion joined the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR). The ECR leadership did not want the SGP to join the new European parliamentary group, because of its conservative views on women.ChristenUnie en SGP uit elkaar op eurofractie.nl

The left-right political spectrum is a system of classifying political positions, ideologies and parties. Left-wing politics and right-wing politics are often presented as opposed, although a particular individual or group may take a left-wing stance on one matter and a right-wing stance on another. In France, where the terms originated, the Left has been called "the party of movement" and the Right "the party of order."Knapp & Wright, p. 10Adam Garfinkle, Telltale Hearts: The Origins and Impact of the Vietnam Antiwar Movement (1997).

[[Ghost crab]]

CATEGORIES: Ocypodoidea

Ghost crabs are semiterrestrial crabs of the subfamily Ocypodinae. They are common shore crabs in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world, inhabiting deep burrows in the intertidal zone. They are generalist scavengers and predators of small animals. The name "ghost crab" derives from their nocturnality and their generally pale coloration.[tpl]cite book |editor=Warren W. Burggren & Brian Robert McMahon |year=1988 |title=Biology of the land crabs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-30690-4 |chapter=Ecology |author=Thomas G. Wolcott |pages=55–97 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RR09AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA91[/tpl] They are also sometimes called sand crabs, though the name refers to various other crabs that do not belong to the subfamily.
Characteristics of the subfamily include one claw being larger than the other, thick and elongated eyestalks, and a box-like body. The differences in claw sizes, however, are not as marked as in male fiddler crabs. The subfamily includes 22 species in two genera.

[[Lamotrigine]]

CATEGORIES: Anticonvulsants, Mood stabilizers, Triazines, Organochlorides

Lamotrigine, marketed in the US and most of Europe as Lamictal [tpl]IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɪ|k|t|əl[/tpl] by GlaxoSmithKline, is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder.  It is also used off-label as an adjunct in treating clinical depression.  For epilepsy, it is used to treat focal seizures, primary and secondary tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.  Like many other anticonvulsant medications, lamotrigine also seems to act as an effective mood stabilizer, and has been the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for this purpose since lithium, a drug approved almost 30 years earlier. It is approved for the maintenance treatment of bipolar type I. Chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants (due to lamotrigine being a phenyltriazine), lamotrigine has many possible side-effects. Lamotrigine is generally accepted to be a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs,[tpl]cite journal | author = Rogawski MA, Löscher W | title = The neurobiology of antiepileptic drugs | journal = Nat Rev Neurosci | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 553–564 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15208697 | doi=10.1038/nrn1430[/tpl] but it could have additional actions since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs are not. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side-effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasises its unique properties.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lees G, Leach MJ | title = Studies on the mechanism of action of the novel anticonvulsant lamotrigine (Lamictal) using primary neurological cultures from rat cortex | journal = Brain Research | volume = 612 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 190–9 | date = May 1993 | pmid = 7687190 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(93)91660-K| url = [/tpl] Lamotrigine is inactivated by hepatic glucuronidation.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.2147/TCRM.S3343 |author= Werz MA |title= Pharmacotherapeutics of epilepsy: use of lamotrigine and expectations for lamotrigine extended release |journal= Ther Clin Risk Manag |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1035–46 |date=October 2008|pmid= 19209284 [/tpl]

There is no consensus on whether Silesian is a separate language or a somewhat divergent dialect of Polish.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]  The issue is largely unanswerable based on linguistic criteria, due to the existence of a dialect continuum between Polish and Czech formed by the Silesian and Lach varieties. The issue of whether language forms like Silesian and Lach represent minority languages in their own right is generally quite contentious in Europe due to the increased linguistic and political rights generally enjoyed by speakers of recognized minority languages, and Silesian is no exception.  In this instance, local Silesians tend to advocate in favor of language status, while Poles and Czechs from other regions tend to advocate against this.  International linguists tend toward giving it dialect status.[tpl]fact|date=April 2013[/tpl]

[[Longest English sentence]]
CATEGORIES: English grammar, World records, Superlatives

There have been several claims for the longest sentence in the English language, usually with claims that revolve around the longest printed sentence. There is no absolute limit on the length of a written English sentence. A sentence can be made as long as time allows with concatenating (linking) clauses using grammatical conjunctions such as and. Sentences can also be extended indefinitely by the addition of modifiers and modifier clauses, such as

Human language grammars are phrase-generation systems, so—in their simplest forms—they must have infinite output. The deeper, more recursive structures reflect similarities among linguistic constituents and operations, but a listener can understand these structures without going into a deeper analysis.[ref]Stabler, Edward P., Recursion in grammar and performance,
http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/stabler/Stabler10-Recurs.pdf revised 2011-10-06 10:06

Its name, which  means "Mountain of the Spirit", comes from the Sanskrit word Manasa, meaning "intellect" or "soul". Manaslu was first climbed on May 9, 1956 by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu, members of a Japanese expedition.

Transatlantic Records was a British independent record label. It was established in 1961. It started began primarily as an importer of American folk, blues and jazz records - by many of the artists who influenced the burgeoning British folk and blues boom. Within a couple of years, the company had started recording British artists. The company's philosophy was intentionally eclectic.
The label was founded by a young Englishman Nat Joseph who started the company at the age of 21 after visiting the USA and realizing that there was a wealth of music of interest to British music fans that was not being made available in the UK. They imported labels from the USA such as Prestige, Tradition (US) and Riverside. From the outset, many of the covers included photography and design by Brian Shuel. Transatlantic were also instrumental in the importation of MK records (a Russian classical label), which were then issued with the original Russian labels, but with an English printed sleeve. 
The company's first commercial success came not from music but from three sex education albums. The controversy about these records led to sales approaching 100,000 and the resulting financial lift gave the company money to develop its musical base. 
Some of their early records included artists as diverse as The Dubliners, actress Sheila Hancock, jazz singer Annie Ross, actresses Jean Hart and Isla Cameron, and Shakespearean actor Tony Britton. They managed to mix the folk music interest with the money making capacity of the sex education records by issuing "When Dalliance was in Flower" - a series of bawdy songs performed by Ed McCurdy and licensed from Elektra in the US. As often happened, these were issued first on the Transatlantic label in the UK and then on the subsidiary label XTRA. The catalogue numbers often contained "TRA" within the prefix, thus MTRA, XTRA, and LTRA were all used. The latter prefix was used with a series of LPs produced by Bill Leader (who worked with Nat Joseph from the outset as an engineer). Amongst these "Leader" records were recordings by Nic Jones, Martin Simpson, Mick Ryan, Bandoggs (another Nic Jones group), Andrew Cronshaw, and Al O'Donnell.
With the advent of psychedelia and flower power the Transatlantic stable of artists achieved increasing popularity, culminating in the formation of the supergroup Pentangle. Meanwhile Transatlantic had been extending its eclecticism, recording such as the eccentric audio collageist Ron Geesin, and The Purple Gang, whose "Granny Takes A Trip" was banned by the BBC in 1967.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2009/jan/22/obituary-stuart-pevitt/print|title=Stuart Previtt|date=22 January 2009|author=Alex Gunningham|accessdate=2011-08-11|location=London|work=The Guardian[/tpl]  CBS had  released the extremely successful contemporary music budget sampler with The Rock Machine Turns You On in 1967. Before CBS could follow up, Transatlantic released Listen Here! early in 1968. Like 'Rock Machine' the record was priced at 14/11d (£0.75) - but Transatlantic took promotion one stage further by not only printing the track listing on the front, but also the price.  The record was designed to preview not only the forthcoming Pentangle double album, but solo records by members Bert Jansch and John Renbourn. Listen Here! also served to introduce a new group The Sallyangie, with siblings Mike Oldfield and Sally Oldfield.
In 1975, Joseph sold a 75% share of his company to Sidney Bernstein's Granada Group and the company became part of Granada. There was a culture clash between the independent-spirited Transatlantic and the corporate sensibilities of Granada and two years later Granada sold its share in Transatlantic to the Marshall Cavendish publishing company, which also acquired Joseph's 25% share. The new company was renamed Logo Records. In the 1990s Logo Records and the Transatlantic Records catalogue was sold to Castle Communications (now Sanctuary Records).

They are called the Blue Wizards on account of their sea-blue robes (each of the other Istari had robes of a different colour), and their individual names are given in the Unfinished Tales as  Alatar and Pallando. They were both sent to the distant east of Middle-earth, and therefore played no role in the events of the west of Middle-earth, as described in The Lord of the Rings.

According to Guoyu and Shanhaijing published in the Zhanguo period (476–221 BCE), Sushen was the name of the tribe who lived in Shandong and border of Liaoxi area.
The name of Sushen appeared as early as the 6th century BC in Chinese documents. They are almost unknown with the exception of the fact that they lived to the north of China and used wooden bows and crossbows. Ancient Chinese believed that the Sushen paid arrows as tribute to an ideal Chinese ruler. In other words, an arrival of Sushen delegates was, for the Chinese, an auspicious sign of the Chinese ruler's virtue.
From the 3rd century to the 6th century, the name Sushen was used as an alias for the Yilou, who were in eastern Manchuria. However, the connection between the Yilou and the ancient Sushen is unclear. Some historians think that Chinese, having heard that the Yilou paid arrows as tribute, linked them with the Sushen based on knowledge of ancient documents. They paid tribute several times and pleased rulers of Northern China. The Yilou disappeared from documents in the 6th century. The Mohe rose into power there instead.
The Chinese characters for 'Sushen' (粛慎) can also be found in Japanese documents, in which the characters are annotated and read as Mishihase or Ashihase. According to Nihonshoki, the Mishihase first arrived to Sado Province during the reign of Emperor Kimmei. In 660, Japanese General Abe no Hirafu defeated the Mishihase in Hokkaidō by request from the native inhabitants.
Some historians consider that the Mishihase were identical with the Sushen of Chinese records, and others think that Japanese named the indigenous people in the northeast based on the knowledge of Chinese documents, just as the Chinese did during the Three Kingdoms Period.
They are believed to have been the ancestors of the Jurchen, and subsequently of the Manchu, Nanai and many other Tungusic peoples.

Nanga Parbat (literally, Naked Mountain Urdu: [tpl]Nastaliq|نانگا پربت[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-hns|nəŋɡaː pərbət̪|[/tpl]) is the ninth highest mountain in the world.  It is the western anchor of the Himalayas around which the Indus river skirts before it debouches into the plains of Pakistan.  It is located in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan, and is locally known as 'Deo Mir' ('mir' meaning 'mountain').The Pamirs and the Source of the Oxus. (1896) George Nathaniel Curzon.

Nanga Parbat is one of the eight-thousanders, with a summit elevation of [tpl]convert|8126|m|ft|0[/tpl]. An immense, dramatic peak rising far above its surrounding terrain, Nanga Parbat is also a notoriously difficult climb.

[[Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service]]
CATEGORIES: United States Postal Service

The Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service is an eleven-member board comparable to a board of directors of a private corporation, except in service of the American postal system.  Nine members are appointed by the President of the United States, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The nine presidentially appointed Governors choose the Postmaster General, who also serves as a member of the Board. These 10, in turn, choose a Deputy Postmaster General, who becomes the 11th member of the Board. The Postmaster General and Deputy Postmaster General serve at the pleasure of the Governors. 
Each Governor is appointed to a nine-year term or to the remainder of an unexpired term created by the death or resignation of a sitting Governor. Terms of the Governors are staggered to expire each year on December 8. A Governor whose term has expired may continue to sit on the Board for up to one year until a successor has been appointed. No more than five of the nine Governors may be of the same political party. On December 20, 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, P.L. 109-435, which changed the terms of subsequently appointed Governors from nine to seven years.
The Board directs the exercise of the powers of the Postal Service, directs and controls its expenditures, reviews its practices, conducts long-range planning and sets policies on all postal matters. The Board takes up matters such as service standards, capital investments and facilities projects exceeding $25 million. It also approves officer compensation.
http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/leadership/board-governors.htm
The Board generally meets once a month. Each January, the Governors elect a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman. Each Governor receives $300 per day for not more than 42 days of meetings each year and travel expenses, in addition to an annual salary of $30,000. The Governors employ a full-time Corporate Secretary who serves as the primary staff assistant to the Board.

For lists of battles organized by campaign and theater, see:
Some battles have more than one name; e.g., the battles known in the North as Battle of Antietam and Second Battle of Bull Run were  referred to as the battles of Sharpsburg and  Manassas by the South. This was because the North tended to name battles after any landmarks, whereas the South named battles after nearby towns.

[[Annulus (mathematics)]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary geometry, Geometric shapes

In mathematics, an annulus (the Latin word for "little ring", with plural annuli) is a ring-shaped object, especially a region bounded by two concentric circles. The adjectival form is annular (as in annular eclipse).
The open annulus is topologically equivalent to both the open cylinder [tpl]math|S1 × (0,1)[/tpl] and the punctured plane.
The area of an annulus is the difference in the areas of the larger circle of radius [tpl]math|R[/tpl] and the smaller one of radius [tpl]math|r[/tpl]:
The area of an annulus can be obtained from the length of the longest interval that can lie completely inside the annulus, 2*d in the accompanying diagram. This can be proven by the Pythagorean theorem; the length of the longest interval that can lie completely inside the annulus will be tangent to the smaller circle and form a right angle with its radius at that point. Therefore d and r are the sides of a right angled triangle with hypotenuse R and the area is given by:
The area can also be obtained via calculus by dividing the annulus up into an infinite number of annuli of infinitesimal width [tpl]math|dρ[/tpl] and area [tpl]math|2πρ dρ[/tpl] and then integrating from ρ = r to ρ = R:
The area of an annulus sector of angle [tpl]math|θ[/tpl], with [tpl]math|θ[/tpl] measured in radians, is given by:

[[Speed to fly]]
CATEGORIES: Airspeed, Gliding

Speed to fly is a principle used by soaring pilots when flying between sources of lift, usually thermals, ridge lift and wave.  The aim is to maximize the average cross-country speed by optimizing the airspeed in both rising and sinking air.  The optimal airspeed is independent of the wind speed, because the fastest average speed achievable through the airmass corresponds to the fastest achievable average groundspeed.Modern Elementary Gliding, British Gliding Association, n.d. Appendix D: "Making the Most of it".  The idea is usually attributed to Paul MacCready, although an early version of the theory was first described by Wolfgang Späte in 1938.[ref]
</ref>
However Späte may not have considered sinking air between thermals, and there is no mention of this  until 1947 when Ernest Dewing and George Pirie independently included this aspect.[ref]
</ref> Paul MacCready, however, certainly invented the "ring", which allowed an easy indication of the optimal speed to fly.

[[Noda Castle]]

CATEGORIES: Castles in Aichi Prefecture

[tpl]nihongo|Noda Castle |野田城|Noda-jō[/tpl] was a Sengoku period castle located in eastern Mikawa Province in what is today part of the city of Shinshiro, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.
A fortified residence was constructed on this site by Suganuma Sadanori in 1508. The Suganuma clan were a subordination branch of the Okudaira clan, who ruled most of Mikawa Province. The castle was seized by the Imagawa clan in 1560, shortly before their defeat at the Battle of Okehazama in Owari Province. Suganuma Sadamitsu recovered the castle in a night battle in 1562. However, in 1571, a reconnaissance-in-force by the Takeda clan, led by Yamagata Masakage took the castle and held it briefly with little difficulty. When the armies of the Takeda clan, led by Takeda Shingen invaded Mikawa Province in 1573, the Takeda clan attempted to seize Noda Castle once again. However, in the past couple of years, the castle defenses had been increased by Suganuma Sadamichi, and the castle held out for several weeks, only reaching the point of surrender after Takeda sappers tunneled into the moats, draining them of water. During this Siege of Noda Castle, Takeda Shingen was wounded by a sniper's bullet, possibly fatally as he died only a few weeks later.
Noda Castle was abandoned around 1590, after Tokugawa Ieyasu relocated to Edo Castle. The site now is an overgrown forested area, with only a stone marker to commemorate the location.

(2005). "Noto" in [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia, p. 728|page=728[/tpl]. It was sometimes called [tpl]nihongo|Nōshū|能州[/tpl]. Noto bordered on Etchū and Kaga provinces.
Nanao, Ishikawa was the ancient capital and the main castle town of Noto. For much of the Sengoku Period Noto was ruled by a minor branch of the Maeda clan of Kaga.
Following the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the han system in 1871, Noto Province was renamed Nanao Prefecture and Imizu District from Etchu Province was added. However, in 1872 Nanao was merged with Kanazawa Prefecture (the former Kaga Province) to form today's Ishikawa Prefecture and Imizu District was given back to Niikawa Prefecture (the renamed Etchu Province).  
Maps of Japan and Noto Province were reformed in the 1870s when the prefecture system was introduced.Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at p. 780.  At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes.  For example, Noto is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.US Department of State. (1906).

The Aérospatiale Gazelle is a five-seat helicopter, commonly used for light transport, scouting and light attack duties. It is powered by a single turbine engine and was the first helicopter to feature a fenestron tail instead of a conventional tail rotor. It was designed and manufactured in France by Sud Aviation, later Aérospatiale; the Gazelle has also been manufactured under licence by Westland Aircraft in the United Kingdom as the Westland Gazelle, by SOKO in Yugoslavia, and the Arab British Helicopter Company (ABHCO) in Egypt.
Since being introduced to service in 1973, the Gazelle has been procured and operated by a number of export customers. It has also participated in numerous conflicts around the world, including by Syria during the 1982 Lebanon War, by Rwanda during the Rwandan Civil War in the 1990s, and by numerous participants on both sides of the 1991 Gulf War. In French service, the Gazelle has been supplemented as an attack helicopter by the larger Eurocopter Tiger, but remains in use primarily as a scout helicopter.

Nobunaga took Odani Castle from Azai Nagamasa, who, left with no other option, committed suicide along with his son. His wife and three daughters were entrusted to Nobunaga, considering they were his sister and nieces. Two of Nagamasa's daughters would later marry into powerful families. Their escape from the besieged castle became a fairly common sentimental scene in traditional Japanese art.
Before Azai Nagamasa committed seppuku he decided to make one last siege on Nobunaga's main camp; in the end, however, he failed and was instead captured.

[[Muller's ratchet]]

CATEGORIES: Population genetics, Evolutionary biology

In evolutionary genetics, Muller's ratchet (named after Hermann Joseph Muller, by analogy with a ratchet mechanism) is the process by which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate deleterious mutations in an irreversible manner.[tpl]cite journal|author=Muller HJ |year=1932 |title=Some genetic aspects of sex |journal=American Naturalist |volume=66 |issue=703 |pages=118–138 |doi=10.1086/280418[/tpl] (Muller's original 1932 paper)[tpl]cite journal|author=Muller HJ |year=1964 |title=The relation of recombination to mutational advance |journal=Mutat Res |volume=106 |pages=2–9 |pmid=14195748[/tpl] (original paper as cited by, e.g.: [tpl]cite book |author=Maynard Smith J |coauthors=Szathmary E |year=1997 | title=The major transitions in evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York, Tokyo[/tpl] ; [tpl]cite book|author=Futuyma DJ|year=1998 |title=Evolutionary biology|edition=3rd edn|publisher=Sinauer Associates|location=Sunderland, Mass.[/tpl])
Muller proposed this mechanism as a theory to explain the evolution of sex. Although Muller's ratchet is proposed to explain the success of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction, the negative effect of accumulating irreversible deleterious mutations  may not be prevalent in organisms which, while they reproduce asexually, also undergo other forms of recombination. This effect has also been observed in those regions of the genomes of sexual organisms which do not undergo recombination.

Cassel (from Flemish; Kassel in modern Dutch spelling) is a commune in the Nord départment in northern France. Built on a prominent hill overlooking French Flanders, the town has existed since Roman times. It was developed by the Romans into an important urban centre and was the focus of a network of roads, which are still in use today, that converge on the hill. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Cassel became an important fortified stronghold for the rulers of Flanders which was repeatedly fought over before finally being annexed to France in the 17th century. It was the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during part of the First World War. In 1940, during the German invasion of France, Cassel was the scene of a fierce three-day battle between British and German forces which resulted in much of the town being destroyed.
Today the town, which was rebuilt following the war, is a popular destination for visitors to French Flanders. It is renowned for its extensive views from the summit of Mont Cassel and is the location of the Nord départment's principal museum of local art, history and folklore. It is also the home of the legendary giants Reuze-Papa and Reuze-Maman, which are paraded in effigy each Easter during the town's annual carnival.

[[Semi-detached]]
CATEGORIES: House types, House types in the United Kingdom, Housing in Canada

Semi-detached housing (often abbreviated to semi in the UK, Canada and Australia, as in "three-bedroom semi", and occasionally referred to as se-tenant houses) consists of pairs of houses built side by side as units sharing a party wall and usually in such a way that each house's layout is a mirror image of its twin. This style of housing, although built throughout the world, is commonly seen as particularly symbolic of the suburbanisation of the United Kingdom and Ireland, or post-war homes in Central Canada. In New England, certain other parts of the United States, and most of Canada, this style is sometimes colloquially called a duplex; elsewhere, however, "duplex" refers to a building split into two flats/apartments (one above the other). The style is usually referred to in the mid-Atlantic (particularly Philadelphia) as a twin.
This type of housing can be thought of as being a half-way state between terraced or row housing and single-family detached homes. Terraced housing consists of continuous row houses with open spaces at the front and back, while semi-detached houses have front, rear and any one side open spaces, and individual detached houses have open spaces on all sides.

Disney California Adventure, a theme park located in Anaheim, California, is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks and Resorts division. The [tpl]convert|72|acre|adj=on[/tpl] park is themed after the history and culture of the state of California. The park opened in 2001, and it is the second of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort complex, after Disneyland Park.
The concept of a theme park dedicated to California arose from a meeting of Disney executives in 1995, following the cancellation of the WestCOT project. Construction of the park began in 1998, and was completed by early 2001. Disney initially projected high attendance rates at the new park, but a series of preview openings held in January 2001 led to negative reviews, and after the park officially opened to the public on February 8, 2001, the company's attendance projections were never met. Disney spent the next several years incrementally adding new rides, shows, and attractions, and implementing other promotions aimed at boosting attendance. In 2007, Disney announced a major expansion of the park as well as a major overhaul of a significant portion of the park. Construction lasted for five years and was completed in stages, culminating with the opening of Cars Land in June 2012.
According to the Themed Entertainment Association, the park hosted approximately 7.78 million guests in 2012, making it the 11th-most visited theme park in the world that year.[tpl]cite news|title=2012 attendance report|url=http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/2012%20Theme%20Index%20Combined_1-1_online.pdf |accessdate=June 23, 2013[/tpl]

Soarin' Over California is a simulator attraction at Disney California Adventure and Walt Disney World's Epcot park. The ride employs a mechanical lift system, a film presentation on a large concave projection screen, and at certain points artificial scents to simulate flight via a hang glider ride over several California landmarks. The ride's soundtrack was written by Jerry Goldsmith.
The original Soarin' Over California was an opening day attraction at Disney California Adventure on February 8, 2001. In addition to the main ride and film presentation, the attraction features a pre-show tribute to the history of California's aviation industry. Soarin' Over California has consistently been a popular attraction at the park despite its low attendance in its early years, and the ride was duplicated at Epcot under the name Soarin[tpl]'[/tpl] in 2005.

The Disneyland Resort, commonly known as Disneyland, is an entertainment resort in Anaheim, California. It is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks and Resorts division and is home to two theme parks, three hotels, and a shopping, dining, and entertainment complex known as Downtown Disney.
The resort was developed by Walt Disney in the 1950s. When it opened to guests on July 17, 1955, the property consisted of Disneyland, its [tpl]convert|100|acre|sing=on[/tpl] parking lot, and the Disneyland Hotel, owned and operated by Disney's business partner Jack Wrather. After succeeding with the multi-park, multi-hotel business model at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, Disney acquired large parcels of land adjacent to Disneyland to apply the same business model in Anaheim. 
During the expansion, the property was named the Disneyland Resort to encompass the entire complex, while the original theme park was named Disneyland Park. The company purchased the Disneyland Hotel from the Wrather Company and the Pan Pacific Hotel from its Japanese owners. The latter became Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel. The property saw the addition of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, a second theme park, named Disney California Adventure, and the Downtown Disney shopping and dining area.

[[Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges]]
CATEGORIES: History of Catholicism in France, Religion in the Ancien Régime, 1438 in France, 15th-century laws in Christianity

The Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, issued by King Charles VII of France, on 7 July 1438, required a General Church Council, with authority superior to that of the papacy, to be held every ten years, required election rather than appointment to ecclesiastical offices, prohibited the pope from bestowing, and profiting from, benefices, and limited appeals to Rome.  The king accepted many of the decrees of the Council of Basel without endorsing its efforts to coerce Pope Eugene IV.
The Gallican church—in the eyes of some—declared administrative independence from the church in Rome, suppressed the payment of annates to Rome, and forbade papal intervention in the appointment of French prelates.  While this did result in a loss of papal power in France, the movement of conciliarists itself was divided. In 1449, the Council of Basel was dissolved and the Concilliar Movement suffered a nearly fatal blow.
The popes, especially Pius II lobbied for the repeal of the Pragmatic Sanction; and the French crown used promises of repeal as an inducement to the papacy to embrace policies favoring its interests.  The Pragmatic Sanction eventually was superseded by agreements made between the French crown and Rome, especially the 1516 Concordat of Bologna.

[[Gender-identity/role]]

CATEGORIES: Gender, Self

Gender-identity/role (coined by John Money to describe gender identity) is expressed through culturally dictated gender roles, like language, clothing, behavior, and other symbols. These terms are defined in most if not all of Money's books, including Gay. Straight, and In-between, and ample examples, such as those discussed below, are also provided.
For example, a traditional gender-identity/role for an American female would begin as an infant. She would learn to call herself a girl, learn to wear dresses, learn to cook and sew, and look forward to adulthood. As an adult woman she would take a "female" occupation, then marry, stay at home, raise children, and maintain the household. In a society that describes these as a woman's role, anyone performing these activities would be judged to be living life as a woman. A male behaving in this way would be running counter to his expected role.
Gender identity is more inclusive than sexual identity. That is to say, the status of one's external genitalia is not the only factor determining whether one identifies oneself as a woman or as a man. For instance, a man who has lost his external genitalia in some accident will not necessarily for that reason cease to regard himself as a man. 
Sometimes, for other reasons, a person with external genitalia that appear to be female will have a male gender identity and will act this gender identity out in life using behavior that constitutes a male gender role. Similarly, an individual with external genitalia that appear to be male will have a female gender identity and will act out a female gender role. People who have been made by various social forces to act out a gender role that is not in accord with their gender identity frequently report acute emotional distress as a result. This discomfort is sometimes called gender dysphoria.

Rudolph Joseph Rummel (October 21, 1932 – March 2, 2014Honolulu Star-Advertiser Obituaries) was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii. He spent his career assembling data on collective violence and war with a view toward helping their resolution or elimination. Rummel coined the term democide for murder by government (compare genocide), and his research claims that six times as many people died of democide during the 20th century than in all that century's wars combined.[tpl]Wayback |date=20071101055924 |url=http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/11/reevaluating-chinas-democide-to-be.html |title=Democratic Peace: Reevaluating China's Democide to be 73,000,000 [/tpl] He concluded that democracy is the form of government least likely to kill its citizens and that democracies do not wage war against each otherAbout R.J. Rummel – Freedom, Democide, War (see Democratic peace theory).
Rummel was the author of 24 scholarly books, and published his major results in Understanding Conflict and War (1975–81). He then spent the next fifteen years refining the underlying theory and testing it empirically on new data, against the empirical results of others, and on case studies. Power Kills (1997) sums up Rummel's research. Other works include Lethal Politics: Soviet Genocides and Mass Murders 1917–1987 (1990); China's Bloody Century: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900 (1991); Democide: Nazi Genocide and Mass Murder (1992); Death by Government (1994); and Statistics of Democide (1997). Extracts, figures, and tables from the books, including his sources and details regarding the calculations, are available online on his website. Rummel also authored Understanding Factor Analysis (1970) and Understanding Correlation (1976). He was the author of the Never again series of alternative-history novels, in which a secret society sends two lovers armed with fabulous wealth and modern weapons back to 1906 with orders to create an alternative, peaceful century. These works are available online.

[[Bedtime for Democracy]]

CATEGORIES: 1986 albums, Alternative Tentacles albums, Dead Kennedys albums

Bedtime for Democracy is the fourth and final studio album released by Dead Kennedys. Songs on this album cover such common punk subjects as conformity, Reaganomics, the military, and even criticizing aspects of their own punk movement. The title of the album is a reference to the 1951 comedy film, Bedtime for Bonzo starring Ronald Reagan, and perhaps also reflects the weary band's bitterness in the aftermath of the financially and emotionally draining trial they were being subjected to at the time over the controversial art included with their previous album. In fact, by the time recording began, they had already played what would be their last live concert with Jello Biafra and announced their breakup immediately after the record's release. There is a typing error on the Manifesto CDs so that the time length for Gone with My Wind is printed ":43" when it should read "1:43". On the original vinyl version, Side A was tracks 1-11 and Side B was tracks 12-21. It also came with a mock periodical in the form of a thin newspaper made up of collage art, called "Fuck Facts."
The East Bay punk band Isocracy parodied the name in their 1988 EP, Bedtime for Isocracy. The cover art depicted the band together in a bed, accompanied by Jello Biafra.

D.H. Peligro is an American punk rock musician, most commonly known in hardcore punk and as the second drummer for the hardcore punk band the Dead Kennedys from February 1981 until their breakup in December 1986. He appears on the albums Plastic Surgery Disasters, Frankenchrist, and Bedtime for Democracy, as well as the EP In God We Trust, Inc. and the singles/rarities collection, Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death.
In 1988, Peligro joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers replacing drummer Jack Irons. Guitarist Hillel Slovak had recently died of a heroin overdose and was replaced by guitarist DeWayne McKnight. Peligro had been friends with the band for years and even at one point was in a joke band called Three Little Butt Hairs with singer Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea. The McKnight and Peligro lineup didn't last long but long enough to record one track,  "Blues for Meister", which appears on the Out In L.A. compilation album. McKnight was fired three shows into their tour in September 1988 and was replaced by John Frusciante, however, Peligro would last a bit longer than McKnight helping to write some songs on the band's fourth album, Mother's Milk. Peligro, who was a close friend of the band, had too many drug and alcohol issues so the band fired him in November 1988, replacing him with drummer Chad Smith who has been with the band ever since.
Peligro also played briefly with The Hellations, Jungle Studs, Nailbomb, The Feederz, Lock-Up, The Two Free Stooges and SSI. In 2001, Peligro rejoined the Dead Kennedys without former frontman and primary songwriter Jello Biafra following a civil fraud complaint against Biafra, accusing him of withholding royalties and creative privilege to license Dead Kennedys songs. In early 2008, D.H. took a hiatus from the Dead Kennedys, citing the need for time off from touring.Deadkennedys.com
D.H. Peligro is the frontman for his band called Peligro (Spanish for "Danger") and has released three albums: Peligro (released in 1995 on Biafra's Alternative Tentacles record label, but deleted from the catalog in 2001), Welcome to America and Sum of Our Surroundings, which won Rock Album of the Year from the American Independent Music Awards. Peligro's sound is known to be an eclectic combination of punk, reggae, funk and heavy metal. He recently recorded a punk rock cover of Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze", which was nominated for a Grammy Award. D.H. Peligro has also fronted the bands Reverend Jones and the Cool Aid Choir and Al Sharpton's Hair and the Hellions. He appears as an interview subject in the 2003 documentary Afro-Punk.
Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 14, 2012. Peligro, although not inducted, was thanked by the band's longtime drummer and Peligro's replacement, Chad Smith during his speech.

Morimasa was born in what is now Shōwa-ku, Nagoya(situated in contemporary Aichi District, Owari Province), He was a retainer of Shibata Katsuie and one of his top generals in many of his campaigns. Morimasa was given the former Ikko Sect fortress Oyama Gobo in the Kaga prefecture by Oda Nobunaga; the fortress was subsequently named Oyama Castle in 1580 but went on to become Kanazawa Castle. After several campaigns in which he had fought, he was given the nickname onigenba which literally means "Demon Genba", Genba being his middle name.
After the betrayal of Akechi Mitsuhide which led to the death of both Oda Nobunaga and his heir Oda Nobutada, Morimasa sided with Shibata Katsuie over making Oda Nobutaka (the third son of Nobunaga) as heir to the Oda clan whereas Hashiba Hideyoshi (later Toyotomi Hideyoshi) supported Lord Sanboshi. Sanboshi was the heir to Oda Nobutada and was still an infant at that time. This argument led to the split of the Oda clan retainers into the two main factions led by Shibata Katsuie and Hashiba Hideyoshi.
Armies of the two factions eventually came to war. In 1583, Morimasa led an offensive against Takayama Ukon in Iwasakiyama. Morimasa then proceeded against Shibata Katsuie's orders and defeated Nakagawa Kiyohide at the battle of Shizugatake in 1583, further ignored orders by Shibata Katsuie to fall back led to his defeat as Toyotomi Hideyoshi's forces approached the next morning. Morimasa continually ignored the orders to retreat and did not abandon his position where he engaged the enemy. Despite calls for reinforcements he was subsequently defeated. Morimasa then attempted to flee, but was captured and beheaded.
The charge by Morimasa was the spark necessary for the battle of Shizugatake where Hideyoshi's troops were able to suppress any resistance led by Maeda Toshiie and prevented the support of Sassa Narimasa and Takigawa Kazumasu. In all, Hideyoshi's troops swelled to 120,000 whereas Shibata Katsuie's troops had only reached 25,000. This eventually forced Shibata Katsuie to commit seppuku along with his wife Lady Oichi (younger sister of Nobunaga) following the betrayal of Maeda Toshiie.

[tpl]nihongo|Sakuma Shōzan|佐久間 象山||March[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]22, 1811[tpl]snd[/tpl]August[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]12, 1864[/tpl] sometimes called Sakuma Zōzan, was a Japanese politician and scholar of the Edo era. He was the son of a samurai, and a native of Shinshu ([tpl]nihongo2|信州[/tpl]) in today's Nagano-ken.
At the age of 23, he went to Edo and for 10 years studied Chinese learning ([tpl]nihongo2|漢学[/tpl]).
He then started to study Western sciences ("rangaku") at the age of 33, with the help of the rangaku scholar Kurokawa Ryōan ([tpl]nihongo2|黒川良安[/tpl]). In 1844, he obtained the "Huishoudelyk Woordboek", a Dutch translation of Nöel Chomel's encyclopedia, from which Sakuma learned how to make glass, and then magnets, thermometers, cameras and telescopes. The encyclopedia was later translated into Japanese by Utagawa Genshin ([tpl]nihongo2|宇田川玄真[/tpl]) under the title [tpl]nihongo2|『厚生新編』[/tpl].
In 1849, he learned about electricity, through the book of the Dutch scientist Van den Bergh, and created Japan's first telegraph, five years before the gift of such a telegraph by Commodore Perry in 1854. He also invented electric machines derived from the Elekiter.
From 1842, following an analysis of the defeat of China against Great Britain in the First Opium War and the spread of Western influence in Asia, Sakuma actively proposed the introduction of Western military methods to the Bakufu and the establishment of maritime defense, through his book "Eight policies for the defense of the sea" ([tpl]nihongo2|海防八策[/tpl]). After the Bakufu ordered Japanese translations of the Military History of the Qing dynasty ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|聖武記[/tpl], Shèngwu Ji) and the  Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms written by Chinese scholar Wei Yuan (1794{–}1857), Sakuma was struck by the similarities in their ideas in defending against the west.[tpl]Cite book | title = Japanese Perceptions of China in the Nineteenth Century: Influence of Fukuzawa Yukichi | last = Narsimhan | first =  Sushila | isbn = 978-8174-8401-72 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ui8WRLGViEgC | year = 1999 | publisher = Phoenix Publishing House | page = 26[/tpl] His writing brought some fame, and he became the teacher of several future leaders of modernization (Yoshida Shōin, Katsu Kaishū, Sakamoto Ryōma).
In 1853, when Yoshida Shoin was convicted for attempting to stow away on one of Perry's ships, Sakuma was also sentenced by association to house arrest ([tpl]nihongo2|蟄居[/tpl]), which he endured for 9 years. During the arrest, he continued to study Western sciences, and developed various electric machines based on the elekiter and the Daniell battery, Japan's first seismic sensor, as well as improvements to guns. After his release, Sakuma Shozan continued to advocate opening Japanese ports to foreign traders, as well as reinforcing the Bakufu through collaboration with the Imperial administration (Kōbu gattai).
Shōzan was murdered by an assassin, a hitokiri named Kawakami Gensai, who killed Shozan with a single strike in broad daylight.
Sakuma Shozan coined the phrase  “Eastern ethics, Western technical learning” (tōyō dōtoku, seiyō gakugei, 東洋道徳西洋学芸) which was later further abbreviated as “Japanese spirit, Western technique” (wakon yōsai, [tpl]nihongo2|和魂洋才[/tpl]). This latter slogan is still in use as a description of the way that Japan ought to handle modernization.Josephson, Jason Ānanda (2012), The Invention of Religion in Japan. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, p.108.
Shozan's son Miura Keinosuke 三浦啓之助 was a member of the Shinsengumi.人名録

[tpl]nihongo|Sanada Masayuki|真田 昌幸||extra=1547 – July 13, 1611[/tpl] was a Japanese Sengoku period lord and daimyo.  He was descended from the Sanada clan, a regional house of Shinano province, which became a vassal of the Takeda clan of Kai province.
Along with his father and brothers, Masayuki served the Takeda clan during its heyday, when it was led by Takeda Shingen. After its downfall, Masayuki took the lead of his family and, despite little power, he managed to establish himself as an independent daimyo under the Toyotomi regime through skillful political maneuvers amidst the powerful Tokugawa, Hojō and Uesugi clans.
Known for having defeated the powerful Tokugawa army in the Siege of Ueda on two separate occasions, Masayuki is now considered one of the greatest military strategists of his era. In recent times, a number of portrayals in novels, films and other forms of media have contributed to his increased popularity.

The Steller's Eider (Polysticta stelleri) is a smallish sea duck that breeds along the Arctic coasts of eastern Siberia and Alaska. The lined nest is built on tundra close to the sea, and 6-10 eggs are laid.
It winters somewhat farther south in the Bering Sea, northern Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea. It can form large flocks, up to 200,000 birds on suitable coastal waters. It is scarce south of its wintering range.
This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food.
This species is the smallest eider at 45 cm long.The Birds of North America Online. Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Ithaca The male is unmistakable with its black upperparts and neck collar, white head and yellowish underparts. The drake's call is a deep crooning, although it is relatively quiet compared to the Somateria eiders.
The female is a dark brown bird, smaller with a more typically duck-shaped head and body than other eider species. She also has a repertoire of grunts and whistles.
This bird is named after the German naturalist Georg Steller.
The Steller's Eider is thought to have hybridised with the Common Eider on at least two occasions in the wild. A drake showing characters of both species was present at Cuxhaven, Niedersachsen, Germany on 17 November 1993.Anon (1995) Hybrid coincidence Birding World 8(5):200 Another drake was seen in Vadso harbour, Varanger, Norway on 7 April 1995; a photograph of this bird was published accompanying Forsman (1995).Forsman, Dick (1995) A presumed hybrid Steller's Eider x Common Eider in Norway ''Birding World' 8(4):138

[[Sanuki Province]]

CATEGORIES: Former provinces of Japan

[tpl]nihongo|Sanuki Province|讃岐国|Sanuki-no kuni[/tpl] was an old province of Japan on the island of Shikoku, with the same boundaries as modern Kagawa Prefecture.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Sanuki" in [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia, p. 823|page=823[/tpl]. It was sometimes called [tpl]nihongo|Sanshū|讃州[/tpl] .
It faced the Inland Sea and bordered on Awa and Iyo Provinces. Across Naruto strait it bordered Awaji Province too. Administratively it was included as a part of Nankaidō. It was settled in the 7th century and originally consisted of the northeastern part of Shikoku and Awaku Islands on the Inland Sea.
Sanuki's ancient capital is believed to have been near modern Sakaide, but has not been discovered. Takamatsu developed as the main seat of the province in the Middle Ages. 
In the Classical Period, Sanuki was famous for its associations with the Buddhist monk, Kūkai, as both his birthplace and early upbringing.  Later, the famed poet Sugawara no Michizane served as governor of the province from 886 to 890 under the Ritsuryō Codes.
In the Sengoku Period, Sanuki was ruled by the Miyoshi clan. The Miyoshi were invaded by Chōsokabe clan in Tosa Province and lost Sanuki province. Finally Chōsokabe lost a battle against Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Sanuki was given to his men. 
In the Edo Period, Sanuki was divided into five; three han in Takamatsu, Marugame, Tadotsu, the Shōgun's direct holding and a part of Tsuyama han whose mainland was on Honshū. Naoshima and Shōdoshima was separated from Bizen Province and merged into Sanuki Province.

[[Atlasov Island]]

CATEGORIES: Kuril Islands, Stratovolcanoes, Active volcanoes, Uninhabited islands of Russia

Atlasov Island, known in Russian as Ostrov Atlasova (Остров Атласова), or in Japanese as Araido (阿頼度島), is the northernmost island and volcano and also the highest volcano of the Kuril islands, part of the Sakhalin Oblast in Russia. The Russian name is sometimes rendered in English as Atlasova Island. Other names for the island include Uyakhuzhach, Oyakoba and Alaid, the name of the volcano on the island.
The island is named after Vladimir Atlasov, a 17th-century Russian explorer who incorporated the nearby Kamchatka Peninsula into Russia. It is essentially the cone of a submarine volcano called Vulkan Alaid protruding above the Sea of Okhotsk to a height of 2,339 m (7,672 ft). The island has an area of 119 km² (46 sq mi), but is currently uninhabited. Numerous pyroclastic cones dot the lower flanks of basaltic to basaltic andesite volcano, particularly on the NW and SE sides, including an offshore cone formed during the 1933–34 eruption.[tpl]cite gvp|vnum=0900-39=|title=Alaid[/tpl]
Its near perfect shape gave rise to many legends about the volcano among the peoples of the region, such as the Itelmens and Kuril Ainu. The Russian scientist Stepan Krasheninnikov was told the story that it was once a mountain in Kamchatka, but the neighbouring mountains became jealous of its beauty and exiled it to the sea, leaving behind Kurile Lake in southern Kamchatka. Geographically, this story is not without evidence, as after the last Ice Age most of the icecaps melted, raising the world's water level, and possibly submerging a landbridge to the volcano.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Following the transfer of the Kuril Islands to Japan by the Treaty of St Petersburg, 1875, Oyakoba as it is called by the Japanese, became the northernmost island of the empire and subject of much aesthetic praise, described in haiku, ukiyo-e, etc.
Ito Osamu (1926) described it as more exquisitely shaped than Mount Fuji.
Administratively this island belongs to the Sakhalin Oblast of the Russian Federation.

[[Phut]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of ancient Egypt, Hebrew Bible nations, Ham (son of Noah), Hebrew Bible people

Phut or Put (Hebrew:  פוט [tpl]Unicode|pûṭ[/tpl]; Septuagint Greek Φουδ Phoud) is the third son of Ham (one of the sons of Noah), in the biblical Table of Nations (Genesis 10:6; cf. 1 Chronicles 1:8).  
The Persian historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (c. 915) recounts a tradition that the wife of Put was named Bakht, a daughter of Batawil son of Tiras, and that she bore him the "Copts". 
The name Put (or Phut) is also used in the Bible for the people or nation said to be descended from him, usually placed in Ancient Libya, but connections are sometimes proposed with the Land of Punt[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Sadler, Jr. |encyclopedia=The New Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible |first=Rodney |editor=Katharine Sakenfeld |publisher=Abingdon Press |volume=4 |location=Nashville |pages=691-92|title=Put |year=2009 [/tpl] known from Ancient Egyptian annals. 
Josephus writes: "Phut also was the founder of Libya, and called the inhabitants Phutites (Phoutes), from himself: there is also a river in the country of Moors which bears that name; whence it is that we may see the greatest part of the Grecian historiographers mention that river and the adjoining country by the appellation of Phut (Phoute): but the name it has now has been by change given it from one of the sons of Mezraim, who was called Lybyos." (AotJ Book 1:6/2).  Pliny the Elder Nat. Hist. 5.1 and Ptolemy Geog. iv.1.3 both place the river Phuth on the west side of Mauretania (modern Morocco). Ptolemy also mentions a city Putea in Libya (iv.3.39).
A Libyan connection has likewise been inferred from Nahum 3:9, where it is said that "Put and Lubim" were the helpers of Egypt. Other biblical verses consistently refer to the descendants of Put as warriors. In Jeremiah 46:9, they are again described as being supporters of Egypt. Ezekiel mentions them three times - in 27:10, as supporters of Tyre (Phoenicia), in 30:5 again as supporting Egypt, and in 38:5, as supporters of Gog. The Septuagint Greek (LXX) substitutes Libues in Ezekiel where the Hebrew Bible refers to Put.  However, the LXX reads Put in Isaiah 66:19, in place of Pul in the Hebrew. 
The Libyan tribe of pỉdw shows up in Egyptian records by the 22nd dynasty, while a Ptolemaic text from Edfu refers to the [tpl]Unicode|t3 n nꜣ pỉt.w[/tpl] "the land of the Pitu". The word was later written in Demotic as Pỉt, and as Phaiat in Coptic, a name for Libya Aegypti, northwestern Egypt.
A fragment of Nebuchadnezzar II's annals mentions his campaign in 567 in Egypt, and defeating the soldiers of Putu Yavan, i.e. Greek Libya (Cyrene). A multilingual stele from al-Kabrīt, dating to the reign of Darius I refers to the Put as the province of Putiya (Old Persian) and [tpl]unicode|Puṭa[/tpl] (Neo-Babylonian), where the equivalent text written in Egyptian has [tpl]Unicode|tꜣ ṯmḥw[/tpl] "Libya".

[[Gene regulatory network]]

CATEGORIES: Gene expression, Networks, Systems biology

A gene regulatory network or genetic regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of DNA segments in a cell which
interact with each other indirectly (through their RNA and protein expression products) and with other substances in the cell, thereby governing the expression levels of mRNA and proteins.
In general, each mRNA molecule goes on to make a specific protein (or set of proteins). In some cases this protein will be structural, and will accumulate at the cell membrane or within the cell to give it particular structural properties. In other cases the protein will be an enzyme, i.e., a micro-machine that catalyses a certain reaction, such as the breakdown of a food source or toxin. Some proteins though serve only to activate other genes, and these are the transcription factors that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades. By binding to the promoter region at the start of other genes they turn them on, initiating the production of another protein, and so on. Some transcription factors are inhibitory.
In single-celled organisms, regulatory networks respond to the external environment, optimising the cell at a given time for survival in this environment. Thus a yeast cell, finding itself in a sugar solution, will turn on genes to make enzymes that process the sugar to alcohol.[tpl]cite web |title=Transcriptional Regulatory Networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae |publisher=Young Lab |url= http://web.wi.mit.edu/young/regulator_network/[/tpl] This process, which we associate with wine-making, is how the yeast cell makes its living, gaining energy to multiply, which under normal circumstances would enhance its survival prospects.
In multicellular animals the same principle has been put in the service of gene cascades that control body-shape.[tpl]cite journal |author=Davidson E, Levin M |title=Gene regulatory networks |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=102 |issue=14 |pages=4935 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15809445 |pmc=556010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0502024102 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/102/14/4935[/tpl] Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of morphogen gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and diffuses[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other morphogens that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling controls embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through feedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make structural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs.
It has been suggested that, because biological molecular interactions are intrinsically stochastic, gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause (i.e. cellular Darwinism). However, recent experimental evidence has favored the attractor view of cell fates.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

[[Gaius Servilius Ahala]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman generals, 5th-century BC Romans, Ancient Roman assassins, Ancient Roman Masters of the Horse

Gaius Servilius Structus Ahala  was a 5th-century BC politician of ancient Rome, considered by many later writers to have been a hero. His fame rested on the contention that he saved Rome from Spurius Maelius in 439 BC by killing him with a dagger concealed under an armpit. This may be less historical fact and more etiological myth, invented to explain the Servilian cognomen "Ahala"/"Axilla", which means "armpit" and is probably of Etruscan origin.[tpl]Citation  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Ahala, C.

As related by Livy and others, Ahala served as magister equitum in 439 BC, when Cincinnatus was appointed dictator on the supposition that Spurius Maelius was styling himself a king and plotting against the state.  During the night on which the dictator was appointed, the capitol and all the strong posts were garrisoned by the partisans of the patricians. In the morning, when the people assembled in the forum, with Spurius Maelius among them, Ahala summoned the latter to appear before the dictator; and upon Maelius disobeying and taking refuge in the crowd, Ahala rushed into the throng and killed him.Livy, iv. 13, 14Joannes Zonaras, vii. 20Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Exc. Mai, i. p. 3
This is mentioned by several later writers as an example of ancient Roman heroism, and is frequently referred to by Cicero in terms of the highest admiration;Cicero, Catiline Orations 1, Pro Milone 3, Cato Maior de Senectute 16 but was regarded as a case of murder at the time.  Ahala was brought to trial, and only escaped condemnation by going into voluntary exile.Valerius Maximus, v. 3. § 2Cicero, De re publica i. 3, pro Dom. 32  Livy passes over this, and only mentions that a bill was brought in three years afterwards, in 436 BC, by another Spurius Maelius, a tribune, for confiscating the property of Ahala, but that it failed.Livy, iv. 21
A representation of Ahala is given on a coin of Marcus Junius Brutus, the murderer of Julius Caesar, but we cannot suppose it to be anything more than an imaginary likeness. Brutus claimed (perhaps baselessly) that he was descended from Lucius Junius Brutus, the first consul, on his father's side, and from Ahala on his mother's, and thus was sprung from two tyrannicides.Comp. Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum xiii. 40  The head of Brutus on the annexed coin is therefore intended to represent the first consul.
Plutarch says, in his life of Brutus, that Brutus' mother Servilia was a descendant of Servilius Ahala, and the ancestral example was an inspiration for his assassination of Julius Caesar.

[tpl]nihongo|Metroid Fusion|メトロイドフュージョン[/tpl] is an action-adventure video game published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in North America, Europe, and Australia in November 2002, and in Japan in February 2003. The game is considered to be the fourth main installment in the Metroid series; the intro alternatively refers to the game as Metroid 4. Metroid Fusion was developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1, the same development team that created the previous Super Metroid, to which Metroid Fusion bears heavy resemblance.
Chronologically, Metroid Fusion is the latest in the Metroid series. The story centers on bounty hunter Samus Aran, who is sent by the Galactic Federation to the Biologic Space Laboratories space station to investigate an explosion. There, she learns that the station is swarming with organisms infected with X Parasites, virions that can replicate their hosts' physical appearances and memories, killing them afterward. Learning that the Galactic Federation plans to capture the X Parasites for further study, Samus must destroy the space station to protect the Federation from the underestimated destructive power of the X Parasites.
The game was given near-universal acclaim, receiving an aggregated score of 92 out of 100 from Metacritic. Praise focused on the action-oriented gameplay, while criticism targeted towards the focus on objective based gameplay, thus making the game more linear compared to Super Metroid. Metroid Fusion received several awards, including Handheld Game of the Year at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards, Best Game Boy Advance Adventure Game from IGN, and Best Action Game on Game Boy Advance from GameSpot. In the United States, the game sold 199,723 copies in its first month with revenues of $5,590,768, making it the month's tenth bestselling game. By August 2006, 940,000 copies of the game were sold in North America, while by November 2004, 155,000 units were sold in Japan.
During the Nintendo Direct on February 13, 2014, Nintendo announced Metroid Fusion would be among the first three Game Boy Advance games to be released on the Wii U's Virtual Console; the game was released for the service on April 3, 2014.[tpl]cite web|last=Hinkle|first=David|title=Wii U Virtual Console gets first Game Boy Advance games in April|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/02/13/wii-u-virtual-console-gets-first-game-boy-advance-games-in-april/|work=Joystiq[/tpl]

[[Lepelstraat]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in North Brabant

Lepelstraat ˈleːpəɫstraːt is a small Dutch community six kilometres north of the city of Bergen op Zoom, and part of the municipality with that name.
It has 2,342 inhabitants and 30 percent of the municipality consists of farmland. Its earliest records of history date back to 1298 where in a manuscript of landrights it was mentioned as "Den Leepel Straet."
Lepelstraat has always been important in its region's religious history. In 1612 a little church was created in the attic of a farmhouse that was kept from the knowledge of authorities because Roman Catholicism was forbidden at that time. Even though this situation changed later in the 17th century, it existed until 1875 when Lepelstraat got its first real church, with a tower having a height of 68 metres. This tower was blown up near the end of World War II by retreating German troops and has never been rebuilt.
During the Netherlands' "Great Flood" in 1953 most of the land around Lepelstraat became flooded, costing almost two thousand lives. The water did not reach Lepelstraat itself, making it a safe haven for the unlucky people who lost their homes, friends, and families.

In computer science, a lookup table is an array that replaces runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation. The savings in terms of processing time can be significant, since retrieving a value from memory is often faster than undergoing an 'expensive' computation or input/output operation.http://apl.jhu.edu/~paulmac/c++-memoization.html The tables may be precalculated  and stored in static program storage, calculated (or "pre-fetched") as part of a program's initialization phase (memoization), or even stored in hardware in application-specific platforms. Lookup tables are also used extensively to validate input values by matching against a list of valid (or invalid) items in an array and, in some programming languages, may include pointer functions (or offsets to labels) to process the matching input.

[[Secretary of State for the Environment]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of government ministers of the United Kingdom

The Secretary of State for the Environment was a UK cabinet position, responsible for the Department of the Environment (DoE). This was created by Edward Heath as a combination of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Public Building and Works on 15 October 1970. Thus it managed a mixed portfolio of issues: housing and planning, local government, public buildings, environmental protection and, initially, transport - James Callaghan gave transport its own department again in 1976. It has been asserted that during the Thatcher government the DoE led the drive towards centralism, and the undermining of local government.Peter Hennessy, Whitehall p.439 Particularly, the concept of 'inner cities policy', often involving centrally negotiated public-private partnerships and centrally appointed development corporations, which moved control of many urban areas to the centre, and away from their, often left-wing, local authorities.
In 1997, when Labour came to power, the DoE was merged with the Department of Transport to form the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), thus, essentially, restoring the DoE to its initial 1970 portfolio. The titular mention of 'the Regions' referred to the government's pledge to create regional government. In the wake of the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, the environmental protection elements of the DETR were split of and merged with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), to form the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Meanwhile, the transport, housing and planning, and local and regional government aspects went to a new Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR). A year later the DTLR also split, with transport getting its own department and the rest going to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

The Democratic Social Movement (DIKKI, Greek: ΔΗΚΚΙ, Δημοκρατικό Κοινωνικό Κίνημα, Dimokratiko Koinoniko Kinima) is a Greek democratic socialist political party. The party was founded in 1995 by Dimitris Tsovolas and several ex-members of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the then ruling social-democratic party.
In the 1996 legislative election, DIKKI received 4.43% of the vote and 9 seats in the Hellenic Parliament. In the 1999 election to the European Parliament, the party received 6.85% of the vote and 2 seats in the European Parliament, and was a full member of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left group.GUE/NGL Site 
After these initial successes, however, DIKKI failed to elect members to the Hellenic Parliament on two consecutive elections; it received 2.69% of the vote in the 2000 legislative election and 1.8% of the vote in the 2004 legislative election. 
After the 2004 election, Tsovolas unilaterally decided to dissolve DIKKI and give the party possessions away to the Greek state. That decision led to a conflict between the party leader and the National Committee, who voted against the dissolvement; there are accusations that Tsovolas went through these actions, because he was planning to be readmitted in PASOK in the near future.P. Mantas, ''Tsovolas expelled his history on his own The National Committee went to law and the court ruled that the party is legally administered by the national executive bodies, thus it cannot cease to exist unless the National Congress or the National Committee takes such decision.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl] The party possessions were returned and Tsovolas was expelled.
In the local elections of 2006 DIKKI supported many tickets led by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), and numerous party members (for the size of the party) were elected in local councils. Moreover, DIKKI participated in All Workers Militant Front (PAME), a trade unionist coordination centre closely related with KKE. Although it was expected that co-operation between the two parties would become permanent, on August 22, 2007 DIKKI announced that it was participating in the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA),DIKKI press release which received 5.04% of the vote in the legislative election held on September 16, 2007.

[[ATX]]
CATEGORIES: Motherboard form factors, IBM PC compatibles

ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) is a motherboard form factor specification developed by Intel in 1995 to improve on previous de facto standards like the AT form factor. It was the first major change in desktop computer enclosure, motherboard and power supply design in many years, improving standardization and interchangeability of parts. The specification defines the key mechanical dimensions, mounting point, I/O panel, power and connector interfaces between a computer case, a motherboard and a power supply. With the improvements it offered, including lower costs, ATX overtook AT completely as the default form factor for new systems within a few years. ATX addressed many of the AT form factors annoyances that had frustrated system builders. Other standards for smaller boards (including microATX, FlexATX and mini-ITX) usually keep the basic rear layout but reduce the size of the board and the number of expansion slots. In 2003, Intel announced the BTX standard, intended as a replacement for ATX. [tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], the ATX form factor remains a standard for do-it-yourselfers; BTX has however made inroads into pre-made systems. This[tpl]clarify|date=January 2013[/tpl] was designed to solve the problems in BAT and LPX motherboards.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The official specifications were released by Intel in 1995 and have been revised numerous times since. The most recent ATX motherboard specification is version 2.2.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.formfactors.org/developer/specs/atx2_2.pdf |title=ATX Specification - Version 2.2 |author= |format=PDF |website= |publisher= |accessdate=April 4, 2014[/tpl] The most recent ATX12V power supply unit specification is 2.31,

The Hereford Gospels (Hereford, Hereford Cathedral Library, MS P. I. 2) is an 8th-century illuminated manuscript Gospel Book in insular script minuscule script, with large illuminated initials in the Insular style. 
The manuscript was likely produced either in Wales (like the Ricemarch Psalter and possibly the Lichfield Gospels) or in the West Country of England near the Welsh border.Richard Gameson, "The Hereford Gospels," from Hereford Cathedral: A History (London, 2000), pgs. 536-543. Gameson himself argues for the Welsh origin of the manuscript, but acknowledges that west England is a possible but less likely location of origin. 
Like other Insular manuscripts, the decoration has features relating to pre-Christian Celtic art, featuring spirals, tri-partite divisions of circles, common in the La Tene style, as well as Germanic and Mediterranean elements. 
It is now housed in Hereford Cathedral in the largest surviving "chained library". (A library in which the books are chained down, so as to prevent theft.)

[[Aachtopf]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Baden-Württemberg, Springs of Germany, Caves of Germany, Danube basin, Karst springs

The [tpl]Audio|Aachtopf.ogg|Aachtopf[/tpl] is Germany's biggest natural spring, producing an average of 8,500 litres per second. Production varies seasonally and in response to the weather, but the spring never runs dry. The Aachtopf is a karst spring which is located south of the western end of the Swabian Jura, near the town Aach. 
The name Aachtopf is compounded from Aach (meaning water in Old High German); the name of the river created by the spring is in full the Radolfzeller Aach. Topf can be translated as bowl and is commonly used for round, bowl-shaped springs. The Radolfzeller Aach flows southward into Lake Constance, which empties into the Rhine.
The spring marks the southern end of a cave system which transports water from the western end of the Swabian Jura. Most of the water is derived from the River Danube and is obtained where the latter river disappears underground at the Donauversickerung (Danube Sinkhole) near Immendingen and Fridingen. Strangely, the Danube flows eastwards into the Black Sea, whereas the Rhine flows northwards to the North Sea. Therefore the water of the Aach flows under the European continental divide. This is a relatively common feature of karst stream captures.
The karst spring is connected to a huge cave, which runs northwards. The cave is completely water-filled and can only be explored by cave divers. The first exploration was made by Jochen Hasenmayer, a famous German cave diver. Unfortunately, a collapse blocks the cave after a few hundred metres. The cave may continue for several kilometres beyond the other
side of the blockage. A local caving club was formed to find this "lost cave segment" by digging a shaft behind the collapse. At present, a continuation of the cave has not been found.
The Aachtopf is a favourite weekend destination and very romantic. It is not possible to see the cave because it is underwater and cave diving is extremely dangerous.

CATEGORIES: Lists of government ministers of the United Kingdom, Health in the United Kingdom, Health ministers, National Health Service, Current ministerial offices in the United Kingdom, Secretaries of State for Health (UK)

Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Health is a UK cabinet position responsible for the Department of Health. Since devolution in 1999, the position holder's responsibility for the health service is mainly restricted to England, with the holder's counterparts in Scotland and Wales responsible for the NHS in those countries. Prior to devolution the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales had those respective responsibilities but the Department of Health had a larger role than now in the co-ordination of health policy across Great Britain. Health services in Northern Ireland have always had separate arrangements from the rest of the UK, and are currently the responsibility of the Health Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive.
The first Boards of Health were created by Orders in Council dated 21 June 14 November, and 21 November 1831. In 1848 a General Board of Health was created with the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests as its President. In 1854 this Board was reconstituted and the President appointed separately. However, the Board was abolished in 1858 and its function of overseeing the local boards was  transferred to a new Local Government Act Office within the Home Office. From 1871 that function was transferred to the new  Local Government Board.
The Ministry of Health was created in 1919 as a reconstruction of the Local Government Board.  Local government functions were eventually transferred to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, leaving the Health Ministry in charge of Health proper.
From 1968 it was amalgamated with the Ministry of Social Security under the Secretary of State for Social Services, until a de-merger of the Department of Health and Social Security on 25 July 1988.

[[Political parties in Belgium]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of political parties by country, Political parties in Belgium, Belgium politics-related lists

Belgium is a federal state with a multi-party political system, with numerous parties who factually have no chance of gaining power alone, and therefore must work with each other to form coalition governments.
Almost all Belgian political parties are divided into linguistic groups, either Dutch-speaking parties (see also political parties in Flanders), Francophone parties or Germanophone parties. 
The Flemish parties operate in Flanders and in the Brussels-Capital Region. The Francophone parties operate in Wallonia and in the Brussels-Capital Region. There are also parties operating in the comparatively small German-speaking community.  No party family has a realistic chance of winning enough seats to govern alone, let alone win an outright majority.
Political parties are thus organised along community lines, especially for the three main communities. There are no representative parties active in both communities. Even in Brussels, all parties presenting candidates are either Flemish parties, or French-speaking. As such, the internal organisation of the political parties reflects the fundamentally dual nature of Belgian society.
There are no significant parties left who exist, or operate on a national, Belgian level.
From the creation of the Belgian state in 1830 and throughout most of the 19th century, two political parties dominated Belgian politics: the Catholic Party (Church-oriented and conservative) and the Liberal Party (anti-clerical and progressive). In the late 19th century the Labour Party arose to represent the emerging industrial working class. These three groups still dominate Belgian politics, but they have evolved substantially in character.

[[Royal Armouries Ms. I.33]]

CATEGORIES: 14th-century illuminated manuscripts, Combat treatises, Historical European martial arts, Swordsmanship

Royal Armouries Ms. I.33  (also known as "the Tower manuscript" because it was kept in the Tower of London during 1950-1996; also referred to as British Museum No. 14 E iii, No. 20, D. vi) is the earliest known surviving European fechtbuch (combat manual), and one of the oldest surviving martial arts manuals dealing with armed combat worldwide.There are some passing references to armed combat in ancient treatises on warfare, e.g. in Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus. There are also long lists of weapons in early medieval Indian texts such as the Agni Purana, but no systematic treatise on fighting technique. Technical descriptions of Chinese martial arts which survive from the Han Dynasty (such as the Six Chapters of Hand Fighting, 1st century) are on unarmed combat exclusively. The 13th-century Indian Malla Purana is also on unarmed combat. Technical descriptions of armed fighting in Asia date to the 16th century or later (e.g. the 16th-century Korean Ji Xiao Xin Shu, the 17th-century Japanese The Book of Five Rings).
It was created around 1300 in Franconia and It remained in a Franconian monastery (presumably in Eastern Franconia) until the mid-16th century. It is first mentioned by Henricus a Gunterrodt in his De veriis principiis artis dimicatoriae of 1579, where he reports it to have been acquired (looted) by a friend of his, one Johannes Herbart of Würzburg when serving in the force of Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach  in the campaigns of 1552/3.
From the 17th century, the manuscript was part of the ducal library of Gotha (signature Cod. Membr. I. no. 115) until it disappeared in World War II and resurfaced at a Sotheby's auction in 1950, where it was purchased by the Royal Armouries. The author of the treatise may be a cleric called Lutegerus (viz. a Latinised form of the German proper name Liutger).
The 32 parchment folia (64 pages) of the treatise expound a martial arts system of defensive and offensive techniques between a master and a pupil, referred to as sacerdos (priest) and scolaris (student), each armed with a sword and a buckler, drawn in ink and watercolour and accompanied with Latin text, interspersed with German fencing terms. On the last two pages, the pupil is replaced by a woman called Walpurgis.
The date of the manuscript is variously given as late 13th century or as  early 14th century, with a consensus range of about 1290-1320.The manuscript is dated to the "late 13th century" in the description by Royal Armouries. Alphonse Lhotsky in a handwritten note suggested the late 13th century and identified the scribe as a secretary to the bishop of Würzburg.
The Latin text of the manuscript is written in a clerical hand, using the various sigla which were standard at the time (but which fell out of use at the end of the medieval period; an image from the manuscript (the second image on fol 26r) was copied into Codex Guelf 125.16.Extrav. in the 1600s by a draughtsman who under his drawing stated that he could not decipher the Latin text).

The Portuguese Communist Party ([tpl]lang-pt|Partido Comunista Português[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|pɐɾˈtidu kumuˈniʃtɐ puɾtuˈɡeʃ|pron[/tpl], PCP) is a major left-wing political party in Portugal. It is a Marxist-Leninist party, and its organization is based upon democratic centralism. The party also considers itself to be patriotic and internationalist.Portuguese Communist Party (2005). Program and Statutes of the Portuguese Communist Party. Edições Avante!. ISBN 972-550-307-4
The party was founded in 1921 as the Portuguese section of the Communist International (Comintern). Made illegal after a coup in the late 1920s, the PCP played a major role in the opposition to the dictatorial regime of António de Oliveira Salazar. During the five-decades-long dictatorship, the party was constantly suppressed by the political police, the PIDE, which forced its members to live in clandestine status under the threat of arrest, torture, and murder. After the bloodless Carnation Revolution in 1974, which overthrew the 48-year regime, the 36 members of party's Central Committee had, in the aggregate, experienced more than 300 years in jail.Cunhal, Álvaro (1997). O caminho para o derrubamento do fascismo. Edições Avante!. ISBN 972-550-262-0
After the end of the dictatorship, the party became a major political force in the newly democratic state, mainly among the working class. Despite being less influential since the fall of the Socialist bloc in eastern Europe, the party still enjoys popularity in large sectors of Portuguese society, particularly in the rural areas of the Alentejo and Ribatejo, and in the heavily industrialized areas around Lisbon and Setúbal, where it holds the leadership of several municipalities.Câmaras Municipais de Presidência CDU, Portuguese Communist Party, URL accessed 20 June 2006
The Party publishes the weekly Avante!, founded in 1931. Its youth organization is the Portuguese Communist Youth, a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

The year 2003 was an exciting one for new scientific discoveries, technological breakthroughs and progress in many scientific fields. Some of the highlights of 2003, which will be further discussed below, include: the anthropologic discovery of 350,000 year-old footprints attesting to the presence of upright-walking humans; SpaceShipOne flight 11P making its first supersonic flight; the observation of a previously unknown element, ununpentium was made; and the world’s first digital camera with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display is released by Kodak.
The year 2003 is also notable for the disintegration of the Columbia Space Shuttle upon its re-entry into earth’s atmosphere, a tragic disaster which took the lives of all seven astronauts on board; the Concorde jet made its last flight, bringing to an end the era of civilian supersonic travel, at least for the time being; and the death of Edward Teller, physicist and inventor of the hydrogen bomb.

The  Catholic Monarchs ([tpl]lang-es|Reyes Católicos[/tpl])"Reyes Católicos" is literally "Catholic Kings" rather than "Monarchs", and is sometimes incorrectly so rendered in English; but in Spanish it is usual for the masculine plural to be used in an essentially gender-indifferent way, so for example it is usual in Spanish to call the children of a person or couple "hijos", literally sons, regardless of actual gender, while in English "sons", and "kings", are exclusively masculine. is the joint title used in history for Queen Isabella I of Castile[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08177a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Isabella I |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-10-01 |accessdate=2014-03-01[/tpl] and King Ferdinand II of Aragon.  They were both from the House of Trastámara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger. Their marriage united both crowns under the same family. John Elliot and many other historians consider that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, but newer historical opinions recognize that under their rule Spain was still a composite monarchy. Castile and Aragon remained largely separate entities for decades to come. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local feudal lords.
The title of "Catholic King and Queen" was bestowed on them by Pope Alexander VI in 1496, for defending Catholic dogmas within their realms.
"Catholic monarchs" or "kings" can also be used in a generic sense (e.g., "the Pope had authority over Catholic monarchs..."); the particular or generic use can be distinguished from the context.

[[Little Bustard]]
CATEGORIES: Birds of Asia, Birds of Europe, Otididae, Birds of Ukraine

The Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) is a large bird in the bustard family, the only member of the genus Tetrax. It breeds in southern Europe and in western and central Asia. Southernmost European birds are mainly resident, but other populations migrate further south in winter. The central European population once breeding in the grassland of Hungary went extinct several decades ago.
This species is declining due to habitat loss throughout its range. It used to breed more widely, for example ranging north to Poland occasionally (Tomek & Bocheński 2005). It is only a very rare vagrant to Great Britain despite breeding in France.
Although the smallest Palearctic bustard, Little Bustard is still pheasant-sized at [tpl]convert|42|–|45|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long with a [tpl]convert|90|–|110|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] wingspan and a weight of [tpl]convert|830|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl].British Trust for Ornithology-Little Bustard 2011 In flight, the long wings are extensively white. The breeding male is brown above and white below, with a grey head and a black neck bordered above and below by white.
The female and non-breeding male lack the dramatic neck pattern, and the female is marked darker below than the male. Immature bustards resemble females. Both sexes are usually silent, although the male has a distinctive "raspberry-blowing" call: prrt.
This species is omnivorous, taking seeds, insects, rodents and reptiles. Like other bustards, the male Little Bustard has a flamboyant display with foot stamping and leaping in the air. Females lay 3 to 5 eggs on the ground.
This bird's habitat is open grassland and undisturbed cultivation, with plants tall enough for cover. It has a stately slow walk, and tends to run when disturbed rather than fly. It is gregarious, especially in winter.
On December 20, 2013, the Cypriot newspapers 'Fileleftheros' and 'Politis', as well as news website 'SigmaLive', reported the discovery of a dead Little Bustard in the United Nations Buffer Zone. The bird had been shot by poachers hunting illegally in the zone. The shooting was particularly controversial amongst conservationists and birders since the Little Bustard is a very rare visitor to Cyprus and had not been officially recorded in Cyprus since December 1979.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/84580 |title=Καταγγελία για πυροβολισμό σπάνιου πουλιού στη νεκρή ζώνη |website=http://www.sigmalive.com/  |author= |date=December 19, 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2014 |language=Greek |trans_title=Complaint about shooting of rare birds in the buffer zone[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://cyprusbirdingtours.com/2013/12/04/little-bustard-cyprus-4th-december-2013/ |title=Little Bustard, Cyprus, 4th December 2013 |author= |website=cyprusbirdingtours.com |date=December 4, 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://cyprusbirdingtours.com/2013/12/17/little-bustard-shot/ |title=Little Bustard Shot |author= |website=cyprusbirdingtours.com |date=December 17, 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2014[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Lists of government ministers of the United Kingdom, Current ministerial offices in the United Kingdom

Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is a post in the British Cabinet, responsible for the Department for Work and Pensions.  It was created on 8 June 2001 by the merger of the Employment division of the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Social Security.
The Ministry of Pensions was created in 1916 to handle the payment of war pensions to former members of the Armed Forces and their dependants. In 1944 a separate Ministry of National Insurance (initially titled the Ministry of Social Insurance, it changed its name on 17 November 1944) was formed; the two merged in 1953 as the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. In 1966 the Ministry was renamed the Ministry of Social Security, but this was short-lived, as the Ministry merged with the Ministry of Health in 1968 to form the Department of Health and Social Security. Confusingly, the Secretary of State responsible for this Department was titled the Secretary of State for Social Services. The Department was de-merged in 1988, creating the separate Department of Health and Department of Social Security.

Cronyism is partiality to long-standing friends, especially by appointing them to positions of authority, regardless of their qualifications. Hence, cronyism is contrary in practice and principle to meritocracy.
Cronyism exists when the appointer and the beneficiary are in social contact; often, the appointer is inadequate to hold his or her own job or position of authority, and for this reason the appointer appoints individuals who will not try to weaken him or her, or express views contrary to those of the appointer. Politically, "cronyism" is derogatorily used.[tpl]cite news|title=Government Cronyism is Back|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2012/03/12/daniel-garza-government-cronyism-is-back/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Daniel Garza|date=March 12, 2012[/tpl]

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) was a United Kingdom government department created by the Board of Agriculture Act 1889 and at that time called the Board of Agriculture, and then from 1903 the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and from 1919 the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. It attained its final name in 1955 with the addition of responsibilities for the British food industry to the existing responsibilities for agriculture and the fishing industry, a name that lasted until the Ministry was dissolved in 2002, at which point its responsibilities had been merged into the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
On its renaming as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1955, it was responsible for agriculture, fisheries and food. Until the Food Standards Agency was created, it was responsible for both food production and food safety, which was seen by some to give rise to a conflict of interest. MAFF was widely criticised for its handling of the outbreak of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (more widely known as Mad Cow Disease) and later the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001.
It was the last Ministry of the United Kingdom government not to be a Department of State.The Ministry of Defence continues to be known as a Ministry although it has been a Department since the 1960s, and similarly the Ministry of Justice is a Department. It was merged with the part of the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions that dealt with the environment (and with a small part of the Home Office) to create a new government department, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in 2001. MAFF was formally dissolved on 27 March 2002, when the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/794) came into force.

It would have included the enslavement, expulsion or extermination of most Slavic peoples in Europe. The plan, prepared in the years 1939–1942, was based on the policy of Lebensraum designed by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi movement, as well as being a fulfillment of the Drang nach Osten ([tpl]lang-en|Drive towards the East[/tpl]) ideology of German expansion to the east.

The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions was a UK Cabinet position created in 1997, with responsibility for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR).www.archive.official-documents.co.uk
The position and department were created for John Prescott by merging the positions and responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Environment, the Secretary of State for Transport and some other functions. Frank Dobson, who had been Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment prior to the 1997 general election, was made Secretary of State for Health, while Andrew Smith, who had been Shadow Secretary of State for Transport, was made a junior minister at the Department for Education and Employment. Michael Meacher, who had been Shadow Minister for Environmental Protection within the Shadow Cabinet, was given the non-cabinet position of Minister of State for the Environment and attended cabinet meetings where the Environment was discussed,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6385545.stm and a position of Minister of State for Transport was similarly created, initially held by Gavin Strang.
In June 2001, the department was renamed the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR), with the Environment portfolio being merged with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food into the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. All departments were given their own Secretaries of State. In May 2002, the Local Government and the Regions portfolios were separated from Transport and given to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which in turn became the Department for Communities and Local Government in May 2006.

Operation Tannenberg ([tpl]lang-de|Unternehmen Tannenberg[/tpl]) was the codename for one of the extermination actions directed at the Polish people during World War II, part of the Generalplan Ost. Conscription lists (Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen), prepared by Germans before the war, identified more than 61,000 members of the Polish elite: activists, intelligentsia, scholars, actors, former officers, and others, who were to be interned or shot. Members of the German minority living in Poland assisted in preparing the lists.
The plan was created in May 1939. Following the orders of Adolf Hitler, a special unit dubbed Tannenberg was created within the Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt). It commanded a number of Einsatzgruppen der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD formed with Gestapo, Kripo and SD officers who were theoretically subordinate to local Wehrmacht commanders. Their task was to arrest all the people listed on the proscription lists prepared before the outbreak of World War II. 
First, in August 1939 about 2,000 activists of Polish minority organisations in Germany were arrested and murdered. The second part of the action began on September 1, 1939, and ended in October, resulting in at least 20,000 deaths in 760 mass executions by Einsatzgruppen special task units with some help from regular Wehrmacht (armed forces) units. In addition, a special formation was created from the German minority living in Poland called Selbstschutz, whose members had trained in Germany before the war in diversion and guerilla fighting (see: Deutscher Volksverband, the German People's Union in Poland). The formation was responsible for many massacres and due to its bad reputation was dissolved by Nazi authorities after the September Campaign.

The Left ([tpl]lang-lb|Déi Lénk[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fr|La Gauche[/tpl], [tpl]lang-de|Die Linke[/tpl]) is a democratic socialist political party in Luxembourg. The Left was formed on 30 January 1999 by a group of like minded activists, many of them affiliated with existing political parties, notably the Communist Party of Luxembourg (KPL), the New Left, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), and the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP). One of the aims of this new organisation was to present a further leftist alternative to social democracy.
In the 1999 national elections, the Left won 3.3% of the votes and one seat in the parliament; André Hoffmann was elected from the southern constituency. In 2000, after anticipated elections in the city of Esch sur Alzette, Hoffmann became deputy mayor and Aloyse Bisdorff (KPL) succeeded him in parliament. Then, in 2002, in accordance with the Left's statutes, Bisdorff resigned from parliament and was succeeded by Serge Urbany.
Later, however, a dispute arose between a number of members of the Communist Party and the majority of the Left. As a consequence, the KPL and the Left ran separate lists in the 2004 elections. The Left won 1.9% of the votes, and accordingly lost its parliamentary presence. In the 2009 elections, it increased its share of the vote to 3.3%. As a result, Hoffmann returned to Parliament as the Left's sole representative - Hoffmann's personal vote of 9,067 in the south constituency was almost equal to the total number of votes gathered by the Communist Party, which won 10,803 votes.[tpl]cite web |first=Éric |last=Netgen|title=Empire of the Census |url=http://le-jeudi.editpress.lu/Forum/1659.html|work=Le Jeudi|date=2009-06-11|accessdate=2009-06-27[/tpl]
The Left is associated with the European United Left–Nordic Green Left group in the European Parliament. It does not currently have any members in the parliament, however. The party participates both in the European Anticapitalist Left and the Party of the European Left.

In essence, the party is communist; according to the programme of the party, the LSP was founded as an organization upholding socialist ideas after the 1991 events that the party describes as a 'counter-revolutionary bourgeois-nationalist coup'.http://www.latsocpartija.lv/userfiles/LSP%20programma%202005%20RU%281%29.pdf
The current president of the party is Alfrēds Rubiks, once mayor of Riga and later leader of the unionist movement and head of the Latvian Communist Party (CPSU platform). He was imprisoned for six years in 1991 on charges of participating in a coup d'état against the Latvian authorities in August 1991. He is not one of the party's members in the Saeima (Latvian Parliament) since he is not allowed to contest elections. However, his son Artūrs Rubiks is a member of Saeima, representing the Socialist Party.
The LSP is more popular among the Russian-speaking population of Latvia. It places a high priority on issues important to ethnic Russians, such as language and citizenship laws. The party also believes that Latvian citizenship should be granted to all citizens of USSR living in Latvia in 1990. This would entail a major change in the current law which only gives automatic citizenship to descendants of people who were citizens of the Republic of Latvia before it was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and requires the Soviet citizens who moved to Latvia between 1940 and 1990 (mainly Russians) to go through a naturalization process. 
In the election held on 5 October 2002, the party was part of the For Human Rights in United Latvia ([tpl]lang-lv|Par cilvēka tiesībām vienotā Latvijā[/tpl]) coalition that won 19.0% of the popular vote and 25 out of 100 seats, 5 of those seats went to Socialist Party. The party was a member of this alliance of predominantly Russian-speaking parties from 1998 to 2003. 
Today, the party's platform is centered on anti-corruption and promoting an independent Latvia that is free from European Union centralised power. In 2005, the LSP entered the "Harmony Centre" coalition, which won 17 seats in the 2006 election. 4 of these 17 parliament members are representatives of the Socialist Party. In 2011, HC won 31 seats, with Socialists receiving 3 seats (Ar. Rubiks, R. Rubiks and I. Zujevs).Sociālisti 11.Saeimā[tpl]lv icon[/tpl]

Cape Henlopen State Park is a Delaware state park on [tpl]convert|5193|acre[/tpl] on Cape Henlopen in Sussex County, Delaware, in the United States. William Penn made the beaches of Cape Henlopen one of the first public lands established in what has become the United States in 1682 with the declaration that Cape Henlopen would be for "the usage of the citizens of Lewes and Sussex County." Cape Henlopen State Park has a 24-hour and year-round fishing pier as well as campgrounds. The remainder of the park is only open from sunrise to sunset, and includes a bathhouse on the Atlantic Ocean, an area for surf-fishing, a disc golf course, and bicycle and walking paths. The beach at Herring Point is a popular surfing spot. The park is a stop on Delaware's Coastal Heritage Greenway.
As with all Delaware state beaches, entrance is free during the off-season but costs $4 daily or $27 annually for Delaware-tagged vehicles and $8 daily or $54 annually for out of state vehicles from 1 May to 31 October. Surf fishing season passes may be purchased at a cost of $65 per in-state vehicle and $130 per out-of-state vehicle. There are lower rates for the military, those getting social services and senior citizens. These passes provide access to all state beaches and parks in Delaware.[tpl]cite web|title=Delaware State Park Annual Pass|url=http://www.destateparks.com/fees/entry/annual-pass.asp|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Delaware State Parks Surf Fishing Pass|url=http://www.destateparks.com/fees/surf-fishing.asp|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl]

The pipa ([tpl]zh|c=琵琶|p=pípá[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-cmn|pʰǐpʰǎ|[/tpl]) is a four-stringed Chinese musical instrument, belonging to the plucked category of instruments.  Sometimes called the Chinese lute, the instrument has a pear-shaped wooden body with a varying number of frets ranging from 12 to 26.  Another Chinese four-string plucked lute is the liuqin, which looks like a smaller version of the pipa.
The pipa is one of the most popular Chinese instruments and has been played for almost two thousand years in China. Several related instruments in East and Southeast Asia are derived from the pipa; these include the Japanese biwa, the Vietnamese đàn tỳ bà, and the Korean bipa.  The Korean instrument is the only one of the three that is no longer widely used;  examples survive in museums, but recent attempts to revive the Korean instrument have been partially successful in recent years.

AKEL also supported the Annan Plan in 2004, but at the end they decided for a negative response, since they did not have time to formulate response to the plan. AKEL has successfully put into practice several socialist measures to support economic welfare of Cypriots during the late-2000s financial crisis, such as increasing low pensions by 30% and strengthening the welfare benefits given to university students to €12 million per year. Overall, €1.2 billion were spent on welfare benefits during the first three years of AKEL in power, with various improvements made in social welfare provision.http://www.socialprotection.eu/files_db/1100/asisp_ANR11_Cyprus.pdfhttp://www.socialprotection.eu/files_db/886/asisp_ANR10_Cyprus.pdf

Herod Antipater ([tpl]lang-el|Ἡρῴδης Ἀντίπατρος[/tpl], Hērǭdēs Antipatros; born before 20 BC – died after 39 AD), known by the nickname Antipas, was a 1st-century ruler of Galilee and Perea, who bore the title of tetrarch ("ruler of a quarter"). He is best known today for accounts in the New Testament of his role in events that led to the executions of John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth.
After being named to the throne by Caesar Augustus upon the death of his father, Herod the Great, in 4 BC, and  subsequent Ethnarch rule by his brother, Herod Archaleus, Antipas ruled them as a client state of the Roman Empire. He was responsible for building projects at Sepphoris and Betharamphtha, and more important for the construction of his capital Tiberias on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Named in honor of his patron, the emperor Tiberius, the city later became a center of rabbinic learning.
Antipas divorced his first wife Phasaelis, the daughter of King Aretas IV of Nabatea, in favour of Herodias, who had formerly been married to his brother Herod Philip I. (Antipas was Herod the Great's son by Malthace, while Herod II was his son by Mariamne II.)[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2lN0ibbLOHEC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=Eerdmans+Herod+Antipas+Herodias#v=onepage&q=Eerdmans%20Herod%20Antipas%20Herodias&f=false |title=Frederick Fyvie Bruce, The Acts of the Apostles (Eerdmans 1990 ISBN 978-080280966-7), p. 96 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 1990-12-01|accessdate=2013-05-02|isbn=9780802809667[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://virtualreligion.net/iho/herod2.html |title=The House of Herod |publisher=Virtualreligion.net |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02[/tpl] According to the New Testament Gospels, it was John the Baptist's condemnation of this arrangement that led Antipas to have him arrested; John was subsequently put to death. Besides provoking his conflict with the Baptizer, the tetrarch's divorce added a personal grievance to previous disputes with Aretas over territory on the border of Perea and Nabatea. The result was a war that proved disastrous for Antipas; a Roman counter-offensive was ordered by Tiberius, but abandoned upon that emperor's death in 37 AD. In 39 AD Antipas was accused by his nephew Agrippa I of conspiracy against the new Roman emperor Caligula, who sent him into exile in Gaul. Accompanied there by Herodias, he died at an unknown date.
The Gospel of Luke states that Jesus was first brought before Pontius Pilate for trial, since Pilate was the governor of Roman Judea, which encompassed Jerusalem where Jesus was arrested. Pilate initially handed him over to Antipas, in whose territory Jesus had been most active, but Antipas sent him back to Pilate's court.

[[Shock therapy (economics)]]

CATEGORIES: Economic liberalization, Economics of regulation, Macroeconomics, Privatization

In economics, shock therapy refers to the sudden release of price and currency controls, withdrawal of state subsidies, and immediate trade liberalization within a country, usually also including large-scale privatization of previously public-owned assets.
As shock policy, the term was coined by economist Milton Friedman. In time, it became absorbed into the group of ideas about economics, that are sometimes referred to as neoliberalism. The economist Jeffrey Sachs coined the expression of shock therapy. The alleged difference between the two shock expressions lies only in the degree of economic liberalisation. Sachs' ideas were based on studying historic periods of monetary and economic crisis and noting that a decisive stroke could end monetary chaos, often in a day. Whereas, Sachs' shock therapy notion views liberalisation as a necessary evil, a fast—as well as nasty—way to achieve economic stabilisation.
The first instance of shock therapy were the neoliberal pro-market reforms of Chile in 1975, carried out after the military coup by Augusto Pinochet.  The reforms, dubbed a shock policy at the time by Milton Friedman, were based on the liberal economic ideas centred around the University of Chicago.  Many of the Chilean economists who drafted the reforms came from there and were collectively dubbed the "Chicago Boys".
The term was truly born after Bolivia successfully tackled hyperinflation in 1985 under Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, using Sach's ideas.  In particular Sachs and Sanchez de Lozada cited West Germany as inspiration where, during a period over 1947-48, price controls and government support were withdrawn over a very short period, kick-starting the German economy and completing its transition from an authoritarian post-War state.
Neoliberalism rose to prominence after the 1970s and neoliberal shock therapy became increasingly used as a response to economic crises, for example by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.  Neoliberal shock therapy became very controversial, with its proponents arguing that it helped to end economic crises, stabilise economies and pave the way for growth, while its critics (like Joseph Stiglitz) believed that it helped deepen them unnecessarily and created unnecessary social suffering.
Sachs' ideas were applied to the post-communist states in their transition to capitalist systems with very mixed results.  Some countries that used shock therapy (e.g., Poland, Czech Republic) did better than those that did not.  To further cloud understanding, China made its highly successful transition in a gradualist fashion.  An opinion Easterly, William: The White Man’s Burden: Why the West’s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good (Penguin, 2006) is that successful market economies rest on a framework of law, regulation, and established practice that cannot be instantaneously created in a society that was formerly authoritarian, heavily centralised and subject to state ownership of assets.

CATEGORIES: Protein domains, Hormones

 
Corticotropin-releasing factor, CRF is a family of related neuropeptides in vertebrates. This family includes corticotropin-releasing hormone, urotensin-I, urocortin, and sauvagine. The family can be grouped into 2 separate paralogous lineages, with urotensin-I, urocortin and sauvagine in one group and CRH forming the other group. Urocortin and sauvagine appear to represent orthologues of fish urotensin-I in mammals and amphibians, respectively. The peptides have a variety of physiological effects on stress and anxiety, vasoregulation, thermoregulation, growth and metabolism, metamorphosis and reproduction in various species, and are all released as prohormones.[tpl]cite journal |author=Balment RJ, Lovejoy DA |title=Evolution and physiology of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family of neuropeptides in vertebrates |journal=Gen.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) [tpl]cite journal |author=Lederis KP, Okawara Y, Richter D, Morley SD |title=Evolutionary aspects of corticotropin releasing hormones |journal=Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. |volume=342 |issue= |pages=467–472 |year=1990 |pmid=2200028[/tpl] is a hormone found mainly in the paraventricular nucleus of the mammalian hypothalamus that regulates the release of corticotropin (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. The paraventricular nucleus transports CRH to the anterior pituitary, stimulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release via CRH type 1 receptors, thereby activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and, thus, glucocorticoid release.
CRH is evolutionary-related to a number of other active peptides. Urocortin acts in vitro to stimulate the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Urotensin is found in the teleost caudal neurosecretory system and may play a role in osmoregulation and as a corticotropin-releasing factor. Urotensin-I is released from the urophysis of fish, and produces ACTH and subsequent cortisol release in vivo. The nonhormonal portion of the prohormone is thought to be the urotensin binding protein (urophysin). Sauvagine ([tpl]Uniprot|P01144[/tpl]), isolated from frog skin, has a potent hypotensive and diuretic effect.

[[Counties of England]]

CATEGORIES: Counties of England, Politics of England

Counties of England are areas used for the purposes of administrative, geographical and political demarcation.  For administrative purposes, England outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly is divided into 83 counties.   The counties may consist of a single district or be divided into several districts. As of April 2009, 27 of these counties are divided into districts and have a county council. Six of the counties, covering the major conurbations, are known as metropolitan counties, which do not have county councils, although some functions are organised on a county-wide basis by the lower-tier districts (or metropolitan boroughs) acting jointly.
All of England (including Greater London and the Isles of Scilly) is also divided into 48 ceremonial counties, which are also known as geographic counties. 
Most ceremonial counties correspond to a metropolitan or non-metropolitan county of the same name but often with reduced boundaries.  
The current arrangement is the result of incremental reform. Many of the counties have their origins in the Middle Ages,[tpl] cite book | author=Hampton, W. | title=Local Government and Urban Politics | year=1991 [/tpl] although the larger counties of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Sussex lost many or all of their administrative functions centuries ago. The geographic counties which existed before the local government reforms of 1965 and 1974 are referred to as ancient counties or historic counties. From 1889 to 1974 areas with county councils were known as administrative counties, which excluded larger town and cities known as county boroughs and included divisions of some geographic counties.[tpl] cite book | author=Kingdom, J. | title= Local Government and Politics in Britain | year=1991 [/tpl]  From 1974 to 1996 the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, some of which were established only in 1974,[tpl] cite book | author=Redcliffe-Maud & Wood, B. | title=English Local Government Reformed | year=1974 [/tpl] corresponded directly with the ceremonial counties. 
Counties, usually either historic counties or current ceremonial counties, are used as the geographical basis for a number of institutions such as police and fire services, sports clubs, and other non-government organisations.
For the purpose of sorting and delivering mail, England was divided into 48 postal counties until 1996; these have been abandoned by the Royal Mail in favour of postcodes.

CATEGORIES: Proposed engines

The Stelzer engine is a two-stroke opposing-piston design proposed by Frank Stelzer. It uses conjoined pistons in a push-pull arrangement which allows for fewer moving parts and simplified manufacturing.
An engine of the same design appeared on the cover of the February 1969 issue of Mechanix Illustrated magazine.

The [tpl]nihongo|Nanboku-chō period|南北朝時代|Nanboku-chō jidai|"South and North courts period", also known as the Northern and Southern Courts period[/tpl], spanning from 1334 to 1392, was a period that occurred during the formative years of the Muromachi bakufu of Japan's history.
During this period, there existed a Northern Imperial Court, established by Ashikaga Takauji in Kyoto, and a Southern Imperial Court, established by Emperor Go-Daigo in Yoshino.
Ideologically, the two courts fought for fifty years, with the South giving up to the North in 1392. However, in reality the Northern line was under the power of the Ashikaga shoguns and had little real independence.
Since the 19th century the Emperors of the Southern Imperial Court have been considered the legitimate Emperors of Japan. Other contributing factors were the Southern Court's control of the Japanese imperial regalia, and Kitabatake Chikafusa's work Jinnō Shōtōki, which legitimized the South's imperial court despite their defeat.
The consequences of events in this period continue to be influential in modern Japan's conventional view of the Tennō Seika (Emperor system).  Under the influence of State Shinto, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the Southern Court.Mehl 1997: 140-147.  After World War II, a series of pretenders, starting with Kumazawa Hiromichi, claimed descent from the Southern Court and challenged the legitimacy of the modern imperial line which is descended from the Northern Court.Lauterbach 1946: 33.
The destruction of the Kamakura shogunate of 1333 and the failure of the Kemmu Restoration in 1336 opened up a legitimacy crisis for the new shogunate.Weber 1968: 212-297. Throughout this article this question becomes central for the Muromachi regime.  Furthermore, institutional changes in the estate system (the shōen) that formed the bedrock of the income of nobles and warriors alike decisively altered the status of the various social groups.  What emerged from the exigencies of the Nanboku-chō (Southern and Northern Court) War was the Muromachi regime, which broadened the economic base of the warriors while undercutting the noble proprietors, a trend that had started already with the Kamakura bakufu.

"Night of the Living Dead" is titled after the 1968 horror film of the same name, and the song's lyrics address the zombie plot of the film: "You think you're a zombie, you think it's a scene/from some monster magazine/Open your eyes too late/This ain't no fantasy boy". "Where Eagles Dare" shares its title with a 1968 World War II spy film. "Rat Fink" is a cover of a song by Allan Sherman from his 1963 album My Son, the Nut, which itself is a parody of "Rag Mop". It was the only cover song that the Misfits recorded during their early era, though it was credited on the single itself, and on later releases, to Danzig.

Stephen Lawrence (13 September 1974 – 22 April 1993) was a Black British man from Eltham, south east London, who was murdered in a racist attack while waiting for a bus on the evening of 22 April 1993. The case became a cause célèbre and one of the highest profile racial killings in UK history; its fallout included profound cultural changes to attitudes on racism and the police, and to the law and police practice, and the partial revocation of double jeopardy laws, before two of the perpetrators were convicted almost 20 years later in 2012.
After the initial investigation, five suspects were arrested but not convicted.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence detective denies claim|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5232372.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=31 July 2006|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl] It was suggested during the course of that investigation that the murder was racially motivated and that Lawrence was killed because he was black, and that the handling of the case by the police and Crown Prosecution Service was affected by issues of race.

In the years after Dobson and Norris were sentenced, the case again regained prominence when concerns of corrupt police conduct during the original case handling surfaced in the media. Such claims had surfaced before, and been investigated in 2006, but were reignited in 2013 when a former undercover police officer stated in an interview that at the time, he had been pressured to find ways to "smear" and discredit the victim's family, to mute and deter public campaigning for better police responses to the case. Although further inquiries in 2012 by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission had ruled that there was no basis for further investigation, Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an independent inquiry into undercover policing and corruption by a prominent QC, which was described as "devastating" when published in 2014.

[tpl]Lang|it|La Cenerentola, ossia La bontà in trionfo[/tpl] (Cinderella, or Goodness Triumphant) is an operatic dramma giocoso in two acts by Gioachino Rossini. The libretto was written by Jacopo Ferretti, based on the fairy tale Cendrillon by Charles Perrault. The opera was first performed in Rome's Teatro Valle on 25 January 1817.
Rossini composed La Cenerentola when he was 25 years old, following the success of The Barber of Seville the year before. La Cenerentola, which he completed in a period of three weeks, is considered to have some of his finest writing for solo voice and ensembles. Rossini saved some time by reusing an overture from La gazzetta and part of an aria from The Barber of Seville and by enlisting a collaborator, Luca Agolini, who wrote the secco recitatives and three numbers (Alidoro's "[tpl]Lang|it|Vasto teatro è il mondo[/tpl]", Clorinda's "[tpl]Lang|it|Sventurata![/tpl]" and the chorus "[tpl]Lang|it|Ah, della bella incognita[/tpl]"). The facsimile edition of the autograph has a different aria for Alidoro, "[tpl]Lang|it|Fa' silenzio, odo un rumore[/tpl]"; this seems to have been added by an anonymous hand for an 1818 production. For an 1820 revival in Rome, Rossini wrote a bravura replacement, "[tpl]Lang|it|La, del ciel nell'arcano profondo[/tpl]". The light, energetic overture has been in the standard repertoire since its premiere as La Cenerentola.

[[Role-playing video game]]

CATEGORIES: Role-playing video games, Video game genres, Video game terminology

A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, as well as computer RPG or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a protagonist  (or several adventuring party members) immersed in a fictional world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing gamesAdams, Rollings 2003, p. 347 (such as Dungeons & Dragons) and use much of the same terminology, settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. A common criteria for whether a game is an "RPG" is whether the game has a complex storyline, and whether the character goes through different places, fighting bosses and communicating with both friends and enemies.

The naval Battle of Oliwa, also Battle of Oliva or Battle of Gdańsk Roadstead, took place on 28 November 1627 during the Polish-Swedish War slightly north of the port of Danzig (Gdańsk) near the village of Oliva (Oliwa). It was the largest naval battle fought by the Polish royal navy, and resulted in the defeat of a small Swedish squadron.  The Poles slipped out of the Danzig harbor and captured the Swedish flagship and sank another vessel.Frost, R.I., 2000, The Northern Wars, 1558-1721, Harlow: Pearson Education Limited, ISBN 9780582064294[tpl]rp|110[/tpl]
The Swedes had a long tradition of seamanship and maintained a strong navy, and were able to land troops from the Swedish mainland at will along the south Baltic shore. They were also able to blockade Poland's ports, the most important of which was Danzig, maintaining a stranglehold on Polish trade. On 28 November 1627, a small, newly formed Polish fleet emerged from Danzig to engage the Swedish blockading squadron. 
The Polish ships were more numerous: numbering ten in all, but were mostly small, and only four galleons had full combat value. The Polish vessels were commanded by Admiral Arend Dickmann in the galleon Sankt Georg (Święty Jerzy). The Swedish squadron numbered six vessels, under Nils Stiernsköld in his flagship the Tigern. The Polish vessels had a larger complement of marines on board than the Swedish ships, and this in large part determined the tactics employed in the action.
The Polish ships anchored off the Danzig roadstead, while the Swedish squadron sailed southwards from the Hel Peninsula. The Poles weighed anchor and suddenly rushed towards the Swedes squadron, much to their surprise. 
The battle split into two main encounters. The Polish flagship, Sankt Georg, supported by a smaller vessel, Meerweib (Panna Wodna), attacked the Swedish flagship, "Tigern". The Polish ships came alongside the "Tigern", and Polish marines boarded, overwhelmed the Swedes and captured the vessel. Meanwhile the Polish vice-admiral's ship, the small galleon Meerman (Wodnik) attacked the larger Solen ("The Sun"). The captain of the Solen blew his ship up rather than allowing it to be captured. The four surviving Swedish ships quickly headed towards the open sea and managed to escape pursuit. Both admirals were killed in the battle.
The Polish court used the victory to its maximum in its propaganda. A popular saying had it that on that day "the sun went down at noon", referring to the scuttling of one of the Swedish ships, the Solen.

[[Nominal watt]]

CATEGORIES: Loudspeaker technology, Units of power

Nominal wattage is used to simplify the measurement of the efficiency of a loudspeaker. 
The impedance of a loudspeaker varies with frequency. This means that if different sine wave tones are fed into the loudspeaker at the same voltage (or the same current), the amount of electric power consumed will vary.
By convention, loudspeakers are designed to generate the same sound pressure level (SPL) at the listener for the same voltage at varying frequencies - regardless of the variation in electric power. This permits a loudspeaker to be used with an amplifier having a low internal impedance and a flat frequency response is realized for the combined amplifier/loudspeaker system.
However, an amplifier with a low internal impedance delivers more electrical output power when the load impedance reduces (until the impedances become approximately matched). Such high power levels could cause damage to either the amplifier or the amplifier's power supply, or the circuit connected to the amplifier's output (including the loudspeaker).
Therefore, an additional convention exists whereby loudspeaker manufacturers specify a conservative estimate of the average impedance that the loudspeaker will present while playing typical music. This is called the nominal impedance. Amplifiers can therefore be safely specified to operate into a load that has this nominal impedance (or higher, but not lower).
Typical nominal impedances for speakers include 4, 6, 8 and 16Ω (ohms), with 4Ω being most common in in-car loudspeakers, and 8Ω being most common elsewhere. A loudspeaker with an 8Ω nominal impedance may exhibit actual impedances ranging from approximately 5 to 100Ω depending on frequency.
In this context, the nominal wattage is the theoretical electric power that would be transferred from amplifier to speaker if the loudspeaker was actually exhibiting its nominal impedance. The actual electric power may vary from about twice the nominal power down to less than one tenth.
Loudspeaker efficiency is measured with respect to nominal power in order to emulate the situation outlined above where a low internal impedance amplifier is used with a loudspeaker. The convention is to supply one nominal watt during testing. If the nominal impedance is 4 ohms, the voltage would be 2 volts. If the nominal impedance is 8Ω, the voltage would be 2.83 volts.

CATEGORIES: 1929 births, Living people, People from Nanchang, Members of the Académie française, Chinese emigrants to France, Prix Femina winners

François Cheng ([tpl]zh|c=程抱一|p=Chéng Bàoyī|w=Ch'eng Pao-i[/tpl],born 30 August 1929 in Nanchang, Jiangxi) is a Chinese-born French academician, writer, poet and calligrapher. He is the author of essays, novels, collections of poetry and books on art written in the French language, and the translator of some of the great French poets into Chinese.
Born in China and taking French citizenship in 1973, he was elected to the Académie française in 2002, and was the first person of Asian origin to be a member of the Academy. He was the winner of the 1998 Prix Femina for Le Dit de Tianyi ("The Tale of Tianyi") (pub. Albin Michel, Paris, 1998).
When Cheng arrived in France in 1948, on a study grant, he did not speak a word of the language. He subsequently adapted quickly and profoundly. In his speech to the Académie française, he explained, "I became a Frenchman in law, mind and heart more than thirty years ago ... especially from that moment when I resolutely went over to the French language, making it the weapon, or the soul, of my creative work. This language, how can I say everything that I owe to it? It is so intimately bound up with the way I live and my inner life that it has proved to be the emblem of my destiny."http://www.academie-francaise.fr/discours-de-reception-de-francois-cheng It took many years before he became a novelist. His first works were on Chinese poetry and painting, and in the late sixties and early seventies he worked closely with the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan on texts from the classical Chinese canon. These exchanges informed Lacan's late teaching on psychoanalytic interpretation.Price, A. "Lacan's Remarks on Chinese Poetry". Hurly-Burly 2 (2009) Later he began to write works of poetry himself, before finally turning to the writing of novels.
Since 2008, he is a member of the Fondation Chirac's honour committee.Fondation Chirac's honour committee

[tpl]angbr|[tpl]IPA|ǀ[/tpl][/tpl] is the current IPA symbol for a dental click, not a lower-case [tpl]angbr|L[/tpl]. crushing or scattering), also known by the Sesotho name Difaqane or Lifaqane, was a period of widespread chaos and warfare among indigenous ethnic communities in :southern Africa during the period between 1815 to about 1840.
As King Shaka created the militaristic Zulu Kingdom in the territory between the Tugela River and Pongola River, his forces caused a wave of warfare and disruption to sweep to other peoples. This was the prelude of the Mfecane, which spread from there. The movement of peoples caused many tribes to try to dominate those in new territories, leading to widespread warfare; consolidation of other groups, such as the Matabele, the Mfengu and the Makololo; and the creation of states such as the modern Lesotho.
Mfecane is used primarily to refer to the period when Mzilikazi, a king of the Matabele, dominated the Transvaal. During his reign, roughly from 1826 to 1836, he ordered widespread killings and devastation to remove all opposition. He reorganised the territory to establish the new Ndebele order. The death toll has never been satisfactorily determined, but the whole region became nearly depopulated. Normal estimates for the death toll range from 1 million to 2 million. These numbers are however controversial.[tpl]cite book|author=Eugene Victor Walter|title=Terror and Resistance: A Study of Political Violence, with Case Studies of Some Primitive African Communities|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=k-3mmwEACAAJ|year=1969[/tpl]Major Charters, Royal Artillery, “Notices Of The Cape And Southern Africa, Since The Appointment, As Governor, Of Major-Gen.

Gasherbrum I is part of the Gasherbrum massif, located in the Karakoram region of the Himalaya. Gasherbrum is often claimed to mean  "Shining Wall", presumably a reference to the highly visible face of the neighboring peak Gasherbrum IV; but in fact it comes from "rgasha" (beautiful) + "brum" (mountain) in Balti, hence it actually means "beautiful mountain."
Gasherbrum I was designated K5 (meaning the 5th peak of the Karakoram) by T.G. Montgomerie in 1856 when he first spotted the peaks of the Karakoram from more than 200 km away during the Great Trigonometric Survey of India. In 1892, William Martin Conway provided the alternate name, Hidden Peak, in reference to its extreme remoteness.
Gasherbrum I was first climbed on July 5, 1958 by Pete Schoening and Andy Kauffman of an eight-man American expedition led by Nicholas B. Clinch. Richard K. Irvin, Tom Nevison, Tom McCormack, Bob Swift and Gil Roberts were also members of the team.Clinch "A Walk in the Sky"

Marvin Camras (1916–1995) was an electrical engineer and inventor who was widely influential in the field of magnetic recording.
Camras built his first recording device, a wire recorder, in the bj1930s for a cousin who was an aspiring singer. Shortly afterwards he discovered that using magnetic tape made the process of splicing and storing recordings easier.
Camras's work attracted the notice of his professors at what is now Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and was offered a position at Armour Research Foundation (which merged with Lewis Institute in 1940 to become IIT) to develop his work.
Before and during World War II Camras' early wire recorders were used by the armed forces to train pilots. They were also used for disinformation purposes: battle sounds were recorded and amplified and the recordings placed where the D-Day invasion was not going to take place. This work was kept secret until after the war.
In June 1944 he was awarded US Patent number 2351004,[tpl]Cite web| last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | title = US Patent number 2351004, "Method and Means of Magnetic Recording"  | work =  | publisher = USPO  | date =   | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=M_VUAAAAEBAJ&dq=2351004  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = January 16, 2008 [/tpl] titled "Method and Means of Magnetic Recording". In all, Camras received more than 500 patents, largely in the field of electronic communications.
Camras received a bachelor's degree in 1940 and a master's degree in 1942, both in electrical engineering, from IIT. In 1968, the institution awarded him an honorary doctorate.
In May 1962 Camras wrote a predictive paper titled "Magnetic recording and reproduction - 2012 A.D.".[tpl]Cite web| last = Camras  | first = Marvin  | authorlink =   | title = Magnetic recording and reproduction - 2012 A.D.  | work =  | publisher = IEEE  | date = May 1, 1962  | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4066743  | format =  | doi = 10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288062  | accessdate = April 30, 2008 [/tpl] In his paper Camras predicted the existence of mass-produced portable media players he described as memory packs the size of a package of playing cards holding up to 1020 bits of information. Such devices would not have any mechanically moving parts and would store both sound and movies. He also predicted music and movie downloads, online shopping, access to online encyclopedias and newspapers and the widespread use of online banking transactions.
In recognition of his achievements, he received the National Medal of Technology award in 1990.
Marvin Camras died of kidney failure at the age of 79 in Evanston, Illinois.

thumb|300 px|Mongibello Mons and other topographic features on Io's leading hemisphereMore than 135 mountains have been identified on the surface of Jupiter's moon Io.[tpl]cite book |last=Turtle |first=Elizabeth P.; et al. |editor=Lopes, R.

R. |title=Io after Galileo |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |isbn=3-540-34681-3 |pages=325–330 |chapter=Appendix 2: Ionian mountains identified to date [/tpl]   Despite the extensive active volcanism taking place on Io, most mountains on Io are formed through tectonic processes.  These structures average 6 km (4 mi) in height and reach a maximum of 17.5 ± 1.5 km (10.9 ± 1 mi) at South Boösaule Montes. Mountains often appear as large (the average mountain is 157 km (98 mi) long), isolated structures with no apparent global tectonic patterns outlined, in contrast to the situation on Earth. To support the tremendous topography observed at these mountains requires rock compositions consisting mostly of silicate, as opposed to sulfur.[tpl]cite journal |title=Stability of sulfur slopes on Io |journal=Icarus |last=Clow |first=G. D. |coauthors=Carr, M. H. |pages=268–279 |volume=44 |issue= 2|year=1980 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(80)90022-6 |bibcode=1980Icar...44..268C[/tpl]
Mountains on Io (generally, structures rising above the surrounding plains) have a variety of morphologies. Plateaus are most common. These structures resemble large, flat-topped mesas with rugged surfaces. Other mountains appear to be tilted crustal blocks, with a shallow slope from the formerly flat surface and a steep slope consisting of formerly sub-surface materials uplifted by compressive stresses. Both types of mountains often have steep scarps along one or more margins. Only a handful of mountains on Io appear to have a volcanic origin. These mountains resemble small shield volcanoes, with steep slopes (6–7°) near a small, central caldera and shallow slopes along their margins.[tpl]cite journal | last=Schenk |first=P. M. |coauthors=et al. |title=Shield volcano topography and the rheology of lava flows on Io |journal=Icarus |volume=169 |issue= |pages=98–110 |year=2004 |url= |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.01.015 |bibcode=2004Icar..169...98S[/tpl] These volcanic mountains are often smaller than the average mountain on Io, averaging only 1 to 2 km (0.6 to 1.2 mi) in height and 40 to 60 km (25 to 37 mi) wide. Other shield volcanoes with much shallower slopes are inferred from the morphology of several of Io's volcanoes, where thin flows radiate out from a central patera, such as at Ra Patera.
Some of Io's mountains have received official names from the International Astronomical Union.  The names are a combination of a name of a person or place derived from the Greek mythological story of Io, Dante's Inferno, or from the name of a nearby feature on Io surface and an approved descriptive term. The descriptive terms, or categories, used for these mountains depends on their morphology, which is a reflection of the mountain's age, geologic origin (volcanic or tectonic), and mass wasting processes.  Mountains consisting of massifs, ridges, or isolated peaks use the descriptive term, mons or the plural montes, the Latin term for mountain.  These features are named after prominent locations from the Greek mythological travels of Io or places mentioned in Dante's Inferno.[tpl]cite web | last=Blue | first=Jennifer | date=October 16, 2006 |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append6.html | title=Categories for Naming Features on Planets and Satellites | publisher=USGS | accessdate= 2010-01-17 [/tpl]  Plateaus are normally given the descriptive term mensa (pl. mensae), the Latin term for mesa, though some mountains with plateau morphology use mons.  Ionian mensae are named after mythological figures associated with the Io myth, characters from Dante's Inferno.  Like mountains, these features can also be named after nearby volcanoes.  Some units of layered plains have names using the descriptive term planum (pl. plana). However other more mountainous structures, such as Danube Planum, use the term.  Partly as a result of the inconsistent use of this term, planum has not been used since the Voyager era.  Ionian plana are named after locations associated with the Io myth.  Rare cases of volcanic mountains, such as the shield volcano Tsũi Goab Tholus, use the term tholus (plural: tholi).  Ionian tholi are named after people associated with the Io myth or nearby features on Io's surface.

Semiramide ([tpl]IPA-it|semiˈraːmide[/tpl]) is an opera in two acts by Gioachino Rossini.
The libretto by Gaetano Rossi is based on Voltaire's tragedy Semiramis, which in turn was based on the legend of Semiramis of Babylon.Raymond Monelle 1992, Semiramide redenta: archetipi, fonti classiche, censure antropologiche nel melodramma, Music & Letters, 73(3), pp. 448—450Marita P. McClymonds 1993, Semiramide redenta: archetipi, fonti classiche, censure antropologiche nel melodramma.  Notes (2nd Ser.), 50(1), pp. 139–141. The opera was first performed at La Fenice in Venice on 3 February 1823.
Semiramide was Rossini's final Italian opera and according to Richard Osborne, "could well be dubbed Tancredi Revisited".Osborne, Richard 1990, "Farewell to Italy: Semiramide" in Rossini, p. 302 As in Tancredi, Rossi's libretto was based on a Voltaire tragedy. The music took the form of a return to vocal traditions of Rossini's youth, and was a melodrama in which he "recreated the baroque tradition of decorative singing with unparalleled skill".Guido Johannes Joerg 1991, Booklet accompanying ArtHaus DVD, p. 27 The ensemble-scenes (particularly the duos between Arsace and Semiramide) and choruses are of a high order, as is the orchestral writing, which makes full use of a large pit.
After this splendid work, one of his finest in the genre, Rossini turned his back on Italy and moved to Paris. Apart from Il viaggio a Reims, which is still in Italian, his last operas were either original compositions in French or extensively reworked adaptations into French of earlier Italian operas.
Musicologist Rodolfo Celletti sums up the importance of Semiramide by stating:

Juan Galindo (1802–1839) was a Central American explorer and army officer. He fought for Central American independence from Spain and led the charge that took the fortress at Omoa, the last Spanish stronghold in Central America.
Galindo was born in Dublin in 1802 as John Galindo.Drew 1999, p.50. His father, Philemon Galindo was an Englishman of Spanish descent and his mother was Irish.Drew 1999, p.51. He left for the New World before he was twenty and, although little is known about his early career, he appeared in Guatemala in 1827. His participation in the army of General Francisco Morazán led to him being made governor of Petén. He received a large land grant there and was charged with pacifying the Lacandon Maya.
Galindo's father  was a government official in Costa Rica. Galindo worked for the government of the United Provinces of Central America. In addition to his military duties, his work included a stint as governor of Petén and diplomatic missions to Havana and the United States. During this time, he wrote accounts of local conditions, topography and landmarks.
Galindo also explored and wrote descriptive accounts of various ancient Maya ruins, including Palenque and Copán. In 1834, while serving as governor of Petén, he visited Copán and noted the sculpted high-relief stelae there.Drew 1999, pp.51–52. They are notable as they were first to point out the close resemblance between the contemporary Maya peoples and the carved images of the ancient Maya to be found amongst the ruins. Contrary to ideas that the ancient Maya architecture had been created by peoples such as ancient Egyptians, Polynesians, or even the Lost Tribes of Israel, this suggested that they were built by the contemporary Mayas' ancestors.
Galindo was a loyal supporter of the liberal central government of President Francisco Morazán. When civil war broke out in Central America, he fought in various battles, but was killed when a Nicaraguan army overran the city of Tegucigalpa.

Hubert Bland (3 January 1855 – 14 April 1914) was an early English socialist and one of the founders of the Fabian Society.
Bland was born in Woolwich, south-east London, the youngest of the four children of Henry Bland, a successful commercial clerk, and his wife Mary Ann.  He was baptised on 14 March 1855 at St Mary Magdalene, Woolwich.  As a young man, Bland showed a keen interest in politics.  He wanted to join the army but his father's death forced him into running the family business. In 1877, he met 19-year-old Edith Nesbit. They married on 22 April 1880 with Edith already seven months pregnant. They did not immediately live together as Bland initially continued to live with his mother. According to Nesbit's biographer, Julia Briggs:
Bland also continued an affair with Alice Hoatson which produced two children (Rosamund in 1886 and John in 1899), both of whom Nesbit raised as her own. With Nesbit, he produced three children: Paul (1880–1940), Iris (1881-?) and Fabian (1885–1900, who died aged 15 after a tonsil operation).
In 1883, the Blands joined a socialist debating group which evolved to become the Fabian Society in January 1884. Bland chaired the first meeting and was subsequently elected to be the Society's treasurer. Fellow members included Edward Pease, Havelock Ellis, and Frank Podmore.
Bland was unpopular with most of the Fabians. George Bernard Shaw described him as:
His biographer, Julia Briggs, believed that he was an unsual socialist:
Around 1885, Bland was briefly a member of the Social Democratic Federation, and in about 1893 he joined the Independent Labour Party. His support of Britain's imperial interests (notably the Second Boer War) began to make him unpopular with his fellow socialists. He taught for a while at the London School of Economics.
Bland was an opponent of women's rights. He wrote:
Bland was a freelance journalist until 1889 when he obtained the position as a columnist for the radical newspaper, Manchester Sunday Chronicle.
Claire Tomalin has written that:
The couple lived in Well Hall House, Eltham from 1899. In 1911 Bland began to go blind and had to be supported by Edith, by this time a successful poet and novelist, The Railway Children (1906) being perhaps her most famous work. Bland died in Eltham of a heart attack on 14 April 1914 and was buried in Woolwich cemetery.

According to Rosemary Wells on the Nick Jr. website, "Max & Ruby celebrates the relationship between Ruby and her younger brother, Max, and the universal nature of sibling relationships."Nick, Jr., Meet Rosemary Wells
In an exclusive interview with Nick Jr., Rosemary Wells, the author of the highly acclaimed children's books the show is based on, says: "We don't see Max and Ruby's parents because I believe that kids resolve their issues and conflicts differently when they're on their own. The television series gives kids a sense about how these two siblings resolve their conflicts in a humorous and entertaining way."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nickjr.com/max-ruby/about-max-ruby/meet-max-and-ruby-creator_ap.html |title=Meet the Creator of Max & Ruby |date= |work=nickjr.com |publisher=Nick Jr. |accessdate=February 18, 2013[/tpl] For the first season, Jamie Whitney was the director, and the first episodes were mostly written by Kate Barris and Patrick Granleese.

Bob the Builder is a British children's animated television show created by Keith Chapman. In the original series Bob appears as a building contractor specializing in masonry in a stop motion animated programme with his colleague Wendy, various neighbours and friends, and their gang of anthropomorphised work-vehicles and equipment (all made of clay). The show is broadcast in many countries, but originates from the United Kingdom where Bob is voiced by English actor Neil Morrissey. The show was later created using CGI animation starting with the spin-off series Ready, Steady, Build!.
In each episode, Bob and his group help with renovations, construction, and repairs and with other projects as needed. The show emphasizes conflict resolution, co-operation, socialization and various learning skills. Bob's catchphrase is "Can we fix it?", to which the other characters respond with "Yes we can!" This phrase is also the title of the show's theme song, which was a million-selling number one hit in the UK.

Pleural effusion is excess fluid that accumulates in the pleural cavity, the fluid-filled space that surrounds the lungs. Excessive amounts of such fluid can impair breathing by mass effect, limiting the expansion of the lungs during ventilation. Various kinds of pleural effusion, depending on the nature of the fluid and what caused its entry into the pleural space, are hydrothorax (serous fluid), hemothorax (blood), chylothorax (chyle), or pyothorax (pus). Pneumothorax is the accumulation of air in the pleural space.

[[Love Pageant Rally]]

The Love Pageant Rally took place on October 6, 1966[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestraight.com/films/lprally/|title=Love Pageant Rally|accessdate=2008-08-05|author=Reg E. Williams|work=The Straight on The Haight[/tpl] — the day LSD became illegal — in the 'panhandle' of Golden Gate Park, a narrower section that projects into San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district. The 'Haight' was a neighborhood of run-down turn-of-the-20th-century housing that was the center of San Francisco's counterculture in the 1960s.
The major instigators of the rally were Allen Cohen and artist Michael Bowen, the creators of the San Francisco Oracle, which first hit the streets in September 1966. The occasion was the banning of LSD, by the California legislature in Sacramento, an enactment which virtually created a neighborhood of outlaws in the Haight, where 'acid' was a staple of community culture. Since the new law was to go into effect on October 6, 1966, Cohen and others related the event to the number of the Beast of Revelation. On a more serious level, busts for drugs were ramping up locally and on the national level, and confrontations between the hippie communes and the local police were getting more intense and led to street protests and rioting, followed by neighborhood curfews. A better form of protest, more suited to hippie culture was needed.
"Without confrontation," said Allen Cohen, "we wanted to create a celebration of innocence. We were not guilty of using illegal substances. We were celebrating transcendental consciousness. The beauty of the universe. The beauty of being."
Posters advertising the event invited participants to "Bring the color gold... Bring photos of personal saints and gurus and heroes of the underground... Bring children... Flowers... Flutes... Drums... Feathers... Bands... Beads... Banners, flags, incense, chimes, gongs, cymbals, symbols, costumes, joy."Gene Anthony, The Summer of Love, Haight-Ashbury at Its Highest (Last Gasp, 1980). Entire text and photos online at erowid.org, website found 2010-03-15.
Thousands showed up for the event, read a "prophecy of a declaration of independence" written by Cohen, after which many placed a tab of acid on their tongues and swallowed in unison. Music was provided by the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin,http://www.beatsupernovarasa.com/beatpics/bp000027.html both invited to play by Michael Bowen for free. Ken Kesey was on hand with the Merry Pranksters in the legendary bus.

Sir John Forrest GCMG (22 August 1847 – 2 September 1918) was an Australian explorer, the first Premier of Western Australia and a cabinet minister in Australia's first federal parliament.
As a young man, John Forrest won fame as an explorer by leading three expeditions into the interior of Western Australia. He was appointed Surveyor General and in 1890 became the first Premier of Western Australia, its only premier as a self-governing colony. Forrest's premiership gave the state ten years of stable administration during a period of rapid development and demographic change.  He pursued a policy of large-scale public works and extensive land settlement, and he helped to ensure that Western Australia joined the federation of Australian states. After federation, he moved to federal politics, where he was at various times postmaster-general, Minister for Defence, Minister for Home Affairs, Treasurer and acting Prime Minister.
Shortly before his death, Forrest was informed that the King had approved his being raised to the British peerage as Baron Forrest of Bunbury.  He immediately began signing his name as "Forrest", as if he were already a peer.  However, at the time of his death his peerage had not been legally established by letters patent.  References to him as "Lord Forrest" are therefore incorrect.

The game centers on the pirate Guybrush Threepwood, who returns home with his wife Elaine Marley after their honeymoon, to find her erroneously declared dead, and her office of governor up for election. Guybrush must find a way to restore Elaine to office, while uncovering a plot to turn the Caribbean into a tourist trap, headed by his nemesis LeChuck and an Australian conspirator Ozzie Mandrill.
Escape was the last of LucasArts' adventure games to be released. It was also the second and last game to use the GrimE engine, which was upgraded from its first use in Grim Fandango.

[[LucasArts adventure games]]
CATEGORIES: Adventure games, LucasArts games, Point-and-click adventure games

From the late 1980s to the early 2000s, LucasArts was well known for their point-and-click graphic adventure games, nearly all of which received high scoring reviews at the time of their release. Their style tended towards the humorous, often irreverent or slapstick humor, with the exceptions of Loom and The Dig. Their game design philosophy was that the player should never die or reach a complete dead-end, although there were exceptions.
Many of the games shared similar game interfaces and technology, powered by SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion). After 1997, these games transitioned into 3D graphics with the GrimE game engine. Common features between the games include in-joke references to both other LucasArts games and Lucasfilm productions, as well as other running gags, such as Chuck the Plant and Sam & Max cameo appearances, that spanned numerous games. Most of the games were designed by the people with experience from creating preceding adventure games for LucasArts, whilst the same composers were involved in the majority of productions.
In 2004, after a string of titles that never reached release, LucasArts ceased development on graphic adventure games. Many of the development staff involved in the making of these games moved on to form new companies, continuing to produce similar games at studios such as Telltale Games, Double Fine Productions, and Autumn Moon Entertainment. In 2009, however, LucasArts announced a collaboration with Telltale to revive the Monkey Island series, one of the old LucasArts adventure franchises, as well as stating its intent to revisit its past portfolio. This collaboration brought the LucasArts developed special editions of the first two Monkey Island Games and the Telltale helmed adventure game Tales of Monkey Island.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/06/01/lechuck-me-monkey-island-returns/|title=LeChuck Me: Monkey Island Returns|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=2009-06-01|first=Alec|last=Meer|accessdate=2009-06-01[/tpl]

Grove Street Cemetery or Grove Street Burial Ground  in New Haven, Connecticut is located adjacent to the Yale University campus. It was organized  in 1796 as the New Haven Burying Ground and incorporated in October 1797 to replace the crowded burial ground on the New Haven Green. The first private, nonprofit cemetery in the world, it was one of the earliest burial grounds to have a planned layout, with plots permanently owned by individual families, a structured arrangement of ornamental plantings, and paved and named streets and avenues. This was "a real turning point... a whole redefinition of how people viewed death and dying", according to historian Peter Dobkin Hall, with novel ideas like permanent memorials and the sanctity of the deceased body."Cemetery Holds New Haven History", Steve Grant, The Hartford Courant, December 26, 2008  Many notable Yale and New Haven luminaries are buried in the Grove Street Cemetery, including fourteen Yale presidents; nevertheless, it was not restricted to members of the upper class, and was open to all.
Initially consisting of six acres (24,000 m²), it has been expanded to nearly 18 acres (73,000 m²). The perimeter of the cemetery was surrounded by an eight foot (2.4 m) stone wall in 1848-49, and the entrance on Grove Street is a brownstone Egyptian Revival gateway, designed by New Haven architect Henry Austin (who is buried at the cemetery), and built in 1845.  The lintel of the gateway is inscribed "The Dead Shall Be Raised.";  the concluding period has been called the most eloquent and sublime piece of punctuation in stone. The quotation is taken from 1 Corinthians 15.52: "For the trumpet will sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed."   The oft-recounted (and likely apocryphal) response of many presidents of Yale is, in substance, "They certainly will be, if Yale needs the property." Immediately inside the gate is a Victorian chapel, now used as an office. The gravestones from the New Haven Green (but not the remains) were moved here for preservation in 1821 and are displayed against the walls of the cemetery. Visitors from afar mingle with New Haven residents enjoying the quiet, park-like atmosphere.
Yale plans to construct two new residential colleges to the immediate north of the cemetery. Various people have accordingly suggested to the cemetery Proprietors that an additional gate be constructed in the north section of the historic wall that surrounds the burial ground to permit pedestrians to walk through the cemetery from the main Yale campus to the planned new colleges. In addition, the Proprietors recently considered a proposal brought forward by one Proprietor that would replace a portion of the stone sections of the wall bordering Prospect Street (the eastern border of the cemetery and a main route to the planned colleges) with iron fencing similar to that already running along most of the cemetery's southern border on Grove Street. This proposal, now withdrawn following a meeting of the Proprietors to which the public was invited for the first time, included architectural and landscaping designs by Yale Architecture School Dean Robert Stern, among the country's most distinguished architects (who will also be designing the new colleges).
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.  It then included one contributing site, three contributing structures, and 15 contributing objects.
The Grove Street Cemetery was further designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Secretary of the Interior in 2000.[tpl]citation|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Register of Historic Landmark Nomination: Grove Street Cemetery / New Haven City Burial Ground|32 KB[/tpl]|date=September 29, 1999 |author=Bruce Clouette |publisher=National Park Service[/tpl] and [tpl]PDFlink|Accompanying 32 photos, from 1997 and undated|32 KB[/tpl]

[[Automated analyser]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory equipment, Measuring instruments, Clinical pathology

An automated analyser is a medical laboratory instrument designed to measure different chemicals and other characteristics in a number of biological samples quickly, with minimal human assistance.
These measured properties of blood and other fluids may be useful in the diagnosis of disease.
Many methods of introducing samples into the analyser have been invented.  This can involve placing test tubes of sample into racks, which can be moved along a track, or inserting tubes into circular carousels that rotate to make the sample available. Some analysers require samples to be transferred to sample cups.  However, the effort to protect the health and safety of laboratory staff has prompted many manufacturers to develop analysers that feature closed tube sampling, preventing workers from direct exposure to samples.,http://www.beckman.com/literature/ClinDiag/AU%209389%20Tanner%20Case%20Study.pdfhttp://www.bd.com/ds/aboutUs/news/News-05227.asp
Samples can be processed singly, in batches, or continuously.
The automation of laboratory testing does not remove the need for human expertise (results must still be evaluated by medical technologists and other qualified clinical laboratory professionals), but it does ease concerns about error reduction, staffing concerns, and safety.

[[Machine code monitor]]

CATEGORIES: Memory management software, Microcomputer software

A machine code monitor (aka machine language monitor) is software that allows a user to enter commands to view and change memory locations on a computer, with options to load and save memory contents from/to secondary storage.  Some full-featured machine code monitors provide detailed control ("single-stepping") of the execution of machine language programs (much like a debugger), and include absolute-address code assembly and disassembly capabilities.
Machine code monitors became popular during the home computer era of the 1970s and 1980s and were sometimes available as resident firmware in some computers (e.g., the built-in monitor in the Commodore 128).  It was not unheard of to perform all of one's programming in a monitor in lieu of a full-fledged symbolic assembler.  Even after full-featured assemblers became readily available, a machine code monitor was indispensable for debugging programs.  The usual technique was to set break points in the code undergoing testing (e.g., with a BRK instruction in 6502 assembly language[tpl]cite book|title=Microprocessors and Microcomputers: Hardware and Software|author=R.J. Tocci & L.P. Laskowski|publisher=Prentice-Hall|date=1979|isbn=9780135813225|page=379[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=6502 Assembly Language Programming|author=L.A. Leventhal|publisher=Osborne/McGraw-Hill|date=1986|isbn=9780078812163[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Apple II in the Laboratory|author=A.F. Kuckes & B.G. Thompson|publisher=UP Archive|date=1987|isbn=9780521321983|page=93[/tpl]) and start the program.  When the microprocessor encountered a break point the test program would be interrupted and control would be transferred to the machine code monitor.  Typically this would trigger a register dump and then the monitor would await programmer input.  Activities at this point might include examining memory contents, patching code and/or perhaps altering the processor registers prior to restarting the test program.
The general decline of scratch-written assembly language software has made the use of a machine code monitor somewhat of a lost art.  In most systems where higher level languages are employed, debuggers are used to present a more abstract and friendly view of what is happening within a program.  However, the use of machine code monitors persists, especially in the area of hobby-built computers.

[[Buonamico Buffalmacco]]
CATEGORIES: 14th-century Italian painters, Tuscan painters, Characters in The Decameron, Year of death uncertain, Year of birth unknown

Buonamico di of  Martino or Buonamico Buffalmacco (active c. 1315–1336) was an Italian painter who worked in Florence, Bologna and Pisa. Although none of his known work has survived, he is widely assumed to be the painter of a most influential fresco cycle in the Camposanto in Pisa, featuring the The Three Dead and the Three Living, the Triumph of Death, the Last Judgement, the Hell, and the Thebais (several episodes from the lives of the Holy Fathers in the Desert). Painted some ten years before the Black Death spread over Europe in 1348, the cycle - a "painted sermon" (L. Bolzoni) - enjoyed an extraordinary success after that date, and was often imitated throughout Italy. The youngsters' party enjoying themselves in a beautiful garden while Death piles mounds of corpses all around is likely to have inspired the setting of Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron, written a few years after the Black Death.
Boccaccio (in his Decameron) and Franco Sacchetti (in his Il trecentonovelle) both describe Buonamico as being a practical joker. Boccaccio features Buonamico along with his friends and fellow painters Calandrino and Bruno in several tales (Day VIII, tales 3, 6, and 9; Day IX, tales 3 and 5).  Typically in these stories, Buonamico uses his wits to play tricks on his friends and associates:  convincing Calandrino that a stone he possesses (heliotrope) confers invisibility (VIII/3), stealing a pig from Calandrino (VIII, 6), convincing the physician Master Simone of an opportunity to ally himself with the devil (VIII, 9), convincing Calandrino that he has become pregnant (IX, 3), convincing Calandrino that a particular scroll can cause a woman to fall in love with him (IX, 5).  Throughout the stories, Buonamico is frequently depicted at work painting in the houses of notable gentlemen in Florence but eager to take time to eat, drink and be merry.
Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Buonamico in his Lives, in which he tells several anecdotes about his comic escapades.Vasari, Giorgio. The Lives of the Painters, Sculptors and Architects. Trans. A. B. Hinds. New York: Everyman's Library. 1980. Vol. 1, Pp. 109-122. Vasari tells of Buonamico's youthful tricking of his master Tafi during his apprenticeship, various pranks and tricks that Buonamico played on his patrons, and his habit of embedding texts within his paintings.  Dismissed by Vasari as just another of the witty painter's gags, which his "clumsy" contemporaries had misunderstood and foolishly imitated, the Camposanto frescoes are actually scattered with texts, a possible indication of the veracity of Vasari's remark. In the scroll over the cripple beggars in the center of The Triumph of Death, for instance, it says, "Since prosperity has completely deserted us, O Death, you who are the medicine for all pain, come to give us our last supper."
Vasari discusses various paintings by the artist which no longer exist, and many of which had already perished by the time of Vasari's writing in the sixteenth century.  He describes a series of paintings at the convent of Faenza in Florence (already destroyed by the sixteenth century), works for the abbey of Settimo (now also lost), tempera paintings for the monks of the abbey of Certosa (also in Florence), and frescoes in the Badia at Florence.  He describes a series of paintings depicting the life of Saint Catherine of Siena in a chapel in her honor in Assisi at the Basilica of Saint Francis (an attribution rejected by later scholars), and several prominent commissions at various abbeys and convents in Pisa.  Interestingly, Vasari does not attribute the famed Pisan frescoes now associated with Buonamico to the painter, but rather, credits him with four frescoes at the Camposanto depicting the beginning of the world through the building of Noah's Ark, which later scholars have instead attributed to Piero di Puccio of Orvieto.Vasari, 1980, 118.
Vasari presents conflicting information regarding Buonamico's death, dating it to the year 1340,Vasari, 1980, 122. but also stating that he was still alive in 1351.Vasari, 1980, 109.  In any case, he is said to have died at the age of 78, in poverty, and to have been buried at the hospital of Santa Maria Novella, in Florence.Vasari, 1980, 122.

Hermann Buhl (September 21, 1924 – June 27, 1957) was an Austrian mountaineer, and is considered one of the best climbers of all time. He was particularly innovative in applying alpine style to Himalayan climbing. His accomplishments include:
Before his successful Nanga Parbat expedition, 31 people had died trying to make the first ascent.
Buhl is the only mountaineer to have made the first ascent of an eight-thousander solo. His climbing partner, Otto, was too slow in joining the ascent, so Buhl struck off alone. He returned 41 hours later, having barely survived the arduous climb to the summit, 4 miles distant from, and 4,000 feet higher than camp V. Experienced climbers, upon hearing later of Buhl's near-death climb, faulted him for making the attempt solo. Regardless, his monumental efforts, along with spending the night untethered, on the edge of a 60 degree ice slope, standing on a tiny pedestal too small to squat upon, has become mountaineering legend.
Just a few weeks after the successful first ascent of Broad Peak (with Fritz Wintersteller and Marcus Schmuck), Buhl and Kurt Diemberger made an attempt on nearby, unclimbed Chogolisa (7654 m) in alpine style. Buhl died when he fell through a cornice on the southeast ridge near the summit of Chogolisa. His body was not recovered and remains in the ice.

ISBN 0500237018 nicknamed Antonio Rossellino for the colour of his hair, was an Italian sculptor. His older brother, from whom he received his formal training, was the painter Bernardo Rossellino.
Born in Settignano, now a part of Florence, he was the youngest of five brothers, sculptors and stonecutters. He is said to have studied under Donatello and is remarkable for the sharpness and fineness of his bas-relief. His most important works are the funeral monument of Beato Marcolino (1458) for the Blackfriar Church (today a museum), Forlì, and the monument of Infante James of Coimbra, cardinal of Portugal in the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte, Florence (1461–1467).
The portrait bust of Matteo Palmieri in the Bargello is signed and dated 1468. In 1470 he made the monument for the Duchess of Amalfi, Mary of Aragon, in the Church of Monte Oliveto, Naples; the relief of the Nativity over the altar in the same place is also probably his. A statue of John the Baptist as a boy is in the Bargello; also a delicate relief of the Madonna and Child, an Ecce Homo, and a bust of Francesco Sassetti. The so-called Madonna del Latte on a pillar in the Church of Santa Croce is a memorial to Francesco Neri, who fell by the stab intended for Lorenzo de' Medici. Other reliefs of the Madonna and Child are in the Via della Spada, Florence, and in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. In the latter place is the bust of Giovanni di San Miniato, a doctor of arts and medicine, signed and dated 1456. Working in conjunction with Mino da Fiesole, Rossellino executed the reliefs of the Assumption of Mary and the Martyrdom of St. Stephen for the pulpit at Prato. A marble bust of the boy Baptist in the Pinacoteca, Faenza, and a Christ Child in the Louvre are attributed to Rossellino by some authorities.
Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Rossellino in his Lives.

Lake Powell is a reservoir on the Colorado River, straddling the border between Utah and Arizona (most of it, along with Rainbow Bridge, is in Utah). It is a major vacation spot that around 2 million people visit every year. It is the second largest man-made reservoir, by maximum water capacity, in the United States behind Lake Mead, storing [tpl]convert|24,322,000|acre.ft|m3[/tpl] of water when full. Lake Powell was created by the flooding of Glen Canyon by the controversial Glen Canyon Dam, which also led to the creation of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, a popular summer destination.  The reservoir is named for explorer John Wesley Powell, a one-armed American Civil War veteran who explored the river via three wooden boats in 1869.  In 1972, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established.  It is public land managed by the National Park Service, and available to the public for recreational purposes.  It lies in parts of Garfield, Kane, and San Juan counties in southern Utah, and Coconino County in northern Arizona.

[[Mortal sin]]

CATEGORIES: Christian law, Catholic doctrines, Christian hamartiology, Christian terms, Sins

Mortal sins ([tpl]la icon[/tpl] peccata mortalia) are in the theology of some, but not all, Christian denominations wrongful acts that condemn a person to Hell after death if unforgiven. These sins are considered "mortal" because they constitute a rupture in a person's link to God's saving grace: the person's soul becomes "dead", not merely weakened. A mortal sin does not usually mean a sin that cannot be repented; even after a mortal sin there is a chance for repentance. To Roman Catholics, repentance and a firm resolution to sin no more or to avoid occasions where one would be likely to give into sin (with at least imperfect contrition) restores the link to God's saving grace in the sacrament of penance; and restoration outside confession if the contrition is perfect. Perfect contrition rises from the love of God who has been grievously offended.[tpl]cite book|last=Hardon|first=Fr.

 If you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin, you will ask, and God will give life to such a one - to those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin that is mortal; I do not say you should pray about that. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not mortal. (NRSV)

[[High Renaissance]]

CATEGORIES: Renaissance art

In art history, High Renaissance, is the period denoting the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance. The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s, with Leonardo's fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V. This term was first used in German (Hochrenaissance) in the early nineteenth century, and has its origins in the "High Style" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann.Jill Burke, "Inventing the High Renaissance from Winckelmann to Wikipedia: an introductory essay", in: Id., Rethinking the High Renaissance: Culture and the Visual Arts in Early Sixteenth-century Rome, Ashgate, 2012 Over the last twenty years, use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works.Marcia Hall, “Classicism, Mannerism and the Relieflike Style” in The Cambridge Companion to Raphael, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 224.

Sir Nigel Playfair (1 July 1874 – 19 August 1934) was the British actor-manager of the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, London, in the 1920s. He was educated at Harrow and University College, Oxford.
Playfair starred in the Mermaid Society's well-received 1904 London production of The Way of the World by William Congreve and went on to produce a very effective modern run twenty years later at The Lyric with Edith Evans as Millamant (1924).
He produced Shakespeare's As You Like It for the opening night of the Shakespeare Festival at Stratford-upon-Avon in April 1919, and brought it back to the Lyric in April 1920. Critics derided an unconventional set and costumes by Claud Lovat Fraser, but in what Shakespearean scholar Sylvan Barnet calls the play's "first modern production", their spare, evocative design was later acknowledged as a ground-breaking departure from the unimaginatively literal Shakespearean production typical of the time.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Playfair has been credited with a major influence on the BBC's 1923 wireless Shakespeare's, the first produced by that organisation. He continued to work as a BBC producer for some years and is credited with having commissioned Richard Hughes to write the world's first radio play, Danger, which was broadcast on 15 January 1924. Playfair also appeared in a few motion picture films during the last years of his life.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

Charles Goodyear (December 29, 1800 – July 1, 1860) was an American inventor who developed a process to vulcanize rubber in 1839, which he improved while living and working in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1844, and for which he received patent number 3633 from the United States Patent Office on June 15, 1844.United States Patent Office 
Though Goodyear is often credited with its invention, modern evidence has proven that the Mesoamericans used stabilized rubber for balls and other objects as early as 1600 BC.Hosler, D., Burkett, S. L., and Tarkanian, M. J. (1999). "Prehistoric polymers: Rubber processing in ancient Mesoamerica," Science, 284(5422), pp. 1988–1991. Goodyear discovered the vulcanization process accidentally after five years of searching for a more stable rubber and stumbling upon the effectiveness of heating.Slack, Charles (2003).

Born into a modest family, Marsh was able to afford higher education thanks to the generosity of his wealthy uncle George Peabody. After graduating from Yale College in 1860 he traveled the world, studying anatomy, mineralogy and geology. He obtained a teaching position at Yale upon his return. From the 1870s to 1890s he competed with rival paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in a period of frenzied Western American expeditions known as the Bone Wars.

[[Imaginary friend]]
CATEGORIES: Children's games, Developmental psychology, Fictional characters, Interpersonal relationships, Imagination

Imaginary friends or imaginary companions are a psychological and social phenomenon where a friendship or other interpersonal relationship takes place in the imagination rather than external physical reality. Imaginary friends are fictional characters created for improvisational role-playing. They often have elaborate personalities and behaviors. Although they may seem very real to their creators, children usually understand that their imaginary friends are not real.Taylor, M. (1999) Imaginary Companions and the Children Who Create Them. New York: Oxford University Press. The first studies focusing on imaginary friends are believed to have been conducted during the 1890s.[tpl]cite journal|last=Klausen|first=Espen|coauthors=Richard H.

Imaginary friends are made often in childhood, sometimes in adolescence, and rarely in adulthood. They often function as tutelaries when played with by a child.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] They reveal, according to several theories of psychology, a child's anxieties, fears, goals and perceptions of the world through that child's conversations.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] They are, according to some children, physically indistinguishable from real people, while others say they see their imaginary friends only in their heads, and still others cannot see the friend at all but can sense his/her presence.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] Imaginary friends are more often seen as abnormal in adults, whereas quite common in children.
Few adults report having imaginary friends; however, as Eileen Kennedy-Moore points out, "Adult fiction writers often talk about their characters taking on a life of their own, which may be an analogous process to children’s invisible friends."Kennedy-Moore, Eileen (2013) "Imaginary Friends: Are invisible friends a sign of social problems?" Psychology Today; Growing Friendships blog. 31 January 2013. http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201301/imaginary-friends (accessed: 24 May 2013) In addition, Marjorie Taylor and colleagues have found that fiction writers are more likely than average to have had imaginary companions as children.Taylor, M., Hodges, S. D., & Kohányi, A. (2002-2003). The Illusion of Independent Agency: Do adult fiction writers experience their characters as having minds of their own?

George Lionel Throssell, CMG (23 May 1840 – 30 August 1910) was the second Premier of Western Australia.  He served for just three months, from 15 February 1901 until 27 May 1901 during a period of great instability in Western Australian politics.
George Throssell was born at Fermoy, County Cork in Ireland on 23 May 1840.  The son of a pensioner guard, he came to Western Australia on board the Scindian in 1850 with his parents, and was educated at the Perth Public School.  He began his own business as a produce merchant in the town of Northam in 1861 and served as the Northam postmaster from 1864 to 1874.  Throssell became owner of a flour mill, farms and a chain of shops, and was active in the Northam community.  He was first elected to the Northam Municipal Council in 1880, of which he was Chairman until 1883 and again from 1885 to 1887.  He subsequently served as Mayor of Northam for broken periods until 1894.  Throssell was popularly known as "the lion of Northam", and was Northam's first citizen in 1890 when was elected unopposed to the Legislative Assembly seat of Northam.
In 1897 Throssell joined Sir John Forrest's government as Commissioner of Crown Lands, a key responsibility in a rapidly developing colony.  When Forrest resigned as premier to join the federal parliament, Throssell took over as premier and treasurer on 15 February 1901.  However, in the election of the following April, the "ministerialists" or former Forrest supporters failed to attain a majority of seats.  On 27 May Throssell resigned as premier and as the leader of his group, but continued as MLA for Northam.  He did not contest the 1904 election for health reasons, but returned to parliament in 1907 after winning a by-election for the Legislative Council's East Province, the electoral region that included Northam.  He served until his death on 30 August 1910.
George Throssell married Annie Morrell in 1861, and was the father of at least twelve children, one of whom was Hugo Throssell.  George Throssell was created a CMG in 1901.

During his reign, which started around 520 BC, he pursued an adventurous and at times unscrupulous foreign policy aimed at crushing Argos and extending Sparta's influence both inside and outside the Peloponnese.  He was a brilliant tactician.  It was during his reign that the Peloponnesian League came formally into existence.  During his reign, he intervened twice successfully in Athenian affairs but kept Sparta out of the Ionian Revolt.  He died in prison in mysterious circumstances, with the Spartan authorities claiming his death was suicide due to insanity.

Airmail (or air mail) is a mail transport service branded and sold on the basis of being airborne. Airmail items typically arrive more quickly than surface mail, and usually cost more to send. Airmail may be the only option for sending mail to some destinations, such as overseas, if the mail cannot wait the time it would take to arrive by ship, sometimes weeks. The Universal Postal Union adopted comprehensive rules for airmail at its 1929 Postal Union Congress in London. Since the official language of the Universal Postal Union is French, airmail items world-wide are often marked  ''Par avion'' , literally: "by airplane".
For about the first half century of its existence, transportation of mail via aircraft was usually categorized and sold as a separate service (airmail) from surface mail. Today it is often the case that mail service is categorized and sold according to transit time alone, with mode of transport (land, sea, air) being decided on the back end in dynamic intermodal combinations. Thus even "regular" mail may make part of its journey on an aircraft. Such "air-speeded" mail is different from nominal airmail in its branding, price, and priority of service.

[[Zorbing]]

CATEGORIES: Outdoor recreation

Zorbing (globe-riding, sphereing, orbing) is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb, generally made of transparent plastic.  Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope, but can also be done on a level surface in pubs and clubs around the UK, permitting more rider control.  In the absence of hills some operators have constructed inflatable, wooden or metal ramps. There are two types of orbs, harnessed and non-harnessed. Non-harness orbs carry up to three riders, while the harness orbs are constructed for one to two riders. Double-harness spheres have different slope requirements, and must only be operated in specific locations.  The longer runs are approximately half a mile. The first zorbing site was established in Rotorua, New Zealand, by David and Andrew Akers.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theogo.com/About_History.html | title=History of Zorbing | publisher=Outdoor Gravity NZ Ltd | accessdate =March 1, 2010[/tpl]

Lorenzo Barcelata (July 24, 1898 – July 13, 1943) was a Mexican composer and actor born in Tlalixcoyan. He died in Mexico City from cholera, shortly before his 45th birthday. 
Barcelata came from a musically oriented family. He wrote his first song, "Arroyito", at the age of 14.  He later moved to Tampico where he formed the quartet "Cuarteto Tamaulipeco", with composer Ernesto Cortázar. Their fame quickly spread throughout the region and they received international fame when the Mexican government sent them on a tour of Cuba. While there, they were signed to perform a 52 week tour of the United States. After two of the members were fatally injured in an automobile accident, Barcelata returned to Mexico. He reformed the quartet as his fame continued to grow. Beginning in 1932, he entered the Mexican film industry and became a prominent film composer until his death. He also achieved fame as an actor as he played roles in several films.  
His most famous song is "María Elena", which was originally written for the First Lady of Mexico, the wife of president Emilio Portes Gil. Maria Elena was featured in the Mexican film by the same name. A version of it was also included on the soundtrack to the American film Bordertown. It was later translated into English and performed by the Lawrence Welk orchestra. Another English version was recorded by Jimmy Dorsey. Dorsey's version topped the charts in 1941. Wayne King also recorded an English version which reached the number 2 position during the week of June 14, runner-up only to the Dorsey version. A vocal version by Tony Pastor also reached the top 10 during that month. Maria Elena has since been recorded internationally by several different musicians. In 1958, the Brazilian group Los Indios Tabajaras recorded a version that became popular throughout Latin America and later reached the number 6 position in the US charts in 1962.
The popularity of Maria Elena resulted in Barcelata touring the United States once again. He returned to Mexico in 1943 where he was scheduled to produce several radio programs. However, he died on July 13, before recording could begin.  In total, he left behind a catalog of 214 songs, including Por ti aprendí a querer, and El Cascabel, among others.http://www.peermusic.com/peermusic/index.cfm/artist-writer/artist-details/?artist_id=413
A recording of "El Cascabel" was one of the pieces of music on the Voyager Golden Record. This version was a mariachi interpretation performed by Antonio Maciel y Las Aguilillas with El Mariachi México de Pepe Villa.

[[Kondo effect]]

CATEGORIES: Condensed matter physics, Electric and magnetic fields in matter, Physical phenomena

In physics, the Kondo effect describes the scattering of conduction electrons in a metal due to magnetic impurities, resulting in a characteristic change in electrical resistivity with temperature.[tpl]cite web |first=Alex C |last=Hewson |coauthors=Jun Kondo |year=2009 |title=Kondo effect |publisher=Scholarpedia |volume=4 |number=3 |page=7529 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.7529 |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Kondo_effect |accessdate=2009-12-18[/tpl]
The effect was first described by Jun Kondo, who applied third-order perturbation theory to the problem, which predicted that the scattering rate of conduction electrons of the magnetic impurity should diverge as the temperature approaches 0 K.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1143/PTP.32.37|format=free access|title=Resistance Minimum in Dilute Magnetic Alloys|year=1964|last1=Kondo|first1=Jun|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics|volume=32|pages=37|bibcode = 1964PThPh..32...37K [/tpl] The temperature dependence of the resistivity including the Kondo effect is written as:
where ρ0 is the residual resistance, aT2 shows the contribution from the Fermi liquid properties, and the term bT5 is from the lattice vibrations; a, b and cm are constants. Jun Kondo derived the third term of the logarithmic dependence.
Later calculations refined this result to produce a finite resistivity but retained the feature of a resistance minimum at a non-zero temperature. One defines the Kondo temperature as the energy scale limiting the validity of the Kondo results. The Anderson impurity model and accompanying renormalization theory were an important contribution to understanding the underlying physics of the problem.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.124.41|url=http://cos.cumt.edu.cn/jpkc/dxwl/zl/zl1/Physical%20Review%20Classics/condensed/061.pdf|title=Localized Magnetic States in Metals|year=1961|last1=Anderson|first1=P.|journal=Physical Review|volume=124|pages=41|bibcode = 1961PhRv..124...41A [/tpl]
The Kondo effect can be considered as an example of asymptotic freedom, i.e. a situation where the coupling becomes non-perturbatively strong at low temperatures and low energies. In the Kondo problem, the coupling refers to the interaction between the localized magnetic impurities and the itinerant electrons. 
Extended to a lattice of magnetic impurities, the Kondo effect likely explains the formation of heavy fermions and Kondo insulators in intermetallic compounds, especially those involving rare earth elements like cerium, praseodymium, and ytterbium, and actinide elements like uranium. In heavy fermion materials, the nonperturbative growth of the interaction leads to quasi-electrons with masses up to thousands of times the free electron mass, i.e., the electrons are dramatically slowed by the interactions. In a number of instances they actually are superconductors. More recently, it is believed that a manifestation of the Kondo effect is necessary for understanding the unusual metallic delta-phase of plutonium.
More recently the Kondo effect has been observed in quantum dot systems.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.281.5376.540|first=Sara M.|last=Cronenwett|year=1998 |title=A Tunable Kondo Effect in Quantum Dots|journal=Science|volume=281|number=5376|page=540-544|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5376/540.abstract|arxiv = cond-mat/9804211 |bibcode = 1998Sci...281..540C [/tpl] In such systems, a quantum dot with at least one unpaired electron behaves as a magnetic impurity, and when the dot is coupled to a metallic conduction band, the conduction electrons can scatter off the dot. This is completely analogous to the more traditional case of a magnetic impurity in a metal.

Myers v. United States, [tpl]ussc|272|52|1926[/tpl], was a United States Supreme Court decision ruling that the President has the exclusive power to remove executive branch officials, and does not need the approval of the Senate or any other legislative body.
In 1920, Frank S. Myers, a First-Class Postmaster in Portland, Oregon, was removed from office by President Woodrow Wilson. An 1876 federal law provided that "Postmasters of the first, second, and third classes shall be appointed and may be removed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate." Myers argued that his dismissal violated this law, and he was entitled to back pay for the unfilled portion of his four-year term.
Chief Justice William Howard Taft, writing for the Court, noted that the Constitution does mention the appointment of officials, but is silent on their dismissal.  An examination of the notes of the Constitutional Convention, however, showed that this silence was intentional: the Convention did discuss the dismissal of executive-branch staff, and believed it was implicit in the Constitution that the President did hold the exclusive power to remove his staff, whose existence was an extension of the President's own authority. 
The Court therefore found that the statute was unconstitutional, for it violated the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.  In reaching this decision, it also expressly found the Tenure of Office Act, which had imposed a similar requirement on other Presidential appointees and played a key role in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, to have been invalid; it had been repealed by Congress some years before this decision.

[[Black-winged Pratincole]]
CATEGORIES: Glareola, Birds of Europe, Birds of Azerbaijan, Birds of Turkey, Birds of Asia, Birds of Africa, Birds of South Africa, Birds of Cameroon, Birds of Ukraine

The Black-winged Pratincole (Glareola nordmanni) is a wader in the pratincole bird family, Glareolidae.
Their most unusual feature of the pratincoles is that although classed as waders they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground.
Black-winged Pratincole is a bird of open country, and is often seen near water in the evening, hawking for insects. This pratincole is found in warmer parts of south east Europe and south west Asia. Its 2-4 eggs are laid on the ground. It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa, and is rare north or west of the breeding range.
Black-winged Pratincole is 24–28 cm long, with short legs, long pointed wings and a long forked tail. It has a short bill, which is an adaptation to aerial feeding. The back and head are brown, and the wings are brown with black flight feathers. The belly is white and the underwings are black.
Very good views are needed to distinguish this species from other pratincoles, such as the Collared Pratincole and the Oriental Pratincole which may occur in its range. It is marginally larger than the Collared Pratincole, and is shorter-tailed and longer legged.
Although the dark underwing and lack of a white trailing edge to the wing are diagnostic, these features are not always readily seen in the field, especially as the chestnut underwing of the Collared Pratincole appears black unless excellent views are obtained.
The scientific name of this bird commemorates the Finnish-born zoologist Alexander von Nordmann.
The Black-winged Pratincole is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

[[Boxing in the 1970s]]
CATEGORIES: History of boxing, 1970s in sports

During the 1970s, boxing was characterized by dominating champions and history-making rivalries. The decade had many superstars, who also had fierce rivals. Alexis Argüello, for example, who won the world Featherweight and Jr. Lightweight titles in the '70s, had to overcome Alfredo Escalera twice before the decade was over.
At least six divisions had world champions who could be considered dominant: The Bantamweights had Rubén Olivares; the Super Bantamweights, (a division created in 1976) had Wilfredo Gómez winning the title in 1977 and keeping it until he left it vacant until 1983; the Lightweights had Roberto Durán, who won the title in 1972 and vacated it in 1979 to seek championships at other weights; the Jr. Welterweights had Antonio Cervantes, who reigned twice; the Middleweights had Carlos Monzón, sometimes referred to as King Carlos because of his seven-year reign as champion; the Light-Heavyweights had Bob Foster.  The Heavyweights, of course, had Muhammad Ali, who ruled twice between 1974 and 1979.
Another aspect of boxing in the 1970s is that the decade is considered by a few to be the best ever for the Heavyweight division: Ali returned in 1970 from his forced retirement, and Joe Frazier was world champion when Ali returned. Former world champions Jimmy Ellis and Floyd Patterson as well as George Foreman, Oscar Bonavena, Jerry Quarry, Earnie Shavers, Leon Spinks, Ken Norton, as well as Larry Holmes, Ron Stander, Chuck Wepner, Jose King Roman, Light Heavyweight champ Foster, John Tate, Jimmy Young, Ron Lyle, Joe Bugner, Scott LeDoux and many others added intrigue to the division. Don King surged as a leading boxing promoter, and champions Duran, Monzon and Ali had historic rivalries with Esteban De Jesús, Rodrigo Valdez and Frazier, respectively.

[[Oriental Pratincole]]

CATEGORIES: Glareola, Birds of Japan, Birds of India, Birds of Pakistan, Birds of Western Australia

The Oriental Pratincole (Glareola maldivarum), also known as the Grasshopper-Bird or Swallow-Plover is a wader in the pratincole family, Glareolidae.
Their most unusual feature of the pratincoles is that although classed as waders they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground.
These are birds of open country, and are often seen near water in the evening, hawking for insects. These pratincoles are found in warmer parts of south and east Asia, breeding from Northern Pakistan and the Kashmir region across into China  and south west.  Their 2-3 eggs are laid on the ground. They are migratory, wintering in both India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australasia. They are rare north or west of the breeding range, but, amazingly, this species has occurred as far away as Great Britain more than once. The first record for the Western Palearctic was in Suffolk, England in June 1981.Burns, David W. (1993) Oriental Pratincole: new to the Western Palearctic British Birds 86(3): 115-20
These birds have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails. They have short bills, which is an adaptation to aerial feeding. The back and head are brown, and the wings are brown with black flight feathers. The belly is white. The underwings are chestnut.
Very good views are needed to distinguish this species from other pratincoles, such as the very similar Collared Pratincole, which also has a chestnut underwing, and Black-winged Pratincole which shares the black upperwing flight feathers and lack of a white trailing edge to the wing. These features are not always readily seen in the field, especially as the chestnut underwing appears black unless excellent views are obtained.
On the 7th of February 2004, 2.5 million Oriental Pratincoles were recorded on Eighty Mile Beach in Australia's north-west by the Australasian Wader Studies Group.  There had previously been no record of this magnitude and it is supposed that weather conditions caused much of the world's population of this species to congregate in one area.

The World of David the Gnome, originally titled David, el Gnomo (also known as David, the Gnome), is a Spanish animated television series based on the children's book The Secret Book of Gnomes, by the Dutch author Wil Huygen and illustrator Rien Poortvliet.http://www.foundus.com/GnoQueen/secret.htm The program was originally created in Spain by BRB Internacional (who were also responsible for the Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds franchise and other cartoons such as Bobobobs and Around the World with Willy Fog) titled David el Gnomo, and retains a sense of the lush illustrations of the original books. Twenty-six episodes were produced. There was also a spin-off series entitled Wisdom of the Gnomes.
The English language dub The World of David the Gnome was produced by Canadian studio Cinar (now Cookie Jar Entertainment, and now part of DHX Media), in association with Miramax Films. Christopher Plummer narrated, with the voice of David the Gnome being provided by Tom Bosley.

Are You Afraid of the Dark? is a Canadian/American horror/fantasy-themed anthology television series. The original series was created by DJ MacHale and Ned Kandel, and was picked up by Nickelodeon in 1991.  MacHale, Kandel, and Nickelodeon teamed up with the Canadian company Cinar, and as a part of the deal the show was filmed in Richmond, British Columbia and in the  Greater Montreal area of Quebec, including their suburbs.
The episode "The Tale of the Twisted Claw" was aired as a pilot on the evening of Halloween in October 1990 in Canada. Are You Afraid of the Dark? was aired from August 15, 1992 to April 20, 1996 on Nickelodeon's SNICK. The series also aired on the Canadian television network YTV from October 30, 1990 until June 11, 2000. The show was both a critical and commercial success, garnering numerous awards as the series progressed.[tpl]cite web|title=Are You Afraid of the Dark? - Awards - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103352/awards?ref_=tt_ql_4|accessdate=2013-10-17[/tpl]
A revived series with new directors, writers, and cast was produced by Nickelodeon from 1999 to 2000 and also aired on SNICK. The sole member from the original lineup to return for the sixth and seventh seasons was Tucker (Daniel DeSanto), although Gary (Ross Hull) returned for the concluding miniseries, which notably broke from the show's established format by blurring the line between story and "reality".

Julian Morton Carroll (born April 16, 1931) is an American politician from the state of Kentucky. A Democrat, he is a member of the Kentucky Senate, representing Anderson, Franklin, Woodford, and part of Fayette counties. From 1974 to 1979, he served as the 54th Governor of Kentucky, succeeding Wendell H. Ford, who resigned to accept a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was the first Kentucky governor from the state's far-western Jackson Purchase region, and his running mate Thelma Stovall was the first woman to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky.
After graduating from the University of Kentucky and spending three years as an Air Force lawyer, Carroll returned to McCracken County, Kentucky where he gained acclaim for leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to provide low-cost electricity to the county. He was elected to the first of five terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1962 and served as Speaker of that body from 1968 to 1970. He ran for Lieutenant Governor in 1970 on an informal ticket with former Governor Bert T. Combs. Combs lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, but Carroll defeated his primary opponents and went on to win the general election. He was elevated to the governorship in 1975 due to Ford's election to the Senate, and won a full term in his own right in 1976.
As Governor, Carroll increased funding for public education and promoted the use of coal as a means of alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, he was elected to the Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, his current term will expire in 2017.

[[Bus sniffing]]
CATEGORIES: Cache coherency

Bus sniffing or Bus snooping is a technique used in distributed shared memory systems and multiprocessors to  achieve cache coherence. Although there is one main memory, there are several caches (one or more per processor), and unless preventative steps are taken, the same memory location may be loaded into two caches, and given two different values. To prevent this, every cache controller monitors the bus, listening for broadcasts which may cause it to invalidate its cache line.
Each cache line is in one of the following states: "dirty" (has been updated by local processor), "valid", "invalid" or "shared".  The set of operations is thus: a value can be read or written.  Writing it changes the value.  Each value is either in main memory (which is very slow to access), or in one or more local caches (which is fast).  When a block is first loaded in the cache it is marked "valid".
On a read miss to the local cache, the read request is broadcast on the bus. All cache controllers monitor the bus. If one has cached that address and it is in the state "dirty", it changes the state to "valid" and sends the copy to requesting node.  The "valid" state means that the cache line is current.
On a local write miss (an attempt to write that value is made, but it's not in the cache), bus snooping ensures that any copies in other caches are set to "invalid". "Invalid" means that a copy used to exist in the cache, but it is no longer current. 
When writing a block in state "valid" its state is changed to "dirty" and a broadcast is sent out to all cache controllers to invalidate their copies.
Since snooping does not scale well, larger cache coherent NUMA (ccNUMA) systems tend to use directory-based coherence protocols.

[[Duke of Burgundy]]

CATEGORIES: Dukes of Burgundy, Lists of French nobility

Duke of Burgundy (Fr.: duc de Bourgogne) was a title borne by the rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy, a small portion of traditional lands of Burgundians west of river Saône which in 843 was allotted to Charles the Bald's kingdom of West Franks. Under the Ancien Regime, the Duke of Burgundy was the premier lay peer of the kingdom of France.
Beginning with Robert II of France, the title has been held by the Capetians, the French royal family. It was granted to Robert's younger son, Robert, who founded the House of Burgundy. When the senior line of the House of Burgundy became extinct, it was inherited by John II of France through proximity of blood. John granted the duchy as an appanage for his younger son, Philip the Bold. The Valois Dukes of Burgundy became dangerous rivals to the senior line of the House of Valois. When the male line of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy became extinct, it was confiscated by Louis XI of France. From then on, the title was never given again to a younger son. 
Today, the title is used by the House of Bourbon as a revived courtesy title.

[[Antagonistic contradiction]]
CATEGORIES: Maoism, Marxism, Maoist terminology

Antagonistic contradiction (Chinese language: 矛盾; Pinyin: Máo dùn) is the impossibility of compromise between different social classes. The term is most often applied in Maoist theory, which holds that differences between the two primary classes, the working class/proletariat and the bourgeoisie are so great that there is no way to bring about a reconciliation of their views. Because the groups involved have diametrically opposed concerns, their objectives are so dissimilar and contradictory that no mutually acceptable resolution can be found. Nonantagonistic contradictions may be resolved through mere debate, but antagonistic contradictions can only be resolved through struggle.
The term is usually attributed to Vladimir Lenin, although he may never have actually used the term in any of his written works.
In Maoism, the antagonistic contradiction was usually that between the peasantry and the landowning class. Mao Zedong expressed his views on the policy in his famous February 1957 speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

Brookside is  a British soap opera set in Liverpool, England. The series began on the launch night of Channel 4 on 2 November 1982, and ran for 21 years until 4 November 2003. Originally intended to be called Meadowcroft,20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White. Page 13 the series was produced by Mersey Television and it was conceived by Phil Redmond who also devised Grange Hill (1978–2008) and Hollyoaks (1995–present).
Brookside became very successful for a number of years and is notable for its tackling of realistic and socially challenging storylines. It was at its most popular in the 1980s and the early 1990s. From the mid-1990s it began raising more controversial subjects under the guidance of new producers such as Mal Young and Paul Marquess. It is especially well known for broadcasting the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss on British television in 1994, as well as a powerful domestic abuse storyline resulting in murder. In 1996, the series caused an uproar when it featured a storyline of a consensual incestuous sexual relationship between two sibling characters. Brookside was also the first British soap to feature an openly gay character when Gordon Collins came out in 1985, and it was also the first to depict serious drug addiction with a number of different characters. Although the series had a long and successful run, by 2000 its viewing figures were in terminal decline and low ratings eventually led to its cancellation in 2003.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2982768.stm|title=Brookside is finally axed|date=11 June 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 January 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/66qzGKD5f | archivedate = 2012-04-11| deadurl=no[/tpl] The final episode was broadcast on 4 November 2003 and was watched by around 2 million viewers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3238427.stm |title=Brookside bows out after 21 years|date=5 November 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3243589.stm|title=Two million watch Brookside's end|date=5 November 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 January 2010[/tpl]
The first episode of Brookside was repeated as part of Channel 4 at 25 on 1 October 2007. The episode aired on More4 in a season of celebratory Channel 4 programmes to mark the channel's first quarter century. Several classic episodes have also been available to view on 4oD, an online service, since 2009.
After 5 years of campaigning by fans led by Lee Brady from 2007 to early 2012, a special DVD was released at the end of November 2012, just over 30 years after the series originally began, titled Brookside Most Memorable Moments. It features clips and episodes from every year of the programme's 21 year history.

Rockefeller Republican (or "liberal Republican") was a faction of the American Republican Party who held moderate to liberal views on domestic issues similar to those of Nelson Rockefeller, Governor of New York (1959-1973) and later Vice President of the United States (1974–77). The term largely fell out of use by the end of the twentieth century, and has been replaced by the terms "moderate Republican"  and, pejoratively, "RINO" (Republican In Name Only).Nicol Rae. Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: 1952 to The Present (1989)   Rockefeller Republicans were  typically center-right, vehemently rejected conservatives like Barry Goldwater and his policies, and were often, but not necessarily, culturally liberal. They espoused government and private investments in environmentalism, healthcare, and higher education as necessities for the nation's growth, in the tradition of Nelson Rockefeller. In general, Rockefeller Republicans opposed socialism and the redistribution of wealth while supporting some regulation of business and federal social programs in matters pertaining to the public good. A critical element in the Republican liberalism was their support for labor unions. The building trades, especially, appreciated the heavy spending on infrastructure. In turn, the unions gave these politicians enough support to overcome the anti-union rural element in the Republican Party. As the unions weakened after the 1970, so too did the need for Republicans to cooperate with them. This transformation played into the hands of the more conservative Republicans, who did not want to collaborate with labor unions in the first place, and now no longer needed to do so carry statewide elections.
In foreign policy, most were "hawks" against communism and strong supporters of American business abroad. Richard Nixon, a moderate establishment Republican within the Party's contemporary ideological framework, but who ran against Rockefeller from the Right in 1968 and was widely identified with the cultural Right of the time, nevertheless was influenced by this tradition within his party (much stronger then than since 1994) as he founded the Environmental Protection Agency, supported expanded welfare programs, imposed wage and price controls  in 1971 announced he was a Keynesian.Richard Reeves, President Nixon: Alone in the White House (2002) p. 295 Rockefeller Republicans were most  common in the New England, West Coast, and the Middle Atlantic States, where there historically were larger liberal constituencies.Reiter (1981)

[[Gröbner basis]]
CATEGORIES: Algebraic geometry, Commutative algebra, Computer algebra, Invariant theory, Rewriting systems

In mathematics, and more specifically in computer algebra, computational algebraic geometry, and computational commutative algebra, a Gröbner basis is a particular kind of generating set of an ideal in a polynomial ring over a field [tpl]nowrap|K..,xn[/tpl]. A Gröbner basis allows many important properties of the ideal and the associated algebraic variety to be deduced easily, such as the dimension and the number of zeros when it is finite. Gröbner basis computation is one of the main practical tools for solving systems of polynomial equations and computing the images of algebraic varieties under projections or rational maps.
Gröbner basis computation can be seen as a multivariate, non-linear generalization of both Euclid's algorithm for computing polynomial greatest common divisors, and
Gaussian elimination for linear systems.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/3-540-12868-9_99|noedit[/tpl]
Gröbner bases were introduced in 1965, together with an algorithm to compute them (Buchberger's algorithm), by Bruno Buchberger in his Ph.D. thesis. He named them after his advisor Wolfgang Gröbner. In 2007, Buchberger received the Association for Computing Machinery's Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for this work. 
An analogous concept for local rings was developed independently by Heisuke Hironaka in 1964, who named them standard bases.
The theory of Gröbner bases has been extended by many authors in various directions. It has been generalized to other structures such as polynomials over principal ideal rings or polynomial rings, and also some classes of non-commutative rings and algebras.

[[Correctness (computer science)]]

CATEGORIES: Formal methods terminology, Theoretical computer science

In theoretical computer science, correctness of an algorithm is asserted when it is said that the algorithm is correct with respect to a specification. Functional correctness refers to the input-output behaviour of the algorithm (i.e., for each input it produces the correct output) [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl].
A distinction is made between total correctness, which additionally requires that the algorithm terminates, and partial correctness, which simply requires that if an answer is returned it will be correct. Since there is no general solution to the halting problem, a total correctness assertion may lie much deeper. A termination proof is a type of mathematical proof that plays a critical role in formal verification because total correctness of an algorithm depends on termination [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl].
For example, successively searching through integers 1, 2, 3, … to see if we can find an example of some phenomenon — say an odd perfect number — it is quite easy to write a partially correct program (using long division by two to check n as perfect or not). But to say this program is totally correct would be to assert something currently not known in number theory.
A proof would have to be a mathematical proof, assuming both the algorithm and specification are given formally. In particular it is not expected to be a correctness assertion for a given program implementing the algorithm on a given machine. That would involve such considerations as limitations on computer memory.
A deep result in proof theory, the Curry-Howard correspondence, states that a proof of functional correctness in constructive logic corresponds to a certain program in the lambda calculus. Converting a proof in this way is called program extraction.
Hoare logic is a specific formal system for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs.

[[Tamper resistance]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptography, Security, Packaging

Tamper resistance is resistance to tampering (intentional malfunction or sabotage) by either the normal users of a product, package, or system or others with physical access to it. There are many reasons for employing tamper resistance.
Tamper resistance ranges from simple features like screws with special drives, more complex devices that render themselves inoperable or encrypt all data transmissions between individual chips, or use of materials needing special tools and knowledge.  Tamper-resistant devices or features are common on packages to deter package or product tampering.
Anti-tamper devices have one or more components:
tamper resistance,
tamper detection,
tamper response, and
tamper evidence.

In some applications, devices are only tamper-evident rather than tamper-resistant.

It is maintained by Stanford University.  Each entry is written and maintained by an expert in the field, including professors from many academic institutions worldwide. Authors contributing to the Encyclopedia give Stanford University the permission to publish the articles but retain the copyright to those articles.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Copyright Information As of November 2, 2012, the SEP has 1335 published entries.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Entries by First Publication Date Listed in Reverse Chronological Order  Apart from its online status, the encyclopedia uses the traditional academic approach of most encyclopedias and academic journals to achieve quality by means of specialist authors selected by an editor or an editorial committee which is competent (though not necessarily a specialist) in the field covered by the encyclopedia and peer review.
The encyclopedia was created in 1995 by Edward N. Zalta, with the explicit aim of providing a dynamic encyclopedia which is updated regularly, and so does not become dated in the manner of print encyclopedias.  The charter for the encyclopedia allows for rival articles on a single topic to reflect reasoned disagreements amongst scholars.

[[The Crown]]

CATEGORIES: Common law, Monarchy, Legal fictions

In English jurisprudence, the Crown is the state in all its aspects. In countries that do not have a monarchy, the concept may be expressed as "the State" or "the people", or some political entity, such as "the United States", "the Commonwealth" or "the State of name".
Legally, the Crown is a corporation sole that, in the Commonwealth realms, Crown dependencies and any of its provincial or state sub-divisions, represents the legal embodiment of executive, legislative, or judicial governance. It evolved first in the United Kingdom as a separation of the literal crown and property of the nation state from the person and personal property of the monarch. The concept spread via British colonisation, and is now rooted in the legal lexicon of the other 15 independent realms. In this context it should not be confused with any physical crown, such as those of the British state regalia.
The term is also found in expressions such as crown land, which some countries refer to as public land or state land, as well as in some offices such as Minister of the Crown, Crown attorney and Crown prosecutor (other terms being District attorney, State prosecutor or public prosecutor).

A heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method for computer software that helps to identify usability problems in the user interface (UI) design.  It specifically involves evaluators examining the interface and judging its compliance with recognized usability principles (the "heuristics").  These evaluation methods are now widely taught and practiced in the new media sector, where UIs are often designed in a short space of time on a budget that may restrict the amount of money available to provide for other types of interface testing.

Non-Inscrits (abbreviated NI; [tpl]lang-en|Non-Attached Members[/tpl], abbreviated NAthe English name is also official, but the French name is prevalent even in English texts) are Members of the European Parliament (MEP) who do not sit in one of the recognized political groups.
The MEPs may be part of a national party, or a European political party, but for a political grouping in parliament to be formed there need to be 25 MEPs from seven different states. Being part of a group grants access to state funds and committee seats but the group members must be ideologically tied. Groups of convenience, such as the Technical Group of Independents that previously existed, are no longer allowed and the minimum requirements of groups have been raised forcing less numerous elements to sit as NIs.
Political ideologies displayed by the Non-Inscrits range from social liberalism to populism, conservatism, national conservatism and nationalism. As of 2009 however, the Non-Inscrits mostly consists of far-right parties.http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/07/party-griffin-bnp-european

Lega Nord (North League, LN, Lega, often referred to as Northern League by English-language media), whose complete name is Lega Nord per l'Indipendenza della Padania (North League for the Independence of Padania), is a federalist and regionalist political party in Italy. It was founded by Umberto Bossi in 1991 as a federation of several regional parties of northern and central Italy, most of which had arisen and expanded their share of the electorate over the 1980s.
The founding parties of Lega Nord were Lega Lombarda, Liga Veneta, Piemont Autonomista, Uniun Ligure, Lega Emiliano-Romagnola, Alleanza Toscana, plus the newly formed regional parties of the other northern regions.
In popular usage the party is generally referred to simply as Lega and is frequently nicknamed il Carroccio in newspapers, after a four-wheeled war altar drawn by oxen, used by the medieval republics of northern Italy which formed the Lombard League in opposition to the imperialist design of Frederick I Barbarossa.
Lega Nord's political programme advocates the transformation of Italy into a federal state, fiscal federalism and greater regional autonomy, especially for the northern regions. At times it has advocated secession of the North, which it calls Padania. Prior to the party's adoption of the term, Padania was infrequently used to name the Padanian-Venetian Plain and was promoted since 1963 by sports journalist Gianni Brera as a modern name for Cisalpine Gaul.
The long-standing leader of the party has been Umberto Bossi, who was Minister for Federal Reform in Berlusconi IV Cabinet. From 2012 to 2013, the party secretary was Roberto Maroni, President of Lombardy and former Minister of the Interior, then in December 2013 Matteo Salvini became the new secretary after defeating Umberto Bossi in the leadership election. Leading members include Luca Zaia (President of Veneto), Roberto Cota (President of Piedmont), Flavio Tosi, Roberto Calderoli, Roberto Castelli, Francesco Speroni, Giancarlo Giorgetti, Massimo Bitonci, Lorenzo Fontana and Attilio Fontana.
At the 2010 regional elections Lega Nord was the largest party in Veneto, the second largest in Lombardy, the third largest in Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Liguria.

Sir Apolo Kagwa (standard Luganda orthography spelling Kaggwa) [tpl]Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George[/tpl] MBE (1864[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]1927)Encyclopaedia Britannica is considered Buganda's first and foremost ethnographer. He was appointed prime minister (Katikkiro) of the Kingdom of Buganda by King Mwanga II in 1890, and served in that capacity until 1926. From 1897, Kagwa served as regent until 1914 when the infant King Daudi Chwa came of age.
Apolo Kagwa was an administrative apprentice at the Royal palace of Buganda when the first Christian missionaries arrived in the 1870s. These palace apprentices, referred to as "pages" by European historians of the era, were bright youths from all over the kingdom sent to the palace to train as the next generation of leaders. He was one of the earliest converts to the Protestant faith, and nearly became one of the Uganda Martyrs when King Mwanga II fell out with the Christians a few years later. He was reportedly spared execution because he had already shown himself to be exceptionally capable as an assistant in the Treasury. 
From 1885 to 1887 the kingdom fell into a religious civil war with Protestants, Catholics and Moslem factions vying for control. Kagwa, still in his twenties, was from early on recognised as the leader of the Protestant faction. A keen rifleman,Wright, M. Buganda in the heroic Age, Oxford University Press 1971 Kagwa served actively in combat during these wars. The Moslems were in ascendancy in the early part of the war, and Kagwa and other Protestants spent some time in exile in the neighboring kingdom of Ankole. King Mwanga, temporarily deposed, was restored in 1890 with the assistance of the Protestants, and Kagwa was named Katikkiro (Prime Minister). King Mwanga was again deposed in 1897 when he rejected British rule and led an unsuccessful fight for independence. An infant prince, Daudi Chwa, was named King with Kagwa as one of three regents. Kagwa was one of the negotiators of the Uganda Agreement, by which Buganda became a British protectorate with limited internal autonomy. 
Kagwa authored many books on Buganda, including a general history Bassekabaka ba Buganda, a treatise on laws and customs Empisa z'Abaganda and a collection of folklore Engero z'Abaganda. His history of Buganda included brief histories of the neighboring kingdoms of Bunyoro and Ankole. He was a strong supporter of the establishment of modern education in Uganda. In particular, he was appalled by what he saw as a tendency of the sons of the nation's leaders to grow up spoiled (in contrast to the spartan upbringing his generation received from the palace apprenticeship system). He worked with British missionaries to establish boarding schools, notably King's College Budo, explicitly to keep young noblemen from growing up spoiled.Hattersley, C.W. The Baganda at Home. Frank Cass Ltd, 1968
His manuscripts and personal papers are in the Africana collection of the Makerere University library in Kampala.
During the later years of his ministry his relationship with the British colonial government was tense; Kagwa believed Buganda's autonomy was being repeatedly encroached upon. 
He was the first African to receive the honour of knighthood.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] In 1918 he was made an honorary member of the Order of the British Empire for services in raising and organising native levies and local Defence Corps in the Uganda Protectorate.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=30576|supp=y|startpage=3289|date=12 March 1918[/tpl]
He had 23 children, including Michael Kawalya Kagwa (who served as Buganda's Katikiro from 1945 to 1950)World Statesmen: Uganda His grandchildren include Apollo Kironde, Uganda's first Ambassador to the United Nations. And his Great Grand children include Rebecca Kakonge, and James Lule.

[[Monomial]]

CATEGORIES: Homogeneous polynomials, Algebra

In mathematics, a monomial is, roughly speaking, a polynomial which has only one term. Two different definitions of a monomial may be encountered:
In the context of Laurent polynomials and Laurent series, the exponents of a monomial may be negative, and in the context of Puiseux series, the exponents may be rational numbers.
Since the word "polynomial" comes from "poly-" plus the Greek word "νομός" (nomós, meaning part, portion), a monomial should theoretically be called a "mononomial". "Monomial" is a syncope of "mononomial".American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 1969.

Bozo the Clown is a clown character very popular in the United States, peaking in the 1960s as a result of widespread franchising in early television.
Originally created by Alan W. Livingston for a children's storytelling record-album and illustrative read-along book set and portrayed by Pinto Colvig, the character became very popular during the 1940s and was a mascot for record company Capitol Records.
The character first appeared on television in 1949 starring Pinto Colvig. After the creative rights to Bozo were purchased by Larry Harmon in 1956, the character became a common franchise across the United States, with local television stations producing their own Bozo shows featuring the character. Harmon bought out his business partners in 1965 and produced Bozo's Big Top for syndication to local television markets not producing their own Bozo shows in 1966, while Chicago's Bozo's Circus which premiered in 1960, went national via cable and satellite in 1978.
The most notable performers to have played Bozo, aside from Colvig and Harmon, include Willard Scott (1959-1962), Frank Avruch (1966–1970s), Bob Bell (1960–1984) and Joey D'Auria (1984–2001). Bozo TV shows were also produced in other countries including Mexico, Thailand, Australia, Greece and Brazil. Larry Harmon claimed that more than 200 actors have portrayed the clown.

CATEGORIES: Counties of Scotland, Vernacular geography

The shires or counties of Scotland ([tpl]lang-gd|Siorrachdan na h-Alba[/tpl]) are historic subdivisions of Scotland.
Scottish shires each sent Commissioners (MPs) to the Scottish Parliament. They trace their origins to the mormaerdoms, stewartries and sheriffdoms of the High Middle Ages. Many of these early entities, while sharing a root of a name with a later shire, represent a greater or smaller area. The case of the Mormaerdom of Moray, which included parts the later shires of Moray, and of Nairnshire, Banffshire and Inverness-shire, is an example of this difference.http://www.scottishhistory.com/articles/early/thanes/sheriffs_page3.html
By the reign of James IV, the sheriffdoms were used to select Commissioners (MPs) to the Parliament of Scotland, forming the basis of the "landward constituencies", which existed distinct from the burgh constituencies until the Representation of the People Act 1918. Before the Union of 1707, Commissioners could represent multiple counties, or, on occasions, a part of one. After Union, eight counties were paired, electing a member at alternating elections to the Unreformed House of Commons. A number of sheriffdoms, such as those of Ross and Cromartyshire were also merged during the 18th century. As a result of the 1832 Reform Act the pairing system ended, and Elginshire and Nairnshire were merged into a single constituency, as were Ross and Cromartyshire and also Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire. Bute and Caithness, previously paired, became separate constituencies.
Scotland still has county constituencies of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Westminster), and the same term is used in reference to constituencies of the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood), created in 1999.
Historically, county constituencies did represent specific counties (minus parliamentary burghs within the counties). Now, however, county in county constituency means predominantly rural. Similarly, burgh constituencies are predominantly urban constituencies.

[[Induced representation]]
CATEGORIES: Group theory

In mathematics, and in particular group representation theory, the induced representation is one of the major general operations for passing from a representation of a subgroup [tpl]mvar|H[/tpl] to a representation of the (whole)  group [tpl]mvar|G[/tpl] itself. It was initially defined as a construction by Frobenius, for linear representations of finite groups. It includes as special cases the action of [tpl]mvar|G[/tpl] on the cosets [tpl]math|G/H[/tpl] by permutation, which is the case of the induced representation starting with the trivial one-dimensional representation of [tpl]mvar|H[/tpl]. If [tpl]math|H [tpl]=[/tpl] {e} [/tpl] this becomes the regular representation of [tpl]mvar|G[/tpl]. Therefore induced representations are rich objects, in the sense that they include or detect many interesting representations. The idea is by no means limited to the case of finite groups, but the theory in that case is particularly well-behaved.

The Japanese Communist Party  (JCP, [tpl]lang-ja|日本共産党[/tpl], Nihon Kyōsan-tō) is a left-wing political party in Japan.
The JCP advocates the establishment of a society based on socialism, democracy, peace, and opposition to militarism. It proposes to achieve these objectives by working within the framework of capitalism in order to achieve its goals,http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040118a2.html while still struggling against what it describes as "imperialism and its subordinate ally, monopoly capital." Although it is a Marxist party, the JCP does not advocate socialist revolution; it proposes a "democratic revolution" to achieve "democratic change in politics and the economy", and "the complete restoration of Japan's national sovereignty", which it sees as infringed by Japan's security alliance with the United States although it firmly defends Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan.
Following the most recent general election, held on December 16, 2012, the party holds eight seats in the House of Representatives and following the most recent councillors election, held on July 21, 2013, the party holds eleven seats in the House of Councillors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/japanese/joho1/kousei/eng/members/index.htm |title=List of Members of the House of Councillors|publisher=www.sangiin.go.jp |date=2013-08-01 |accessdate=2013-08-02[/tpl]

The County of London was a county of England from 1889 to 1965, corresponding to the area known today as Inner London. It was created as part of the general introduction of elected county government in England, by way of the Local Government Act 1888. The Act created an administrative County of London, which included within its territory the City of London. However, the City of London and the County of London formed separate counties for "non-administrative" purposes.Robson 1939, pp. 80–92. The local authority for the county was the London County Council (LCC), which initially performed only a limited range of functions, but gained further powers during its 76-year existence. The LCC provided very few services within the City of London, where the ancient Corporation monopolised local governance, as it still does. In 1900 the lower-tier civil parishes and district boards were replaced with 28 new metropolitan boroughs. The territory of the county was [tpl]convert|74903|acre|km2[/tpl] in 1961. During its existence there was a long-term decline in population as more residents moved into the outer suburbs; there were periodic reviews of the local government structures in the greater London area and several failed attempts to expand the boundaries of the county. In 1965, the London Government Act 1963 replaced the county with the much larger Greater London administrative area.

[[Chinese house church]]

CATEGORIES: Christianity in China, Roman Catholic Church in China, Christian movements

Chinese house churches ([tpl]zh|c=中國家庭教會|p=Zhōngguó jiātíng jiàohuì[/tpl], also known as 地下教會 dìxià jiàohuì and 地下天國 dìxià tiānguó) are a religious movement of unregistered assemblies of Christians in the People's Republic of China, which operate independently of the government run Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC) for Protestant groups and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CCPA) and the Chinese Catholic Bishops Council (CCBC) for Catholics.  They are also known as the "Underground" Church or the "Unofficial" Church. They are called "house churches" because as they are not officially registered organizations, they cannot independently own property and hence they meet in private house.
The Chinese house church movement developed after 1949 as a result of the Communist government policy which requires the registration of all religious organizations. This registration policy requires churches to become part of the TSPM/CCC set-up, which may involve interference in the church's internal affairs either by government officials or by TSPM/CCC officials, who are approved by the Communist Party of China's United Front Work Department. During the Cultural Revolution of 1966–76 all Christian worship was forced underground.
Since the 1990s there have been cases of increasing official tolerance in various regions of house churches. Most observers believe that the opposition of house churches by government officials arises less from an ideological opposition to religion and support of atheism, and more out of fear of potential disturbances to orderly society from mass mobilization of believers, similar to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and mass protests of Falun Gong members in Beijing in 1999.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]
Protestant house churches are indigenous to mainland China and are usually not under foreign control. This assertion of strictly native support is important in the PRC political discourse, since Christian churches and missionaries have sometimes historically been seen as tools of imperialism. In addition, at least with the Protestant churches there is no central church hierarchy, a fact that is commonly cited as a reason why house churches are seen as less threatening and subject to less overt opposition by the Communist officials.
Chinese house churches have indigenous forms of worship and usually use their own songs. One collection of Chinese house church worship songs, Jiānán Shīxuăn; "Songs from Canaan") has been made into a book, with audio of some of the songs available.
Chinese Roman Catholic house churches generally recognize the authority of the Pope in contrast to the official Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association where such recognition is not possible because Papal Supremacy is not only doctrinal but also because he heads the Vatican, an external nation State. The role of Catholic house churches is a major complication in the official diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the People's Republic of China.
In the past two decades, a number of house church networks have developed, headquartered mainly in Henan and Zhejiang provinces. These networks have sent missionaries all over the country and have even started sending them abroad to neighboring states.[tpl]cite book|last=Aikman|first=David|title = Jesus in Beijing|publisher=Regnery Publishing |date=2003-10-25|isbn=0-89526-128-6[/tpl]

The  Cream-coloured Courser (Cursorius cursor) is a wader in the pratincole and courser family, Glareolidae.
Although classed as waders, these are birds of dry open country, preferably semi-desert, where they typically hunt their insect prey by running on the ground.
These coursers are found in Canary Islands, north Africa and southwest Asia. Their two eggs are laid in a ground scrape. They are partially migratory, with northern and northwestern birds wintering in India, Arabia and across the southern edge of the Sahara. Some birds also breed in the southern desert regions in northwestern India and Pakistan.Rahmani,Asad R; Manakadan,Ranjit (1989): Breeding records of Creamcoloured Courser Cursorius cursor cursor (Latham) from India. J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.  86(3), 447-448.
They are rare north of the breeding range, but this species has occurred as far away as Finland, Ireland and Great Britain.
These birds have long legs and long wings. They have slightly downcurved bills. The body plumage is sandy in colour, fading to whitish on the lower belly. The upperwing primary feathers and the underwings are black. The crown and nape are grey, and there is a black eyestripe and white supercilium.
In flight this species resembles a pratincole, with its relaxed wingbeats, pointed wings and dark underwings.

It became the Royal Astronomical Society in 1831 on receiving its Royal Charter from William IV.  A Supplemental Charter in 1915 opened up the fellowship to women.  It is the UK adhering organisation to the International Astronomical Union and a member of the Science Council, and encourages and promotes the study of astronomy, solar-system science, geophysics and closely related branches of science.RAS Website "About the RAS" page; Meetings are held in Burlington House, in Piccadilly, London and across the United Kingdom (UK). They are involved in the production of astronomical journals and periodicals. The society has over 3000 members, around a third of whom live outside the UK. In addition, those members of the public who have an interest in astronomy and geophysics and wish to support the work of the society may become Friends of the RAS.

[[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland]]

CATEGORIES: Lieutenancy areas of Scotland, Scotland geography-related lists

The lieutenancy areas of Scotland are the areas used for the ceremonial lord-lieutenants, the monarch's representatives, in Scotland.  The lord-lieutenants' titles chosen by the monarch and her legal advisers are mainly based on placenames of the traditional counties of Scotland. In 1794 permanent lieutenancies were established by Royal Warrant. By the Militia Act 1797 (37 Geo.3, C.103), the lieutenants appointed "for the Counties, Stewartries, Cities, and Places" were given powers to raise and command County Militia Units.
While in their lieutenancies, lord lieutenants are among the few individuals in Scotland officially permitted to fly the Royal Standard of Scotland, the "Lion Rampant" as it is more commonly known.
Lieutenancy areas are different from the current local government council areas and their committee areas. They also differ from other subdivisions of Scotland including sheriffdoms and former regions and districts.
The Lord Provosts of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow also act ex officio as lord-lieutenants. This is a unique right in the United Kingdom: all other lord-lieutenants are appointed by the monarch, rather than being elected politicians.

Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a 1971 American musical film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution Company in North America on December 13, 1971. It is based upon the books The Magic Bed Knob; or, How to Become a Witch in Ten Easy Lessons (1943) and Bonfires and Broomsticks (1945) by English children's author Mary Norton. The film, which combines live action and animation, stars Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson.
The film is frequently compared to Mary Poppins (1964): combining live action and animation and partly set in the streets of London. It shares some of the cast from Mary Poppins, namely Tomlinson, supporting actor Reginald Owen (in his last film role) and Arthur Malet, (Restored Version Only) a similar filmcrew, songwriters the Sherman Brothers, director Robert Stevenson, art director Peter Ellenshaw, and music director Irwin Kostal.'Bedknobs and Broomsticks: Cast & Crew' movies.msn.com'Bedknobs & Broomsticks' Turner Classic Movies Database
According to film critic Leonard Maltin's book Disney Films, Leslie Caron, Lynn Redgrave, Judy Carne, and Julie Andrews were all considered for the role of Eglantine Price before the Disney studio decided on Angela Lansbury. David Tomlinson replaced Ron Moody as Emelius Brown due to Moody's busy schedule. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, scoring 66% on Rotten Tomatoes, and won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. This was the last film released prior to the death of Walt Disney's surviving brother, Roy O. Disney, who died one week later.

It was established in October 2001, through the unification of the Russian Communist Workers' Party, the Russian Party of Communists and the Union of Communists, with the aim of resurrecting socialism and the USSR. The RCWP-CPSU considers the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) to be reformist but for the occasion of the 2003 Duma Election the Party leaders decided to make an agreement with the CPRF in order not to disperse the communist vote. 
In 2007, the party was de-registered by the Justice Ministry. In 2010, the RCWP-CPSU co-founded Russian registered political party Russian United Labour Front (ROT Front), led by Viktor Tyulkin.

[tpl]more footnotes|date=May 2010[/tpl]The Baptist Union of New Zealand is an association of Baptist churches in the country of New Zealand.
Several Baptists settled in New Zealand in the 1840s, but the first Baptist minister, Decimus Dolamore from Yorkshire, England, did not arrive until May 1851. Dolamore settled in Nelson and was involved in the formation of the first Baptist Church in New Zealand - Nelson Baptist Church - that same year. He was instrumental in obtaining a change in the law to allow Baptist ministers to perform marriage ceremonies. Until 1854, only Catholic and Anglican priests were allowed to do so. Dolamore later went to Christchurch and was the first minister for that congregation.[tpl]cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.otbc.org.nz/about/|publisher=Oxford Terrace Baptist Church|accessdate=19 March 2011[/tpl]
The Canterbury Baptist Association was formed in 1874. This association started the New Zealand Baptist magazine, which has been published monthly since January 1881. The Baptist Union of New Zealand was formed at Wellington in October 1882. At the time the Union was formed, there were 22 Baptist churches, with 1,890 members. The New Zealand Baptist Missionary Society was formed at the 1885 conference of the Baptist Union. At the 1891 conference, the Union established a plan to divide the country into four districts - "Otago/Southland" (org. 1892), "Auckland" (org. 1892), "Canterbury & Westland" (org. 1892), and "Central" (org. 1896). Central District was later divided into the Central District Association and the "Wellington" Association, and "South Auckland" was formed in 1939. South Auckland was later divided into the "Waikato" Association and the "Bay of Plenty" Association (now Bay of Plenty & Eastland). The "Top of the South" Association was formed in 1990. Some groups were called "auxiliary" and some "association", but in 1957, the term "auxiliary" was dropped in favor of the term "association". There are currently 9 associations. The Baptist National Centre is the registered office of the Baptist Union of New Zealand, the New Zealand Baptist Missionary Society and Baptist Care Limited, and is located in Penrose.
According to Union statements, they believe "the true humanity and Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ; the atonement made on the cross by our Lord for the sin of the world; the person of the Holy Spirit as the one who sets apart, empowers, and imparts spiritual gifts to the church; the inspiration of the Bible and its authority in all matters of faith and practice; salvation and membership in the Church by faith in Christ alone; membership of the church for the regenerate; and the immersion of believers as the scriptural form of water baptism." Unless they are willing to be celibate or undergo a heterosexual conversion process, gay people are deeply unwelcome in New Zealand Baptist churches.
Theologically, the Baptist Union member churches are deeply influenced by the charismatic renewal movement even though there is no official position regarding the charismatic movement.  A study in 1989 indicates 69% of churches belonging to the Baptist Union identified with the charismatic movement.[tpl]cite web| last =Tucker| first =John| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Heads in the Sand: New Zealand Baptists and the Tour Debate| work = | publisher = | date =October 2007| url =http://baptistlife.org.nz/documents/0000/0000/0013/PJBR_3-2_Oct_07_Tucker_on_Tour.pdf| doi =| accessdate = 2011-10-22[/tpl]  A smaller portion of member churches are Reformed in doctrine.
The Union supports education through Carey Baptist College in Penrose, and Te Whare Amorangi, designed for Maori men and women, in Papatoetoe.
In 2006, Baptist Union membership included 23,118 baptized believers in 244 churches and fellowships.

Oh Yeah! Cartoons is an American animation showcase that appeared on the Nickelodeon cable channel. Oh Yeah! was an animation project guided by Fred Seibert, former Creative Director of MTV Networks and President of Hanna-Barbera. Produced by Frederator Studios, it ran as part of Nickelodeon's Nicktoons lineup, and in its second season, was hosted by Kenan Thompson of All That and Kenan & Kel fame; Then later by Josh Server, from All That, for its third season. Bill Burnett composed the show's theme music. Oh Yeah! Cartoons was distributed by Nelvana outside of the United States.
In terms of sheer volume, Oh Yeah! Cartoons remains TV's biggest animation development program ever. Giving several dozen filmmakers the opportunity to create nearly 100 seven-minute cartoons, the series eventually yielded three dedicated half-hour spin-offs:
Nickelodeon's Oh Yeah! half-hour featured in its first season, a total of 39 brand new seven-minute cartoons in 13 episodes, surpassing the number of new cartoons and characters on any other single network. In its full run, Oh Yeah! Cartoons featured and produced over 99 cartoons and 54 characters.
39 episodes were made, however, MTV Networks International Distribution says 27 episodes were made.
Many of the animated shorts were created by cartoonists who later became more prominent, including Bob Boyle, Thomas R. Fitzgerald, Bill Burnett, Jaime Diaz, Greg Emison, John Eng, John Fountain, Antoine Guilbaud, Butch Hartman, Larry Huber, Steve Marmel, Zac Moncrief, Ken Kessel, Alex Kirwan, Seth MacFarlane, Carlos Ramos, Rob Renzetti, C. Miles Thompson, Byron Vaughns, Pat Ventura, Vincent Waller and David Wasson.     Many of the animators featured on Oh Yeah! Cartoons had worked on the What A Cartoon! Show produced by Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon Network two years earlier. The show was also created by Fred Seibert while he was president of Hanna-Barbera and had the same concept as Oh Yeah! Cartoons.    When Seibert left Hanna-Barbera in 1997 and founded Frederator Studios, many of the animators that had worked on What A Cartoon! migrated with him to produce shorts for Oh Yeah! Cartoons.

[[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]]
CATEGORIES: Political history of England, Constitution of the United Kingdom

The Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England, and later of Great Britain, was formerly an officer of the English Crown charged with physical custody of the Great Seal of England. This evolved into one of the Great Officers of State.
The seal, adopted by Edward the Confessor was at first entrusted to a chancellor for keeping.  The office of chancellor from the time of Thomas Becket onwards varied much in importance; the holder being a churchman, he was not only engaged in the business of his diocese, but sometimes was away from England. Consequently, it became not unusual to place the personal custody of the great seal in the hands of a vice-chancellor or keeper; this, too, was the practice followed during a temporary vacancy in the chancellorship.
This office gradually developed into a permanent appointment, and the lord keeper acquired the right of discharging all the duties connected with the great seal. He was usually, though not necessarily, a peer, and held office during the king's pleasure, he was  appointed merely by delivery of the seal, and not, like the chancellor, by patent. His status was definitely fixed (in the case of lord keeper Sir Nicholas Bacon) by the Lord Keeper Act 1562 (5 Eliz 1 c 18),1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, Precedence which declared him entitled to like place, pre-eminence, jurisdiction, execution of laws, and all other customs, commodities, and advantages as the Lord Chancellor. In subsequent reigns the lord keeper was generally raised to the chancellorship, and retained the custody of the seal.
The last lord keeper was Sir Robert Henley (afterwards Earl of Northington), who was made chancellor on the accession of George III.
A pub-restaurant in the town of Oadby, Leicestershire is named the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal to honour Sir Nathan Wright, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal from 1700 to 1705, who was later lord of the manor of Oadby.Lord Keeper of the Great Seal

Marc Ferrez (December 7, 1843 — January 12, 1923) was a Brazilian photographer born in Rio de Janeiro.
Marc Ferrez was the son of the French sculptor and engraver Zepherin Ferrez who moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1816 as a member of the Missão Artística Francesa (French Artistic Mission) organized by Joachim Lebreton. 
Ferrez's life was dedicated to the art of photography and he is considered one of the greatest photographers of his time. His production was massive, and his photographs document the consolidation of Brazil as a nation and Rio de Janeiro as a metropolis. His career was energized when he made part of Professor Charles Hartt's Geological Commission which covered the north and south of the country.
In 1865, Ferrez opened his own studio at Rua São José, in the center of Rio de Janeiro, which was by that time the capital of the Brazilian empire. He was made Photographo da Marinha Imperial and his work with images increased through his life. He photographed Brazil from south to north, but paid more attention to his home city, Rio de Janeiro. His masterpieces are the great albums of railway constructions and the great panoramic views of the city of Rio de Janeiro and its development.
Ferrez died in 1923 and left thousands of pictures and reproductions of his works.

Potassium sodium tartrate is a double salt first prepared (in about 1675) by an apothecary, Pierre Seignette, of La Rochelle, France. As a result the salt was known as Seignette's salt or Rochelle salt.
Rochelle salt is not to be confused with rock salt, which is simply the mineral form of sodium chloride. 
Potassium sodium tartrate and monopotassium phosphate were the first materials discovered to exhibit piezoelectricity.[tpl]cite journal |title=Ferroelectricity: The Foundation of a Field from Form to Function |first=R.E. |last=Newnham  |coauthors=Cross, L. Eric |journal=MRS Bulletin |volume=30 |date=November 2005 |pages=pp. 845–846[/tpl] This property led to its extensive use in "crystal" gramophone (phono) pick-ups, microphones and earpieces during the post-War consumer electronics boom of the mid-20th Century. Such transducers had an exceptionally high output with typical pick-up cartridge outputs as much as 2 volts or more. Rochelle salt is deliquescent so any transducers based on the material deteriorated if stored in damp conditions.
It is a colorless to blue-white salt crystallizing in the orthorhombic system. Its molecular formula is KNaC4H4O6·4H2O. It is slightly soluble in alcohol but more completely soluble in water. It has a specific gravity of about 1.79, a melting point of approximately 75 °C, and has a saline, cooling taste.  As a food additive, its E number is E337.
It has been used medicinally as a laxative.  It has also been used in the process of silvering mirrors. It is an ingredient of Fehling's solution and Nylander's test, formerly used in the determination of reducing sugars in solutions.
In organic synthesis, it is used in aqueous workups to break up emulsions, particularly for reactions in which an aluminium-based hydride reagent was used.Fieser, L. F.; Fieser, M., Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Vol.1; Wiley: New York; 1967, p. 983
It is a common precipitant in protein crystallography and is also an ingredient in the Biuret reagent which is used to measure protein concentration. This ingredient maintains cupric ions in solution at an alkaline pH.

The Dominion Land Survey (DLS) is the method used to divide most of Western Canada into one-square-mile (2.6 km2) sections for agricultural and other purposes.  It is based on the layout of the Public Land Survey System used in the United States, but has several differences.  The DLS is the dominant survey method in the Prairie provinces, and it is also used in British Columbia along the Railway Belt (near the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway), and in the Peace River Block in the northeast of the province.  (Although British Columbia entered Confederation with control over its own lands, unlike the Northwest Territories and the Prairie provinces, British Columbia transferred these lands to the federal Government as a condition of the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

The KPÖ was banned between 1933 and 1945 under both the Austrofascist regime and the Nazi German control of Austria after the 1938 Anschluss. It played an important role in the Austrian resistance against the Nazis.
The party currently holds two seats in the Styrian Landtag (state parliament), but has not had representation in the National Council (Nationalrat, Austria's federal parliament) since 1959. At the legislative election held on September 29, 2013, it won only 1.03% of the votes (48,175 out of a total of 4,782,563), well below the 4% minimum to obtain seats in the National Council.

A proficient Chinese speaker, she is the only First Lady to have spoken an Asian language. She oversaw construction of the presidential retreat at Rapidan Camp in Madison County, Virginia. She was the first First Lady to make regular, nationwide radio broadcasts to the American public.

[[Euteleostomi]]

CATEGORIES: Vertebrates, Teleostomi

Euteleostomi is a successful clade that includes more than 90% of the living species of vertebrates.  Euteleostomes are also known as "bony vertebrates".  Both major subgroups are successful today: Actinopterygii includes the majority of extant fish species, and Sarcopterygii includes the tetrapods.  This clade is sometimes called "Osteichthyes", but since that name literally means "bony fish" and traditionally is a paraphyletic group that excludes tetrapods, the name Euteleostomi was coined as a substitute.
Euteleostomes originally all had endochondral bone, fins with lepidotrichs, and jaws lined by maxillary, premaxillary, and dentary bones.  Many of these characters have since been lost by descendant groups, however, such as lepidotrichs lost in tetrapods, and bone lost among the chondrostean fishes.

The Workers' Communist Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina ([tpl]lang-bs|Radničko-komunistička partija Bosne i Hercegovine[/tpl]) is a communist party from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was formed in 2000 and strongly opposes the nationalism of the region and the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Some of their major aims are the introduction of workers' self-management and participatory democracy, as well as the establishment of a socialist federal Yugoslavia. They say they are not motivated by nostalgia, as they are critical of Josip Broz Tito.
They believe that socialism has to be democratic and strongly oppose the system of the former Soviet Union and other former governments. They have been particularly influenced by Rosa Luxemburg and Antonio Gramsci.

CATEGORIES: Communist Party of Brazil, Communist parties in Brazil, Political parties in Brazil, Political parties established in 1962

The Communist Party of Brazil ([tpl]lang-pt|Partido Comunista do Brasil, PCdoB[/tpl]) is a communist party in Brazil. It has national reach and deep penetration in the trade union and students movements. PCdoB shares the disputed the title of "oldest political party in Brazil" with the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB). The predecessor of both parties was the Brazilian Section of the Communist International, founded on March 25, 1922. The current PCdoB was launched on February 18, 1962, in the aftermath of the Sino-Soviet split. Outlawed after the 1964 coup d'état, PCdoB supported the armed struggle against the regime before its legalization on 1988. Its most famous action in the period was the Araguaia guerrilla (1966–1974). Since 1989, PCdoB has been allied to the Worker's Party (PT) in the federal level, and, as such, it was a member of the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva administration, and joined the For Brazil to keep on changing coalition, which elected his successor, Dilma Rousseff.
PCdoB publishes the newspaper Working Class (Classe Operária) as well as the magazine Principles (Princípios), and is a member of the Foro de São Paulo. Its youth wing is the Union of the Socialist Youth (União da Juventude Socialista, UJS), launched on 1984, while its trade union wing is the Central of the Workers of Brazil (Central dos Trabalhadores e Trabalhadoras do Brasil, CTB), founded on 2007 as a dissidence from the Unified Workers' Central (Central Única dos Trabalhadores, CUT).

[/ref] It bears the name of the Pascal programming language but is incompatible with it. Instead, it is a minor variant and refinement of Oberon-2, designed and supported by a small ETH Zürich spin-off company called Oberon microsystems. They developed an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called BlackBox Component Builder. At the time the first version was released (1994 as Oberon/F) it presented a novel approach to graphical user interface (GUI) construction based on editable forms, where fields and command buttons are linked to exported variables and executable procedures. This approach bears some similarity to the code-behind way used in Microsoft's .NET 3.0 to access code in XAML.
An open-source implementation exists for the .NET and Java Virtual Machine platforms, from the Gardens Point team around John Gough at Queensland University of Technology in Australia.
On 23 June 2004 Oberon microsystems announced that the BlackBox Component Builder was made available as a free download and that an open-source version was planned. The beta open-source version was initially released in December, 2004 and updated to a final v1.5 release in December, 2005.  It includes the complete source code of the IDE, compiler, debugger, source analyser, profiler and interfacing libraries and can also be downloaded from their website. Several release candidates for v1.6 appeared in the years 2009 – 2011, the latest one (1.6rc6) appeared on Oberon microsystems web pages in 2011. End of 2013 Oberon Microsystems released the final release 1.6. It is most probably last release bundled by Oberon Microsystems and a small community took over the ongoing development.
BlackBox Component Pascal uses the extensions .odc (= 'Oberon document'') for document files, such as source files for example, and .osf (''= Oberon symbol file'') for symbol files while Gardens Point Component Pascal uses .cp for source and .cps for symbol files. BlackBox Component Pascal has its own executable and loadable object format .ocf (''= Oberon code f'ile); it includes a runtime linking loader for this format. The document format (.odc) is a rich text binary format, which allows nice formatting, supports conditional folding, and allows active content to be embedded in the source text. It also handles user interface elements in editable  forms. This is in tradition of the Oberon Text format.Mössenböck, H. and Koskimies, K.

The Communist Party of Canada (CPC) is a communist political party in Canada. Although it is currently a minor or small political party without representation in the Federal Parliament or in provincial legislatures, historically the Party has elected representatives in Federal Parliament, the Ontario Legislature and the Manitoba Legislature as well as various municipal governments. The party has also contributed significantly to trade union organizing and labour history in Canada, peace and anti-war activism, as well as many other social movements.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
The Communist Party of Canada is the second oldest registered party after the Liberal Party of Canada, and the only registered political party to historically have been declared illegal (in 1921, 1932, and 1940). In 1990 the party was also de-registered and had its assets seized, forcing it to begin an ultimately successful thirteen-year political and legal battle to allow small political parties in Canada. The campaign culminated with the final decision of Figueroa v. Canada, changing the legal definition of a political party in Canada.

Originally claimed by several countries (See Oregon Country), the region was divided between the U.S. and Great Britain in 1846. When established, the territory encompassed an area that included the current states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, as well as parts of Wyoming and Montana. The capital of the territory was first Oregon City, then Salem, followed briefly by Corvallis, and lastly as Salem, the seat of government for the State of Oregon.

The Charter of the French Language ([tpl]lang-fr|La charte de la langue française[/tpl]), also known as Bill 101 (Law 101 or [tpl]lang-fr|Loi 101[/tpl]), is a law in the province of Quebec in Canada defining French, the language of the majority of the population, as the official language of Quebec and framing fundamental language rights. It is the central legislative piece in Quebec's language policy.
Proposed by Camille Laurin, the Minister of Cultural Development under the first Parti Québécois government of Premier René Lévesque, it was passed by the National Assembly, and granted Royal Assent by Lieutenant Governor Hugues Lapointe on August 26, 1977. The Charter's provisions expanded upon the 1974 Official Language Act (Bill 22), which was enacted by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Parliament during the tenure of Premier Robert Bourassa's Liberal government to make French the official language of Quebec. Prior to 1974, Quebec had no official language and was subject only to the requirements on the use of English and French contained in Article 133 of the British North America Act, 1867."British North America Act, 1867", in Wikisource, retrieved April 24, 2008
Bill 101 has been amended more than six times since 1977. Each amendment has aroused controversy over such provisions as the use of French on commercial signs or restrictions on enrollment into anglophone schools.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/debate-on-pq-language-bill-to-begin/article9582744/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Debate on PQ language bill to begin | date=March 11, 2013[/tpl]

[[Mating]]

CATEGORIES: Mating, Developmental biology, Ethology, Fertility, Reproduction in animals, Sexology, Sexuality

In biology, mating is the pairing of opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms, usually for the purposes of reproduction. Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mating|title=Mate|author=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=May 31, 2013[/tpl] while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. Fertilization is the fusion of both sex cell or gamete.[tpl]cite web|last=The Free Dictionary|title='Fertilization' - definition of|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fertilization|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=25 January 2014[/tpl]  Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization (autogamy); for example, banana slugs.
For animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating domesticated animals and of artificially inseminating them is part of animal husbandry.

The album features a slightly smoother sound than its predecessor. The bass guitar is less present except for several moments when it becomes the focal point of the song. The album title Room on Fire was drawn from a line in "Reptilia": "The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair." The record received positive reviews upon release. It reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number four in the U.S. on the Billboard 200, where it went on to sell 597,000 units by October 2006[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] and was certified Gold.

They are refundable to the extent they exceed tax as determined on tax returns. PAYE may include withholding the employee portion of insurance contributions or similar social benefit taxes. In most countries, they are determined by employers but subject to government review. PAYE is deducted from each paycheck by the employer and must be remitted promptly to the government. Most countries refer to income tax withholding by other terms, including pay-as-you-go tax.

[[Flight control surfaces]]

CATEGORIES: Aircraft controls

Aircraft flight control surfaces allow a pilot to adjust and control the aircraft's flight attitude.
Development of an effective set of flight controls was a critical advance in the development of aircraft. Early efforts at fixed-wing aircraft design succeeded in generating sufficient lift to get the aircraft off the ground, but once aloft, the aircraft proved uncontrollable, often with disastrous results. The development of effective flight controls is what allowed stable flight.
This article describes the control surfaces used on a fixed-wing aircraft of conventional design.  Other fixed-wing aircraft configurations may use different control surfaces but the basic principles remain.  The controls (stick and rudder) for rotary wing aircraft (helicopter or autogyro) accomplish the same motions about the three axes of rotation, but manipulate the rotating flight controls (main rotor disk and tail rotor disk) in a completely different manner.

[[Opera seria]]

CATEGORIES: European court festivities, Opera genres, Italian opera terminology

Opera seria (plural: opere serie; usually called dramma per musica or melodramma serio) is an Italian musical term which refers to the noble and "serious" style of Italian opera that predominated in Europe from the 1710s to c. 1770. The term itself was rarely used at the time and only attained common usage once opera seria was becoming unfashionable and beginning to be viewed as a historical genre. The popular rival to opera seria was opera buffa, the 'comic' opera that took its cue from the improvisatory commedia dell'arte.
Italian opera seria (invariably to Italian libretti) was produced not only in Italy but also in Habsburg Austria, England, Saxony and other German states, even in Spain, and other countries. Opera seria was less popular in France, where the national genre of French opera was preferred. Popular composers of opera seria included Alessandro Scarlatti, Johann Adolf Hasse, Leonardo Vinci, Nicola Porpora, George Frideric Handel, and in the second half of the 18th century Tommaso Traetta, Josef Mysliveček, Gluck, and Mozart.

The word derives from the Narragansett word powwaw, meaning "spiritual leader". A similar gathering by California Native Peoples usually in the fall is called a Big Time. A modern pow-wow is a specific type of event for Native American/First Nations people to meet and dance, sing, socialize, and honor Native American/First Nations culture. There is generally a dancing competition, often with significant prize money awarded. Pow-wows vary in length from one day session of five to six hours to three days. Major pow-wow or pow-wows called for a special occasion can be up to one week long.
The term also has been used to describe any gathering of Native Americans of any tribe, and as such is occasionally heard in older Western movies. The word has also been used to refer to a meeting, especially a meeting of powerful people such as officers in the military.  However, such use is sometimes viewed as disrespectful to Native culture.[tpl]cite web|author=This story was written by Patricia Sabine |url=http://www.hanscom.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123280183 |title=Commentary - Did they really just say that? |publisher=Hanscom.af.mil |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2013-09-10[/tpl]

Fortín de las Flores is a city in the Mexican state of Veracruz.  Fortín de las Flores is the municipal seat of Fortín municipality, which borders the municipalities of Córdoba, Naranjal and Ixtaczoquitlán. It stands on Federal Highways 190 and 180 and the Mexico City to Veracruz railway.
In the 2005 INEGI Census, the city reported a total population of 18,965, with 53,311 in the surrounding municipality.[ref]

The ravine of Metlac, which has been declared a National Park on account of its extremely rich biodiversity and beautiful landscapes, is the most famous feature of Fortín de las Flores.
The residents of Fortín de las Flores are considered by freighthopping Central American migrants to be some of the most generous in Mexico.Nazario, Sonia. Enrique's Journey. New York: Random House, 2006. p. 104
Travelers driving to the city of Veracruz from Mexico City pass through the colonial towns of Orizaba, Fortin de las Flores, and Cordoba. Orizaba is nestled under the snow-capped volcano Pico de Orizaba, the third-highest peak in North America at 18,491 feet, and Mexico’s highest. In Fortin de las Flores, the next stop on the journey, “flowers” form part of its name and much of its landscape. The small, industrial city of Cordoba is located about 10 minutes from Fortin.
The town’s central plaza where Mexico’s Declaration of Independence was signed offers a nice place to enjoy a sip of coffee, beer or rum, all products of local industry in this coffee and sugar growing region. From here travelers descend through sugar cane fields on their way to Veracruz and its fast-growing neighbor turned suburb Boca del Rio.
There are several 45-minute flights a day from Mexico City. By car or bus, the drive passes through the state of Puebla and across the formidable Cumbres de Maltrata Mountains down into the lush vegetation that characterizes just about the entire state. The drive from Mexico City to the port city of Veracruz takes under five hours on a toll road that has garnered a good rating from the American Automobile Association (AAA). Drivers should be aware that just outside Veracruz the return highway is at an 8,000-foot elevation and often enveloped in thick fog, making driving this stretch a challenge.

[[Bloch wave]]

CATEGORIES: Concepts in physics, Condensed matter physics, Mathematical physics

A Bloch wave (also called Bloch state or Bloch function or Bloch wave function), named after Swiss physicist Felix Bloch, is a type of wavefunction for a particle in a periodically-repeating environment, most commonly an electron in a crystal. A wavefunction ψ is a Bloch wave if it has the form:[tpl]cite book|last1= Kittel| title=Introduction to Solid State Physics|publisher=Wiley|location= New York|year=1996| first1=Charles|isbn= 0-471-14286-7[/tpl]
where r is position, ψ is the Bloch wave, u is a periodic function with the same periodicity as the crystal, k is a real number called the crystal wave vector, e is Euler's number, and i is the imaginary unit. In other words, if you multiply a plane wave by a periodic function, you get a Bloch wave.
Bloch waves are important because of Bloch's theorem, which states that the energy eigenstates for an electron in a crystal can be written as Bloch waves. (More precisely, it states that the electron wavefunctions in a crystal have a basis consisting entirely of Bloch wave energy eigenstates.) This fact underlies the concept of electronic band structures.
These Bloch wave energy eigenstates are written with subscripts as ψn k, where n is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present because there are many different Bloch waves with the same k (each has a different periodic component u). Within a band (i.e., for fixed n), ψn k varies continuously with k, as does its energy. Also, for any reciprocal lattice vector K, ψn k = ψn,(k+K). Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for k-values within the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice.

[[Smothered mate]]
CATEGORIES: Chess checkmates, Chess terminology

In chess, a smothered mate is a checkmate delivered by a knight in which the mated king is unable to move because he is surrounded (or smothered) by his own pieces.
The mate is usually seen in a corner of the board, since fewer pieces are needed to surround the king there. The most common form of smothered mate is seen in the diagram to the right. The knight on f7 delivers mate to the king on h8 which is prevented from escaping the check by the rook on g8 and the pawns on g7 and h7. Similarly, White can be mated with the white king on h1 and the knight on f2. Analogous mates on a1 and a8 are rarer, because kingside castling is the more common as it safely places the king closer to the corner than it would have the castling occurred on the queenside.

Saint Metrophanes was the bishop of Byzantium from 306 to 314. He may have retired from his episcopacy and died as late as 326. 
There is a tradition that, before his death, the Emperor Constantine I bestowed upon him the honorary title of Patriarch; however, Byzantium did not become the capital of the Empire until 330 (when it was renamed New Rome or Constantinople), and the see was not elevated to a patriarchate until 451.
Metrophanes I could not partake in the first Ecumenical Council, which was held at Nicaea, due to age and ill health (he was already bedridden). He sent instead Alexander, the first among his presbyters, an honest man, whom he destined as his successor. For it is said that, when the Council had ended and the king with the god-bearing fathers returned, he was told by God that Alexander, and after him Paul, pleased God, and are good for this position.  
Metrophanes has been canonized a saint, and is revered in both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. His feast day is June 4.
His predecessor as Bishop of Byzantium was Probus, son of Dometius and Metrophanes may have been the son of Probus.Bishops/Patriarchs of Constantinople Byzantine Studies Page, Fordham University

A person with wrist drop would be unable to move from this position to one in which the fingers are pointing up towards the ceiling.

[[Dogbert's New Ruling Class]]
CATEGORIES: Dilbert, Fan clubs

Dogbert's New Ruling Class, or DNRC, is the official Dilbert fan club.  It is a group of people who, according to Dilbert author Scott Adams, will form the new ruling elite once Dogbert conquers the Earth. DNRC members (defined in effect by their subscription to the (free) email Dilbert Newsletter, which was issued approximately four times per year, apparently ending in 2008)[tpl]cn|date=November 2011[/tpl] are characterised by their 'superior intelligence and good looks', whereas non-members ('induhviduals', a play on the word 'duh') suffer from idiocy and lacklustre charm. DNRC membership stood at 533,198 in February 2008February 2008 ISSUE 68[tpl]Dead link|date=May 2009[/tpl] and has been fairly stable since September 2004. 460,000 listed in newsletter for September 2004, Issue 57[tpl]Dead link|date=May 2009[/tpl]
According to Dogbert, DNRC will eventually take over the world. Once this happens, all 'induhviduals' will become subservient slaves of DNRC (except the CEOs, who are too incompetent to do anything).  It is not certain whether this will be permanent, however, since in the past Dogbert has been known to conquer the earth only to grow tired of the ensuing peace.
A typical DNRC newsletter contains the following core features:
Adams also uses it as vehicle to promote his other publications, often done so blatantly as to be part of the humor.

Taishanese (Toisanese; [tpl]zh|t=臺山話|s=台山话[/tpl]; Taishanese: [tpl]IPA-yue|hɔi˨san˧wa˧˨˥|[/tpl]) is a dialect of Yue Chinese. The dialect is closely related to Cantonese.
Taishanese is spoken in the southern part of Guangdong Province in China, particularly in and around the city-level county of Taishan. In the mid to late 19th century, a significant number of Chinese emigrating to North America originated from this area, making Taishanese a dominant variety of the Chinese language spoken in North American Chinatowns. It was formerly the lingua franca of the overseas Chinese residing in the United States.[tpl]Harv|Yang|1999[/tpl]  It is not currently recognized as having official status in any country.

[[Per capita]]

CATEGORIES: Latin words and phrases, Social statistics

Per capita is a Latin prepositional phrase: per (preposition, taking the accusative case, meaning "by, by means of") and capita (accusative plural of the noun caput, "head"). The phrase thus means "by heads" or "for each head", i.e. per individual/person.  The term is used in a wide variety of social sciences and statistical research contexts, including government statistics, economic indicators, and built environment studies.
It is commonly and usually used in the field of statistics in place of saying "for each person" or "per person".[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Per%20capita |title=Per capita | Define Per capita at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-29[/tpl]
It is also used in wills to indicate that each of the named beneficiaries should receive, by devise or bequest, equal shares of the estate. This is in contrast to a per stirpes division, in which each branch (Latin stirps, plural stirpes) of the inheriting family inherits an equal share of the estate.

Zollinger–Ellison Syndrome (ZES) is caused by a non–beta islet cell, gastrin-secreting tumor of the pancreas that stimulates the acid-secreting cells of the stomach to maximal activity, with consequent gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration. ZES may occur sporadically or as part of an autosomal dominant familial syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). The primary tumor is usually located in the pancreas, duodenum or abdominal lymph nodes, but ectopic locations have also been described (e.g., heart, ovary, gallbladder, liver, kidney).

[[Promiscuous mode]]
CATEGORIES: Network analyzers

In computer networking, promiscuous mode or promisc mode is a mode for a wired network interface controller (NIC) or wireless network interface controller (WNIC) that causes the controller to pass all traffic it receives to the central processing unit (CPU) rather than passing only the frames that the controller is intended to receive.  This mode is normally used for packet sniffing that takes place on a router or on a computer connected to a hub (instead of a switch) or one being part of a WLAN. Interfaces are placed into promiscuous mode by software bridges often used with hardware virtualization.
In IEEE 802 networks such as Ethernet, token ring, and IEEE 802.11, and in FDDI, each frame includes a destination Media Access Control address (MAC address).  In non-promiscuous mode, when a NIC receives a frame, it normally drops it unless the frame is addressed to that NIC's MAC address or is a broadcast or multicast frame.  In promiscuous mode, however, the card allows all frames through, thus allowing the computer to read frames intended for other machines or network devices.
Many operating systems require superuser privileges to enable promiscuous mode. A non-routing node in promiscuous mode can generally only monitor traffic to and from other nodes within the same broadcast domain (for Ethernet and IEEE 802.11) or ring (for token ring or FDDI).  Computers attached to the same network hub satisfy this requirement, which is why network switches are used to combat malicious use of promiscuous mode. A router may monitor all traffic that it routes.
Promiscuous mode is often used to diagnose network connectivity issues. There are programs that make use of this feature to show the user all the data being transferred over the network. Some protocols like FTP and Telnet transfer data and passwords in clear text, without encryption, and network scanners can see this data. Therefore, computer users are encouraged to stay away from insecure protocols like telnet and use more secure ones such as SSH.

The Division Bell is the fourteenth and final studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd. It was released in the UK by EMI Records on 28 March 1994, and the US by Columbia Records on 4 April.
The music was written mostly by David Gilmour and Richard Wright; lyrically, the album deals with themes of communication. Recording took place in several locations, including the band's Britannia Row Studios, and Gilmour's houseboat, Astoria. The production team included Pink Floyd stalwarts such as producer Bob Ezrin, engineer Andy Jackson and saxophonist Dick Parry. Gilmour's new wife, Polly Samson, co-wrote many of the album's lyrics, and Wright performed his first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon.
The album reached number one in the UK and the US, but received lukewarm reviews. Its release was followed immediately by a tour of the US and Europe. The Division Bell was certified gold, platinum and 2x platinum in the US in 1994, and 3x platinum in 1999.

Zolpidem has not adequately demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining sleep, unless delivered in a controlled-release (CR) form.

Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, which is used for benzodiazepine overdose, can also reverse zolpidem's sedative/hypnotic and memory-impairing effects.[tpl]cite journal | author = Patat A, Naef MM, van Gessel E, Forster A, Dubruc C, Rosenzweig P | title = Flumazenil antagonizes the central effects of zolpidem, an imidazopyridine hypnotic | journal = Clin Pharmacol Ther | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 430–6 | date = October 1994 | pmid = 7955804 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.1994.157 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Wesensten NJ, Balkin TJ, Davis HQ, Belenky GL | title = Reversal of triazolam- and zolpidem-induced memory impairment by flumazenil | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl) | volume = 121 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–9 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8545530 | doi = 10.1007/BF02245635 [/tpl]
As a muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant, the drug's effects are not evident until dosages 10 and 20 times those required for sedation, respectively, are reached.[tpl]cite journal | author = Depoortere H, Zivkovic B, Lloyd KG, Sanger DJ, Perrault G, Langer SZ, Bartholini G | title = Zolpidem, a novel nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic.

Such drastically increased doses are also more inclined to induce one or more of the drug's adverse side effects, including hallucinations and amnesia. Contrary to early studies, more recent research has indicated that zolpidem is in fact a potent anticonvulsant.[tpl]cite journal | author = Vlainić J, Pericić D | title = Zolpidem is a potent anticonvulsant in adult and aged mice | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1310 | pages = 181–8 | date = 15 January 2010 | pmid = 19914223 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.11.018 [/tpl] The anticonvulsant effects are not realized until the normal dosage range has been surpassed (meaning sedation would still be a major side effect) but the threshold for this effect is now believed to be considerably lower than original estimates.

On 2012, a study published in the BMJ Open journal revealed that sleeping pills, including zolpidem, are associated with a higher risk of death and cancer diagnosis.

The [tpl]Nihongo|Kyōhō reforms|享保の改革|kyōhō no kaikaku[/tpl] were an array of economic policies introduced by the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1736 Japan.In the name "Kyōhō Reforms," the noun "Kyōhō" refers to the nengō  (Japanese era name) after "Shōtoku" and before "Genbun."  In other words, the Kyōhō Reforms occurred during Kansei, which was a time period spanning the years from 1716 through 1736. The reforms overlapped somewhat into the next era, which was proclaimed in 1736 (Kyōhō 21, 21st day of the 4th month) to mark the enthronement of Emperor Sakuramachi.  These reforms were instigated by the eighth Tokugawa shogun of Japan, Tokugawa Yoshimune, encompassing the first twenty years of his shogunate.Bowman, John Stewart. (2000). Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture, p. 142;  Titsingh, Issac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, pp. 416-417.
The reforms were aimed at making the shogunate financially solvent. Because of the tensions between Confucian ideology and the economic reality of Tokugawa Japan (Confucian principles that money was defiling vs. the necessity for a cash economy), Yoshimune found it necessary to shelve certain Confucian principles that were hampering his reform process.
The Kyoho reforms included an emphasis on frugality, as well as the formation of merchant guilds that allowed greater control and taxation. Alternate attendance (sankin kōtai) rules were relaxed, and the ban on western books (minus those relating or referring to Christianity) was lifted.
This reform movement was followed by three others during the Edo period: the Kansei reforms of the 1790s, the Tenpō reforms of the 1830s, and the Keiō reforms of 1866-1867.Traugott, Mark. (1995). Repertoires and Cycles of Collective Action, p. 147.

George Baldwin Selden (September 14, 1846 in Clarkson, New York – January 17, 1922 in Rochester, New York) was a patent lawyer and inventor who was granted a U.S. patent for an automobile in 1895.Flink, p. 51 Probably the most absurd action in the history of patent law was the granting of United States patent number 549,160 on November 5, 1895, to George B. Selden. a Rochester, New York, patent lawyer and inventor, for an "improved road engine" powered by "a liquid-hydrocarbon engine of the compression type."Flink, p. 51 His own patent application was filed in 1879. He then used evasive legal tactics to delay the patent's acceptance until conditions seemed favorable for commercial exploitation.''

The Shenzhou spacecraft carried a crew of Fèi Jùnlóng (费俊龙) and Niè Hǎishèng (聂海胜) for five days in low Earth orbit. It launched three days before the second anniversary of China's first human spaceflight, Shenzhou 5.
The crew were able to change out of their new lighter space suits, conduct scientific experiments, and enter the orbital module for the first time, giving them access to toilet facilities. The exact activities of the crew were kept secret but were thought by some to include military reconnaissance, however this is likely untrue given that similar experiments in the US and USSR determined that humans are not suited for military reconnaissance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/shezhou6.htm|title=Shenzhou 6| accessdate = 2006-09-19|author=Mark Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica[/tpl] It landed in the Siziwang Banner of Inner Mongolia on October 16, 2005, the same site as the previous manned and unmanned Shenzhou flights.

Dongfanghong I (Red East 1) ([tpl]zh|s=东方红一号|t=東方紅一號|p=Dōngfānghóng Yīhào[/tpl]), also known as China 1[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl], was the People's Republic of China's first space satellite, launched successfully on 24 April 1970 (after one failed attempt on 16 November 1969[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]) as part of the PRC's Dongfanghong space satellite program. At [tpl]convert|173|kg|lbs|abbr=on[/tpl], it was heavier than the first satellites of other countries. The satellite carried a radio transmitter which broadcast the song of the same name, Dōngfānghóng or "The East Is Red"; the broadcast lasted for 26 days while in orbit.
It was developed under the direction of Qian Xuesen (Tsien Hsue-shen), dean of the Chinese Academy of Space Technology (CAST). At the time, a total of five identical satellites were created. The first satellite launched successfully. The academy formulated a "Three-Satellite Plan" consisting of Dongfanghong I, re-entry satellites, and geosynchronous orbit communications satellites. Sun Jia-Dong was responsible for the Dongfanghong I technology. In 1967, Dang Hongxin chose a copper antenna membrane that resolved the difficulties of broadcasting on an ultra-short wave antenna between 100°C and −100°C. Engineers installed a music player playing "The East is Red" on the satellite.

A crampon is a traction device used to improve mobility on snow and ice during ice climbing.[tpl]cite book|edition=7|editor=Cox, Steven M. and Kris Fulsaas, ed.|title=Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills|publisher=The Mountaineers|isbn=0-89886-828-9|location=Seattle|year=2003[/tpl] Not only are crampons used during ice climbing, but they are also used for secure travel on snow and ice, such as crossing glaciers, snowfields and icefields, ascending snow slopes, and scaling ice-covered rock. There are three main attachment systems for footwear: step-in, hybrid, and strap bindings. The first two require boots with welts, as a tension lever attaches the crampon to the heel. The last type (strap bindings) are more versatile and can adapt to virtually any boot or shoe, but often do not fit as precisely as the other two types.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/crampons-snow-ice-climbing.html|title=Crampons: How to Choose|publisher=REI|accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl]

[[Hunger circus]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Bucharest, Socialist Republic of Romania, History of Bucharest, Unfinished buildings and structures in Romania

"Hunger circus" ([tpl]lang-ro|Circ al foamei[/tpl]) was a colloquial name for any in a series of identical buildings which were to be completed as part of Nicolae Ceauşescu's program of systematization during his period as ruler of Romania. Officially designated by the communist regime as "complex agroalimentar" (Food Complex), these large domed buildings were intended as produce markets and public refectories. It appears to have been Ceauşescu's vision that they would serve as food hypermarkets, eliminating the need for selling or distributing food anywhere else.
The name "hunger circuses", now so universally used as to have almost suppressed the memory of the official communist-era term, derived from the circus-like domed architecture and the irony of constructing these massive food-related buildings during a period when food was scarce throughout Romania (due to Ceauşescu's policy of exporting most of Romania's agricultural produce in order to pay off the foreign debt). The irony was reinforced by the connotation of "circus" as ridiculous farce.
At the time of Ceauşescu's downfall and execution, only two hunger circuses had been completed: One of these, Pantelimon, now forms part of a public market in the Delfinului area of Bucharest; the other, also in Bucharest, is placed close to the Unirea shopping mall, nestled between Piaţa Unirii and Sfânta Vineri Street. Several others stood half-finished in scattered locations around Bucharest, surrounded by rusting construction cranes and vacant lots.
Ironically, the hunger circuses left unfinished after the 1989 Revolution were later completed, as capitalist malls such as Bucharest Mall in Vitan, City Mall and Plaza România in Militari. The hunger circus in Rahova was partially demolished in November 2006 to make room for a new mall - Liberty Center Mall. Another hunger circus was transformed into a private university.

[[Ice axe]]

CATEGORIES: Axes, Hiking equipment, Mountaineering equipment

An ice axe is a multi-purpose hiking and climbing tool used by mountaineers both in the ascent and descent of routes that involve frozen conditions with snow and/or ice. An ice axe can be held and employed in a number of different ways, depending on the terrain encountered. In its simplest role, the ice axe is used like a walking stick in the uphill hand, the mountaineer holding the head in the center, with the pick pointing to the rear. It can also be buried pick down, the rope tied around the shaft to form a secure anchor on which to bring up a second climber, or buried vertically to form a stomp belay. The adze is used to cut footsteps (sometimes known as pigeon holes), as well as scoop seats in the hillside and trenches to bury an ice axe belay.[tpl]cite book | edition = 7 | editor = Cox, Steven M. and Kris Fulsaas, ed. | title = Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills | publisher = The Mountaineers | isbn = 0-89886-828-9| location = Seattle | year = 2003-09[/tpl] The long-handled alpenstock was a predecessor to the modern ice axe. The ice axe bears similarity in design with a Medieval war hammer.
An ice axe is not only used as an aid to climbing, but also as a means of self-arrest in the event of a downhill slip. A self-arrest is a mountaineering maneuver in which a climber who has fallen and is sliding down a snow or ice slope stops the slide with only his or her ice axe and/or crampons, and without the use of a rope or other belay system.
Most ice axes meet design and manufacturing standards of organizations such as the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA) or European Committee for Standardization. There are two classifications of ice axe, Basic and Technical. Basic ice axes are designed for use in snow conditions for general mountaineering, and are adequate for basic support and self-arrest. Technical ice axes, which may have curved shafts, are used for steep or vertical ice climbing.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.
Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/appdev/story/0,10801,66192,00.html |title=Extreme Programming |author=Lee Copeland |date=December 2001 |work= |publisher=Computerworld |accessdate=January 11, 2011[/tpl] but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.Newkirk, JW and Vorontsov, AA.

[[Egyptian Nightjar]]
CATEGORIES: Caprimulgus, Birds of Iran, Birds of Pakistan

The Egyptian Nightjar (Caprimulgus aegyptius) is a medium-small nightjar which occurs in south west Asia and north Africa, and winters in tropical Africa. It is a late migrant, seldom appearing before the end of April or beginning of May. It is a rare visitor to Europe, but, remarkably, has twice occurred as far away as Great Britain.
Open desert with a few trees or bushes are the haunts of this crepuscular nightjar. It flies at dusk, most often at sundown, with an easy, silent moth-like flight; its strong and deliberate wingbeats alternate with sweeps and wheels with motionless wings.
The variegated plumage is much paler than the European Nightjar. The adult is sand-colours, barred and streaked with buff and brown. The under parts are sandy or whitish. It is smaller, but relatively longer-winged and longer-tailed than the more widespread species. Like other nightjars, it has a wide gape, long wings, soft downy plumage and nocturnal habits. The male has tiny white wing spots. The length is 25 cm, and the wingspan 55 cm.
Its call is a repetitive mechanical kroo-kroo-kroo…, which rises and falls as the bird turns its head from side to side. Crepuscular insects, such as moths, are its food.
During the day this nightjar lies silent upon the ground, concealed by its plumage; it is difficult to detect, blending in with the sandy soil. No nest is made; the two elongated and elliptical eggs are placed upon the bare ground; the brooding bird, sitting closely, is their best protection.

Troy was a son of a Cornell University dairy professor of the same name, and both father and son were members of the Quill and Dagger society. Troy attended Cornell as an architecture student from 1922 to 1927, although he was suspended without receiving a degree due to a particular joke that offended the administration. Although many of his practical jokes on campus are legendary, university historians have been unable to prove their truthfulness and some suspect the majority of his tales to be exaggerated or entirely fabricated. After serving in the military in World War II (under Gen. Curtis LeMay), he made his living as an illustrator for books and magazines, authoring three children's stories. He died in 1964.

[tpl]Redirect |F-20||F20 (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]F20[/tpl]
The Northrop F-20 Tigershark (initially F-5G) was a privately financed light fighter, designed and built by Northrop. Its development began in 1975 as a further evolution of Northrop's F-5E Tiger II, featuring a new engine that greatly improved overall performance, and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible radar. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air capability, and had a full suite of air-to-ground modes capable of firing most U.S. weapons. With these improved capabilities, the F-20 became competitive with contemporary fighter designs such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but was much less expensive to purchase and operate.
Much of the F-20's development was carried out under a US Department of Defense (DoD) project called "FX". FX sought to develop fighters that would be capable in combat with the latest  Soviet aircraft but, by excluding sensitive front-line technologies used by the United States Air Force, the FX could be safely sold to foreign nations without the risk of significant technological advancements falling into Soviet hands. FX was a product of the Carter administration's military export policies. Northrop had high hopes for the F-20 in the international market; however, policy changes following Ronald Reagan's election meant the F-20 had to compete for sales against aircraft like the F-16, the USAF's latest fighter design. The development program was eventually abandoned in 1986 after three prototypes had been built and a fourth partially completed.[tpl]harvnb |Johnsen|2006|pp= 92–98[/tpl]

It is about 14 cm (5.5 in) long with ash-brown upperparts and paler underparts, and a short, square tail that has distinctive white patches on most of its feathers. It breeds in the mountains of southern Europe, northwestern Africa and southern Asia. It can be confused with the three other species in its genus, but is larger than both, with brighter tail spots and different plumage tone. Many European birds are resident, but some northern populations and most Asian breeders are migratory, wintering in northern Africa, the Middle East or India.
The Eurasian Crag Martin builds a nest adherent to the rock under a cliff overhang or increasingly onto a man-made structure. It makes a neat half-cup mud nest with an inner soft lining of feathers and dry grass. Nests are often solitary, although a few pairs may breed relatively close together at good locations. Two to five brown-blotched white eggs are incubated mainly by the female, and both parents feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, but is gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds on a wide variety of insects that are caught in its beak as the martin flies near to cliff faces or over streams and alpine meadows. Adults and young may be hunted and eaten by birds of prey or corvids, and this species is a host of blood-sucking mites. With its very large and expanding range and large population there are no significant conservation concerns.
This bird is closely related to the other three crag martins which share its genus, and has sometimes been considered to be the same species as one or both, although it appears that there are areas where two species' ranges overlap without hybridisation occurring. All three Ptyonoprogne crag martins are quite similar in behaviour to other Old World swallows that build mud nests, and are sometimes subsumed into the larger genus Hirundo, but this approach leads to inconsistencies in classifying other genera, particularly the house martins.

[[Red-rumped Swallow]]
CATEGORIES: Cecropis, Birds of Western Australia, Birds of Europe, Birds of Asia, Birds of Pakistan, Birds of Japan, Birds of Africa, Animals described in 1769, Birds of Western Sahara, Birds of Cameroon, Birds of Ukraine

The Red-rumped Swallow (Cecropis daurica) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family. It breeds in open hilly country of temperate southern Europe and Asia from Portugal and Spain to Japan, India and tropical Africa. The Indian and African birds are resident, but European and other Asian birds are migratory. They winter in Africa or India and are vagrants to Christmas Island and northern Australia.
Red-rumped Swallows are somewhat similar in habits and appearance to the other aerial insectivores, such as the related swallows and the unrelated swifts (order Apodiformes). They have blue upperparts and dusky underparts.
They resemble Barn Swallows, but are darker below and have pale or reddish rumps, face and neck collar. They lack a breast band, but have black undertails. They are fast fliers and they swoop on insects while airborne. They have broad but pointed wings.
Red-rumped Swallows build quarter-sphere nests with a tunnel entrance lined with mud collected in their beaks, and lay 3 to 6 eggs. They normally nest under cliff overhangs in their mountain homes, but will readily adapt to buildings such as mosques and bridges.
They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are gregarious outside the breeding season. Many hundreds can be seen at a time on the plains of India.

CATEGORIES: Animals

Eumetazoa (Greek: εὖ eu, well + μετά metá, after + ζῷον zóon, animal) is a clade comprising all major animal groups except sponges, placozoa, and several other obscure or extinct life forms, such as Dickinsonia.  Characteristics of eumetazoans include true tissues organized into germ layers, and an embryo that goes through a gastrula stage.  The clade is usually held to contain at least Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and Bilateria.  Whether mesozoans and placozoans belong is in dispute. Ctenophora now appear basal metazoa.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Science|title=The Genome of the Ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi and its Implications for Cell Type Evolution|volume=342|issue=6164, number 6164|pages=1242592|date=13 December 2013|doi=10.1126/science.1242592|pmid=24337300|last1=Ryan|first1=J.

Some phylogenists have speculated the sponges and eumetazoans evolved separately from single-celled organisms, which would mean that the animal kingdom does not form a clade (a complete grouping of organisms descended from a common ancestor). However, genetic studies and some morphological characteristics, like the common presence of choanocytes, support a common origin.[tpl]cite journal |author=Philippe H, Derelle R, Lopez P, et al. |title=Phylogenomics revives traditional views on deep animal relationships |journal=Curr.

Eumetazoans are a major group of animals in the Five Kingdoms classification of Lynn Margulis and K. V. Schwartz, comprising the Radiata and Bilateria — all animals except the sponges, placozoans and mesozoans.Systema Naturae 2000 Taxon: Subkingdom Eumetazoa — retrieved February 2, 2006  When treated as a formal taxon Eumetazoa is typically ranked as a subkingdom.  The name Metazoa has also been used to refer to this group, but more often refers to the Animalia as a whole.  Many classification schemes do not include a subkingdom Eumetazoa.

Street fighting is hand-to-hand combat in public places, between individuals or groups of people.[tpl]cite news|title= Reality Fighting, Street Fighting & Self Defense|work= Kung Fu Magazine |date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=552|accessdate=2010-02-07[/tpl] 
Unlike sport fighting, a street fight might involve weapons, multiple opponents or revenge and has no rules. The venue is usually a public place (e.g. a street) and the fight often results in a serious injury or even death.
The main difference between street fighting and a self-defense situation is that a street fight is avoidable, whereas a self-defense situation is not. The other characteristic being that the fight is consensual between both parties. A typical situation might involve two men arguing in a bar, then one suggests stepping outside, where the fight commences. Thus, it is often possible to avoid the fight by backing off, while in self-defense, a person is actively trying to escape the situation, using force if necessary to assure his or her own safety.
In some martial arts communities, street fighting and self-defense are often considered synonymous.[tpl]cite webpage|title=Street fight – practical self-defence (czech language)|url=http://skbu.cz/co-umime/street-fight/|accessdate=2010-09-15[/tpl]

Enguera ([tpl]lang-va|Énguera[/tpl]) is a municipality in southwestern province of Valencia, Spain. 
The local economy depends primarily on agriculture, and secondarily on industry and services. In recent years, agricultural crops, especially olives, have gained in importance, although the complementary or secondary component of agriculture is evident. Rural tourism, including camping, country homes, a hotel, and restaurants are gaining importance. Meanwhile, the once-flourishing industry that was an important part of the village economy at the end of the eighteenth century has faded almost to nothing. While many of Enguera's inhabitants work in industry, their jobs are in nearby towns.
The Sierra de Enguera is named after this town.

This is a list of people on stamps of Ireland, including the years when they appeared on a stamp.
Because no postage stamps had been designed, the first Irish stamps issued were the current British definitive postage stamps bearing a portrait of George V that were overprinted Rialtas Sealadaċ na hÉireann 1922 (Provisional Government of Ireland 1922) and issued on 17 February 1922. The overprint was later changed to Saorstát Éireann 1922 (Irish Free State 1922).
The Irish Free State issued the first commemorative stamps depicting a person on 22 June 1929 when Oifig an Phoist, the Irish Post Office, a section of  the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, issued a set of three stamps showing Daniel O'Connell. Since 1929 O'Connell is one of a small number of people shown in two issues, including Wolfe Tone and Arthur Guinness. The 2009 Guinness issue included postmarks with his trade mark signature, a first in philately.First day of issue postmarks, 28 August 2009
The Department of Posts and Telegraphs and, after 1984, An Post designed stamps showing statesmen, religious, literary and cultural figures, athletes, etc. Until the mid-1990s it was usual policy not to issue stamps showing living persons, the only exceptions being Douglas Hyde (stamp 1943, d. 1949, illustrated below) and Louis le Brocquy (stamp 1977, still alive in 2007, illustrated below), but this policy has been put aside and there have recently been several issues showing living persons.

William Bartram (April 20, 1739 – July 22, 1823) was an American naturalist. The son of Ann (née Mendenhall) and John Bartram, William Bartram and his twin sister Elizabeth were born in Kingsessing, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[tpl]Cite book | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | last = Waselkov | first = Gregory A. | coauthors = Kathryn E.

From his mid-teens, Bartram was noted for the quality of his botanic and ornithological drawings. He also had an increasing role in the maintenance of his father's botanic garden, and added many rare species to it.
In 1773, he embarked upon a four-year journey through eight southern colonies. Bartram made many drawings and took notes on the native flora and fauna, and the native American Indians. In 1774, he explored the St. Johns River, where he had memorable encounters with aggressive alligators, and also visited a principal Seminole village at Cuscowilla, where his arrival was celebrated with a great feast. He met Ahaya the Cowkeeper, chief of the Alachua band of the Seminole tribe. When Bartram explained to the Cowkeeper that he was interested in studying the local plants and animals, the chief was amused and began calling him Puc Puggy (the flower hunter).Bartram, William.

[[Proof by infinite descent]]
CATEGORIES: Mathematical proofs, Mathematical terminology, Diophantine equations

In mathematics, a proof by infinite descent is a particular kind of proof by contradiction which relies on the facts that the natural numbers are well ordered and that there are only a finite number of them that are smaller than any given one. One typical application is to show that a given equation has no solutions.
Typically, one shows that if a solution to a problem existed, which in some sense was related to one or more natural numbers, it would necessarily imply that a second solution existed, which was related to one or more 'smaller' natural numbers. This in turn would imply a third solution related to smaller natural numbers, implying a fourth solution, therefore a fifth solution, and so on. However there cannot be an infinity of ever-smaller natural numbers, and therefore by mathematical induction (repeating the same step) the original premise—that any solution exists—must be incorrect. It is disproven because its logical outcome would require a contradiction.
An alternative way to express this is to assume one or more solutions or examples exists. Then there must be a smallest solution or example—a minimal counterexample. We then prove that if a smallest solution exists, it must imply the existence of a smaller solution (in some sense)—which again proves that the existence of any solution would lead to a contradiction.
The method of infinite descent was developed by Fermat, who often used it for Diophantine equations.[tpl]citation | last = Weil | first = André | author-link = André Weil | title = Number Theory: An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1984 | pages = 75–79 | isbn = 0-8176-3141-0[/tpl] Two typical examples are showing the non-solvability of the Diophantine equation r2 + s4 = t4 and proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, which states that any prime p such that p ≡ 1 (mod 4) can be expressed as a sum of two squares (see proof). In some cases, to a modern eye, what he was using was (in effect) the doubling mapping on an elliptic curve. More precisely, his method of infinite descent was an exploitation in particular of the possibility of halving rational points on an elliptic curve E by inversion of the doubling formulae. The context is of a hypothetical rational point on E with large co-ordinates. Doubling a point on E roughly doubles the length of the numbers required to write it (as number of digits): so that a 'halved' point is quite clearly smaller. In this way Fermat was able to show the non-existence of solutions in many cases of Diophantine equations of classical interest (for example, the problem of four perfect squares in arithmetic progression).

The widemouth blindcat (Satan eurystomus) is a species of North American freshwater catfish endemic to Texas in the United States.  It is the only representative of the genus Satan.
The widemouth blindcat's closest relative is the flathead catfish, Pylodictis olivaris.[tpl]cite journal|title=Morphological Adaptations of the Texas Blind Catfishes Trogloglanis pattersoni and Satan eurystomus (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae) to Their Underground Environment|first=Thomas G.|last=Langecker|coauthors=Longley, Glenn|journal=Copeia|year=1993|pages=976–986|doi=10.2307/1447075|volume=1993|jstor=1447075|issue=4|publisher=Copeia, Vol. 1993, No. 4[/tpl]
It was first discovered inhabiting a well, and is adapted for a lightless underground environment. This species is distributed in five artesian wells penetrating the San Antonio Pool of the Edwards Aquifer in and near San Antonio, Texas. These fish have been found with crustacean exoskeletons in their stomachs, and may be the top carnivore in their habitat.
The widemouth blindcat lacks pigmentation and has no externally visible eyes. The eye remnants are extremely reduced in size with very little or no trace of a retina or lens; the optic tract is present, but always regresses before reaching the brain. The swim bladder in these fish is reduced, and the skull is mostly cartilaginous and not well-ossified, unlike the adults of most larger ictalurids. The lateral line is fragmentary and never reaches past the anterior part of the anal fin. This species also has a few paedomorphic traits (indicated by small size, kidney morphology, and weak ossification of the skeleton). This species grows to about 13.7 cm (5.4 in) TL.[tpl]FishBase species|genus=Satan|species=eurystomus|year=2011|month=December[/tpl]

[[Fair housing (United States)]]
CATEGORIES: Civil rights and liberties, Housing in the United States

In the United States, the fair housing (also open housing) policies date largely from the 1960s. Originally, the terms fair housing and open housing came from a political movement of the time to outlaw discrimination in the rental or purchase of homes and a broad range of other housing-related transactions, such as advertising, mortgage lending, homeowner's insurance and zoning. Later, the same language was used in laws. In April 1968, at the urging of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Congress passed the federal Fair Housing Act (codified at 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619, penalties for violation at 42 U.S.C. 3631), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, only one week after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.
The primary purpose of the Fair Housing Law of 1968 is to protect the buyer/renter of a dwelling from seller/landlord discrimination. Its primary prohibition makes it unlawful to refuse to sell, rent to, or negotiate with any person because of that person's inclusion in a protected class.Definition of Fair Housing Act of 1968 , Legal Dictionary at TheFreeDictionary.com, Farlex Company. Accessed 15 January 2011.  The goal is a unitary housing market in which a person's background (as opposed to financial resources) does not arbitrarily restrict access. Calls for open housing were issued early in the twentieth century, but it was not until after World War II that concerted efforts to achieve it were undertaken.

The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra (RPhO; [tpl]lang-nl|Rotterdams Philharmonisch Orkest[/tpl]) is a Dutch symphony orchestra based in Rotterdam.  Its primary venue is the concert hall De Doelen.  The RPhO is considered one of the Netherlands' two principal orchestras of international standing, second to the  Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam.[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801EEDD1531F93AA25751C0A9669D8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | title=Yannick Nézet-Séguin; Youthful Intensity, Onstage and in the Program | work=New York Times | author=Anthony Tommasini | date=19 February 2010 | accessdate=2010-05-09[/tpl]  In addition to symphony concerts, the RPhO performs as the opera orchestra in productions at De Nederlandse Opera, as do other Dutch ensembles.
Several musicians founded the RPhO in 1918 as a private "Society of Professional Musicians for Mutual Cultivation of the Arts". It had paying members and the aim was to make music for personal pleasure without pursuit of gain.  The first musical director was Willem Feltzer, who was the manager of two Rotterdam music schools.  Alexander Schmuller succeeded Felzer as music director, for two years.
In May 1930, Eduard Flipse was appointed principal conductor, and held the post until 1962.  Under his stewardship, the amateur ensemble evolved into a professional orchestra.  When Flipse took over from Feltzer and Schmuller, the orchestra was in poor shape both financially and artistically.  However, Filpse had both managerial skills and musical vision.  He established an "Instrument Fund" to raise funds for new instruments and other necessities, and the orchestra became known for its special attention to contemporary music, featuring the work of Dutch composers such as Johan Wagenaar, Willem Pijper and Alphons Diepenbrock.
A 1300-seat concert hall, the Doelen, was built in 1935, and the orchestra was rewarded by rising attendance numbers.  When the Rotterdam City Council began to subsidize the orchestra, its problems seemed to be in the past. 
On May 7, 1940 the orchestra played a concert of Bruch and Stravinsky in a celebration of Flipse's first ten years as conductor.  In June 1940 Rotterdam was planning to celebrate its six hundredth birthday and the Rotterdam Philharmonic planned a special program.  However, on May 14 Nazi Germany bombed Rotterdam and nearly completely destroyed it, thereby launching its occupation of the Netherlands which lasted for the duration of World War II.  The Doelen was destroyed, as was a rehearsal facility, with most of the music library and all of the orchestra's instruments.
Despite the problems, the orchestra season finished according to plan, thanks to several other Dutch orchestras who gave concerts to raise money and helped with equipment and sheet music.  The Koninginnekerk, one of the few churches that survived the bombing, became the new concert hall.  During the occupation, the rules of the new Cultuurkamer, an organization meant to regulate the arts in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands, were severely restrictive and discriminatory.  Every musician had to become a member of the Cultuurkamer, Jewish musicians had to be fired, and music by Jewish composers was banned, as was music from countries at war with Nazi Germany.
After the war, the orchestra lacked a permanent home until a new concert hall, also called the Doelen, was built in 1966.  After Flipse retired as principal conductor in 1962, he was followed by Franz Paul Decker (1962-1967) and Jean Fournet (1968-1973).  In 1967, the young Dutch conductor Edo de Waart was appointed to the orchestra, and was principal conductor from 1973 to 1979.  Under De Waart and David Zinman, who succeeded him as principal conductor from 1979 to 1982, the Rotterdam grew into an orchestra of international stature, making many recordings and successful international tours.
From 1983 to 1991, the American conductor James Conlon was the RPhO's principal conductor.  The British conductor Jeffrey Tate succeeded Conlon, from 1991-1995.

Ramón María del Valle-Inclán y de la Peña (in the village András, in the comarca of Vilanova de Arousa, Galicia, Spain, 28 October 1866 – Santiago de Compostela, 5 January 1936), Spanish dramatist, novelist and member of the Spanish Generation of 98, is considered perhaps the most noteworthy and certainly the most radical dramatist working to subvert the traditionalism of the Spanish theatrical establishment in the early part of the 20th century. His drama is made all the more important by its influence on later generations of Spanish dramatists. Therefore, on the national theater day, his statue in Madrid receives the homage of the theatrical profession.

Ramón Gómez de la Serna Puig (July 3, 1888, Madrid – January 13, 1963, Buenos Aires) was a Spanish writer, dramatist and avant-garde agitator. He strongly influenced surrealist film maker Luis Buñuel.
Ramón Gómez de la Serna was especially known for "Greguerías" - a short form of poetry that roughly corresponds to the one-liner in comedy.  The Gregueria is especially able to grant a new and often humorous perspective. Serna published over 90 works in all literary genres. In 1933, he was invited to Buenos Aires. He stayed there during the Spanish Civil War and the following Franco regime and died there.
Some sample Greguerias:
 
 El par de huevos que nos tomamos parece que son gemelos, y no son ni primos terceros.

[[Guadeloupe Fund]]

CATEGORIES: Swedish monarchy, 1815 in Sweden, Economic history of Sweden

The Guadeloupe Fund ([tpl]lang-sv|Guadeloupefonden[/tpl]) was established by Sweden's Riksdag of the Estates in 1815 for the benefit of Crown Prince and Regent Charles XIV John of Sweden, also known as Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, and his heirs.
On March 3, 1813, the island of Guadeloupe was ceded by Britain to "His Royal Majesty the King of Sweden, and his successor to the Swedish throne" according to the Act of Succession of September 26, 1810. This was supposedly in order to keep the Crown Prince "at least partially compensated for the donations and other property, which he had lost since being called to the succession of the Swedish throne", having also used proceeds of sales of his Italian and French property to pay off debts of Sweden and losses as a consequence of Sweden's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars. Crown Prince Charles, or Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, had been one of the most successful soldiers in Napoleonic France. He was Empire Marshal of France, a former minister of war and had been created Prince of Ponte Corvo by Napoleon, before accepting the election as heir to the Swedish throne. Under his adoptive father, the reigning and yet powerless King Charles XIII of Sweden, the Crown Prince was effectively the regent of the country, and when Sweden sided with Napoleon's enemies, Bernadotte came to be seen as a traitor to his native France. Upon Sweden's accession to the Sixth Coalition, the offer of a West Indies island by Britain was an attempt to, in some way, compensate for this. Guadeloupe was conveniently located in proximity to the Swedish colony of Saint-Barthélemy.
After France had been defeated and Napoleon was exiled to Elba, the Treaty of Paris of 1814 settled the terms of the peace, in which Guadeloupe, having previously been a French possession, was returned to France. On August 13, 1814, a settlement of 24 million francs was reached with Britain as a replacement for the intended compensation.
The Crown Prince, acting as regent, used about half of the sum to pay off government debts; the rest went to various projects of public benefit. In recognition of this, the Riksdag of 1815 instituted that the Crown Prince and his heirs would receive an annual installment of 300,000 Riksdaler, which was to be paid out in perpetuity.
In the middle of the 20th century the scheme came under close scrutiny and, following a settlement between the Crown and the House of Bernadotte, the last payment of the fund was made in 1983.

In the War of the Sixth Coalition (1812–1814), a coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and a number of German States finally defeated France and drove Napoleon into exile on Elba.  After the disastrous French invasion of Russia, the continental powers joined Russia, the UK, Portugal and the rebels in Spain.  With their armies reorganized, they drove Napoleon out of Germany in 1813 and invaded France in 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate and restoring the Bourbons.
The War of the Sixth Coalition included the battles of Lützen, Bautzen, Dresden and the epic Battle of Leipzig (also known as the Battle of Nations), which was the largest battle in European history before the First World War.  Ultimately, Napoleon's earlier setbacks in Russia and Germany proved to be the seeds of his undoing, and the Allies occupied Paris, forcing his abdication.

[[Isle of Man National Anthem]]

The National Anthem ([tpl]lang-gv|Arrane Ashoonagh[/tpl]) of the Isle of Man, known in Manx as [tpl]lang|gv|Arrane Ashoonagh Vannin[/tpl], was written and composed by William Henry Gill (1839-1923), with the Manx translation by John J. Kneen (1873-1939). The English title is normally O Land of Our Birth.Island factfile - National anthem. Isleofman.com. Retrieved 2 Junio 2010.Island Facts. Isle of Man Public Services (2010). Retrieved 5 June 2010.
The anthem is sung to an adaptation of the traditional Manx melody of Mylecharaine's March, which had been described as the 'Manx national melody' long before Gill's composition. The words that accompanied the melody date to around 1800 and concern the impoverishment of a father in order to pay a dowry. However, those curious words have been identified as disparate pieces of older songs amalgamated together incompletely. The first verse of the song is: O Vylecharaine, c'raad hooar oo dty stoyr? / Nagh dooar mee 'sy Churragh eh dowin, dowin dy liooar? / My lomarcan daag oo mee (O Mylecharaine, where did you get your store? / Did I not get it in the Curragh, deep, deep enough? / Alone you left me).Manannan's Cloak: An Anthology of Manx Literature'' by Robert Corteen Carswell, London: Francis Boule Publishers, 2010, pp. 121-123
First performed at the Manx Music Festival on Thursday 21 March 1907, there are eight verses in total, but the first verse is usually sung. The anthem was given official status by the Isle of Man's legislature Tynwald at a sitting on 22 January 2003, with God Save the Queen, being designated as the Royal Anthem. The National Anthem is used on official and ceremonial occasions and in schools, the Royal Anthem is normally reserved for use additionally on those occasions when the Sovereign, members of the Royal Family or the Lieutenant Governor are present.
The song [tpl]lang|gv|Ellan Vannin[/tpl] had up to this point vied to be an equal unofficial national anthem.

[[Full Gospel]]
CATEGORIES: Pentecostalism

The term Full Gospel is often used as a synonym for Pentecostalism, a Protestant movement originating in the 19th century. Early Pentecostals saw their teachings on baptism with the Holy Spirit, spiritual gifts, and divine healing as a return to the doctrines and power of the Apostolic Age. Because of this many early Pentecostals called their movement the Apostolic Faith or the Full Gospel. 
This term has origins in the holiness movement. A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, framed his core beliefs around the "Fourfold Gospel", that Christ is Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and Soon Coming King. Many Pentecostals were influenced by Simpson and adopted his Fourfold or "Foursquare" Gospel as an articulation of their beliefs. This term is still used today in the name of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. 
The term "Full Gospel" also refers to Romans 15,18-19, where Paul says: "... to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."

An algorithm that solves a cube in the minimum number of moves is known as God's algorithm. 
There are two common ways to measure the length of a solution. The first is to count the number of quarter turns. The second is to count the number of face turns. A move like F2 (a half turn of the front face) would be counted as 2 moves in the quarter turn metric and as only 1 turn in the face metric.

Massamá ([tpl]IPA-pt|mɐsɐˈma[/tpl]) is a Portuguese parish, located in the municipality of Sintra, and a suburb of Lisbon. Separated from Queluz in 1997, it has an area of 2.78 km² and a population of 28,176 (2001 est.)
The parish consists of three different zones. The old zone is known as the 2nd phase, a newer zone is known as the 6th phase, while the newest zone, Massamá-Norte (North Massamá, also known as 7th phase) is located outside the parish of Massamá, belonging to Belas parish, though it's usually considered as a zone from Massamá, as it is connected to the rest of Massamá. Belas town is actually several kilometers from Massamá Norte.
Although the town already has enough people to be considered a city, it hasn't yet been made one due to political issues and lack of infrastructure such as fire department, police department and cinemas.

It honors the willingness of Abraham (Ibrahim) to sacrifice his young first-born son Ishmael (Ismail)[tpl]ref|a|a[/tpl] as an act of submission to God's command, before God then intervened to provide Abraham with a lamb to sacrifice instead.Diversity Calendar: Eid al-Adha, University of Kansas Medical Center In the lunar-based Islamic calendar, Eid al-Adha'' falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah and lasts for four days.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/eiduladha.shtml |title=BBC – Religion & Ethics – Eid el Adha |accessdate=December 2007, December 29, 2012[/tpl] In the international Gregorian calendar, the dates vary from year to year, drifting approximately 11 days earlier each year.
Eid al-Adha is the latter of the two Eid holidays, the former being Eid al-Fitr. The basis for the Eid al-Adha comes from the 196th ayah (verse) of Al-Baqara, the second sura of the Quran.[tpl]cite quran|2|196|s=ns[/tpl] The word "Eid" appears once in Al-Ma'ida, the fifth sura of the Quran, with the meaning "solemn festival".[tpl]Cite quran|5|114|s=ns|q=Said Jesus the son of Mary: "O Allah our Lord! Send us from heaven a table set (with viands), that there may be for us—for the first and the last of us—a solemn festival and a sign from thee; and provide for our sustenance, for thou art the best Sustainer (of our needs)." [/tpl]
Like Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha begins with a Sunnah prayer of two rakats followed by a sermon (khutbah). Eid al-Adha celebrations start after the descent of the Hajji from Mount Arafat, a hill east of Mecca. Ritual observance of the holiday lasts until sunset of the 12th day of Dhu al-Hijjah.Mittwoch, E. "ʿĪd al- Aḍḥā." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E.

The days of Tashriq are from the Fajr prayer of the 9th of Dhul Hijjah up to the Asr prayer of the 13th of Dhul Hijjah (5 days and 4 nights). This equals 23 prayers: 5 on the 9th–12th, which equals 20, and 3 on the 13th.This includes the Friday congregational prayer if it falls within these days. There is no harm in saying it after the Eid al-Adha prayer.

[[Class (philosophy)]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophical concepts

Philosophers sometimes distinguish classes from types and kinds.  We can talk about the class of human beings, just as we can talk about the type (or natural kind), human being, or humanity. How, then, might classes differ from types?  One might well think they are not actually different categories of being, but typically, while both are treated as abstract objects, classes are not usually treated as universals, whereas types usually are. Whether natural kinds ought to be considered universals is vexed; see natural kind.
There is, in any case, a difference in how we talk about types or kinds. We say that Socrates is a token of a type, or an instance of the natural kind, human being.  But notice that we say instead that Socrates is a member of the class of human beings.  We would not say that Socrates is a "member" of the type or kind, human beings. Nor would we say he is a type (or kind) of a class. He is a token (instance) of the type (kind).  So the linguistic difference is: types (or kinds) have tokens (or instances); classes, on the other hand, have members.
The concept of a class is similar to the concept a set defined by its members. Here, the class is extensional. If, however, a set is defined intensionally, then it is a set of things that meet some requirement to be a member. Thus, such a set can be seen as creating a type. Note that it also creates a class from the extension of the intensional set. A type always has a corresponding class (though that class might have no members), but a class does not necessarily have a corresponding type.

Hairspray is a musical with music by Marc Shaiman, lyrics by Scott Wittman and Shaiman and a book by Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan, based on the 1988 John Waters film Hairspray.  The songs include 1960s-style dance music and "downtown" rhythm and blues.

She then launches a campaign to integrate the show.  Hairspray is a social commentary on the injustices of parts of American society in the 1960s.
The musical's original Broadway production opened on August 15th, 2002.

In geometry, the Peano curve is the first example of a space-filling curve to be discovered, by Giuseppe Peano in 1890.[tpl]citation|first=G.|last=Peano|authorlink=Giuseppe Peano|title=Sur une courbe, qui remplit toute une aire plane|journal=Mathematische Annalen|volume=36|issue=1|year=1890|pages=157–160|doi=10.1007/BF01199438[/tpl]. Peano's curve is dense in the unit square, and was used by Peano to construct a continuous function from the unit interval to the unit square, motivated by an earlier result of Georg Cantor that these two sets have the same cardinality. Because of this example, some authors use the phrase "Peano curve" to refer more generally to any space-filling curve.[tpl]citation|title=Differential Geometry|first=Heinrich Walter|last=Gugenheimer|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1963|isbn=9780486157207|page=3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CSYtkV4NTioC&pg=PA[/tpl].

The Call of the Wild is a novel by Jack London published in 1903. The story is set in the Yukon during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush—a period when strong sled dogs were in high demand. The novel's central character is a dog named Buck, a domesticated dog living at a ranch in the Santa Clara valley of California as the story opens. Stolen from his home and sold into the brutal existence of an Alaskan sled dog, he reverts to atavistic traits. Buck is forced to adjust to, and survive, cruel treatments and fight to dominate other dogs in a harsh climate. Eventually he sheds the veneer of civilization, relying on primordial instincts and lessons he learns, to emerge as a leader in the wild.
London lived for most of a year in the Yukon collecting material for the book. The story was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903; a month later it was released in book form. The novel’s great popularity and success made a reputation for London. Much of its appeal derives from the simplicity with which London presents the themes in an almost mythical form. As early as 1908 the story was adapted to film and it has since seen several more cinematic adaptations.

The Westland affair in 1985-86 was an episode in which the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Defence Minister Michael Heseltine went public over a complex cabinet dispute with questions raised about integrity and which senior official was not telling the truth.
The argument was a result of differences of opinion as to the future of the British helicopter industry.  The struggling Westland Aircraft company, Britain's last helicopter manufacturer, was to be the subject of a rescue bid. While the Defence Secretary Heseltine favoured a European solution, integrating Westland and British Aerospace (BAe) with Italian (Agusta) and French companies, the Prime Minister and the Trade and Industry Secretary Leon Brittan wanted to see Westland merge with Sikorsky, an American company. Heseltine refused to accept Thatcher's choice and suggested she had lied about it. She had leaked a confidential letter, then tried to cover that up. It resulted in resignations in January 1986 by Heseltine and Brittan. The episode embarrassed the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher in 1986 and hurt her reputation.John Campbell, Margaret Thatcher: Iron Lady v. 2 (2004)  pp 483-98

Barking is an area of east London, England, and forms part of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. It is [tpl]convert|8.8|mi|km|1[/tpl] east of Charing Cross and is one of 35 major centres identified in the London Plan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf | author=Mayor of London | publisher=Greater London Authority | title=London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004) |date=February 2008 [/tpl] It was historically a fishing and agrarian settlement in the county of Essex and formed an ancient parish. Its economic history is characterised by a shift to market gardening, and industrial development to the south adjacent to the River Thames. The railway station opened in 1854 and has been served by the London Underground since 1908.  As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Barking significantly expanded and increased in population, primarily due to the development of the London County Council estate at Becontree in the 1920s, and it became a municipal borough in 1931. It has formed part of Greater London since 1965. In addition to an extensive and fairly low-density residential area, the town centre forms a large retail and commercial district, currently a focus for regeneration.http://www.barking-dagenham.gov.uk/5-work/regeneration/town-centre/towncentre-menu.html The former industrial lands to the south are being redeveloped as Barking Riverside.http://www.barkingriverside.co.uk/aboutbarkingriverside.html

Mucklestone is a small village in Staffordshire, England. It is about nine miles (14 km) northwest of Eccleshall, and four and a half miles northeast of Market Drayton in Shropshire.
It is notable for its associations with the Battle of Blore Heath. According to legend, Queen Margaret of Anjou is said to have watched the defeat of her forces from the church tower, before fleeing on horse-back.[tpl]cite book |last=Mee |first=Arthur |title=Staffordshire (King's England) |year=1971 |publisher=Hodder & Straughton |location= |isbn=0-340-15030-0|pages=132[/tpl]  It is said that Margaret employed the local blacksmith, William Skelhorn, to reverse the shoes on her horse to disguise her getaway. An anvil said to have belonged to Skelhorn stands in the churchyard to commemorate the event.
The ancient parish of Mucklestone was about six miles (10 km) in length, and from one to two miles (3 km) in breadth, extending along the borders of the counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire. Five of traditional townships, Aston, Knighton, Mucklestone, Oakley and Winnington are in Staffordshire and the other four, Bearstone, Dorrington, Gravenhunger and Woore, are in Shropshire.
This parish originally comprised [tpl]convert|8120|acre|km2|0[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|4362|acre|km2|0[/tpl] were in Staffordshire. Mucklestone township contains about [tpl]convert|1100|acre|km2|0[/tpl]. Aston, a village and township, three and a half miles north-east of Mucklestone, and eight miles (13 km) south-west of Newcastle-under-Lyme, contains [tpl]convert|912|acre|km2|1[/tpl]. Knighton is a small township, one mile (1.6 km) south-west of Aston, bounded on three sides by Shropshire. Oakley township at the south end of the parish, two miles (3 km) south-west of Mucklestone, contains Oakley Hall, in a beautiful park of [tpl]convert|300|acre|km2|1[/tpl], on the east bank of the River Tern, which locally divides Staffordshire from Shropshire. Winnington township, has a small village one mile (1.6 km) north of Mucklestone.William White, History, Gazetteer and Directory of Staffordshire,  Sheffield, 1851.
The church of Saint Mary at Mucklestone, which originally served the whole of the ancient parish, is in the decorated style. Except for the tower, it was rebuilt according to church records in 1789 and again in 1883 by Lynam and Rickman in keeping with the surviving medieval tower.[tpl]cite book |title=Staffordshire (Pevsner Buildings of England) |first=Nikolaus |last=Pevsner |publisher=Yale University Press / Penguin Books |year=1974 |pages=207 |isbn=0-14-071046-9[/tpl] It contains stained glass windows, designed by Charles Kempe in the 19th century including commemorations of the Battle of Blore Heath.
Other local structures of merit include a Georgian Folly; an important house of earlier date known as Willoughbridge Lodge; warm springs (discovered in the 17th century) and known, together with the ruined bath house c1682, as Willoughbridge wells; and also Oakley Hall built about 1710.[tpl]cite book |title=Staffordshire (Pevsner Buildings of England) |first=Nikolaus |last=Pevsner |publisher=Yale University Press / Penguin Books |year=1974 |pages=214 |isbn=0-14-071046-9[/tpl]

Walther Wilhelm Georg Bothe (8 January 1891 – 8 February 1957) was a German nuclear physicist, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954 with Max Born.
In 1913, he joined the newly created Laboratory for Radioactivity at the Reich Physical and Technical Institute (PTR), where he remained until 1930, the latter few years as the director of the laboratory. He served in the military during World War I from 1914, and he was a prisoner of war of the Russians, returning to Germany in 1920. Upon his return to the laboratory, he developed and applied coincidence methods to the study of nuclear reactions, the Compton effect, cosmic rays, and the wave-particle duality of radiation, for which he would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954.
In 1930 he became a full professor and director of the physics department at the University of Giessen. In 1932, he became director of the Physical and Radiological Institute at the University of Heidelberg. He was driven out of this position by elements of the deutsche Physik movement. To preclude his emigration from Germany, he was appointed director of the Physics Institute of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research (KWImF) in Heidelberg. There, he built the first operational cyclotron in Germany. Furthermore, he became a principal in the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranium Club, which was started in 1939 under the supervision of the Army Ordnance Office.
In 1946, in addition to his directorship of the Physics Institute at the KWImf, he was reinstated as a professor at the University of Heidelberg. From 1956 to 1957, he was a member of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in Germany.
In the year after Bothe's death, his Physics Institute at the KWImF was elevated to the status of a new institute under the Max Planck Society and it then became the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics. Its main building was later named Bothe laboratory.

The book relates his mental and intellectual development, his life and growth in Calcutta, his observations of vanishing landmarks, the connotation of this is dual—changing Indian situation and historical forces that was making exit of British from India an imminent affair.
Nirad, a self-professed Anglophile, is in any situation an explosive proposition and in the book he is at his best in observing as well as observing-at-a-distance and this dual perspective makes it a wonderful reading. His treatment of his childhood, his enchantment, disillusionment and gratitude to the colonial capital Calcutta is highly factual as well as artistic to the extent highly readable.
Arguably, his magnum opus considering his literary output that he could generate as late age as ninety years, Autobiography is not a single book, it is many. Consciously or unconsciously he has left traces of all his erudition, his spirit and learning. Declaring himself a cartographer of learning, the book is also a cartographic evidence of the author's mind and its varied geographies, of the map as well as of the mind.
The dedication of the book runs thus:

Over the years, the Autobiography has acquired many distinguished admirers. Winston Churchill thought it one of the best books he had ever read. V. S. Naipaul remarked: "No better account of the penetration of the Indian mind by the West - and by extension, of the penetration of one culture by another - will be or now can be written." In 1998, it was included, as one of the few Indian contributions, in The New Oxford Book of English Prose .

[[Cytoluminescent therapy]]
CATEGORIES: Experimental cancer treatments, Light therapy

Cytoluminescent Therapy is a proposed cancer treatment as a form of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) characterized by a photosensitiser that is supposedly eliminated from normal tissue but selectively accumulated in neoplastic and dysplastic tissue.  This is followed by whole body irradiation with light of the specific wave length which activates the photosensitiser.  The result is supposed to be selective damage or elimination of tumor cells while normal tissues are unharmed. However, tests as of 2003 did not show any positive clinical effects in a group of 48 patients treated in this way. 
The original providers of CLT in Killaloe, Ireland, are no longer performing the treatment. Much of their claims of effectiveness were based upon anecdotal reports, not research. In fact, the wavelength of light used to active the chlorphyll-derived photosensitizer used in CLT is incapable of penetrating tissue more than several millimeters. The FDA-approved therapy PDT uses red light (wavelength approximately 600-700 nm) and penetrates human tissue up to 2 centimeters. No wavelength can fully penetrate the human body, as the purveyors of CLT claimed.

In mathematics, random graph is the general term to refer to probability distributions over graphs.  Random graphs may be described simply by a probability distribution, or by a random process which generates them.Béla Bollobás, Random Graphs, 2nd Edition, 2001, Cambridge University Press The theory of random graphs lies at the intersection between graph theory and probability theory.  From a mathematical perspective, random graphs are used to answer questions about the properties of typical graphs.  Its practical applications are found all areas in which complex networks need to be modeled – a large number of random graph models are thus known, mirroring the diverse types of complex networks encountered in different areas. In a mathematical context, random graph refers almost exclusively to the Erdős–Rényi random graph model.  In other contexts, any graph model may be referred to as a random graph.

[[Girard Desargues]]
CATEGORIES: 1591 births, 1661 deaths, 17th-century mathematicians, 17th-century Italian people, French architects, French engineers, French mathematicians, Geometers, People from Lyon

Girard Desargues ([tpl]IPA-fr|dezaʁɡ|lang[/tpl]; February 21, 1591–September 1661) was a French mathematician and engineer, who is considered one of the founders of projective geometry.Swinden, B.A. "Geometry and Girard Desargues". The Mathematical Gazette. Vol. 34, No. 310 (Dec., 1950) p. 253 Desargues' theorem, the Desargues graph, and the crater Desargues on the Moon are named in his honour.
Born in Lyon, Desargues came from a family devoted to service to the French crown. His father was a royal notary, an investigating commissioner of the Seneschal's court in Lyon (1574), the collector of the tithes on ecclesiastical revenues for the city of Lyon (1583) and for the diocese of Lyon.
Girard Desargues worked as an architect from 1645. Prior to that, he had worked as a tutor and may have served as an engineer and technical consultant in the entourage of Richelieu.
As an architect, Desargues planned several private and public buildings in Paris and Lyon. As an engineer, he designed a system for raising water that he installed near Paris. It was based on the use of the at the time unrecognized principle of the epicycloidal wheel.
His research on perspective and geometrical projections can be seen as a culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry across the classical epoch in optics that stretched from al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) to Johannes Kepler, and going beyond a mere synthesis of these traditions with Renaissance perspective theories and practices. 
His work was rediscovered and republished in 1864. A collection of his works was published in 1951,[tpl]cite book|last=Desargues|first=Girard|title=L'oeuvre mathématique de G. Desargues: Textes publiés et commentés avec une introd. biograph. et historique|year=1951|publisher=Presses universitaires de France|location=Paris|editor-last=Taton|editor-first=René[/tpl] and the 1864 compilation remains in print.[tpl]cite book|last=Desargues|first=Girard|title=Oeuvres de Desargues|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1108032583|editor-last=Poudra|editor-first=Noël Germinal[/tpl] One notable work, often cited by others in mathematics, is "Rough draft for an essay on the results of taking plane sections of a cone" (1639). 
Late in his life, Desargues published a paper with the cryptic title of DALG. The most common theory about what this stands for is Des Argues, Lyonnais, Géometre (proposed by Henri Brocard).
He died in Lyon.

[[Desargues' theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Theorems in projective geometry, Proof without words

In projective geometry, Desargues' theorem, named after Girard Desargues, states:
Denote the three vertices of one triangle by a, b, and c, and those of the other by A, B,  and C.  Axial perspectivity means that lines ab and AB meet in a point, lines ac and AC meet in a second point, and lines bc and BC meet in a third point, and that these three points all lie on a common line called the axis of perspectivity.  Central perspectivity means that the three lines Aa, Bb, and Cc are concurrent, at a point called the center of perspectivity.
This intersection theorem is true in the usual Euclidean plane but special care needs to be taken in exceptional cases, as when a pair of sides are parallel, so that their "point of intersection" recedes to infinity.  Mathematically the most satisfying way of resolving the issue of exceptional cases is to "complete" the Euclidean plane to a projective plane by "adding" points at infinity following Poncelet.
Desargues's theorem is true for the real projective plane, for any projective space defined arithmetically from a field or division ring, for any projective space of dimension unequal to two, and for any projective space in which Pappus's theorem holds. However, there are some non-Desarguesian planes in which Desargues' theorem is false.

[[Avoidant personality disorder]]

Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), also known as anxious personality disorder,Avoidant personality disorder - International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) is a Cluster C personality disorder recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders handbook as afflicting persons when they display a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation, and avoidance of social interaction."Avoidant personality disorder" – Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), American Psychiatric Association (2000) Individuals afflicted with the disorder tend to describe themselves as ill at ease, anxious, lonely, and generally feel unwanted and isolated from others.[tpl]cite book|last1=Millon|first1=Theodore|authorlink1=Theodore Millon|last2=Davis|first2=Roger D.|title=Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV and Beyond, 2nd Edition|year=1996|pages=263[/tpl]
People with avoidant personality disorder often consider themselves to be socially inept or personally unappealing and avoid social interaction for fear of being ridiculed, humiliated, rejected, or disliked. Avoidant personality disorder is usually first noticed in early adulthood. Childhood emotional neglect and peer group rejection (e.g., bullying) are both associated with an increased risk for the development of AvPD.[tpl]cite web|title=Avoidant Personality Disorder - Environmental Factors|url=http://www.tljones.co.uk/apd/envmnt.htm[/tpl]
There is controversy as to whether avoidant personality disorder is a distinct disorder from generalized social phobia and it is contended by some that they are merely different conceptualisations of the same disorder, where avoidant personality disorder may represent the more severe form.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Reich|first1=James|title=Avoidant personality disorder and its relationship to social phobia|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=11|issue=1|pages=89–93|year=2009|pmid=19187715|doi=10.1007/s11920-009-0014-0[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Huppert|first1=Jonathan D.|last2=Strunk|first2=Daniel R.|last3=Ledley|first3=Deborah Roth|last4=Davidson|first4=Jonathan R.

[[Uqbar]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional Asian countries, Jorge Luis Borges

Uqbar is a fictional place in Jorge Luis Borges's 1940 short story "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius". Uqbar in the story is doubly fictional: even within the world of the story it turns out to be a fictional place. The story turns on the narrator's discovery of a fictitious entry about Uqbar: that is, a false article in an otherwise legitimate reference work. Also, despite its overall fictional nature, "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" is loaded with references to real people and places and it playfully combines reality and fiction.
Consequently, on the one hand hoaxes about Uqbar abound, and on the other, many writers have claimed that Borges's Uqbar is entirely fictional. Nonetheless, there is at least one real place with the name Uqbar, in Algeria, as well as a town called Ukbara in Iraq, each of which seems to have at least some aspects in common with Borges's fictional Uqbar. These places may plausibly have inspired the name and some other aspects of the Borges's Uqbar, although Borges's description of its culture is fictional.

A nickel, in American usage, is a five-cent coin struck by the United States Mint.  Composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel, the piece has been issued since 1866.
The silver half dime, equal to five cents, had been issued since the 1790s.  The American Civil War caused economic hardship, driving gold and silver from circulation; in response, in place of low-value coins, the government at first issued paper currency.  In 1865, Congress abolished the five-cent fractional currency note after Spencer M. Clark, head of the Currency Bureau (today the Bureau of Engraving and Printing), placed his own portrait on the denomination.  After successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces, without precious metal, Congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal; the Mint began striking this version in 1866.
The initial design of the Shield nickel was struck from 1866 until 1883, then was replaced by the Liberty Head nickel.  The Buffalo nickel was introduced in 1913 as part of a drive to increase the beauty of American coinage; in 1938, the Jefferson nickel followed.  In 2004 and 2005, special designs in honor of the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition were issued.  In 2006, the Mint reverted to using Jefferson nickel designer Felix Schlag's original reverse (or "tails" side), although a new obverse, by Jamie Franki, was substituted.  As of the end of FY 2013, it cost more than nine cents to produce a nickel;.[tpl]cite web |title=US Mint Cost To Make Penny and Nickel Declines in FY 2013 |url=http://news.coinupdate.com/us-mint-cost-to-make-cent-and-nickel-declines-3113/ |date=January 20, 2014[/tpl] the Mint is exploring the possibility of reducing cost by using less expensive metals.

Sarnia Cherie is used as the anthem of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands. 'Sarnia' is a traditional Latin name for the island, hence, the title translates as 'Dear Guernsey'.  George Deighton wrote Sarnia Cherie in 1911, with Domenico Santangelo subsequently composing the tune later that year. The song was first performed at St. Julian's Theatre - which is now the Gaumont Cinema - in November 1911.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/lifestyle/history-heritage/sarnia-cherie/ |title=Sarnia Cherie » History & Heritage |publisher=This Is Guernsey |date= |accessdate=2011-04-15[/tpl] Sarnia Cherie was G.B.

[[Twist (dance)]]

CATEGORIES: Novelty and fad dances

The twist is a dance that was inspired by rock and roll music. It became the first worldwide dance craze in the early 1960s, enjoying immense popularity among young people and drawing fire from critics who felt it was too provocative. It inspired dances such as the Jerk, the Pony, the Watusi, the Mashed Potato, the Monkey, and the Funky Chicken, but none were as popular. The dance was inspired by "The Twist", Chubby Checker's 1960 cover of the B-side of Hank Ballard and The Midnighters' 1959 single, "Teardrops on Your Letter".
A world record was set in DeLand, Florida, on October 11, 2012, when Chubby Checker sang the song live and the crowd danced. An estimated 4,000 people twisted along with Checker, surpassing the previous Guinness World Record record for most people twisting in the streets at once.[tpl]cite web|last=Bauer|first=Peter|title=DeLand crowd sets 'twist' record with Chubby Checker|url=http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20121012/NEWS/310119937?Title=DeLand-crowd-sets-twist-record-with-Chubby-Checker|publisher=Daytona Beach News Journal|accessdate=13 October 2012[/tpl]

[[Ma Normandie]]

CATEGORIES: Jersey culture, Norman music, Regional songs, National anthems

"Ma Normandie" is the semi-official anthem of the Bailiwick of Jersey, a British Crown dependency in the Channel Islands, and was written and composed by Frédéric Bérat. Jersey is historically part of the Duchy of Normandy, and French has been for centuries an official administrative language of Jersey, whose inhabitants have traditionally spoken a variety of Norman language.
Although "Ma Normandie" is used by Jersey at Commonwealth Games, Island Games and other international events where it is necessary for territories that otherwise use "God Save the Queen" to be distinguished, the fact that the song refers to France rather than to Jersey means that a body of opinion has campaigned for a change of anthem.
In 2007 the States of Jersey undertook to find a new, official, Anthem by means of an open competition. The final judging of the competition took place with a public performance of the short-listed pieces on 30 April 2008. The short-listed composers were: Derek Lawrence, Gerard Le Feuvre, James Taberner and a joint composition by Kevin Porée and Matheson Bayley; the traditional song "Beautiful Jersey"/"Man Bieau P'tit Jèrri" was also included in the shortlist. The winner of the competition was declared to be "Island Home" composed by Gerard Le Feuvre. A Jèrriais version of the English lyrics will be provided. The States will take the decision on whether to ratify the adoption of a new anthem in the light of public reaction to the results of the competition.BBC - Jersey - People - Jersey's new anthem
"Ma Normandie" is also widely used, but unofficially, as the regional anthem of Normandy.

[[Jèrriais]]

CATEGORIES: Jersey, Languages of Europe, Norman language, Articles including recorded pronunciations, Endangered Romance languages

Jèrriais is the form of the Norman language spoken in Jersey, in the Channel Islands, off the coast of France. It has been in decline over the past century as English has increasingly become the language of education, commerce and administration. There are very few people who speak Jèrriais as a mother tongue and, owing to the age of the remaining speakers, their numbers decrease annually. Despite this, efforts are being made to keep the language alive.
A similar language, Guernésiais is spoken in neighbouring Guernsey; the language of Sark, Sercquiais, is a descendant of the Jèrriais brought by the Jersey colonists who settled Sark in the 16th century; and there is mutual intelligibility with the Norman language of mainland Normandy.
Jèrriais is often called "Jersey French" or "Jersey Norman French" in English (though this may give the impression that the language is a dialect of French) and "jersiais" or "normand de Jersey" in French. Care should be taken to distinguish between Jèrriais and the Jersey Legal French used for legal contracts, laws and official documents by the government and administration of Jersey. For this reason, some prefer using the term "Jersey Norman" to avoid ambiguity and to disassociate the language from standard French.

[[Visual meteorological conditions]]

CATEGORIES: Air traffic control

In aviation, visual meteorological conditions (or VMC) is an aviation flight category in which visual flight rules (VFR) flight is permitted—that is, conditions in which pilots have sufficient visibility to fly the aircraft  maintaining visual separation from terrain and other aircraft. They are the opposite of Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The boundary criteria between IMC and VMC are known as the VMC minima and are defined by: visibility, cloud ceilings (for takeoffs and landings), and cloud clearances.
The exact requirements vary by type of airspace, whether it is day or night (for countries that permit night VFR), and from country to country. Typical visibility requirements vary from one statute mile to five statute miles (many countries define these in metric units as 1,500m to 8km). Typical cloud clearance requirements vary from merely remaining clear of clouds to remaining at least one mile away (1,500m in some countries) from clouds horizontally and one thousand feet away from clouds vertically. For instance, in Australia, VMC minima outside controlled airspace are clear of cloud with 5,000m visibility below 3,000ft AMSL or 1,000ft AGL (whichever is higher), and 1,000ft vertical/1,500m horizontal separation from cloud above these altitudes or in controlled airspace. Above 10,000ft, 8,000m visibility is required to maintain VMC. Air Traffic Control may also issue a Special VFR clearance to VFR aircraft, to allow departure from a control zone in less than VMC - this reduces the visibility minimum to 1,600m.
Generally, VMC requires greater visibility and cloud clearance in controlled airspace than in uncontrolled airspace. In uncontrolled airspace there is less risk of a VFR aircraft colliding with an IFR aircraft emerging from a cloud, so aircraft are permitted to fly closer to clouds. An exception to this rule is class B airspace class, in which ATC separates VFR traffic from other VFR traffic and from IFR traffic, which is why in Class B Airspace lower cloud clearance is required.

Celina González Zamora (born 16 March 1929 in Jovellanos, Matanzas) is a Cuban singer and songwriter of musica campesina, the traditional music of the Cuban countryside. She is best known for co-authoring A Santa Bárbara with her partner Reutilio Domínguez.not the traditional song Santa Bárbara bendita. Her recording of it was a hit, as was Celia Cruz's version. Celina and Reutilio also wrote Yo soy el punto cubano: the recording was a hit in many countries throughout the world. 
Celina met Reutilio Dominguez at the age of sixteen in Santiago de Cuba. He became her singing partner and husband, resulting in a collaboration that lasted until Reutilio's death in Guantanamo in 1971. In 1948 they began working with the famous Ñico Saquito and gained increasing popularity on radio, film and television. They performed in New York with two of the greatest Cuban artists of all time: Beny Moré and Barbarito Diez. In 1964 the duo stopped performing together and Celina continued as a soloist. In later years she sang with her son Lázaro, and was usually accompanied by the conjunto Campo Alegre.
Initially, her music was mainly that of the white countryside guajiro (peasant), with lyrics based on the poetics of décima. The musical form was often that of the punto cubano.Giro, Radamés 2007. Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba. La Habana. vol 3, p273 'Punto'.Linares, María Teresa 1999. El punto cubano. Santiago de Cuba. The relationship with Ñico Saquito taught her a great deal about the son and the guaracha, and her later work made frequent use of those forms.
In 1980 she won Egrem's Disco de Plata award for the album Celina. This was the first of many awards. In 1984 she was awarded the Vanguardia Nacional for her artistic work and won a trip to the Soviet Union and Bulgaria with her son. In 1984 she won the award for Best Singer at the 27th International Music Festival in Cali, Colombia and after a successful tour in Europe in 1988 she recorded a session for the BBC. Her biggest award came just two years ago when she received the Golden Picasso medal by UNESCO. 
Albums La rica cosecha and Desde La Habana te traigo were well received, and she was nominated, unsuccessfully, for a Grammy in 2001 in the 'Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album' category, for her CD Cincuenta años... como una reina. The album won instead the Cubadisco award for the same year.Giro, Radamés 2007. Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba. La Habana. vol 2, p164.

Apache ([tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|æ|tʃ|iː[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-fr|a.paʃ|lang[/tpl]) is the collective term for several culturally related groups of Native Americans in the United States originally from the Southwest United States. These indigenous peoples of North America speak a Southern Athabaskan (Apachean) language, which is related linguistically to the languages of Athabaskan speakers of Alaska and western Canada.
The modern term Apache excludes the related Navajo people.  Since the Navajo and the other Apache groups are clearly related through culture and language, they are all considered Apachean.  Apachean peoples formerly ranged over eastern Arizona, northern Mexico, New Mexico, west and southwest Texas, and southern Colorado. The Apachería consisted of high mountains, sheltered and watered valleys, deep canyons, deserts, and the southern Great Plains.
The Apachean groups had little political unity; the major groups spoke seven different languages and developed distinct and competitive cultures.  The current division of Apachean groups includes the Navajo, Western Apache, Chiricahua, Mescalero, Jicarilla, Lipan, and Plains Apache (formerly Kiowa-Apache). Apache groups live in Oklahoma and Texas and on reservations in Arizona and New Mexico.
Some Apacheans have moved to large metropolitan areas. Some Apacheans were employed in migrant farm labor and relocated to the central agricultural regions of Southern California, such as the Coachella, Imperial and Colorado River valleys, where now tens of thousands of Apacheans live. [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
The Apachean tribes were historically very strong and strategic, opposing the Spanish and Mexican peoples for centuries. The first Apache raids on Sonora appear to have taken place during the late 17th century.  In 19th-century confrontations, the U.S. Army found the Apache to be fierce warriors and skillful strategists.Emma and Todd Uzzelly, "Apache Indians Defend Borderlands in the Southwest", El Paso Community College Local History Project, accessed 21 Jan 2010

According to the historian John Shy, Jomini "deserves the dubious title of founder of modern strategy."Shy, p. 144 Jomini's ideas were a staple at military academies. The senior generals of the American Civil War—those who had attended West Point—were well versed in Jomini's theories.

The compound eyes of arthropods like insects, crustaceans and millipedes[tpl]cite journal |pages=463–76 |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2007.09.002 |title=The fine structure of the eyes of some bristly millipedes (Penicillata, Diplopoda): Additional support for the homology of mandibulate ommatidia |year=2007 |last1=Muller |first1=C |last2=Sombke |first2=A |last3=Rosenberg |first3=J |journal=Arthropod Structure & Development |volume=36 |issue=4[/tpl] are composed of units called ommatidia (singular: ommatidium). An ommatidium contains a cluster of photoreceptor cells surrounded by support cells and pigment cells.  The outer part of the ommatidium is overlaid with a transparent cornea. Each ommatidium is innervated by one axon and thus provides the brain with one picture element. The brain forms an image from these independent picture elements. The number of ommatidia in the eye depends upon the type of insect and ranges from just a handful in the primitive Archaeognatha and Thysanura to around 30 thousand in larger Anisoptera dragonflies and in some Sphingidae moths.[tpl]cite book |last=Common |first=I. F. B. |title=Moths of Australia |publisher=Brill |year=1990 |page=15 |isbn=978-90-04-09227-3[/tpl]
Ommatidia are typically hexagonal in cross section and approximately ten times longer than wide. The diameter is largest at the surface, tapering toward the inner end. At the outer surface there is a cornea, below which is a pseudocone that acts to further focus the light. The cornea and pseudocone form the outer ten percent of the length of the ommatidium.
The inner 90% of the ommatidium contains 6 to 9 (depending on the species) long and thin photoreceptor cells in the case of some butterflies[tpl]cite journal |pages=1805–13 |doi=10.1242/jeb.013045 |title=Reconstructing the ancestral butterfly eye: Focus on the opsins |year=2008 |last1=Briscoe |first1=A. D. |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=211 |issue=11[/tpl] often abbreviated "R cells" in literature and often numbered, e.g. R1 through R9. These "R cells" tightly pack the ommatidium. The portion of the R cells at the central axis of the ommatidium collectively form a light guide, a transparent tube, called the rhabdom. 
In certain flies, the rhabdom has separated into seven independent rhabdomeres.  This has required the rewiring of the eye such that each ommatidium now has seven axons leading from it. The advantage to this arrangement is that it increases the number of picture elements by a factor of seven, without increasing the number of ommatidia. 
Since an image from the compound eye is created from the independent picture elements produced by ommatidia, it is important for the ommatidia to react only to that part of the scene directly in front of it. To prevent light entering at an angle from being detected by the ommatidium it entered, or by any of the neighboring ommatidia, six pigment cells are present. The pigment cells line the outside of each ommatidium. Each pigment cell is situated at the apex of the hexagons and thus lines the outside of  three ommatidia. Light entering at an angle passes through the thin cross-section of the photoreceptor cell, with only a tiny chance of exciting it, and is absorbed by the pigment cell, before it can enter a neighboring ommatidium. In many species, in low-light situations, the pigment is withdrawn, so that light entering the eye might be detected by any of several ommatidia. This enhances light detection but lowers resolution.
The size of the ommatidia varies according to species, but ranges from 5 to 50 micrometres. The rhabdoms within them may cross-section at least as small as 1.x micrometres, the category of "small" being assigned in some cross-species studies to those under 2 micrometers.[tpl]cite journal |pages=147–77 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.42.1.147 |title=Visual Acuity in Insects |year=1997 |last1=Land |first1=Michael F. |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=42 |pmid=15012311[/tpl] Naively, microlens arrays can be seen as a biomimetic analogy of ommatidia.

Science studies  is an interdisciplinary research area that seeks to situate scientific expertise in a broad social, historical, and philosophical context. It is concerned with the history of scientific disciplines, the interrelationships between science and society,  and the alleged covert purposes that underlie scientific claims. While it is critical of science, it holds out the possibility of broader public participation in science policy issues.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]  
The word science is used in the sense of natural, social and formal sciences - areas of research that tend toward positivism. The word "science" thus explicitly excludes the humanities and cultural studies, which tend toward relativism. Thus, while the topic of research in "science studies" is the sciences, the main approaches to research come from the humanities (e.g. history) (hence the word "study" in the title, rather than for example "theory"). Science studies scholars study (investigate) specific phenomena such as technological milieus, laboratory culture, science policy, and the role of the university.

[[Indian Peace Medal]]
CATEGORIES: Native American history, Lewis and Clark Expedition, United States federal Indian policy

The term Indian Peace Medals is most commonly associated with circular, or oval, silver medallions distributed to Native American tribal representatives by representatives of the United States government. They were made in three sizes: small, medium and large. The largest could have a diameter of inches.  The most common feature of Indian Peace Medals was the portrait of the current U.S. president.  They are often cited as a symbol of the relationships between the United States federal government and Native Americans in the late-18th and 19th centuries.  Indian Peace Medals were minted until the term of President Benjamin Harrison ended. The relationships, governed by treaty and ostensible good faith, were in most cases ultimately determined by force.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
Following the practice established by European powers in the American colonies, U.S. presidents and their agents gave these medals to the chiefs or significant warriors of Native American tribes as tokens of friendship, sometimes accompanied by explanations of newly established U.S. sovereignty. The best known examples were the medals carried by Lewis and Clark on their 1804-1806 expedition to explore the Louisiana Purchase. Those were made of silver, of three different sizes. They were the first American Indian peace medals to be struck as opposed to engraved, but they were struck on two thin sheets of silver and held together by an outer band. Prior to James Madison's time, the obverse and reverse were separate silver sheets.  The exact origin of Indian Peace Medal distribution is obscure.  "Indian Peace Medals" were often typically accompanied by a token of a flag of the colonial power conducting diplomatic negotiations with the tribe.
From 1801 - , the reverse of an Indian Peace Medal depicted clasped hands and a crossed tomahawk and peace pipe.  It also included the phrase Peace and Friendship.  The left wrist was covered with the ornamented cuff of a military uniform; the right wrist was bare, except in the case of Jefferson's medal, which covered the wrist with a broad metallic bracelet with the image of an eagle on it.  The Jefferson design is also the basis for the reverse design of some 2004 nickels.
In many cases, because the medals were distributed to significant members of tribal parties, the medals became sought after symbols of power and influence within Native American tribes.  While most of the medals were not distributed with holes in them, Native Americans would often perforate the medals themselves so to be worn around the neck.  Indian peace medals are commonly seen in Native American portraiture.  Once the medals became sought after by Native Americans during the period of European colonization of the Americas, many private corporations commissioned their own medals, often featuring the president of the corporation on the face of the medal, which was to be given out by their representative.  The practice of distributing medals to Native American became so commonplace at one point that government representatives reported that it was difficult to engage in diplomatic relations without them.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
The production of a majority of the American medals took place at the United States Mint in Philadelphia.  As the relations between the United States government and American Indian tribes changed and a large number of unofficial medals flooded reservations, the significance of the medals declined.
The United States Mint produces bronze replicas of some peace medals as part of its presidential medal series.

Vladimir Antonovich Ivashko ([tpl]lang-ru|Влади́мир Анто́нович Ива́шко[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ua|Володимир Антонович Івашко[/tpl]) (28 October 1932 – 13 November 1994), was briefly the acting General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) during the period from 24 August 1991 to 29 August 1991. On 24 August Mikhail Gorbachev resigned, and on 29 August the CPSU was suspended by the Supreme Soviet. Before becoming General Secretary he had been voted Gorbachev's Deputy General Secretary within the Party on 12 July 1990, a newly created position as a result of the 28th Congress of the Communist Party
The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the 28th Congress in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society, the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Actual political power lay in the positions of President of the Soviet Union (held by Gorbachev) and President of the Russian SFSR (held by Boris Yeltsin). During the August coup he did not make public statements but on behalf of the Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee distributed letters to local party organizations calling on them to uphold the CPSU.
Mikhail Gorbachev brought in his ally Ivashko in to replace the long-serving Volodymyr Shcherbytsky as First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian SSR on 28 Sep 1989. Ivashko led the Communists to victory in the first relatively parliamentary election held in the Ukrainian SSR, which took place from 4 March to 18 March 1990, the Communists winning 331 seats to the 'Democratic Blocks' 111 seats. Ivashko was elected by the communist majority to the post of the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR on 4 Jun 1990. Since the abandonment by the Communists of their `leading role` in early 1990 this position now superseded that of First Secretary of the Communist Party as most powerful position in the Ukraine.
He resigned his position as First Secretary on 22 Jun 1990 following opposition demonstrations against his occupation of both the First Secretary post and Chairmanship of the Rada. However on 9 Jul 1990 he too resigned as Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR after declining to be recalled to Kiev during the 28th Congress of the Communist Party in Moscow, and a few days later successfully secured the position of Deputy General Secretary of the CPSU.
Ivashko retired in 1992 and died on 13 November 1994, at the age of 62 after an undetermined "long illness".

A travel trailer or caravan is towed behind a road vehicle to provide a place to sleep which is more comfortable and protected than a tent (although there are fold-down trailer tents).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gorving.ca/foldingcamping.asp |title=Folding Camping Trailer (fold-down) : a towable RV |publisher=Gorving.ca |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.folding-camper.com/|title=Buying a trailer tent or folding camper.|date= |accessdate=2011-02-04[/tpl] It provides the means for people to have their own home on a journey or a vacation, without relying on a motel or hotel, and enables them to stay in places where none is available. However, in some countries campers are restricted to designated sites for which fees are payable.
Travel trailers and caravans vary from basic models which may be little more than a tent on wheels to those containing several rooms with all the furniture and furnishings and equipment of a home. They are used principally in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand and are rare elsewhere.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

Julius Kambarage Nyerere (13 April 1922 – 14 October 1999) was a Tanzanian politician who served as the first President of Tanzania and previously Tanganyika, from the country's founding in 1961 until his retirement in 1985.
Born in Tanganyika to Nyerere Burito (1860–1942), Chief of the Zanaki, Nyerere was known by the Swahili honorific Mwalimu or 'teacher', his profession prior to politics. He was also referred to as Baba wa Taifa (Father of the Nation). Nyerere received his higher education at Makerere University in Kampala and the University of Edinburgh. After he returned to Tanganyika, he worked as a teacher. In 1954, he helped form the Tanganyika African National Union.
In 1961 on independence, Nyerere was elected Tanganyika's first Prime Minister, and following the declaration of a republic in 1962, the country's first President. In 1964, Tanganyika became politically united with Zanzibar and was renamed Tanzania. In 1965, a one-party election returned Nyerere to power. During the first years, Nyerere created a single-party system and used "preventive detention" to eliminate trade unions and opposition.
In 1967, influenced by the ideas of African socialism, Nyerere issued the Arusha Declaration, which outlined his vision of ujamaa ("unity", "oneness" or "familyhood"), a concept that came to dominate his policies. However, his policies led to economic decline, systematic corruption, and unavailability of goods. In the early 1970s, Nyerere ordered his security forces to forcibly transfer much of the population to collective farms and, because of opposition from villagers, often burned villages down. This campaign pushed the nation to the brink of starvation and made it dependent on foreign food aid.
In 1985, after more than two decades in power, he relinquished power to his hand-picked successor, Ali Hassan Mwinyi. Nyerere left Tanzania as one of the poorest, least developed, and most foreign aid-dependent countries in the world, although much progress in services such as health and education had nevertheless been achieved.http://www.policyforum-tz.org/files/LeeKyongKoo.pdf He remained the chairman of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi for another five years until 1990. He died of leukemia in London in 1999.

The Westland Wessex is a British-built turbine-powered development of the Sikorsky S-58 "Choctaw", it was developed and produced under license by Westland Aircraft (later Westland Helicopters). One of the main changes from Sikorsky's S-58 was the replacement of the piston-engine powerplant with a turboshaft engine; the Wessex was the first helicopter in the world to be produced in large numbers that made use of a gas turbine propulsion system."The Wessex Helicopter". royalnavy.mod.uk, Retrieved: 14 January 2014. Early models were powered by a single Napier Gazelle engine, later builds used a pair of Rolls-Royce Gnome engines.
The Wessex was initially produced for the Royal Navy (RN) and later for the Royal Air Force (RAF); a limited number of civilian aircraft were also produced, as well as some export sales. The Wessex operated as an anti-submarine warfare and utility helicopter; it is perhaps best recognised for its use as a search and rescue (SAR) helicopter. The type entered operational service in 1961, and had a service life in excess of 40 years before being retired in Britain.

CATEGORIES: Albums produced by Rick Rubin, The Mars Volta albums, 2003 debut albums, Concept albums, Albums with cover art by Storm Thorgerson, Gold Standard Laboratories albums

De-Loused in the Comatorium is the debut studio album by American progressive rock band The Mars Volta, released on June 24, 2003 on Gold Standard Laboratories and Universal Records. Based on a short story written by lead singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and sound manipulation artist Jeremy Michael Ward, the concept album is an hour-long tale of Cerpin Taxt, a man who enters a week-long coma after overdosing on a mixture of morphine and rat poison. The story of Cerpin Taxt alludes to the death of El Paso, Texas artist — and Bixler-Zavala's friend — Julio Venegas (1972–1996). 
Co-produced by Rick Rubin and guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, it is the only studio album to feature founding member Jeremy Michael Ward, who was found dead in an apparent heroin overdose one month before the album was released. Following the departure of Eva Gardner, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea occupied the role of bass guitarist on this album. 
The music contained in De-Loused is distinguished by its enigmatic lyrics, latin and jazz rhythms, and Omar Rodríguez-López's frenetic guitar riffs, which are often harshly dissonant. The title of this album is taken from the lyrics of the song "Eunuch Provocateur" on the band's previous release, Tremulant. The cover artwork is by Storm Thorgerson.

[[Marsupilami]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional marsupials, Spirou et Fantasio, Dupuis titles, Television series based on Belgian comics

Marsupilami is a fictional comic book species created by André Franquin, first published on 31 January 1952 in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou.[tpl]cite web| last =franquin.com | title =Franquin-Une vie-1952 | url =http://www.franquin.com/bio/1952.php [/tpl][tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Since then it appeared regularly in the popular Belgian comic book series Spirou et Fantasio until Franquin stopped working on the series in 1968 and the character dropped out soon afterward. In the late 1980s, the Marsupilami got its own successful spin-off series of comic albums, Marsupilami, written by Greg, Yann and Dugomier and drawn by Batem, launching the publishing house Marsu Productions. Later, two animated shows featuring this character, as well as a Sega Genesis video game and a variety of other merchandise followed. The asteroid 98494 Marsupilami is named in its honour.
The name is a portmanteau of the words marsupial, Pilou-Pilou (the French name for Eugene the Jeep, a character Franquin loved as a kid) and ami, French for friend.
Marsupilami's adventures had been translated to several languages, like Dutch, German, Spanish,  Portuguese and several Scandinavian languages. More than three million albums of the Marsupilami series are claimed to have been sold by Marsu Productions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marsuproductions.com/pers.php?name=marsupilami|title=Marsu Productions : Merchandising – Promotion – Edition tout pour la BD  et bande dessinée|publisher=Marsuproductions.com|language=French|date=|accessdate=2014-01-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202083439/http://www.marsuproductions.com/pers.php?name=marsupilami|archivedate=2 February 2009[/tpl]
One album of Spirou and Fantasio featuring Marsupilami, number 15, was translated to English by Fantasy Flight Publishing in 1995, although it is currently out of print. Plans on releasing number 16 ended halfway through the translation process, due to bad sales. In 2007, Egmont's subsidiary Euro Books translated albums number 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14 for the Indian market.

[[Obedience (human behavior)]]

CATEGORIES: Authority, Behavior, Conformity, Social psychology

Obedience, in human behavior, is a form of "social influence in which a person yields to explicit instructions or orders from an authority figure".[tpl]cite book | last = Colman | first = Andrew | title = A Dictionary of Psychology | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 0199534063 [/tpl] Obedience is generally distinguished from compliance, which is behavior influenced by peers, and from conformity, which is behavior intended to match that of the majority.  Obedience can be seen as immoral, amoral and moral. For example, in a situation when one orders a person to kill another innocent person and he or she does so willingly, it is generally considered to be immoral. However, when one orders a person to kill an enemy who will end many innocent lives and he or she does so willingly, it can be deemed moral.
Humans have been shown to be obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures, as shown by the Milgram experiment in the 1960s, which was carried out by Stanley Milgram to find out how the Nazis managed to get ordinary people to take part in the mass murders of the Holocaust. The experiment showed that obedience to authority was the norm, not the exception. Regarding obedience, Milgram said that "Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to; Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others."[tpl]cite journal|last=Milgram|first=S.|title=Behavioral study of obedience|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1963|issue=67|pages=371–378[/tpl] A similar conclusion was reached in the Stanford prison experiment.

The Return of Jafar (also known as Aladdin: The Return of Jafar) is a 1994 American animated film that is a direct-to-video sequel to the 1992 animated film Aladdin, both produced by The Walt Disney Company. The film was released on May 20, 1994 and serves as the origin of the Aladdin animated series. Another direct-to-video sequel, Aladdin and the King of Thieves, followed in 1996.
The film centers on Jafar, the villain from the original film, trying to gain his revenge against Aladdin and his companions, Princess Jasmine, Genie, Abu, Carpet, the Sultan, and Iago (now turned against Jafar), and become the ruler of Agrabah.
It was the first Disney direct-to-video animated feature release, and was released on Special Edition DVD (with "Aladdin:" added to the title), with digitally restored picture and remastered sound. The Special Edition DVD along with the other two films in the series went back to the Disney Vault on January 31, 2008 in the U.S., and February 4, 2008 in the U.K.[tpl]cite web | work=UltimateDisney.com | title=Out of Print Disney DVDs|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/OOP.htm| accessdate=24 September 2006[/tpl]
The trailer of the film was seen on the 1994 release of The Fox and the Hound.
This was the first and only Aladdin full-length production without the original voice of Genie, Robin Williams. He was replaced by Dan Castellaneta (best known for voicing Homer Simpson), who also voiced the Genie in the animated series as well as in Kingdom Hearts. Williams returned as the Genie in Aladdin and the King of Thieves.
This was also the first Aladdin full-length production without the original voice of Sultan, Douglas Seale. He was replaced by Val Bettin, who also voiced the Sultan in the series' animated series and in Aladdin and the King of Thieves.

Aladdin and the King of Thieves is a 1996 animated film that is the second direct-to-video sequel to the Disney animated feature Aladdin.  Aladdin and the King of Thieves serves as the final chapter of the Arabian Nights-inspired Disney stories that began with the theatrical feature Aladdin (1992) and continued with its first direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar (1994) and the Aladdin animated TV series (1994–1995).
Robin Williams returned to voice the Genie after Disney apologized for the use of his likeness in the promotion of the original Aladdin film (Williams believed Disney had broken the terms of his contract). Dan Castellaneta had actually recorded all the dialogue of the Genie for this film, as he did with the previous sequel due to Disney's differences with Williams, but his recording session was not used when Robin Williams agreed to reprise his role.
This film grossed $186 million, making it the fourth-highest-grossing direct-to-video animated feature film of all time.  In 2005, the film was re-released as a Special Edition DVD, with digitally restored picture and remastered sound. The DVD however has the film matted to 1.85:1 Widescreen, an aspect ratio Disney never uses for animation. The DVD went back into the Disney Vault along with the other two films in the series in January 2008.[tpl]cite web | work=UltimateDisney.com | title=Out of Print Disney DVDs|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/OOP.htm| accessdate=24 September 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060929172259/http://www.ultimatedisney.com/OOP.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The film is inspired by the tale Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves from the 1001 Arabian Nights, replacing Ali Baba with Aladdin, and for the first time since the original Aladdin, the film has a completely new soundtrack instead of the rearranged music from the original film for The Return of Jafar and the TV series.
Though the film serves as a finale of the series, the characters would later return in a crossover episode of the animated series Hercules, titled "Hercules and the Arabian Night."

[[State Opening of Parliament]]
CATEGORIES: Speeches by heads of state, Parliament of the United Kingdom, Opening ceremonies, Ceremonies in the United Kingdom

The State Opening of Parliament is an event in the United Kingdom that marks the commencement of a session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and includes a Speech from the Throne.  In many other countries, a similar speech from the throne is given by their head of state to their national legislature at or near the opening of a new legislative session. In Commonwealth nations that recognize Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State, the Governor-General of the nation gives the Speech from the Throne as the Queen's representative.
The State Opening takes place in the House of Lords Chamber and, before 2011, was usually held in November or December[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm|title=State Opening of Parliament|date=6 October 2009|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=14 October 2009[/tpl] or, in a general election year, when the new Parliament first assembled. In 1974, when two general elections were held, there were two State Openings.
However, from 2012 onwards, the ceremony takes place in May. This is owing to the introduction in 2011 of fixed-term parliaments of five years in length, with parliamentary elections being subsequently held in the May of every year divisible by five, with the next such election being scheduled for 2015. The 2012 ceremony took place on 9 May and the 2013 date was 8 May.
The current Sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II, has opened every session of the Westminster Parliament since her accession, except in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, respectively. These two sessions were opened by Lords Commissioners, headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (Geoffrey Fisher in 1959, and Michael Ramsey in 1963), empowered by Her Majesty. The Lord Chancellor (The Viscount Kilmuir in 1959, The Lord Dilhorne in 1963) read the Queen's Speech on those occasions.

The Dieppe Raid, also known as the Battle of Dieppe, Operation ''Rutter and, later,  'Operation Jubilee''', was a Second World War Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe. The raid took place on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942. The assault began at 5:00 a.m. and by 10:50 a.m. the Allied commanders were forced to call a retreat. Over 6,000 infantrymen, predominantly Canadian, were supported by a Canadian Armoured regiment and a strong force of Royal Navy and smaller Royal Air Force landing contingents. It involved 5,000 Canadians, 1,000 British troops, and 50 United States Rangers.
Objectives included seizing and holding a major port for a short period, both to prove that it was possible and to gather intelligence. Upon retreat, the Allies also wanted to destroy coastal defences, port structures and all strategic buildings. The raid had the added objectives of boosting morale and demonstrating the firm commitment of the United Kingdom to open a western front in Europe.
Virtually none of these objectives were met. Allied fire support was grossly inadequate and the raiding force was largely trapped on the beach by obstacles and German fire. After less than 10 hours since the first landings, the last Allied troops had all been either killed, evacuated, or left behind to be captured by the Germans. Instead of a demonstration of resolve, the bloody fiasco showed the world that the Allies could not hope to invade France for a long time. Some intelligence successes were achieved, including electronic intelligence.
A total of 3,623 of the 6,086 men (almost 60%) who made it ashore were either killed, wounded, or captured.Hamilton, Nigel (1981). Monty: The Making of a General. London: Hamish Hamilton Ltd.

[[Josef Sudek]]

Josef Sudek (17 March 1896, Kolín, Bohemia – 15 September 1976, Prague) was a Czech photographer, best known for his photographs of Prague.
Sudek was originally a bookbinder. During The First World War he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1915 and served on the Italian Front until he was wounded in the right arm in 1916. Although he had no experience with photography and was one-handed due to his amputation, he was given a camera. After the war he studied photography for two years in Prague under Jaromir Funke. His Army disability pension gave him leeway to make art, and he worked during the 1920s in the romantic Pictorialist style.  Always pushing at the boundaries, a local camera club expelled him for arguing about the need to move forwards from 'painterly' photography. Sudek then founded the progressive Czech Photographic Society in 1924. Despite only having one arm, he used large, bulky cameras with the aid of assistants.
Sudek's photography is sometimes said to be modernist. But this is only true of a couple of years in the 1930s, during which he undertook commercial photography and thus worked "in the style of the times". Primarily, his personal photography is neo-romantic. 
His early work included many series of light falling in the interior of St. Vitus cathederal. During and after World War II Sudek created haunting night-scapes and panoramas of Prague, photographed the wooded landscape of Bohemia, and the window-glass that led to his garden (the famous The Window of My Atelier series). He went on to photograph the crowded interior of his studio (the Labyrinths series).
His first Western show was at George Eastman House in 1974 and he published 16 books during his life.
Known as the "Poet of Prague", Sudek never married, and was a shy, retiring person.  He never appeared at his exhibit openings and few people appear in his photographs. Despite the privations of the war and Communism, he kept a renowned record collection of classical music.

210px|thumbGeorge Szell ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l[/tpl]; June 7, 1897 – July 30, 1970), originally György Széll, György Endre Szél, or Georg Szell,Sources differ on Szell's birthname or "real" name.  Slonimsky 2001, for example, begins its entry, "Szell, George (actually, György)...", and Charry 2011 gives his birth name as György Endre Szél.  This form would seem consistent with Szell's Hungarian origins.  However, both Charry 2001 and Rosenberg 2000 fail to cite the name "György" at all, mentioning instead the more Germanic "Georg,"  which would seem appropriate in Szell's childhood home of Vienna.  Rosenberg goes so far as to say, "he was born Georg Szell on June 7, 1897, in Budapest..." (p. 237, emphasis added).  Sources agree, however, that in later life (at least after coming to America) Szell went by the Anglicised "George," and that is the name credited on his extant recordings. was a Hungarian-born American conductor and composer. He is widely considered one of the twentieth century's greatest conductors.Charry, Michael (2011) “George Szell A Life of Music” University of Illinois Press. He is remembered today for his long and successful tenure as music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, and for the recordings of the standard classical repertoire he made in Cleveland and with other orchestras.
Szell came to Cleveland in 1946 to take over a respected if undersized orchestra, which was struggling to recover from the disruptions of World War II.  By the time of his death he was credited, to quote the critic Donal Henahan, with having built it into "what many critics regarded as the world's keenest symphonic instrument."[tpl]cite news | author=Henahan, Donal | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dht-QrfdzIwC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=szell+henahan&source=web&ots=BEtagzUPJC&sig=it2jxE2lz8rAn_OOeOQOJHVs3P8 | title=George Szell, Conductor, Is Dead | pages=1. | work=The New York Times | date=31 July 1970 | accessdate=2007-07-15[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Brown  | first=Richard  | coauthors=Brown, Gene | title=The Arts | url=http://books.google.com/?id=dht-QrfdzIwC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=szell+henahan |location=New York | publisher=Arno Press | year=1978 | isbn=0-405-11153-3[/tpl]  Through his recordings, Szell has remained a presence in the classical music world long after his death, and his name remains synonymous with that of the Cleveland Orchestra.  While on tour with the Orchestra in the late 1980s, then-Music Director Christoph von Dohnányi remarked, "We give a great concert, and George Szell gets a great review."[tpl]cite news | author=Oestreich, James R. | url= | title=Out From Under the Shadow | work=The New York Times | date=26 January 1997 | accessdate=[/tpl]

Tyler Hamilton (born March 1, 1971, Marblehead, Massachusetts) is a former American professional road bicycle racer. He is the only American rider to win one of the Five Monuments of Cycling. Hamilton became a professional cyclist in 1995 with the US Postal Service cycling team. He was a teammate of Lance Armstrong during the 1999, 2000 and 2001 Tour de France, where Armstrong won the Yellow jersey. Hamilton appeared at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ha/tyler-hamilton-1.html|title=Tyler Hamilton|work=Sports-reference[/tpl] In 2004, he won a gold medal at the time trial. The first doping test gave a positive result, but because the backup sample was frozen, no doping offence could be proven. After he failed further doping tests at the 2004 Vuelta a España, Hamilton was suspended for two years.
Hamilton came back after his suspension and became national road race champion in 2008. In 2009, Hamilton failed a doping test again, and was banned for eight years, which effectively caused him to retire. In July 2010, he was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury for the use of performance enhancing drugs in cycling. In May 2011, Hamilton admitted that he had used banned substances in competition, and returned his gold medal. In 2012, he co-authored a book The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-ups, and Winning at All Costs, which details his doping practices and experience in the world of cycling.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/category/books-and-dvd/product/review-tyler-hamilton-the-secret-race-46544|title=The Secret Race by Tyler Hamilton and Daniel Coyle - book review|work=BikeRadar|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|date=5 September 2012|accessdate=30 December 2012|author=Laura Weislo[/tpl] On August 10, 2012 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped Hamilton of his 2004 gold medal.IOC formally strips Tyler Hamilton of Athens gold

Donald Grant Creighton, [tpl]Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC[/tpl] (July 15, 1902 – December 19, 1979) was a noted Canadian historian whose major works include The Commercial Empire of the St-Lawrence: 1760-1850 (first published in 1937) a detailed study on the growth of the English merchant class in relation to the St-Lawrence River in Canada. His biography of John A. Macdonald, published into two parts between 1952 and 1955, was considered by many Canadian historians as re-establishing biographies as a proper form of historical research in Canada.Berger, Carl, The Writing of Canadian History, Toronto: Toronto University Press, 1986, 364 p. By the 1960s Creigthon began to move towards a more general history of Canada. Creighton's later years were also preoccupied with criticizing the then ruling Liberal Party of Canada under William Lyon Mackenzie King and his successor Louis St-Laurent. Creighton held the belief that the Liberal Party had attempted to undermined Canada's link with Great Britain and move towards closer relations with the United States of America.

Clogs are a type of footwear made in part or completely from wood. Clogs are used worldwide and although the form may vary by culture, within a culture the form often remained unchanged for centuries.
Traditional clogs were often worn in heavy labor. Today they remain in use as protective clothing in agriculture and in some factories and mines. Although clogs are sometimes negatively associated with cheap and folkloric footwear of farmers and the working class, some types of clogs are considered as fashion wear today, such as [tpl]Ill|sv|Swedish clogs|Träskor[/tpl] or Japanese geta.
Clogs are also used in several different styles of dance. When worn for dancing an important feature is the sound of the clog against the floor. This is one of the fundamental roots of tap, but with the tap shoes the taps are free to click against each other and produce different sound to clogs.

Robert Alphonso Taft (September 8, 1889 – July 31, 1953) was a conservative American politician, statesman, and presidential hopeful who served as a  United States Senator from Ohio from 1939 until his death in 1953. A member of the Republican Taft political family, he was the eldest son of William Howard Taft (the 27th President of the United States, and, tenth Chief Justice of the United States).
As the U.S. Senate's main opponent of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal domestic policies, after Roosevelt's death Taft successfully led the conservative coalition's effort to curb the expanding power of labor unions in America. Taft was also a major advocate of the foreign policy of non-interventionism. However, he failed in his quests to win the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 1940, 1948, and 1952. Throughout that period, he battled New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey (leader of the moderate "Eastern Establishment") for control of the national Republican Party. Chief Taft biographer James T. Patterson portrayed Taft as honest, conscientious, courageous, dignified, and highly intelligent, while also faulting Taft's competitiveness and extreme partisanship.Robert Muccigrosso, ed., Research Guide to American Historical Biography (1988) 1477–80  A 1957 Senate committee named Taft as one of the five greatest senators in American history, along with Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C.

[[Method of complements]]

CATEGORIES: Computer arithmetic

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers. 
The nines' complement of a number is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number y (the subtrahend) from another number x (the minuend), the nines' complement of y is added to x and one is added to the sum.  The leading digit  '1' of the result is then discarded. Discarding the initial '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' complement plus one is known as the tens' complement.
The method of complements can be extended to other number bases (radixes); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction and represent negative numbers in base 2 or binary arithmetic.

[[Melian dialogue]]
CATEGORIES: Dialogues, Peloponnesian War, Political realism, Ancient Melos, Slavery in ancient Greece

The Melian dialogue is a dramatic set-piece debate inserted by Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War, his account of the ruinous 27-year long struggle (431–404 BC) between the powerful Greek city-states of Athens and Sparta. It is one of the two most famous instances of fictionalized speeches in the book (the other being the defense of Athenian democracy in the funeral oration of Pericles in the beginning of the work). These speeches were not necessarily made just as written, but were inserted for literary effect, according to what Thucydides felt was "called for in the situation".Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.34-2.46. Greek text and English translation thereof available online at the Perseus Project. The Melian dialogue takes place fifteen years into the Peloponnesian war, during the confrontation in 416–415 BC between the Athenians and the people of Melos, a small island located in the southern Aegean Sea just east of Sparta. The Athenians demanded that the Melians surrender their city and pay them tribute or face the destruction of their city. The Melians claimed their right to remain neutral, appealing to the Athenians' sense of decency and mercy toward a small, peaceful, and defenseless city. The Athenians sternly replied that questions of justice did not arise between unequal powers and proceeded to lay siege to Melos as they had threatened to do, and to starve the resisting inhabitants into surrender, slaughter the men of military age, and enslave the women and children. This act has become "famous as the worst atrocity committed by a usually decent society, but even more as one of the most famous assertions in history of the rights of unbridled power, " according to the historian Alan Ryan, who writes that, "The Athenian insistence that 'justice is what is decided when equal forces are opposed, while possibilities are what superiors impose and the weak acquiesce to' has been discussed by practical people and by philosophers ever since. Not everyone has rejected the Athenian case.".Alan Ryan, On Politics A History of Political Thought from Herodotus to the Present, Vol. 1 (New York and London: Liveright Publishing Corporation, 2012), p. 23: Ryan, an expert on the nineteenth-century utilitarians, was Warden of New College and Professor of Politics at the University of Oxford. Ryan also notes that although Thucydides portrays the Melians as having always been strictly neutral and wishing to remain so, in fact, this was not true. Melos was a Spartan colony and had aided Sparta at the beginning of the war.Alan Ryan, On Politics Vol 1, p. 23. In general, however, "the Dialogue is formally not about the morality of the eventual execution, but about the Melian response to the Athenians' first demand, that Melos should submit."D.M., Lewis.

[[Binary asteroid]]

CATEGORIES: Binary asteroids

A binary asteroid is a system of two asteroids orbiting their common center of mass, in analogy with binary stars.  243 Ida was the first binary asteroid to be identified when the Galileo spacecraft did a flyby in 1993. Since then numerous binary asteroids have been detected.
When both binary asteroids are similar in size, they are sometimes called "binary companions",[tpl]cite web |date=2009-09-17 |title=Satellites and Companions of Minor Planets |publisher=IAU / Minor Planet Center |url=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/minorsats.html |accessdate=2011-01-08[/tpl] "double asteroids" or "doublet asteroids". A good example of true binary companions is the 90 Antiope system. Binary asteroids with a small satellite, called a "moonlet", have been more commonly observed (see 22 Kalliope, 45 Eugenia, 87 Sylvia, 107 Camilla, 121 Hermione, 130 Elektra, 243 Ida, 283 Emma, 379 Huenna, etc.). They are also called high-size-ratio binary-asteroid systems.
Paired impact craters, such as the Clearwater Lakes in Canada, may have been formed by binary asteroids.
Several theories have been posited to explain the formation of binary-asteroid systems. Recent work suggests that most of them have a significant macro-porosity (a "rubble-pile" interior). The satellites orbiting large main-belt asteroids such as 22 Kalliope, 45 Eugenia or 87 Sylvia could have formed by disruption of a parent body after impact or fission after an oblique impact. Trans-Neptunian binaries may have formed during the formation of the Solar System by mutual capture or three-body interaction. Near-Earth asteroids, which orbit in the inner part of the Solar System, may have split by tidal disruption after a close encounter with a terrestrial planet. A possible explanation for the relatively greater occurrence of binary asteroids near or inside of Earth's orbit was described in the journal Nature (10 June 2008): this theory states that when solar energy (see YORP effect) spins a “rubble pile” asteroid to a sufficiently fast rate, material is thrown from the asteroid’s equator. This process also exposes fresh material at the poles of the asteroid.[tpl]cite journal|year=2008|month=June|title=Rotational breakup as the origin of small binary asteroids.|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7201|pages= 188–191|doi=10.1038/nature07078|accessdate=2008-07-14|author=Walsh, Kevin J.|pmid=18615078|last2=Richardson|first2=DC|last3=Michel|first3=P|bibcode = 2008Natur.454..188W [/tpl]Study Puts Solar Spin on Asteroids, their Moons & Earth Impacts Newswise, Retrieved 14 July 2008.

The Plain of Jars (Lao: ທົ່ງໄຫຫິນ [tpl]IPA-lo|tʰōŋ hǎj hǐn|[/tpl]) is a megalithic archaeological landscape in Laos. Scattered in the landscape of the Xieng Khouang plateau, Xieng Khouang, Lao PDR, are thousands of megalithic jars.  These stone jars appear in clusters, ranging from a single or a few to several hundred jars at lower foothills surrounding the central plain and upland valleys.   
The Xieng Khouang Plateau is located at the northern end of the Annamese Cordillera, the principal mountain range of Indochina. Initial research of the Plain of Jars in the early 1930s claimed that the stone jars are associated with prehistoric burial practices.  Excavation by Lao and Japanese archaeologists in the intervening years has supported this interpretation with the discovery of human remains, burial goods and ceramics around the stone jars.  The Plain of Jars is dated to the Iron Age (500 BC to AD 500) and is one of the most important sites for studying Southeast Asian prehistory.  The Plain of Jars has the potential to shed light on the relationship between increasingly complex societies and megalithic structures and provide insight into social organisation of Iron Age Southeast Asia’s communities.

Sir Walter Hartwell James KCMG KC (29 March 1863 – 3 January 1943) was the fifth Premier of Western Australia and an ardent supporter of the federation movement.
Walter James was born on 29 March 1863 in Perth, in what was then the British colony of Western Australia. He was educated at Perth Boys School and later at Perth High School (now Hale School). After his father's death, his mother remarried to George Randell, a member of the Legislative Council. James was thus the step-brother of Ernest Randell, who later played cricket for Western Australia. In his youth, James worked as a jackaroo at De Grey Station in the Pilbara, but after being shipwrecked off Rottnest Island in 1883 on his way to the Pilbara, he turned to the legal profession.  He was articled to George Leake in 1883, and was admitted to the Western Australian bar in 1888. Shortly afterwards he went into partnership with Leake. James also played football for the Rovers Football Club in the West Australian Football Association.SURVIVOR OF A FAMOUS TEAM – The West Australian. Published 30 April 1952.

From 1890 to 1896, James represented Central Ward on Perth City Council.  In 1894 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly seat of East Perth.  James sat in the Legislative Assembly as an independent, and was a consistent opponent of John Forrest's government.  He was a strong advocate for social reform, working for women's suffrage over a long period, and playing an active part in the establishment of a compulsory, free, secular education system.  He became an active member of the Western Australian Liberal Association, a reformist organisation that pursued liberal ideals.
James was also strongly in favour of federation, and campaigned heavily with George Leake and James Gardiner for Western Australia to become an original member of the Federation.  He was a member of the Western Australian delegation to the Federal Conventions of 1897 and 1898, and in May 1898 he helped found the Federal League.
On 28 June 1901, James was appointed minister without portfolio in the first Leake government.  In 1902 he was made KC.  After Leake died in late June 1902, James was appointed Premier and Attorney-General on 1 July.  As premier, James fought for the state's interests against an aggressive Commonwealth executive.  He also led a reforming government; its achievements include legalization of the union movement, the first workers' compensation, a stronger Arbitration Act, and the opening of the current Parliament House. James also tried but failed to reform the franchise; he achieved only the abolition of plural voting, and an increase in Goldfields representation.  These changes appear to have been his undoing, as it is likely that they were key factors in Labor's strong support in the election of 28 June 1904, after which James was defeated when Parliament next met on 10 August 1904.
On 22 September 1904, James resigned from parliament to take up an appointment as Agent-General for Western Australia in London.  He was appointed Knight Bachelor on 28 June 1907.  After returning to Perth from London, he devoted himself to his legal practice and rose to prominence as a leading member of the Bar.  In 1910 he contested the Legislative Assembly seat of Beverley at a by-election, but was unsuccessful.
In 1909, James was appointed to a Royal Commission to enquire into the establishment of a university in Perth.  When the University of Western Australia was established, he became a founding member.  He continued to serve the university for many years, and was elected pro-Chancellor on 19 August 1929 and Chancellor on 17 March 1930.  He retired as Chancellor in 1936.
In 1931, James was elevated to KCMG.  In 1932, he declined an offer from Premier James Mitchell to become Lieutenant-Governor of Western Australia.  In 1936, he accepted an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.  He died on 3 January 1943, and was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.

[[Cornice]]
CATEGORIES: Columns and entablature, Architectural elements

A cornice  (from the Italian cornice meaning "ledge") is generally any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element— the cornice over a door or window, for instance, or the cornice around the top edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall.  A simple cornice may be formed just with a crown molding.
The function of the projecting cornice of a building is to throw rainwater free of the building’s walls. In residential building practice, this function is handled by projecting gable ends, roof eaves, and gutters.  However, house eaves may also be called "cornices" if they are finished with decorative molding.  In this sense, while most cornices are also eaves (in that they overhang the sides of the building), not all eaves are usually considered cornices— eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative, and a cornice has a decorative aspect to it.

Henry Daglish (18 November 1866 – 16 August 1920) was the sixth Premier of Western Australia and the state's first Labor Premier.
Henry Daglish was born in Ballarat West, Victoria on 18 November 1866. He was educated in Geelong, and attended Melbourne University. He began a career in mechanical engineering, but abandoned it in 1883 and instead entered the Victorian public service, working as a clerk in the police department. On 20 August 1894 he married Edith Bishop. The following year, he resigned from the public service to go into business. In 1895 he also stood as a Labor party candidate in a by-election for the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of South Melbourne, but received only 34 votes in an electorate of over 2000 electors. Later that year he wrote to the Western Australian premier Sir John Forrest requesting employment in Western Australia's public service. He was offered and accepted a position in Western Australia's police department. He eventually resigned, and entered business as an auctioner, accountant and legal manager.
Daglish became active in community life in Subiaco, and on 1 December 1900 was elected a member of the Subiaco Municipal Council. On 24 April 1901 he was elected to the seat of Subiaco in the Legislative Assembly, and resigned his position on the municipal council a month later. On 1 December 1902 he was elected Mayor of Subiaco, which office he held until 30 November 1904. He was re-elected as the Legislative Assembly member for Subiaco on 28 June 1904 with nearly 80 per cent of the vote. On 2 August he successfully moved a vote of no-confidence against Premier Walter James, and was asked to form Western Australia's first Labor government. He became premier, treasurer and minister for education on 10 August 1904. He gave up the education portfolio in June the following year.
Labor's support was not sufficient to keep the Daglish government in power, and it was dependent for its majority on a group of five independents. Because of this, the Daglish government put forward no distinctively Labor policies, and worked for consolidation rather than rapid development; in the press it was sometimes derisively referred to as the Mark Time Government. After twelve difficult months, Daglish was finally defeated over the government's plans to buy out the Midland Railway Company for £1.5 million, which was thought to be too large a sum. The Daglish government was such a disappointment to Labor voters that when Cornthwaite Rason took over as premier and was granted an early dissolution, Labor lost seven of its 22 seats. Ultimately, Daglish's ministry achieved little, and its main significance was that having Labor in government encouraged the various opposition groups to coalesce into a Liberal party, thus resulting in a two-party system for the first time.
After his government's defeat, Daglish resigned as leader of the Labor Party, and as a member of the Caucus, and called himself Independent Labor. On 20 August 1907 he was made Chairman of Committees in the Legislative Assembly. From 1 December 1907 until 30 November 1908 he was again Mayor of Subiaco. On 16 September 1910, Daglish resigned as Chairman of Committees and accepted a position as minister for works in Frank Wilson's Liberal government. He held the portfolio until he lost his seat in the election of October 1911.
Daglish served as president of the Subiaco Football Club from 1902–06 and again in 1911.Past Club Staff – sfclions.com.au. Retrieved 21 August 2011.
From 1912, Daglish worked as an estate agent. In 1912 he was also appointed the employers' representative in the Court of Arbitration. He died on 16 August 1920, and was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.
The Perth suburb of Daglish is named after him.

[[Push-to-talk]]
CATEGORIES: IMS services

Push-to-talk (PTT), also known as Press-to-Transmit, is a method of having conversations or talking on half-duplex communication lines, including two-way radio, using a momentary button to switch from voice reception mode to transmit mode. 
For example, an air traffic controller usually talks on one radio frequency to all aircraft under his/her supervision.  Those under the same frequency can hear other's transmissions while using procedure words such as "over" and "out" to provide order during the conversation.
In doing so, they are aware of each other's actions and intentions, and do not hear any background noise from the ones who are not speaking.  Similar considerations apply to police radio, the use of business band radios on construction sites, and other scenarios requiring coordination of several parties.  Citizens Band is another example of classic push to talk operation.
In situations where a user may be too busy to handle a talk switch, voice operated switches are sometimes employed.  Some systems use PTT ID to identify the speaker.
Push to Talk over Cellular (PoC) is a service option for a cellular phone network that enables subscribers to use their phones as walkie-talkies with unlimited range. A typical Push-to-Talk connection connects almost instantly. A significant advantage of PoC / PTT is the ability for a single person to reach an active talk group with a single button press; users need not make several telephone calls to coordinate with a group.

Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel KG,  (7 July 1585 – 4 October 1646) was a prominent English courtier during the reigns of King James I and King Charles I, but he made his name as a Grand Tourist and art collector rather than as a politician. When he died he possessed 700 paintings, along with large collections of sculpture, books, prints, drawings, and antique jewellery. Most of his collection of marble carvings, known as the Arundel marbles, was eventually left to the University of Oxford.
He is sometimes referred as the 2nd Earl of Arundel; it depends on whether one views the earldom obtained by his father as a new creation or not. He was also 2nd or 4th Earl of Surrey, and later, he was created 1st Earl of Norfolk. Also known as 'the Collector Earl'.

[[Grey alien]]

CATEGORIES: Alleged UFO-related entities, Roswell UFO incident, Goblins

Grey aliens, also referred to as "Greys", "Grays", "Roswell Greys", and "Zetans", are alleged extraterrestrial beings whose existence is promoted in ufological, paranormal, and New Age communities, and who are named for their skin color. Around half of all reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. Such claims vary in every respect including their nature (ETs, extradimensionals, demons, or machines), origins, moral dispositions, intentions, and physical appearances (even varying in their eponymous skin color). A composite description derived from overlap in claims would have Greys as small-bodied sexless beings with smooth grey-colored skin, enlarged head and large black eyes.
The origin of the idea of the Grey is commonly associated with the Betty and Barney Hill abduction claim which took place 1961, although skeptics see precursors in science fiction and earlier paranormal claims. The Grey aliens are also famous from the Roswell UFO incident from 1947.

CATEGORIES: Canadian Rockies, Mountains of Jasper National Park, Mountains of Alberta, Mountains of British Columbia, Winston Churchill Range, Borders of British Columbia, Borders of Alberta

Mount Columbia is the highest point in Alberta, Canada and the second highest peak in the Canadian Rockies after Mount Robson. It is located on the border between Alberta and British Columbia on the northern edge of the Columbia Icefield. Its highest point, however, lies within Jasper National Park in Alberta.[tpl]cite peakbagger|pid=4470|title=Mount Columbia|publisher=Peakbagger.com[/tpl]
The mountain was named in 1898 by J. Norman Collie after the Columbia River. The river itself was named after the American ship Columbia Rediviva  captained by Robert Gray, who first ventured over a dangerous sandbar and explored the lower reaches of the river in 1792. Mount Columbia was first ascended in 1902 by James Outram, guided by Christian Kaufmann

[[Arundel marbles]]

CATEGORIES: Collection of the Ashmolean Museum, Collections of classical sculpture, Former private collections

The Arundel marbles are a collection of carved Ancient Greek sculptures and inscriptions collected by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel in the early seventeenth century, the first such comprehensive collection of its kind in England.   They are now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, having been donated in two groups.
The bulk of the collection was a gift by Arundel's grandson Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk in 1667, at the prompting of John Evelyn and John Selden.  The remainder were received in a second gift of 1755, when the extravagant 2nd Earl of Pomfret sold back to his mother those that had been at his house at Easton Neston and she donated them to the Ashmolean, where they are sometimes called the Pomfret marbles. 
The Earl of Arundel had supervised excavations in Rome, and deployed his agents in the Eastern Mediterranean, above all at Istanbul. Late in the seventeenth century, an visitor to Ottoman Turkey could complain that: [tpl]quote|"the scarcity of antiquities now to be found in Smyrna arises from hence, that it furnished the greatest part of the Marmora Arundeliana."Chambers' Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities, 1869 "July 7th"[/tpl] The earl displayed his unrivalled collections at Arundel House, London, and one which his grandson did not leave to the collection, a 2nd-century AD relief from Ephesus is on display in the 17th century gallery at the Museum of London.
Some of these are not works of art but important inscriptions, the first Greek inscriptions that had been seen in England, from which historians have confirmed many dates in Greek history. Among them is the Parian Chronicle, inscribed about 263 BC so called because it was found on Paros, which gives Greek dates from 1582 BC down to 354 BCE  A smaller fragment of the relief, covering 356–299 BCE is conserved in the museum on Paros. Among outstanding pieces is a relief that shows parts of the human body, outstretched arms: elbow to finger tips, foot, clenched fists and fingers each used as in that period of Ancient Greece as standard units of measure. 
The Arundel marbles were catalogued as early as 1628, when, at the suggestion of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, John Selden compiled a catalogue: Marmora Arundeliana with the assistance of two others, Patrick Young and Richard James. In 1763 Richard Chandler published a fine edition of the inscriptions as Arundelian Marbles, Marmora Oxoniensia with a Latin translation, and a number of suggestions for filling the lacunae (gaps).

Howell Davis became a writer after the American Civil War, completing her husband's memoir. She was recruited by Kate Davis Pulitzer to write articles and eventually a regular column for her husband's newspaper, the New York World of Joseph Pulitzer. In 1891 Howell Davis moved to New York City to live full-time with her daughter Winnie after her husband's death. She acted to reconcile prominent figures of the North and South in the late nineteenth century.

[[Club sandwich]]
CATEGORIES: American sandwiches, Sandwiches, Skewered foods

A club sandwich, also called a clubhouse sandwich, is a sandwich with toasted bread. It is often cut into quarters and held together by hors d'œuvre sticks. It frequently has two layers which are separated by an additional slice of bread.
The classic ingredients for a club sandwich are turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/classic-club-sandwich-recipe/index.html |title=Classic Club Sandwich Recipe : Food Network Kitchens : Recipes |publisher=Food Network |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl] Other common club sandwiches generally vary the bottom layer, for example a "chicken club" or a "roast beef club" or a "breakfast club". Variations might include ham (instead of, or in addition to bacon)  and/or additional cheese slices.  As with a BLT, the club sandwich is usually served on toasted bread. Mayonnaise and mustard and sometimes honey mustard are common condiments. The sandwich is commonly served with a side portion of either coleslaw, or potato salad, and often accompanied by a pickle. The coleslaw or potato salad is often reduced to a "garnish" portion, when the primary side item is an order of French fries or potato chips.
One popular theory is that the club sandwich was invented in an exclusive Saratoga Springs, New York, gambling club in the late 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Sandwiches/ClubSandwich.htm |title=History of the club sandwich |publisher=Whatscookingamerica.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl]

[[Red-footed Falcon]]
CATEGORIES: Falco (genus), Birds of Azerbaijan, Birds of Iran, Birds of Pakistan, Birds of Europe, Birds of Turkey, Birds of Cameroon, Birds of Ukraine

The Red-footed Falcon (Falco vespertinus), formerly Western Red-footed Falcon, is a bird of prey. It belongs to the family Falconidae, the falcons. This bird is found in eastern Europe and Asia although its numbers are dwindling rapidly due to habitat loss and hunting. It is migratory, wintering in Africa. It is a regular wanderer to western Europe, and in August 2004 a Red-footed Falcon was found in North America for the first time on the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.
The Amur Falcon was formerly included herein as a subspecies but it is nowadays considered well distinct. Nonetheless, it is the present species' closest relative; their relationship to other falcons is more enigmatic. They appear morphologically somewhat intermediate between kestrels and hobbies and DNA sequence data has been unable to further resolve this question, mainly due to lack of comprehensive sampling. They might be closer to the Merlin than to most other living falcons, or more generally related to this species and American falcons such as the American Kestrel and the Aplomado Falcon.
It is a medium-small, long-winged species. The adult male is all blue-grey, except for his red undertail and legs; its underwings are uniformly grey. The female has a grey back and wings, orange head and underparts, and a white face with black eye stripe and moustaches.
Young birds are brown above and buff below with dark streaks, and a face pattern like the female. Red-footed Falcons are 28–34 cm (11–13½ in) in length with a wingspan of 65–75 cm (25½–29½ in). The average mass is [tpl]convert|155|g|abbr=on[/tpl].
This falcon is a colonial breeder, reusing the old nests of corvids, such as Rooks. It lays two to four eggs. Its maximum lifespan is 13.25 years in the wild and 18 years in captivity.[tpl]cite journal |last=Wasser |first=D.

The Brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. The common English name is probably derived from Common West Germanic *brâma, meaning bramble or a thorny bush. (Compare Standard German Brämling with the same meaning.)

Ruy López de Villalobos (ca. 1500 – April 4, 1544), not to be confused with Heitor Villa-Lobos, was a Spanish explorer who sailed the Pacific from Mexico to establish a permanent foothold for Spain in the East Indies, which was near the Line of Demarcation between Spain and Portugal according to the Treaty of Saragossa in 1529. Villalobos gave the Philippines their name, after calling them Las Islas Filipinas in honor of the Infante of Asturias at the time, Philip II of Spain. In 1542 he also discovered a Pacific group of islands, most likely Hawaii, but the Spaniard kept the discovery secret.

The Muezzin's post is an important one, as he is the one responsible for each call to prayer.  The community depends on him for accurate prayer schedules (salat, Turkish namaz).
Historically a muezzin would have recited the adhan or call to prayer by the minarets in order to be heard by those around the mosque.  Now, mosques often have loudspeakers mounted on the top of the minaret and the muezzin will use a microphone allowing the call to prayer to be heard at great distances without climbing the minaret.

The European Greenfinch, or just Greenfinch (Carduelis chloris) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. The genus Carduelis might be split up and in this case, the greenfinches would be separated in their old genus Chloris again.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
This bird is widespread throughout Europe, north Africa and south west Asia. It is mainly resident, but some northernmost populations migrate further south. The Greenfinch has also been introduced into both Australia and New Zealand. In Malta it is considered a prestigious song bird which has been trapped for many years. It has been domesticated and many Maltese people breed them.
Chloris is from the Greek Khloros meaning "green" or "yellowish-green".[tpl]cite book |title=A Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names |last=Jobling |first=James A |year=1991 |publisher=OUP |isbn=0-19-854634-3[/tpl]

The Redpolls are a group of small passerine birds in the finch family Fringillidae which have characteristic red markings on their heads. They were formerly placed into the genus Acanthis together with the linnets and the twite, but their closest relatives are actually the crossbills, that are placed in the genus Loxia.[tpl]cite journal|last=Arnaiz-Villena|first=Antonio|coauthors=Alvarez-Tejado M., Ruiz-del-Valle V., García-de-la-Torre C., Varela P, Recio M.

But this would entail changing the name of a large number of species, and as their adaptations and biogeography are evolutionarily quite peculiar, it would be better to reinstate Acanthis instead, including only the redpolls. There are several different very closely related[ref]Seutin, G.; Ratcliffe, L. M. & Boag, P. T.

All redpolls are northern breeding woodland species, associated with birch trees. They are small birds, brown or grey-brown above and with a red forehead patch. The adult male's breast is washed in red, but in females and young birds the buff breast and white belly are streaked with brown. The bill is small and yellow. Some birds, particularly young ones, are difficult to assign to species.
They are primarily seed-eaters, and often feed acrobatically like a tit; their diet may include some insects in summer. They have a dry reeling song and a metallic call. They lay 4–7 eggs in a nest in a tree or, in the case of the Arctic Redpoll, a large bush. They can form large flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with other finches.

Sir Cornthwaite Hector William James Rason (18 June 1858 – 15 March 1927), better known as Hector Rason, was the seventh Premier of Western Australia.
Hector Rason was born in Cleeve, Somerset in England on 18 June 1858.  He was the son of Cornthwaite Hector Rason (Snr), a Royal Navy surgeon who was the medical officer at York, Western Australia in 1866 and 1867.  Rason (Jnr) was educated at private schools in Eastbourne, Brighton and Reading, and worked as a railway clerk.
In October 1880, Rason emigrated to Perth, Australia, but returned to England after eighteen months.  In February 1883, he married Mary E. Terry, and shortly afterwards returned to Western Australia with his wife and her brother, W. R. Terry.  Rason and Terry set up business as storekeepers at Toodyay and Guildford, but after a few years Terry returned to England.  Rason then went into partnership with a Mr Webster, and attempted to benefit from the gold rushes in the Kimberley and Goldfields regions.  Rason also spent some time in Coolgardie trading as a mining engineer and auctioneer.  He retired from business in 1891, but was affected by the firm's bankruptcy in 1892.  From 1893 to 1895 he was a mining agent and auctioneer in Coolgardie, and in 1896 he moved to Mount Magnet.  From 1897 to 1898, Rason was Mayor of Guildford.
In January 1889, Rason was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Council for the Swan district.  He was a strong supporter of responsible government, and left the Council in October 1890 after responsible government had been established.  In 1897 he was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of South Murchison, sitting as a supporter of Sir John Forrest's government.  In 1898, he was appointed president of the royal commission on mining.  The seat of South Murchison was abolished in 1901, and Rason won the Legislative Assembly seat of Guildford in the general elections of April 1901.  When George Leake formed his second government in December 1901, Rason was appointed minister for works, holding responsibility for administration of the Coolgardie Water Scheme.  Under Walter James' premiership from July 1902 until August 1904, he was minister for works and railways, and was also treasurer for a few months from April 1904.  After Labor took office in August 1904, he became Leader of the Opposition.
Rason became Premier, Treasurer and Minister for Justice on 25 August 1905, after Henry Daglish's Labor government was defeated.  Like Daglish, Rason did not have a majority of support, but he was granted an early dissolution in October, and easily won the subsequent general election.  Later that year he headed the royal commission on immigration.
Hector Rason did not provide firm leadership as premier, and was dogged by family and financial worries.  In May 1906 he appointed himself as Agent General for Western Australia in London before resigning as premier to take up the post, an action which drew strong criticism.  He held the post until 1911, after which he pursued a business career in Britain.  He was made Knight Bachelor in 1909.  Rason died at Beckenham, Kent in England on 15 March 1927.

It was while he was at Amblin that he first gained control over the creation of a new series of Doctor Who, working in conjunction with fellow English expatriate Peter Wagg (Producer of Max Headroom) to create the early drafts of what eventually became the Doctor Who television movie in 1996. It had long been his dream to produce his own version of the long-running series.

Remembrance of the Daleks is the first serial of the 25th season in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 5 October to 26 October 1988. It was written by Ben Aaronovitch and directed by Andrew Morgan.
In the serial, alien time traveller the Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and his companion Ace (Sophie Aldred) travel back to the beginning of the Doctor's journey to retrieve the Hand of Omega and keep it from the Daleks, the reason why he fled his home planet Gallifrey.
The serial contained many references to the history of the show. It is set in 1963, around the same time as the very first Doctor Who episode, An Unearthly Child. Remembrance of the Daleks returns the Doctor to Coal Hill School and the junkyard at 76 Totter's Lane, locations first seen in that episode. The serial also continues the story arc of a civil war between rival Dalek factions, culminating in a showdown between the Doctor and Dalek Emperor Davros. This was the last appearance of Davros and the Daleks in the original run of Doctor Who; after a brief mention in the 1996 television film, the Daleks would return in the 2005 episode "Dalek".

Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965) was the first of two Doctor Who films made by Amicus Productions in the 1960s. It was followed by Daleks – Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D. The film features Peter Cushing as Dr. Who, Roberta Tovey as Susan, Jennie Linden as Barbara, and Roy Castle as Ian.
It is based on the second serial of the British science fiction Doctor Who television programme, The Daleks, produced by the BBC. Filmed in Technicolor, it is the first Doctor Who story to be made in colour and in a widescreen format. The television series continued to be made in black-and-white until 1969 and not in widescreen until the revival of the series in 2005.
The film was not intended to form part of the ongoing storylines of the television series. Elements from the programme were used, however, such as various characters, the Daleks and a police box time machine, albeit in re-imagined forms.

[[Garbage (album)]]
CATEGORIES: Garbage (band) albums, 1995 debut albums, Albums produced by Butch Vig

Garbage is the debut album by American alternative rock group Garbage. It was released in the late summer and autumn of 1995 worldwide, following critical acclaim and promising chart positions for their debut single "Vow", which entered the Billboard Hot 100.
Garbage eventually spent over a year on both the US and UK charts, reaching the top 20 on charts worldwide and receiving multi-platinum certification in numerous territories. The album's success was helped by the band promoting it on a year-long tour, including playing on the European festival circuit and supporting the Smashing Pumpkins throughout 1996, as well as by a run of increasingly successful singles culminating with "Stupid Girl" which in 1997 was nominated for Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.
Garbage was considered innovative for its fusion of pop melodies with alternative rock, trip-hop and electronica genres and its use of loops and sampling including, amongst other things, The Clash's "Train in Vain", the sound of torn sheets of metal, an air conditioning unit and a broken tape deck.

The Inland Empire (I.E.), is a metropolitan area and region of Southern California. It is situated directly east of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The term "Inland Empire" is most commonly used in reference to the U.S. Census Bureau federally defined Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area, which covers more than [tpl]convert|27000|sqmi|km2[/tpl]. The metropolitan area consists of Riverside County and San Bernardino County.
According to the Census Bureau, the counties of San Bernardino and Riverside are home to over 4 million people and is the 12th-most populous metropolitan area in the United States, and the third-most populous in the state of California.[tpl]cite web | title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Combined Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2010 | url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-02.csv | format = CSV | work= 2006 Population Estimates | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division | date= April 7, 2010 | accessdate=December 2, 2007[/tpl] Most of the area's population is located in the southwest of San Bernardino County and the northwest of Riverside County. At the end of the 19th century, the Inland Empire was a major center of agriculture, including citrus, dairy, and wine-making. Agriculture declined through the 20th century, and since the 1970s a rapidly growing population, fed by families migrating in search of affordable housing, has led to more residential, industrial, and commercial development. The U.S. Census Bureau also combines the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Inland Empire into one larger region known as the Greater Los Angeles Area with a population of over 17 million.

[[Structure (category theory)]]
CATEGORIES: Category theory

In mathematics, progress often consists of recognising the same structure in different contexts - so that one method exploiting it has multiple applications. In fact this is a normal way of proceeding; in the absence of recognisable structure (which might be hidden) problems tend to fall into the combinatorics classification of matters requiring special arguments.
In category theory structure is discussed implicitly - as opposed to the explicit discussion typical with the many algebraic structures. Starting with a given class of algebraic structure, such as groups, one can build the category in which the objects are groups and the morphisms are group homomorphisms: that is, of structures on one type, and mappings respecting that structure. Starting with a category C given abstractly, the challenge is to infer what structure it is on the objects that the morphisms 'preserve'. 
The term structure was much used in connection with the Bourbaki group's approach. There is even a definition. Structure must definitely include topological space as well as the standard abstract algebra notions. Structure in this sense is probably commensurate with the idea of concrete category that can be presented in a definite way - the topological case means that infinitary operations will be needed. Presentation of a category (analogously to presentation of a group) can in fact be approached in a number of ways, the category structure not being (quite) an algebraic structure in its own right.
The term transport of structure is the 'French' way of expressing covariance or equivariance as a constraint: transfer structure by a surjection and then (if there is an existing structure) compare.
Since any group is a one-object category, a special case of the question about what the morphisms preserve is this: how to consider any group G as a symmetry group? That is answered, as best we can by Cayley's theorem. The analogue in category theory is the Yoneda lemma. One concludes that knowledge on the 'structure' is bound up with what we can say about the representable functors on C. Characterisations of them, in interesting cases, were sought in the 1960s, for application in particular in the moduli problems of algebraic geometry; showing in fact that these are very subtle matters.

The Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing Owls can be found in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.). Unlike most owls, Burrowing Owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. But like many other kinds of owls, Burrowing Owls do most of their hunting from dusk until dawn, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to the forest, the Burrowing Owl has developed longer legs, which enables it to sprint as well as fly when hunting.

[[COCOMO]]
CATEGORIES: Software engineering costs

The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is an algorithmic software cost estimation model developed by Barry W. Boehm. The model uses a basic regression formula with parameters that are derived from historical project data and current as well as future project characteristics.
COCOMO was first published in Boehm's 1981 book Software Engineering EconomicsBarry Boehm. Software Engineering Economics. Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice-Hall, 1981. ISBN 0-13-822122-7 as a model for estimating effort, cost, and schedule for software projects. It drew on a study of 63 projects at TRW Aerospace where Boehm was Director of Software Research and Technology. The study examined projects ranging in size from 2,000 to 100,000 lines of code, and programming languages ranging from assembly to PL/I. These projects were based on the waterfall model of software development which was the prevalent software development process in 1981.
References to this model typically call it COCOMO 81. In 1995 COCOMO II was developed and finally published in 2000 in the book Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II.Barry Boehm,  Chris Abts, A. Winsor Brown, Sunita Chulani, Bradford K. Clark, Ellis Horowitz, Ray Madachy, Donald J. Reifer, and Bert Steece. Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II  (with CD-ROM). Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice-Hall, 2000. ISBN 0-13-026692-2 COCOMO II is the successor of COCOMO 81 and is better suited for estimating modern software development projects. It provides more support for modern software development processes and an updated project database. The need for the new model came as software development technology moved from mainframe and overnight batch processing to desktop development, code reusability, and the use of off-the-shelf software components. This article refers to COCOMO 81.
COCOMO consists of a hierarchy of three increasingly detailed and accurate forms. The first level, Basic COCOMO is good for quick, early, rough order of magnitude estimates of software costs, but its accuracy is limited due to its lack of factors to account for difference in project attributes (Cost Drivers). Intermediate COCOMO takes these Cost Drivers into account and Detailed COCOMO additionally accounts for the influence of individual project phases.

Cymru Annibynnol, the Independent Wales Party is a small political party operating in Wales.  They were formed as a splinter from Plaid Cymru in January 2000, when that party's leader Ieuan Wyn Jones distanced Plaid from supporting Welsh independence.
Cymru Annibynnol are an expressly republican organisation seeking full independence for Wales from the United Kingdom.  They contested various seats in the Welsh Assembly elections of 2003.  The party describes their aims and methods as being:
Broadly they are like Plaid Cymru: a left-leaning party that favours independence as a means to combatting what they perceive as the negative effects of globalisation, also favouring wealth redistributive measures.
They have stated that they do not intend to contest elections to the British House of Commons and will instead contest only local elections, and those to the Welsh Assembly.  They contested the 2003 Assembly elections but did not poll highly.  They have thus far to make much impact politically.
Cymru Annibynnol changed its name in 2004 when it became Cymru Rydd - Welsh Republicans. Its tag line is "Fe godwn ni eto! We shall rise again"

A rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhyme between lines of a poem or song. It is usually referred to by using letters to indicate which lines rhyme; lines designated with the same letter all rhyme with each other. Therefore, it is the pattern of end rhymes or lines.

B
A

Thus its own associations and resonances to cause a particular effect on the reader. A basic distinction is between rhyme schemes that apply to a single stanza, and those that continue their pattern throughout an entire poem (see chain rhyme). There are also more elaborate related forms, like the sestina - which requires repetition of exact words in a complex pattern.
In English, highly repetitive rhyme schemes are unusual.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] English has more vowel sounds than Italian, for example, meaning that such a scheme would be far more restrictive for an English writer than an Italian one - there are fewer suitable words to match a given pattern. Even such schemes as the terza rima ("aba bcb cdc ded..."), used by Dante Alighieri in The Divine Comedy, have been considered too difficult for English.

[[Pantun]]
CATEGORIES: Malay culture, Malay language, Indonesian literature

The pantun (Jawi: ڤنتون) is a Malay poetic form. The pantun originated as a traditional oral form of expression. The first examples to be recorded appear in the 15th century in the Malay Annals and the Hikayat Hang Tuah. The most common theme is love.
In its most basic form the pantun consists of a quatrain which employs an abab rhyme scheme. A pantun is traditionally recited according to a fixed rhythm and as a rule of thumb, in order not to deviate from the rhythm, every line should contain between eight and 12 syllables. "The pantun is a four-lined verse consisting of alternating, roughly rhyming lines. The first and second lines sometimes appear completely disconnected in meaning from the third and fourth, but there is almost invariably a link of some sort. Whether it be a mere association of ideas, or of feeling, expressed through assonance or through the faintest nuance of a thought, it is nearly always traceable" (Sim, page 12). The pantun is highly allusive and in order to understand it readers generally need to know the traditional meaning of the symbols the poem employs. An example (followed by a translation by Katharine Sim):
According to Sim, halai-balai tempurung hanyut literally means "a floating coconut shell at sixes and sevens". Selasih (sweet basil) means "lover", because it rhymes with kekasih. Other frequently recurring symbols are the flower and the bee meaning the girl and her lover, the squirrel (tupai) meaning a seducer, and the water hyacinth (bunga kiambang) meaning love that will not take root. Pantuns often make use of proverbs as well as geographical and historical allusions, for example the following poem by Munshi Abdullah:
This alludes to the foundation of Singapore in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles. The last line means a girl who is protected by a powerful man and Sim suggests this may refer to Raffles' wife Olivia.
Sometimes a pantun may consist of a series of interwoven quatrains, in which case it is known as a pantun berkait. This follows the abab rhyme scheme with the second and fourth lines of each stanza becoming the first and third lines of the following stanza. Finally, the first and third lines of the first stanza become the second and fourth lines of the last stanza, usually in reverse order so that the first and last lines of the poem are identical. This form of pantun has exercised the most influence on Western literature where it is known as the pantoum.

Denbighshire ([tpl]lang-cy|Sir Ddinbych[/tpl]) is a county in north-east Wales.  It is named after the historic county of Denbighshire, but has substantially different borders. Denbighshire has the distinction of being the oldest inhabited part of Wales. Pontnewydd (Bontnewydd-Llanelwy) Palaeolithic site has remains of Neanderthals from 225,000 years ago. There are several castles in the region: Denbigh Castle, Rhuddlan Castle, Ruthin Castle, Castell Dinas Bran and Bodelwyddan Castle. One of Britain's smallest cathedrals is at St Asaph, itself one of the smallest cities.

The Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star (or T-Bird) is an American jet trainer aircraft. It was produced by Lockheed and made its first flight in 1948 piloted by Tony LeVier. The T-33 was developed from the Lockheed P-80/F-80 starting as TP-80C/TF-80C in development, then designated T-33A.  It was used by the U.S. Navy initially as TO-2 then TV-2, and after 1962, T-33B.

Seymour, an African American preacher. It began with a meeting on April 9, 1906, and continued until roughly 1915. The revival was characterized by ecstatic spiritual experiences accompanied by miracles, dramatic worship services, speaking in tongues, and inter-racial mingling. The participants were criticized by the secular media and Christian theologians for behaviors considered to be outrageous and unorthodox, especially at the time. Today, the revival is considered by historians to be the primary catalyst for the spread of Pentecostalism in the 20th century.

Legio tertia ''Italica ('Third Italian legion') was a Roman legion levied by Marcus Aurelius around 165, for his campaign against the Marcomanni tribe. The cognomen Italica'' suggests that recruits were originally from Italy. The legion was still active in Raetia and other provinces in the early 5th century (Notitia Dignitatum, dated ca. 420 AD for Western Roman Empire entries).
Together with legions II Italica and I Adiutrix, III Italica legion was in the Danube provinces from its beginning, fighting the Marcomanni invasion of the Raetia and Noricum provinces. In 171 they built the camp Castra Regina, present Regensburg, designed as strongly defensive position.
In the civil war of 193, this legion supported Septimius Severus and helped him defeat his opponents first Pertinax and Didius Julianus, then Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus. Their loyalty was extended to Severus' successor, emperor Caracalla, for whom they fought in 213 a campaign against the Alamanni.

[[Chemical kinetics]]
CATEGORIES: Chemical kinetics

'''thumb|right|300px|Reaction rate tends to increase with concentration – a phenomenon explained by collision theory.
Chemical kinetics, also known as reaction kinetics, is the study of rates of chemical processes.  Chemical kinetics includes investigations of how different experimental conditions can influence the speed of a chemical reaction and yield information about the reaction's mechanism and transition states, as well as the construction of mathematical models that can describe the characteristics of a chemical reaction.  In 1864, Peter Waage and Cato Guldberg pioneered the development of chemical kinetics by formulating the law of mass action, which states that the speed of a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of the reacting substances.
Chemical kinetics deals with the experimental determination of reaction rates from which rate laws and rate constants are derived. Relatively simple rate laws exist for zero-order reactions (for which reaction rates are independent of concentration), first-order reactions, and second-order reactions, and can be derived for others. In consecutive reactions, the rate-determining step often determines the kinetics. In consecutive first-order reactions, a steady state approximation can simplify the rate law. The activation energy for a reaction is experimentally determined through the Arrhenius equation and the Eyring equation.  The main factors that influence the reaction rate include: the physical state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the temperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are present in the reaction.

He went to Africa as a surgeon in 1763 and returned to England in 1770. During this time he served four years as governor of Whydah (now Ouidah, Benin). He observed that the people at Whydah "pay a kind of veneration to a particular species of large snake, which is very gentle."
Appointed by the Committee of Merchants that was in charge of the Gold Coast at the time, he served as governor in two periods: 31 March 1792 - 16 December 1798, and 28 April 1800 - 30 September 1802.
In 1793 he published The history of Dahomy, an inland kingdom of Africa; comp. from authentic memoirs; with an introduction and notes where he argued that the raiding of Dahomean villages for slaves was saving them from the greater evil of being human sacrifices.
Son of William Dalziel (1705-1751) a carpenter from Kirkliston and Alice Linn.  Brother of Andrew Dalzel (1742-1806), Professor of Greek, Honorary Librarian at Edinburgh University.

In algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics, Serre duality is a duality present on non-singular projective algebraic varieties V of dimension n (and in greater generality for vector bundles and further, for coherent sheaves). It shows that a cohomology group Hi is the dual space of another one, Hn−i. If the variety is defined over the complex numbers, this yields different information from Poincaré duality, which relates Hi to H2n−i, considering V as a real manifold of dimension 2n.
In the case for holomorphic vector bundle E over a smooth compact complex manifold V, the statement is in the form:
in which V is not necessarily projective.

[tpl]nihongo|Tuxedo Mask|タキシード仮面|Takishīdo Kamen[/tpl] is a fictional character and one of the primary protagonists of the Sailor Moon metaseries. Named [tpl]nihongo|Mamoru Chiba|地場 衛|Chiba Mamoru|Darien Shields in the English-language versions[/tpl], he disguises himself in order to support the series' central heroines, the "Sailor Senshi". Wearing a mask to conceal his identity, he interferes with enemy operations, offers the Senshi advice, and sometimes physically aids them in battle.
Like the Senshi, Tuxedo Mask possesses a power item like theirs: a Sailor Crystal, which gives him guardianship over the planet Earth. He also has psychic powers, including psychometry and healing, which evolve and become important to the storyline in the manga, but which play only a minor role and remain static in the anime. Along with his primary love interest Sailor Moon, a significant player in much of the story, he has royal credentials in the "past life" storyline as well as in the future.
The Japanese version refers to him as "Tuxedo Kamen" while the dub refers to him as "Tuxedo Mask" when calling this character by his codename, literally translating the word Kamen, a word in Japanese which means 'mask' or 'masked', into its English equivalent. Chibiusa and Usagi, in particular, also commonly refer to him with the nickname "Mamo-chan". The English-language dub often shortens his name, "Darien", to "Dar" as a nickname; however, this happens inconsistently. His traits are somewhat similar to Batman and James Bond.

Historians and liberation theologians cite the Appeal as an influential political and social document of the 19th century. Walker exerted a radicalizing influence on the abolitionist movements of his day and inspired future black leaders and activists.

CATEGORIES: Socialism, History of socialism

The history of socialism has its origins in the French Revolution of 1789 and the changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution, although it has precedents in earlier movements and ideas. The Communist Manifesto was written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848 just before the Revolutions of 1848 swept Europe, expressing what they termed 'scientific socialism'. In the last third of the 19th century in Europe social democratic parties arose in Europe drawing mainly from Marxism. The Australian Labor Party was the world's first elected socialist party when the party won the 1899 Queensland state election.[tpl]cite book |last=Blainey |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Blainey |title=A shorter history of Australia |publisher=Vintage |year=2000 |location=Milsons Point, N.S.W. |isbn=1-74051-033-X |page=263[/tpl]
In the first half of the twentieth century, the Soviet Union and the Communist parties of the Third International around the world mainly came to represent socialism in terms of the Soviet model of economic development, the creation of centrally planned economies directed by a state that owns all the means of production, although other trends condemned what they saw as the lack of democracy. In the UK Herbert Morrison said "Socialism is what the Labour government does", whereas Aneurin Bevan argued that socialism requires that the "main streams of economic activity are brought under public direction", with an economic plan and workers' democracy.Bevan, Aneurin, In Place of Fear, p50, p126-8. MacGibbon and Kee, (1961). Some argued that capitalism had been abolished.Anthony Crossland stated: "to the question 'Is this still capitalism?' I would answer 'No'." In The Future of Socialism p46. Constable (2006) Socialist governments established the 'mixed economy' with partial nationalisations and social welfare.
By 1968, the prolonged Vietnam War (1959–1975), gave rise to the New Left, socialists who tended to be critical of the Soviet Union and social democracy. Anarcho-syndicalists and some elements of the New Left and others favored decentralized collective ownership in the form of cooperatives or workers' councils. At the turn of the 21st century, in Latin America, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez championed what he termed 'Socialism of the 21st Century', which included a policy of nationalisation of national assets such as oil, anti-imperialism, and termed himself a Trotskyist supporting 'permanent revolution'.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6246219.stm Chavez accelerates on path to socialism, BBC news, 10 January 2007 accessed July 8, 2007

Vilho Petter Nenonen (March 6, 1883, Kuopio - February 17, 1960) was a Finnish general.
He received his military education in the Hamina Cadet School 1896-1901, in the Mihailov Artillery School in St Petersburg 1901-1903, and in St Petersburg Artillery Academy 1906-1909. He served in the Russian army during World War I. When the Finnish Civil War began he moved to Finland and was given the job of creating the artillery of general Mannerheim's White Army. After the war Nenonen also served as the Minister of Defence between 1923 and 1924. During the Continuation War he was a part of Mannerheim's inner circle. He was promoted to the rank of General of the artillery in 1941.
Nenonen developed the Finnish Army's artillery and tactics that proved decisive in the defensive victory in the Battle of Tali-Ihantala.  The trajectory calculation formulas he developed are still in use today by all modern artillery.
Nenonen received the Mannerheim Cross in 1945.
His medals and personal history is on display in The Artillery Museum of Finland.

[[Vernacular literature]]
CATEGORIES: Literature by language, Diglossia

Vernacular literature is literature written in the vernacular—the speech of the "common people".
In the European tradition, this effectively means literature not written in Latin. In this context, vernacular literature appeared during the Middle Ages at different periods in the various countries; the earliest European vernacular literatures are Irish literature, Welsh literature, Anglo-Saxon literature and Gothic literature. 
The Italian poet Dante Alighieri, in his De vulgari eloquentia, was possibly the first European writer to argue cogently for the promotion of literature in the vernacular.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl] Important early vernacular works include Dante's Divine Comedy, Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron (both in Italian), John Barbour's The Brus (in Scots), Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (in Middle English) and Jacob van Maerlant's Spieghel Historiael (in Middle Dutch). Indeed Dante's work actually contributed towards the creation of the Italian language.
The term is also applied to works not written in the standard and/or prestige language of their time and place.  For example, many authors in Scotland, such as James Kelman and Edwin Morgan have used Scots, even though English is now the prestige language of publishing in Scotland.  Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o writes in his native Gikuyu language though he previously wrote in English. Some authors have written in invented vernacular; examples of such novels include the futuristic literary novels A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess and Boxy an Star by Daren King.

[[Prescription drug]]

CATEGORIES: Pharmacology, Pharmaceuticals policy, Drugs, Advanced practice registered nursing

A prescription drug (also prescription medication or prescription medicine) is a licensed medicine that is regulated by legislation to require a medical prescription before it can be obtained.  The term is used to distinguish it from over-the-counter drugs that can be obtained without a prescription.  Different jurisdictions have different definitions of what constitutes a prescription drug.
"Rx" is often used as a short form for prescription drug in North America.  It is an abbreviation for the Latin "recipe", an imperative form of "recipere", meaning "take".[tpl]cite web|last=Crane|first=Gregory R.|title=Perseus 4.0 (Perseus Hopper)|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=recipere&la=la|work=Perseus 4.0 (Perseus Hopper)|accessdate=19 January 2014[/tpl]
Prescription drugs are often dispensed together with a monograph (in Europe, a Patient Information Leaflet or PIL) that gives detailed information about the drug.

[[Human-readable medium]]
CATEGORIES: Optical character recognition, Typography

A human-readable medium or human-readable format is a representation of data or information that can be naturally read by humans.
In computing, human-readable data is often encoded as ASCII or Unicode text, rather than presented in a binary representation. Virtually all data can be parsed by a suitably equipped and programmed computer or machine; reasons for choosing binary formats over text formats usually center on issues of storage space, as a binary representation usually takes up fewer bytes of storage, and efficiency of access (input and output) without parsing or conversion.
In most contexts, the alternative representation is a machine-readable format or medium of data primarily designed for reading by electronic, mechanical or optical devices, or computers. For example, Universal Product Code (UPC) barcodes are very difficult to read for humans, but very effective and reliable with the proper equipment, whereas the strings of numerals that commonly accompany the label are the human-readable form of the barcode information. In many jurisdictions, barcode labels used in retail shopping must also include a human-readable price on the merchandise.
With the advent of standardized, highly structured markup languages, such as Extensible Markup Language (XML), the decreasing costs of data storage, and faster and cheaper data communication networks, compromises between human-readability and machine-readability are now more common-place than they were in the past. In addition, these structured representations can be compressed very effectively for transmission or storage.
Various organizations have standardized the definition of human-readable and machine-readable data and how they are applied in their respective fields of application, e.g., the Universal Postal Union.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upu.int/document/2005/an/cep_gn_ep_4-1/src/d011_ad00_an09_p00_r00.doc|title=OCR and Human readable representation of data on postal items, labels and forms|publisher=Universal Postal Union[/tpl]
Often the term human-readable is also used to describe shorter names or strings, that are easier to comprehend or to remember than long, complex syntax notations, such as some Uniform Resource Locator strings.

The Malvern Hills are a range of hills in the English counties of Worcestershire, Herefordshire and a small area of northern Gloucestershire, dominating the surrounding countryside and the towns and villages of the district of Malvern. The highest summit of the hills affords a panorama of the Severn valley with the hills of Herefordshire and the Welsh mountains, parts of thirteen counties, the Bristol Channel, and the cathedrals of Worcester, Gloucester and Hereford.
They are known for their spring water – initially made famous by the region's many holy wells, and later through the development of the 19th century spa town of Great Malvern, a process which culminated in the production of the modern bottled drinking water.
The Malvern Hills have been designated as a Biological and Geological Site of Special Scientific Interest and as National Character Area 103 by Natural England and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty by the Countryside Agency (now Natural England). The SSSI notification has 26 units of assessment which cover grassland, woodland and geological sites. The site (The Malvern Hills SSSI (Chase End Hill)) is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).
Management of the hills is the responsibility of the Malvern Hills Conservators.

The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland is a political party in Northern Ireland.  It is Northern Ireland's fifth-largest party overall, with eight seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly and one in the House of Commons.
Founded in 1970 from the New Ulster Movement, the Alliance Party originally represented moderate and non-sectarian Unionism.  However, over time, particularly in the 1990s, it moved towards neutrality on the Union, and has come to represent wider liberal and non-sectarian concerns.  It opposes consociational power sharing as deepening the sectarian divide, and, in the Northern Ireland Assembly, it is designated as neither unionist nor nationalist, but 'Other'.
In May 2010 the Alliance Party won their first Westminster seat in a General Election, in Belfast East, unseating Peter Robinson, leader of the DUP and First Minister of Northern Ireland. Naomi Long, the successful candidate, is the first MP from the Alliance Party since Stratton Mills who had joined the party from the Ulster Unionist Party in 1973.

The Northern Ireland Women's Coalition (NIWC) was a minor political party in Northern Ireland.  It was founded in 1996 by Catholic academic Monica McWilliams and Protestant social worker Pearl Sagar to contest the elections to the Northern Ireland Forum, the body for all-party talks which led to the Belfast Agreement. The party did not espouse a particular ideology and campaigned principally around the fact that it was led by women rather than men.http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/public-participation/ni-womens-coalition.php Conciliation Resources website article by Kate Fearon (2002), "Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition: institutionalizing a political voice and ensuring representation" It declined to take any position on whether Northern Ireland should be part of the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland, but strongly opposed sectarian violence from both sides. It attracted support from former supporters of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, but also the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Ulster Unionist Party. 
In the 1996 Forum elections McWilliams, Sagar and eight other Coalition candidates secured 7,731 votes (1.03% of the total) and did not win any constituency seats, but under a 'top-up' mechanism to ensure the representation of minor parties they were awarded two seats as Members of the Northern Ireland Forum, taken by McWilliams and Sagar. They attended the negotiations dominated by the other 108 representatives and supported (but did not, as often reported, sign) the ensuing intergovernmental Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. The party claimed credit for the inclusion of a commitment to integrated education in the agreement, as did the much larger Alliance Party. 
In the Northern Ireland Assembly election, 1998, the NIWC secured 13,018 votes (1.6%)Northern Ireland Assembly Elections 1998 and McWilliams, representing South Belfast, and Jane Morrice, representing North Down, were elected to the inaugural Northern Ireland Assembly.

Eduard Penkala was born in Liptovský Mikuláš (in what is now Slovakia), to Franciszek Pękała, who was of Polish heritage, and Maria Pękała (née Hannel), who was of Dutch heritage. He attended the University of Vienna and Technische Universität Dresden, graduating from the latter in 1898 and going on to earn a doctorate in organic chemistry. He then moved with his wife and family to Zagreb (which was then in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, also part of Austria-Hungary) and to mark his loyalty to his new homeland he took on the Croatian name Slavoljub (the equivalent of slavophile), becoming a naturalized Croat.
He became renowned for further development of the mechanical pencil (1906)http://www.penkala.com.hr/en/penkala_en.htm—then called an "automatic pencil"—and the first solid-ink fountain pen (1907).http://www.croatia.hr/English/Penkala/Inovacije.aspx Collaborating with an entrepreneur by the name of Edmund Moster, he started the Penkala-Moster Company and built a pen-and-pencil factory that was one of the biggest in the world at the time.  This company, now called TOZ Penkala, still exists today.
He also constructed the first Croatian aircraft to fly in the country, the 1910 Penkala Monoplane,flown by Dragutin Novak, who was also the first Croatian pilot. He constructed and invented many other products and devices, and held a total of 80 patents.
Among his patented inventions were:
He also founded another company called the Elevator Chemical Manufacturing Company, which produced various chemicals such as detergents, sealing wax, and "Radium Vinovica", a patent-medicine–like product that was billed as curing rheumatism.
Penkala died in Zagreb at the age of 50, after catching pneumonia on a business trip. He was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery.[tpl]hr icon[/tpl] Gradska groblja Zagreb: Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, Mirogoj RKT-78-I-117

Camperdown is an area of Dundee, Scotland, best known for Camperdown Park, which is the largest park in the city.
The name is Dutch in origin, being the English version of Kamperduin, a village of the North Holland province (north of Haarlem) on the North Sea coast of the Netherlands. This is because Adam Duncan (1 July 1731 - 4 August 1804), defeated the Dutch fleet off there on 11 October 1797 in the Battle of Camperdown. His home, Camperdown House, was in turn named after this, and then gave its name to the area.

Eddie Brock is a fictional character created by David Michelinie and Todd McFarlane. Originally a comic book supervillain, Brock's earliest appearance is a cameo in Web of Spider-Man #18 (September 1986)Spider-Man Saga #4, February 1992 before making his first full appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #299 (April 1988) as Venom. The character has since appeared in many Marvel Comics publications including his own series Venom. Introduced as the first incarnation of the Spider-Man villain Venom, the character becomes an anti-hero, working with and against superheroes.
In the original version of the story, Brock is a journalist who exposes the identity of a serial killer only for the real killer to be caught by Spider-Man, Brock having accused the wrong man. Disgraced and suicidal, Brock comes into contact with an alien Symbiote, rejected by Peter Parker. The Symbiote bonds with Brock becoming Venom and together they seek out revenge against their mutual enemy. Though Brock repeatedly comes into conflict with Spider-Man, he also attempts to operate as a hero, albeit a violent one, seeking to save those he deems "innocent". In 2008, after being separated from the Venom Symbiote, Brock gains a new Symbiote and becomes the anti-hero Anti-Venom. However, that symbiote is sacrificed to help cure the "Spider-Island" endemic during the 2011 storyline. In 2012 he is bonded to the Toxin symbiote.

The Brighton hotel bombing occurred on 12 October 1984 at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, England. A long-delay time bomb was planted in the hotel by Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) member Patrick Magee, with the purpose to kill Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet, who were staying at the hotel for the Conservative Party conference.[tpl]cite news | title = Patrick Magee convicted of IRA terrorist attack | author = Gareth Parry | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/fromthearchive/story/0,,1235581,00.html | publisher = The Guardian | date = 10 June 1986 | accessdate = 30 April 2007 | location=London[/tpl] Although Thatcher narrowly escaped injury, five people were killed, including two high-profile members of the Conservative Party, and 31 were injured.

The North American F-86 Sabre (sometimes called the Sabrejet) was a transonic jet fighter aircraft. Produced by North American Aviation, the Sabre is best known as the United States's first swept wing fighter which could counter the similarly-winged Soviet MiG-15 in high-speed dogfights over the skies of the Korean War. Considered one of the best and most important fighter aircraft in the Korean War, the F-86 is also rated highly in comparison with fighters of other eras."MiG-15 'Fagot'." mnangmuseum.org. Retrieved 19 July 2011. Although it was developed in the late 1940s and was outdated by the end of the 1950s, the Sabre proved versatile and adaptable, and continued as a front-line fighter in numerous air forces until the last active operational examples were retired by the Bolivian Air Force in 1994.
Its success led to an extended production run of more than 7,800 aircraft between 1949 and 1956, in the United States, Japan and Italy. Variants were built in Canada and Australia. The Canadair Sabre added another 1,815 airframes, and the significantly redesigned CAC Sabre (sometimes known as the Avon Sabre or CAC CA-27), had a production run of 112. The Sabre was by far the most-produced Western jet fighter, with total production of all variants at 9,860 units.Winchester 2006, p. 184.

The Sheffield Botanical Gardens are botanical gardens situated off Ecclesall Road in Sheffield, England, with 5,000 species of plant in 19 acres (77,000 m2) of land.
The gardens were designed by Robert Marnock and first opened in 1836.  The most notable feature of the gardens are the Grade II* listed glass pavilions, restored and reopened in 2003. Other notable structures are the main gateway, the south entrance lodge and a bear pit.
The Sheffield Botanical and Horticultural Society was formed in 1833 and by 1834 had obtained £7,500 in funding. The money was raised selling shares, permitting the purchase of [tpl]convert|18|acre|m2[/tpl] of south-facing farmland from the estate of local snuff manufacturer Joseph Wilson. 12,000 people visited the Gardens on their opening in the Summer of 1836. Sheffield's Town Trust assumed the management of the gardens in the closing years of the 19th. century, when they repaid the shareholders the nominal value of their £5 shares. The Trust abolished the existing entry charge and since that time entry to the Botanical Gardens has remained free. Though the Town Trust are still the owners, Sheffield Corporation signed a 99-year lease on 18 December 1951, thereby taking over management.http://www.sbg.org.uk/historydetail.asp| "Detailed History" - Sheffield Botanical Gardens Website 
The gardens hold the national collection of the genus Sarcococca, Weigela and the closely related Diervilla.

Acid Eaters is the thirteenth studio album by the American punk band Ramones.
Recorded in 1993, towards the end of the Ramones' career, the album is often set apart from other Ramones releases in that it is entirely composed of covers. Acid Eaters forms a musical tribute to the Ramones' 60s favorites, and highlights the influence that garage rock bands like The Seeds or the Amboy Dukes, and better known bands such as The Beach Boys, The Who and The Rolling Stones, (all of whom are covered in this album) had on their music.

George Ord (1781 - January 24, 1866) was an American ornithologist.
Ord was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father (also named George) was a rope maker and Ord joined him in the business, continuing after his father's death in 1806. In 1829 he retired from the business so that he could devote more time to science.
In 1815 Ord became a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and two years later became a member of the American Philosophical Society. He went on to hold important positions in both. Ord received several of the specimens brought back by Lewis and Clark for description, including the Grizzly Bear and the Pronghorn.
Ord was friend and avid supporter of Alexander Wilson, accompanying him on several of his journeys. After Wilson's death he finished the eighth and ninth volumes of Wilson's American Ornithology. He issued a life of Wilson in 1828 and published biographies of his fellow naturalists Thomas Say (1834) and Charles Alexandre Lesueur (1849). He also assisted in the enlargement of Samuel Johnson's dictionary and the first edition of Noah Webster's dictionary. He was hostile to John James Audubon, whose drawings he disliked and who he felt was usurping the position of Wilson. He is buried in Philadelphia next to Wilson in Gloria Dei Church cemetery.

Lost in La Mancha is a 2002 documentary film about Terry Gilliam's unfinished film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, a film adaptation of the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. It was shot in 2000 during Gilliam's first attempt to make the film with the purpose of being its making-of, but Gilliam's failure into making the movie led it to be retitled Lost in la Mancha and to be released independently.
Written and directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, Lost in La Mancha presents Gilliam's quest to make Don Quixote as a parallel to Quixote's quest to become a hero. It co-stars Johnny Depp, Jean Rochefort and Vanessa Paradis, all supposed to star in The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, and is narrated by Jeff Bridges.

[[Vaasa Province]]
CATEGORIES: Provinces of Finland (1917–1997)

The Province of Vaasa ([tpl]Lang-fi|Vaasan lääni[/tpl], [tpl]Lang-sv|Vasa län[/tpl]) was a province of Finland, established in 1775 when Finland was an integrated part of Sweden from the southern part of Ostrobothnia County and disbanded in 1996. The province was named after the city of Vaasa.
On the death of Tsar Nicholas I in 1855, a small group of citizens in the city of Vaasa tendered a petition to change the name of the city after him. The name of the city came from the Royal House of Vasa and despite that only 15 citizens were backing the proposal the name of the city was changed to Nikolaistad ([tpl]lang-ru|Николайстада[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fi|Nikolainkaupunki[/tpl]). This also meant that the Vaasa Province ([tpl]lang-ru|Вазаская губерния[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sv|Vasa län[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fi|Vaasan lääni[/tpl]) was called the Nikolaistad Province, after 1855. In 1862 a large group of citizens in the city unsuccessfully petitioned to have the old name restored. The new name remained official until 1917, but colloquially the old name continued in use.
In 1960 the eastern part was separated as the Province of Central Finland. In 1997 it was reunited with Central Finland, togeather they merged with the northern part of the Province of Häme and the Province of Turku and Pori to establish the new Province of Western Finland. 
The former province corresponds to the current regions of Ostrobothnia, Central Ostrobothnia and Southern Ostrobothnia.

[[Homosexuality in China]]

CATEGORIES: LGBT history prior to the 19th century, LGBT in China, LGBT history in China

The existence of homosexuality in China has been well documented since ancient times. According to one study, homosexuality in China was regarded as a normal facet of life in China, prior to the Western impact of 1840 onwards. However, this has been disputed.Passions of the Cut Sleeve: The Male Homosexual Tradition in China by Bret Hinsch; Review by: Frank Dikötter. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 55, No. 1(1992), Cambridge University Press, p. 170 Many early Chinese emperors are speculated to have had homosexual relationships, accompanied by heterosexual ones.Hinsch, Bret.  (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve.  University of California Press.  pp. 35–36. Opposition to homosexuality, according to the study by Hinsch, did not become firmly established in China until the 19th and 20th centuries, through the Westernization efforts of the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. On the other hand, Gulik's influential study argued that the Mongol Yuan dynasty introduced a more ascetic attitude to sexuality in general.Robert Hans Van Gulik 1961. Sexual life in Ancient China: a preliminary survey of Chinese sex and society from ca. 1500 B.C. till 1644 A.D.  Leiden: Brill.Needham, J: Science and Civilization in China: Sexual Techniques. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, Vol. 2, 1954. It is also argued that the classical Chinese were unable to express homosexuality in a coherent and empathetic manner."M. P. Lau and M. L. Ng: Homosexuality in Chinese Culture.  Review of: History of Homosexuality in China (Chinese ed.). Xiaomingxiong. Hong Kong: Samshasha and Pink Triangle Press, 1984.  Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry 13: 465--488, 1989. O 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers Thus, it may remain for further research to determine the question of whether anti-gay attitudes in Modern China can be significantly attributed to the entrance of Western attitudes into China, or whether opposition was merely not expressed in a coherent manner. Either way, it is indisputable that homosexual sodomy was banned in the People's Republic of China from at least the twentieth century, until it was legalized in 1997.  In 2001, homosexuality was removed from the official list of mental illnesses in China.China Decides Homosexuality No Longer Mental Ilness.  Associated Press, South China Morning Post, March 08 2001.  See http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/55/325.html

[[Abstract structure]]

CATEGORIES: Abstraction, Mathematical terminology, Structure

An abstract structure in mathematics is a formal object that is defined by a set of laws, properties, and relationships in a way that is logically if not always historically independent of the structure of contingent experiences, for example, those involving physical objects.  Abstract structures are studied not only in logic and mathematics but in the fields that apply them, as computer science, and in the studies that reflect on them, such as philosophy and especially the philosophy of mathematics.  Indeed, modern mathematics has been defined in a very general sense as the study of abstract structures (by the Bourbaki group: see discussion there, at algebraic structure and also structure).
An abstract structure may be represented (perhaps with some degree of approximation) by one or more physical objects — this is called an implementation or instantiation of the abstract structure. But the abstract structure itself is defined in a way that is not dependent on the properties of any particular implementation.
An abstract structure has a richer structure than a concept or an idea. An abstract structure must include precise rules of behaviour which can be used to determine whether a candidate implementation actually matches the abstract structure in question. Thus we may debate how well a particular government fits the concept of democracy, but there is no room for debate over whether a given sequence of moves is or is not a valid game of chess.

CATEGORIES: Lossless compression algorithms

The Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is an algorithm used to perform lossless data compression. It has been under development since 1998. The SDK history file states that it was in development from 1996, and first used in 7-Zip 2001-08-30. Aside from some unreferenced comments about 1998, the algorithm appears to have been unpublished before its use in 7-Zip. and was first used in the 7z format of the 7-Zip archiver. This algorithm uses a dictionary compression scheme somewhat similar to the LZ77 algorithm published by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977 and features a high compression ratio (generally higher than bzip2)
 and a variable compression-dictionary size (up to 4 GB), while still maintaining decompression speed similar to other commonly used compression algorithms
LZMA2 is a simple container format that can include both uncompressed data and LZMA data, possibly with multiple different LZMA encoding parameters.  LZMA2 supports arbitrarily scalable multithreaded compression and decompression and efficient compression of data which is partially incompressible.

The Hook and Cod wars ([tpl]lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten[/tpl]) comprise a series of wars and battles in the County of Holland between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over the title of count of Holland, but some[tpl]who?|date=February 2014[/tpl] have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the bourgeois in the cities against the ruling nobility.
The Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of Holland. 
The Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen.
The origin of the name "Cod" is uncertain, but is most likely a case of reappropriation. Perhaps it derives from the arms of Bavaria, that look like the scales of a fish. The Hook refers to the hooked stick that is used to catch cod. Another possible explanation is that as a cod grows it tends to eat more, growing even bigger and eating even more, thus encapsulating how the noblemen perhaps saw the expanding middle classes of the time.

[[Bathos]]

CATEGORIES: Poetics, Satire, Humour, Rhetorical techniques, Rhetoric, Philosophical concepts

Bathos ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|θ|ɒ|s|,_|-|θ|oʊ|s[/tpl]; Greek βάθος, meaning "depth") is an abrupt transition in style from the exalted to the commonplace, producing a ludicrous effect.  While often unintended, bathos may be used deliberately to produce a humorous effect.[tpl]cite book|last=Fiske|first=Robert Hartwell|title=Robert Hartwell Fiske's Dictionary of Unendurable English: A Compendium of Mistakes in Grammar, Usage, and Spelling with commentary on lexicographers and linguists|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JZqfZfIvtlsC&pg=PA71|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-1-4516-5134-8|page=71[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&pg=PA24|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4130-3390-8|page=24[/tpl]  If bathos is overt, it may be described as Burlesque or mock-heroic. It should not be confused with pathos, a mode of persuasion within the discipline of rhetoric, intended to arouse emotions of sympathy and pity.

[[Alexander Kotov]]
CATEGORIES: 1913 births, 1981 deaths, Chess grandmasters, Russian chess players, Soviet chess players, Soviet chess writers, Russian chess writers

Alexander Alexandrovich Kotov (Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Ко́тов; [tpl]OldStyleDate|12 August|1913|30 July[/tpl] – 8 January 1981) was a Soviet chess grandmaster and author. He was a Soviet champion, a two-time world title Candidate, and a prolific chess author.  Kotov served in high posts in the Soviet Chess Federation and most of his books were written during the period of Cold War between the US and the USSR.  Therefore, his works tended to be rather critical of (and occasionally somewhat dismissive toward) American players.  Russian players, on the other hand, were presented and described in a particularly favorable light.
Kotov's books also included frequent praise for the Soviet system in general.  For example, the 1958 book The Soviet School of Chess (which he co-wrote with Mikhail Yudovich) stated that "The rise of the Soviet school to the summit of world chess is a logical result of socialist cultural development."   At the time, statements such as this were sufficiently controversial that Western publishers felt compelled to include disclaimers in versions of his books that were translated for distribution to English-speaking countries. Dover Publications, Inc.'s 1961 paperback version of The Soviet School of Chess was distributed primarily to Western countries and included an introduction that stated "...literature of this type, though helpful in our ultimate understanding of the game, is very often riddled with distortion.  The publishers of this Dover edition are very much concerned that readers be aware of the propaganda techniques employed, even in the history of chess, by the Soviet Union."
Notwithstanding Kotov's forays into the political realm, his books were insightful and informative and were written in a congenial style.  He often made his points by citing first-hand stories of incidents involving famous grandmasters, most of whom he knew personally.  Such entertaining and enlightening personal accounts helped to ensure that his books would remain popular among chess players of widely varying nationalities and playing strengths.
