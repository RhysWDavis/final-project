[[General Electric AN/CPS-6 Radar]]

CATEGORIES: Ground radars, Military radars of the United States Air Force

The AN/CPS-6 was a medium-range search/height finder Radar used by the United States Air Force Air Defense Command.
The AN/CPS-6 was developed during the later stages of World War II by the Radiation Laboratory at MIT. The first units were produced in mid-1945. 
General Electric developed and produced the A-model and subsequent B-model at a plant in Syracuse, New York. The unit consisted of two antennas. One of the antennas slanted at a forty-five degree angle to provide the height-finder capability. 
Initially, the radar was designed to detect fighter aircraft at 100 miles and 16,000 feet. The radar used five transmitters that operated at S-band frequencies ranging from 2700 to 3019 MHz. It took twenty-five people to operate the radar. 
An AN/CPS-6 radar was installed as part of the Lashup Radar Network at Twin Lights, New Jersey, in 1949 and proved capable of detecting targets at ranges of eighty-four miles. The first units of the follow-on 6B radar set were ready for installation by mid-1950. Fourteen 6B units were used within the first permanent network. 
A component designed to improve the radar's range was added in 1954. Initial tests showed the 6B unit had a range of 165 miles with an altitude limit of 45,000 feet. One radar unit and its ancillary electronic equipment had to be transported in eighty-five freight cars. The Air Force phased out the 6B model between mid-1957 and mid-1959.
The AN/FPS-10 unit was essentially a stripped down version of the AN/CPS-6B. Thirteen of these units served within the first permanent network.

The Mrs. Charles Frances Adams Cup, or "Adams Cup" for short, is the competition for the United States Women's Sailing Championship.http://championships.ussailing.org/Championships_Home/Championship_Histories/U_S__Women_s_Championship.htm  In a sport with hundreds of different classes of boats and a national champion for each, the point of the Adams Cup is to determine an overall champion for the sport of sailing.  Run by the U.S. Sailing Associationhttp://home.ussailing.org/ (as opposed to any given class), eliminations are held throughout the country, and the finals are raced in a different type of boat each year to eliminate any advantage a sailor from any particular class might otherwise have.  Competitors sail boats that are provided by the host club, and teams are required to race each boat at the event once so that nobody will have an advantage in terms of equipment.
As with national championships in other sports, the top three finishers receive gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively.  The winner likewise holds the Mrs. Charles Frances Adams Cup itself until the following year's champion is crowned.

Odayil Ninnu (From the Gutter) is a Malayalam novel written by P. Kesavadev in 1942. The protagonist of the novel is a rickshaw-puller named Pappu. The novel is one of the best known works of Kesavadev. Dev was in the forefront among the writers who employed new norms in the content and characterization in Malayalam fiction. Odayil Ninnu came as a shocking revelation that a finest piece of literature can be produced with commonplace themes and unconventional style of prose with ordinary mortals as heroes and heroines. Apart from the fact that the appearance of rickshaw puller was a thrilling experience at that time, the author blazed a new trail in Malayalam literature. With the appearance of the novel in 1942 began the publication of a series of high quality novels in Malayalam.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BXluAAAAMAAJ&q=odayil+ninnu&dq=odayil+ninnu&hl=en&ei=xzMCTvXALtHtrQejx5WGAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw|author=A.

Following Ben Ali's departure from the country, a state of emergency was declared. The Constitutional Court affirmed Fouad Mebazaa as acting president under Article 57 of the Constitution. A caretaker coalition government was also created, including members of Ben Ali's party, the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), in key ministries, while including other opposition figures in other ministries, with elections to take place within 60 days. However, five newly appointed non-RCD ministers resigned almost immediately, and daily street protests in Tunis and other towns around Tunisia continued, demanding that the new government have no RCD members and that the RCD itself be disbanded. On 27 January Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi reshuffled the government, removing all former RCD members other than himself.

The Christmas flood of 1964 was a major flood that took place in the Pacific Northwest and California between December 18, 1964 and January 7, 1965, spanning the Christmas holiday.[ref]
  
</ref>
Considered a 100-year flood,[ref]
  
</ref>
it was the worst flood in recorded history on nearly every major stream and river in coastal Northern California and one of the worst to affect the Willamette River in Oregon. It also had an impact on parts of southwest Washington, Idaho, and Nevada.[ref]
  
</ref>
In Oregon seventeen people died as a result of the disaster, and it caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. The flooding on the Willamette covered [tpl]convert|152789|acre|ha|sigfig=6[/tpl].[ref]
  
</ref>
The National Weather Service rated the flood as the fifth most destructive weather event in Oregon in the 20th century.[ref]
  
 '''Note''': Surpassed only by the [[Heppner Flood of 1903]], the [[Vanport City, Oregon|Vanport Flood of 1948]], the [[Columbus Day Storm of 1962]], and the [[Tillamook Burn|Tillamook Burn of 1933, 1939, 1945, and 1951]].</ref>
California Governor Pat Brown was quoted as saying that a flood of similar proportions could "happen only once in 1,000 years," and it was often referred to later as the Thousand Year Flood. The flood killed 19 people, heavily damaged or completely devastated at least 10 towns, destroyed all or portions of more than 20 major highway and county bridges, carried away millions of board feet of lumber and logs from mill sites, devastated thousands of acres of agricultural land, killed 4,000 head of livestock, and caused $100 million in damage in Humboldt County, California alone.

Wesley Chapel, also known as the "Hopetown Church", is a historic church building in the unincorporated community of Hopetown, Ohio, United States.  Built for a Methodist congregation, the church's earliest portion was constructed in 1834; this rectangular structure forms the core of the present building.  Major changes to the building since the 1830s have included the erection of a five-sided addition on the church's northern side in 1888 and significant destruction and repairs after a 1926 lightning strike.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places.  Vol. 2.  St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1227.
Built of brick on a stone foundation,Welsey Chapel, Ohio Historical Society, 2007.  Accessed 2010-12-30. the church features a distinctive pyramid-shaped roof above the 1888 addition.  At one time, the church also included a tower above the entrance; the tower was the portion of the building hit by the 1926 lightning strike, and it was removed as a result.  The various architectural elements combine to form a building that is distinctively in the Gothic Revival style.
From its earliest years, Wesley Chapel was the center of community life in Hopetown.  The community was settled during the final years of the eighteenth century; the oldest graves in the church's cemetery date from the 1790s.  For decade after decade, the church was the location of social activities, such as quilting bees and fish fries.  Many years passed without the church being able to obtain its own minister, so it was served by circuit-riding ministers instead.  Despite the prosperity brought by the coming of the Ohio and Erie Canal in the 1830s, Hopetown remained small; Wesley Chapel was always at the heart of a small settlement.
In 1979, Wesley Chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its important place in local history.  More than forty Ross County locations are on the Register, but Wesley Chapel is the only religious building among them.

[[Mount Pleasant Road]]
CATEGORIES: Roads in Toronto

Mount Pleasant Road is a major arterial thoroughfare in the Canadian city of Toronto, Ontario that travels from Jarvis Street south of Bloor Street north to Glen Echo Drive. The road is unique as one of the few arterial roads in Toronto to be created after the development of the suburbs which it passes through. These include the wealthy Rosedale, Moore Park and Lawrence Park neighbourhoods. The road also passes through the centre of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, after which it takes its name.
Mount Pleasant Road was first established in 1915 when the city of Toronto, having recently annexed Moore Park, purchased the right-of-way for a new road through the cemetery. This road opened to traffic in 1919, from St. Clair Avenue to the Blythwood Ravine, south of Lawrence Avenue. Several streets were absorbed into the length of Mount Pleasant Road in 1919, 1920 and 1935; the latest as part of a northward extension through Lawrence Park. In the late 1940s, what originally began as the Clifton Road Extension opened a new right-of-way between St. Clair Avenue and Jarvis Street, despite opposition from the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), bringing the road to its current length of [tpl]convert|7.6|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. This extension is considered Toronto's first expressway.

CATEGORIES: 1946 songs, Songs with lyrics by Johnny Burke (lyricist), Songs with music by Jimmy Van Heusen, Dorothy Lamour songs, Dinah Shore songs, Al Hirt songs

Personality is a popular song with lyrics by Johnny Burke and music by Jimmy Van Heusen. It was written for the 1946 film Road to Utopia, and Dorothy Lamour performed it in the movie.
In a slightly longer version, the song became a number one Billboard hit for Johnny Mercer in 1946. Dinah Shore also recorded it around that time. Lamour was between record contracts at the time of the film's release, so she did not record the song herself until years later.
The lyrics are humorous (and slightly suggestive for the 1940s), employing the word "personality" as an obvious euphemism for a woman's voluptuous figure.
Al Hirt released a version on his 1964 album, Beauty and the Beard.Al Hirt, Beauty and the Beard Retrieved April 10, 2013.
Rewritten versions of the song have been used as commercial jingles. The most notable was "Wessonality," an advertisement for Wesson cooking oil sung by Florence Henderson.

The European Papers on the New Welfare are a series of papers in English (with an Italian version) published since 2005 by The Risk Institute (Geneva, Trieste, Zagreb). The subtitle of the series, "The Counter-ageing Society", underlines the major goal: to promote and to publish studies, based on academic analyses and practical experiences, on issues related to the lengthening of the life cycle. This involves the understanding and monitoring of the impact of scientific advances in many fields (biology, medicine, gerontology, communications, etc.). Key is the promotion of an active life well beyond 60 years of age, and developing adequate learning and education systems as societal integration tools. All this in view of many reforms needed to develop a sustainable New Welfare (including employment, pensions schemes, health and ageing, etc.)

The prisons in Wales are run by Her Majesty's Prison Service, which is in turn a part of the National Offender Management Service which is an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice responsible for the correctional services in England and Wales. The objectives of prison confinement in Wales is threefold: to "hold prisoners securely", to "reduce the risk of prisoners re-offending" and to "provide safe and well-ordered establishments in which we treat prisoners humanely, decently and lawfully".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/abouttheservice/statementofpurpose/ | title=Statement of Purpose | work=hmprisonservice.gov.uk | author=HM Prison Service | accessdate=30 December 2010[/tpl]
Although the concept of incarceration as a punishment for wrongdoing did not exist in Wales, as in the rest of Britain, during the medieval period, from Tudor times onwards correction houses began appearing throughout the country. In the 18th century several buildings began taking on the function of modern prisons, and in 1878 Welsh prisons came under centralised government control. Today there are four prisons in Wales; three are run directly by the government with Parc Prison in Bridgend being Wales' only privatised jail.

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a former Anglican church in the hamlet of Warminghurst in the district of Horsham, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex.  The present building, which is no longer used for worship, has 13th-century origins, but a church may have existed on the site in the 11th century or earlier.  Often administered in connection with other churches in the rural area of West Sussex in which it was built–churches at nearby Steyning, Ashington and Thakeham were all involved with it at various times–its congregations declined and closure came first in the 1920s and then for good in 1979, when it was declared redundant.  Unlike many ancient churches in Sussex, it was not subject to restoration in the mid-19th century: its interior has been called "the finest example in Sussex of how many must have looked before the Victorian restorers".[tpl]Harvnb|Beevers|Marks|Roles|1989|p=155.[/tpl]  After a period in which the Early English Gothic stone-built church fell into dereliction, prompting one Sussex historian to lament its "unloved" appearance, it was taken into the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.  English Heritage has listed the church at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance.

CATEGORIES: Steam trams in the Netherlands, 3 ft 6 in gauge railways in the Netherlands

The Stoomtram Walcheren was a [tpl]RailGauge|Cape[/tpl] gauge steam tram that operated between Vlissingen and Domburg in the Netherlands, with a branch line from Koudekerke - where the depot was - to Middelburg. The tramway opened in 1906 and was closed in 1937, being replaced by bus services operated by the SW company, which changed its name to Streekvervoer Walcheren. The track was lifted but completely relaid by the German army during the occupation to aid the construction of defensive positions.
The line was operated by a single class of five 0-4-0 enclosed Hohenzollern steam locomotives. Coaches were supplied by Allens in their usual style but were the longest in the Netherlands. Goods stock was also by Allen.
Some signs of the old line survive. The Director's House and enginemens' cottages in Koudekerke still stand as well as the station building; there is also a Tramstraat. The bus station in Middelburg is on the site of the loop and quayside sidings. The Tramzicht cafe in Domburg overlooks the site of the former terminus in Stationsstraat. No rolling stock survives.

They cover an area of [tpl]convert|1909|km2[/tpl] and are the largest Slovenian mesoregion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://zgs.zrc-sazu.si/sl-si/teletekst/09101999.aspx |title=Posavsko hribovje |language=Slovene |trans_title=The Sava Hills |publisher=Association of Slovenian Geographers |date=September 1999 |work=Geografija na teletekstu TV Slovenija, september–oktober 1999 in Teletext of TV Slovenija, September–October 1999[/tpl]
The region has an average elevation of only [tpl]convert|484|m[/tpl], and an average inclination of 16.6°. It is water-rich, because the ground contains copious impermeable rocks, particularly sandstone and conglomerate at lower elevations, whereas at higher elevations, it mainly consists of limestone and dolomite. Predominantly deciduous forest covers almost two thirds of the area. The Sava flows through its central part from the west to the east. Notable rises along it are Kum ([tpl]convert|1220|m|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]) to the south of the Sava, Mount Čemšenik ([tpl]convert|1204|m|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]), Javor ([tpl]convert|1133|m|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]), and Mrzlica ([tpl]convert|1122|m|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]) to the north of the Sava and to the west of the Savinja River, and Bohor ([tpl]convert|1023|m|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]) and Lisca ([tpl]convert|948|m|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]) to the north of the Sava and the east of the Savinja.

About 135,000 people live in the Sava Hills. The settlements Litija in the Litija Basin and Trbovlje, Zagorje ob Savi, and Hrastnik in the narrow Central Sava Valley are known by their mining and timber rafting past and the energetics industry. The town of Radeče at the beginning of the wider Lower Sava Valley is known after paper industry. Other economic activities in the region are services, forestry, and livestock production. A railroad links places along the Sava and another one links places along the Savinja, both joining at Zidani Most. Since 2005, a highway crosses the northern Sava Hills and connects the Ljubljana Basin and the Celje Basin through the Trojane Tunnel.

CATEGORIES: Philippine general election, 2013, Philippine Senate elections

The 2013 election to the Senate of the Philippines was the 31st election to the Senate of the Philippines. It was held on Monday, May 13, 2013 to elect 12 of the 24 seats in the Senate. Together with those elected in 2010, the candidates elected in this election shall comprise the 16th Congress. The senators elected in 2010 will serve until June 30, 2016, while the senators elected in this election will serve up to June 30, 2019. The elections to the House of Representatives as well as local elections occurred on the same date. The Philippines use plurality-at-large voting for seats in the Senate: the twelve candidates with the highest number of votes win the twelve seats up for election. The Senate seat vacated by President Benigno Aquino III in 2010 was among the twelve seats to be put for election.
While the Philippines is a multi-party democracy since 1987, parties have not been able to complete a 12-candidate slate. This means parties have to form coalitions in order to complete a slate, this lessens the number of slates the voters have to choose for. In this election, the two coalitions that completed 12-candidate slates are Team PNoy led by the President Benigno Aquino III's Liberal Party, and the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) of former president Joseph Estrada's Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino and Vice President Jejomar Binay's Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan; the two slates used to share three common candidates, until they were dropped by UNA.
Team PNoy banked on Aquino's popularity and was leading 9−3 in the surveys, with Loren Legarda emerged topping the Senate election for a record-tying third time. However, on the final weeks of the campaign, Legarda was accused of hiding assets abroad, a charge she vehemently denied. On election night, former Movie and Television Review and Classification Board chairperson Grace Poe, daughter of defeated 2004 presidential candidate Fernando Poe, Jr., emerged as the frontrunner. Poe, Legarda, and four others were proclaimed on May 16, and further proclamations were held until May 18. Team PNoy did win nine seats against UNA's three, with both coalitions winning at the expense of retiring or term-limited senators who were not members of either coalition. Team PNoy campaign manager and senator Franklin Drilon was elected Senate President upon the convening of the 16th Congress of the Philippines on late July, after emerging as the frontrunner in the Senate Presidency, at the expense of incumbent Juan Ponce Enrile of UNA.

CATEGORIES: Liverpool F.C. seasons, English football clubs 1991–92 season

1991-92 was the first full season as manager of Liverpool F.C. for Graeme Souness. The manager needed heart surgery in April, only to be present at Liverpool won the final of the FA Cup the following month. However, it was a disappointing season in the league for Liverpool, whose sixth place finish was their first outside the top two since 1981.
Souness reshaped his side substantially over the close season. Out went older players including Peter Beardsley, David Speedie and Gary Gillespie as well as the young Steve Staunton, and in came £2.9million national record signing Dean Saunders from Derby County along with his Derby colleague, defender Mark Wright. He also forked out for Rangers midfielder Mark Walters and blooded in young talent in midfield in the shape of Steve McManaman and Jamie Redknapp, and just after the season began he drafted in Rob Jones from Fourth Division Crewe Alexandra, and within a few months the player, barely in his twenties, was representing England at senior level.
On his way out of Anfield halfway through the season was winger Steve McMahon to Manchester City, followed by defender Barry Venison to Newcastle United at the end of it. Mid season also saw the arrival of midfielder Michael Thomas from Arsenal, two and a half years after the player's goal for his former club had denied Liverpool the league title. Thomas ended the season by scoring one of Liverpool's two goals in the FA Cup final against Sunderland, the other coming from Ian Rush.

Neboulos ([tpl]lang-el|Νέβουλος[/tpl]) was a South Slavic or Bulgar military commander in the service of the Byzantine emperor Justinian II (r. 685–695 and 705–711), who defected with many of his men to the Arabs during the crucial Battle of Sebastopolis.[tpl]harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1448[/tpl]. 
In 688/689, Emperor Justinian II forcibly transplanted Slavic populations from the Balkans and settled them in the depopulated Opsician Theme. From them, he recruited a special military corps, allegedly 30,000 strong, which was called in Greek λαός περιούσιος, "the chosen people".[tpl]harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=333, 335[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Winkelmann|Lilie|Ludwig|Pratsch|2000|pp=340–341[/tpl]. In about 690, Neboulos, who already held the rank of skribon and possibly served in the imperial guard, was placed as their commander (archon). Neboulos's own origin is disputed between scholars, with some suggesting a Bulgar origin and others a South Slavic one. According to the account of Patriarch Nikephoros, he was chosen from among the nobility of the Slav settlers. 
In 692/693, after the corps' training had been completed, they were employed en masse by Emperor Justinian II in a major campaign against the Umayyads under the strategos of the Anatolics, Leontios. The Byzantines engaged the Arabs in the Battle of Sebastopolis and initially had the upper hand until Neboulos, with the bulk (some 20,000) of his men, deserted the Byzantine lines and went over to the Arabs, allegedly bribed by the Arab commander, Muhammad ibn Marwan.[tpl]harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=335[/tpl]. Some sources report, probably with great exaggeration, how thereafter Justinian took his revenge on the remaining Slavs: he disbanded the corps, and killed or sold into slavery many of its men, as well as the families of the deserters. Neboulos and his men, on the other hand, were settled by the Umayyads in Syria, and were employed in subsequent Arab forays into Byzantine-held Asia Minor.

[[List of Dutch Top 40 number-one singles of 2011]]
CATEGORIES: 2011 in the Netherlands, 2011 record charts, Lists of number-one songs in the Netherlands

This is a list of the Dutch Top 40 number-one singles of 2011. The Dutch Top 40 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the Netherlands. It is published every week by radio station Radio 538. In 2011, it was the first time that the Dutch Top 40 had 53 releases, because there were 53 Saturdays in 2011. In the past, if there were 53 Saturdays in a year, the Dutch Top 40 was only released 52 times. 
Eighteen acts gained their first number-one single in the Dutch Top 40 in 2011, either as lead or featured act: Martin Solveig, Dragonette, Adele, Alexis Jordan, Ne-Yo, Afrojack, Nayer, Sak Noel, Don Omar, Lucenzo, Maroon 5, Christina Aguilera, The Voice of Holland, Gotye, Kimbra, Gers Pardoel, Sandro Silva and Quintino. This means only Lady Gaga and Pitbull did not gain their first number-one single this year: they gained their first number-one singles in 2009 (Gaga with "Just Dance" and Pitbull with "I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)").
Lady Gaga's single "Born This Way" debuted at number one in the Top 40 this year. This has not happened since 2009, when Lisa Lois's cover version of "Hallelujah" debuted at number one. Alexis Jordan became the artist with the most weeks on number one this year: her song "Happiness" spent ten weeks at the top (see number-one artists). Three singles spent only one week at the number-one position: "Set Fire to the Rain", "One Thousand Voices" and "Epic".
The artist with the most number-one singles in 2011, was Adele. In fact, she was the only artist with more than one number-one single this year. She reached the top with her songs "Rolling in the Deep" and "Set Fire to the Rain". Adele also became, with these two singles, the first act since 1974 that held the number-one position with more than one song consecutively. In 1974, the English band Mud managed to achieve this with the singles "Dynamite" and "Tiger Feet".
Seven artists that scored a Dutch Top 40 number-one single in 2011, are American; five are Dutch. The other artists are Belgian Australian, Canadian, French, New Zealander, Portuguese, Puerto Rican, Spanish and British. The most used language in the number-one singles of 2011 is English.

SMS ''Ostfriesland[tpl]efn|name=SMS[/tpl] was the second vessel of the [tpl]sclass-|Helgoland|battleship|4[/tpl] of battleships of the German Imperial Navy. Named for the region of East Frisia, Ostfriesland[tpl]'[/tpl]s keel was laid in October 1908 at the Kaiserliche Werft dockyard in Wilhelmshaven. She was launched on 30 September 1909 and was commissioned into the fleet on 1 August 1911. The ship was equipped with twelve [tpl]convert|30.5|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on[/tpl] guns in six twin turrets, and had a top speed of [tpl]convert|21.2|kn[/tpl]. Ostfriesland'' was assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career, including World War I.
Along with her three sister ships, [tpl]SMS|Helgoland||2[/tpl], [tpl]SMS|Thüringen||2[/tpl], and [tpl]SMS|Oldenburg||2[/tpl], Ostfriesland participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I in the North Sea against the British Grand Fleet. This included the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, the largest naval battle of the war. The ship also saw action in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy. She was present during the unsuccessful first incursion into the Gulf of Riga in August 1915.
After the German collapse in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany, however, and were therefore spared the destruction of the fleet in Scapa Flow. Ostfriesland and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers as war reparations; Ostfriesland was transferred to the United States Navy. She was sunk during air power trials off the Virginia Capes in July 1921.

[[Manley–Rowe relations]]
CATEGORIES: Applied mathematics, Electrical engineering

The Manley–Rowe relations are mathematical expressions developed originally for electrical engineers to predict the amount of energy in a wave that has multiple frequencies.
The original papers, written by two researchers at Bell Labs, J. M. Manley and H. E. Rowe between 1956 and 1960[ref]

[/ref] 
was for an electrical circuit containing nonlinear capacitors and inductors.  One or more oscillators, operating at specified frequencies, are connected to the input of this circuit. The Manley–Rowe relations predict the energy present in waves at various frequencies, including new frequencies (such as harmonics and sidebands) that arise in the circuit due to nonlinearity. The theory is based partly on the principle of conservation of energy. It requires that energy storage in the circuit is a stationary process that varies with time only due to the oscillations and not due to some steady increase or decrease with time.
Because the Manley–Rowe relations are based on general concepts like nonlinear waves and conservation of energy, their use is not limited to the original application in radio-frequency electrical circuits. They have also found use in other scientific fields, for example nonlinear optics.[ref]

</ref>
In the electrical circuit for the original derivation of Manley–Rowe relations, capacitors and inductors store energy from a wave and then release it. Other physical systems that involve energy storage for waves, and nonlinear generation of new waves, can make use of the same relations.
John Manley and Harrison Rowe were protégés of Ralph Hartley at Bell Laboratories (although I believe that this information is not related to the Manley–Rowe relations). The work with nonlinear reactances (inductors and capacitors) was started back in 1917 by John Burton and Eugene Peterson.Peterson E., “Atomic Physics and Circuit Theory”; Bell Laboratories Record, Volume 7, February 1929, pp 231–233 When Hartley joined Bell Laboratories after being part of Western Electric, he started a research group on nonlinear oscillations. This group was later joined by Peterson, Manley, and Rowe.

At the time the country was a one-party state and all candidates had to be members of the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). Two candidates were elected from each of the 175 constituencies (although the six constituencies in Sinai and Suez were not contested and their representatives appointed by the President), with a second round of voting required if one or both of the candidates failed to win over 50% of the vote in the first round, or neither of the candidates with over 50% were classed as a worker or farmer (each constituency had to have at least one farmer or worker representing it).Egypt Inter-Parliamentary Union In total, 1,661 candidates contested the election.

Aurobindo's political career lasted only four years, from 1906 to 1910. Though he had been active behind the scene surveying, organizing and supporting the nationalist cause, ever since his return to India, especially during his excursions to Bengal. This period of his activity from 1906-1910 saw a complete transformation of India's political scene. Before Aurobindo began publishing his views, the Congress was an annual debating society whose rare victories had been instances of the empire taking a favourable view to its petitions. By the time Aurobindo left the field, the ideal of political independence had been firmly ingrained into the minds of people, and nineteen years later, it became the official raison d'être of the Congress.Peter Heehs. Idea of India
This change was affected by the advent of the aggressive nationalist thought of Lokmanya Tilak who declared that swaraj was his birthright and Bipin Chandra Pal who demanded "complete autonomy" from Britain. However none went as far as Aurobindo in articulating the legitimacy and necessity of complete independence. He "based his claim for freedom for India on the inherent right to freedom, not on any charge of misgovernment or oppression". He wrote :

Al-Muntakhab al-Hasan (died 936) was an imam of the Zaidi state in Yemen in the period 934-936. He was the fourth ruler of the Rasssid Dynasty
Al-Hasan bin Ahmad was the third of the six sons of imam an-Nasir Ahmad. An-Nasir Ahmad had been a powerful ruler who had consolidated Zaydiyyah influence in the Yemeni highland, but after his death in 934 the imamate entered into a rather obscure period. The rivalling Yu'firid Dynasty controlled Sa'dah, the residence of the Rassids, for four months after an-Nasir's demise. Now, al-Hasan claimed the imamate, with the regnal name al-Muntakhab al-Hasan. However, his elder brother al-Mukhtar al-Qasim was set up as rival imam.Enzyklopädie des Islam, Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 1216. Neither al-Mutakhab al-Hasan nor al-Mukhtar al-Qasim are listed in the later Zaidi chronicles, which count the imamate of their younger brother al-Mansur Yahya as starting from 934. The death of al-Muntakhab al-Hasan is dated in 936 by the historian Ibn Khaldun; another text says 939.Cesare Ansaldi, Il Yemen nella storia e nella leggenda. Roma 1933, p. 130.

The area was proclaimed as a town in 1892 by Paul Kruger and was originally named Dull's-stroom, later simplified to Dullstroom, after the settlers’ leader Wolterus Dull and the Crocodile River (stream), which flows nearby.
Matlebjane II had five sons. The first son was Seloane, second Mogashoa, third Phaahla, fourth Masemola and lastly Photo. Seloane, Mogashoa, Phaahla and Masemola, got worried that the king’s gifts (dibego) were continuously being taken to the younger king's wife (the mother to Photo). They then all agreed to murder the king, but were worried about what people will say. So they conceived a plan, since Photo was still a teenager, they somehow convinced him that all of them including him Photo should kill the king at night with their spears. But there was a plan Seloane, Mogashoa, Phaahla and Masemola cooked which Photo was not privy to (continue reading to discover this plan).
During that night all the brothers got into the king's resting place and all with their spears stabbed the king and the king died. During the morning Photo discovered that he has been fooled by his brothers. During the stabbing last night Photo discovered that his brother's spears were turned deliberately at the sharp tip and he had killed the king alone. So only his spear had blood while his brother's spears did not have blood as the spears were deliberately blunted. Photo's brothers then cried aloud hysterically with painful voices, that Photo has killed their father. From then on Photo was despised and rejected by the people for having killed his father. The killing of Matlebjane II by his sons is the reason we have these idioms today:
Matlebjane o bolaile ke tswala.
Ka hlagolela leokane la re go gola la ntlhaba?
The Batau lived at the Mokwena River for a period spanning 200 years. This was a time of relative peace and stability. Some people believe that their ruins and remains are still visible there in Mokwena (Crocodile) River, Dullstroom.
Ga Masemola surround ga Maphutha village.  Maphutha (from swazi name Mabuza), is a brother to Masemola.

[[Protocol Builder]]
CATEGORIES: Computer programming tools

Protocol Builder is a tool in some programming languages like C++ and C# to generate code to build protocols in a fast and reliable way. Network programming for all kinds of protocols (like TCP, UDP, SNMP ... ) includes converting data to be transferred to a raw bytes in the sending side and parsing these bytes in the receiving side. Protocol builders facilitate this stage usually by generating the code automatically.
Protocol Programming has many components to be developed, these are: server listener, server connection, client connection, packets, and loggers, most protocol builders implement these components automatically so developers save time and money.
Currently, there are two Protocol Builders in the market, one for C++ from UpRedSun which is for TCP and UDP protocols. The Second one is for .Net languages which generates the code in C# for TCP Protocols, this tool is called .Net Protocol Builder.

The pass provides a way through the northern Amanus Mountains (modern Nur Mountains), connecting Cilicia to southern Anatolia and northern Syria. It is one of two passes through the Amanus, the other being the Syrian Gate to the south.William Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, 1878, s.v. 'Amanides Pylae'
The Amanian Gate was mentioned in the ancient Nabonidus Chronicle.[tpl]cite web|title=Amanus Mountains|url=http://www.livius.org/am-ao/amanus/amanus.html|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=30 December 2010[/tpl] 
The pass played an important role leading to the Battle of Issus. The Persian army advanced through the Amanic Gates or another nearby pass, coming behind the Macedonian army which turned back to face and defeat the Persian army. The exact Persian strategy remains in dispute. According to Jona Lendering, after a part of Alexander the Great army occupied the Syrian Gate, Darius III of Persia decided to lead his army north through the Amanian Gate and place his army between the two Macedonian armies at the town of Issus.[tpl]cite web|title=The Battle of Issus|url=http://www.livius.org/io-iz/issus/issus_battle.html|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=30 December 2010[/tpl] However, the Macedonians joined forces before the arrival of Darius, and the outcome was Persian defeat. However, Donald Engels rejects a similar interpretation.Engels, Donald, 1978, Alexander the Great and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army, p. 53 fn. 137.

After three years at school, Peterson ran away to sea, working at a salt works in India. Returning to England, he trained as a lawyer and married Charlotte Myers St Clair, daughter of a colonel in the Royal Artillery. In 1846 he left to practice law at the Supreme Court in Calcutta. Retiring  in the 1870s, he bought land near Sway, Hampshire, building and extending his house, Arnewood Towers, "from a small villa into a commodious country residence of somewhere near forty rooms, with the necessary outbuildings, built entirely of concrete".James Burns, Medium and Daybreak, 15 June 1883, pp. 369-71. Quoted in Philip Hoare, England's Lost Eden: Adventures in a Victorian Utopia, p. 159
Becoming a convert to spiritualism, Peterson met an uneducated sensitive called William Lawrence. After Lawrence had completed a three-month sentence for fraudulent imposture at Coldbath Fields prison,Hoare, England's Lost Eden, chapter 11 'Mr Peterson's Tower', pp. 346-371  he became Peterson's personal medium, channelling spirit messages from 'controls' including Pythagoras,  Aesop, Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, Brutus, Julius Caesar, Buddha, Muhammad, Jesus, Martin Luther, John Knox, Oliver Cromwell, Sir Walter Raleigh, William Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, John Dryden, Jonathan Swift and Thomas Paine.Blake Pinnell, Country House History Around Lymington, Brockenhurst and Milford-on-Sea, ch. 8 'Arnewood Court', pp. 157-166 In late 1877 Lawrence also served as the channel for 'Spiritual drawings' from William Blake and Henry Fuseli.
Sir Christopher Wren, through Lawrence, directed Peterson to build a large concrete tower in Sway: foundation work began in 1879, and in 1886 the tower was completed, at a height of 218 feet and a cost of £30,000. It remains the world's tallest non-reinforced concrete structure.[tpl]cite book|last=James|first=J.|title=All about Sway Tower|location=Lymington|publisher=Lymington Museum Trust|year=1997[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Trout|first=Edwin|title=Sway Tower: an early example of high-rise concrete construction|journal=Concrete|date=October 2002|pages=64–5[/tpl]

The first mass in Tompkinsville occurred 12 November 1899 in McRobert's Hall on Arietta Street. A large chapel in the building of the Augustinian Academy (Tompkinsville, Staten Island) "was used for parochial purposes with the chapel of Our Lady of Consolation in Tompkinsville.  The chapel, which is situated on St. Paul's Avenue, was erected on 2 February 1902."  It was enlarged and renovated in the summer of 1908 and the parish numbered around 400 in 1914.  The second pastor, the Irish-born Rev. B.E. Daly, O.S.A., was a missionary before being appointed to the Tompkinsville parish on 22 December 1910.
The modern church building was designed by the architectural firm of Genovese & Maddalene of 175 Rock Road, Glen Rock, New Jersey. The firm also designed Manhattan's Church of the Nativity in 1968. It was dedicated by Terrence Cardinal Cooke on April 26, 1968.

Dom Jean-Baptiste Delaveyne, O.S.B., (1653-1719)L'aventure d'un homme:Jean-Baptiste Delaveyne accessed 16 April 2012 [tpl]fr[/tpl] was a French Benedictine monk and priest, who founded a religious institute which continues to serve throughout the world.
Delaveyne was born in the village of Saint-Saulge in 1653, in the ancient province of Nivernais. As a teenager, he went to the city of Autun to start his education. After studying with the Society of Jesus, in 1669 he entered the  Abbey of St. Martin in that city, at about the age of 16. He was soon sent to Paris, spending the following seven years studying there. He made his religious profession there in 1670. While there, he was drawn into the artistic and literary circles of the elite of Parisian society. After his ordination in 1676, he was sent to his hometown to serve as its pastor, continuing to lead a life mostly focused on the intellectual pursuits of the literary life.
Two years later, a chance remark by the pastor of a neighboring village contrasting his way of life to that of St. Benedict re-ignited the religious fervor of Delaveyne's youth. He returned to his monastery in Autun for a spiritual retreat, in order to find again the focus of his life. From this experience he returned to his parish a changed man.
In his re-found religious mindset, Delaveyne began to see the misery of the poor of the parish, especially those in the countryside. He started to work to relieve their physical as well as their spiritual needs.
Out of these efforts, in 1680 Delaveyne invited a group of young women of the parish to organize to care for the needs of women and children. He advised them:
In this way, Delaveyne founded the religious congregation of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers, which has operated hundred of convents and schools throughout France since its founding, with its motherhouse still in Nevers. The most famous member of the congregation is St. Bernadette Soubirous, the visionary of Lourdes.[tpl]cite book|last=Marbot|first=Edmond|title=La sainte église d'Aix et Arles: Nos évêques|year=1889|publisher=A.

Cathedral constables are employed by a small number of Church of England cathedrals in England.Cathedral constables Previously appointed under common law, modern-day constables no longer have any of the powers and privileges of a constable.cathedralconstables.co.uk - Our History
Cathedral constables have a long history and can trace their lineage back to the 13th Century. They have played an important, if little known contribution, in the development of policing in the United Kingdom. Before the onset of professional policing, something often overlooked, is the close relationship, which once existed between the church and the imposition of law and order. Parish constables, sometimes referred to as petty constables, were supervised not only by justices of the peace, but also by churchwardens. Like parish constables, church wardens were locally appointed and oversaw the upkeep of the church fabric and property.
In the Middle Ages, the parish was the smallest unit of local government in the country. Every parish was centred on the Church of England church and, after the Reformation, was responsible for administering civil and religious government at a local level.
Many parishes developed a Vestry - a small body of village officials, answerable only to the bishop and the local justices, and responsible for the ecclesiastical and secular well being of the parish they served. Similarly, many cathedrals employed parish constables to keep watch and maintain law and order, both within and around the cathedral and its precincts. These officers were answerable to the Dean and Chapter.
Currently, Canterbury Cathedral, York Minster, Hereford Cathedral and Liverpool Cathedral still employ constables; and in December 2011 Chester Cathedral appointed its first head constable, raising the number of cathedrals which employ constables to four. However, officers are no longer attested as constables, unlike the members of the specialist port and parks constabularies. Having no police powers of arrest, cathedral constables utilise 'any person' powers of arrest under Section 24A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
In order to preserve their history and tradition, the Liverpool Cathedral Constables formed the Cathedral Constables' Association; their motto 'In Deo Speramus,' simply means, 'In God we trust.' The association has published a short book 'Cathedral Bobbies,' of the history, traditions and work of cathedral constables through the ages.

The present Brutalist-style church structure was built 1971 to designs by Paul Reilly. The identity of the architect is somewhat in question with Paul W. Reilly of 393 Seventh Avenue, New York City, New York 10001, claiming the church as his own in the American Architects Directory, whereas the AIA Guide to NYC (2nd to 5th editions) attributes the design to Paul J. Reilly. Colorful chunks of stained glass are set directly into the concrete in the style of the then-contemporary European post-war stained-glass work.
The Church is part of a parish that also includes a school located directly across the street, know as St. Frances de Chantal School.

North Stoke Church, rededicated in 2007 to St Mary the Virgin after its medieval dedication was unexpectedly rediscovered, is a former Church of England parish church in the riverside hamlet of North Stoke in the Horsham District of West Sussex. The partly 11th-century cruciform building, set in an almost deserted village in a loop of the River Arun, is mostly unrestored and stands on an ancient earthwork which has pre-Christian origins.  The building has architectural features and internal fittings spanning hundreds of years, including some very old stained glass and wall paintings, although there are few memorials compared with other Sussex churches of a similar age. The church, "movingly eloquent of centuries of remote Sussex agricultural life",[tpl]Harvnb|Watney|2006|p=60.[/tpl] is no longer used for worship: it was declared redundant in 1992, after which it was entrusted to the Churches Conservation Trust.

Adamston, West Virginia is a former town in Harrison County, West Virginia, incorporated in 1903. It was the former site of a Baltimore & Ohio Railroad depot and a post office. It is now a neighborhood of Clarksburg, West Virginia.
It attained some national attention in 1912 when it elected a Socialist mayor and city government, some of whom were re-elected in 1915. Among the contributing factors in the victory, according to later analysis, were the strong involvement of the window glass factory workers, and the commitment of a large portion of the Belgian-American population of the town.Fones-Wolf, Ken Glass towns: industry, labor and political economy in Appalachia, 1890-1930s Champaign-Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2007; pp. 113-145
In 1917, Adamston, along with Broad Oaks, North View (where Progressives had had success) and Stealer Heights, was annexed to Clarksburg.State and municipal compendium, Volume 4. William B. Dana Company, 1931; p. 185 It was generally understood that part of the reason for annexation was to diminish the political power of glassworker enclaves in these small municipalities.

The hospital provides orthopaedic, ophthalmogic, otolaryngology (ENT), plastic, and general surgery care, as well as pain management techniques and podiatric care. NCSH is the oldest hospital in Durham, dating back to 1926, when it was formed as an eye, ear, nose, and throat hospital originally known as McPherson Hospital, named after Dr. Samuel McPherson, an EENT specialist. In the early-1990s, the hospital was renamed as the North Carolina Eye and Ear Hospital. It was located at the time in its original building in downtown Durham, near the East Campus of Duke University.  In May 2005, NCSH moved to its current location in northern Durham, and was renamed as North Carolina Specialty Hospital in 2000.
In 2009, North Carolina Specialty Hospital was named the top hospital in North Carolina, and among the top 10 in the United States, for its patient care ratings, per the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), a division of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

[[Human trafficking in Hungary]]

CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Hungary, Crime in Hungary

Hungary is a source, transit, and destination country for women and girls subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and a source country for men and women in conditions of forced labor. Women from Hungary are forced into prostitution in the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Greece, and the United States. Women from eastern Hungary are subjected to forced prostitution in Budapest and areas in Hungary along the Austrian border. Roma women and girls who grow up in Hungarian orphanages are highly vulnerable to internal forced prostitution. Men from Western Europe travel to Budapest for the purpose of adult sex tourism, some of which may involve the exploitation of trafficking victims. Men and women are subjected to conditions of forced labor within Hungary. Women from Romania and Ukraine are transported through Hungary to the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France, and the United Arab Emirates where they are subsequently subjected to forced prostitution; some of these victims may be exploited in Hungary before they reach their final destination country.
The Government of Hungary does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated law enforcement progress in 2009, including amending Paragraph 175/b of its criminal code to increase penalties for cases involving child victims of human trafficking under the age of 12 as well as an increase in the number of traffickers convicted and sentenced to time in prison, though it did not prosecute or convict any labor trafficking offenders. The government demonstrated mixed progress in improving victim assistance during the reporting period; while it allocated funding for a new NGO-run shelter that opened in March 2010 and guaranteed funding through June 2011, the shelter did not assist any victims during the reporting period. Moreover, the shelter is permitted only to assist Hungarian victims, excluding the assistance of any potential foreign victims. More should be done to ensure all victims have access to assistance. The lack of victim assistance funding by the government in 2008 and most of 2009 may have resulted in a decrease in victims assisted in 2009."Hungary". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010.

[[Human trafficking in Gabon]]

CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Gabon, Crime in Gabon

Gabon is primarily a transit country for children from Benin, Nigeria, Togo, Mali, Guinea, and other West African countries who are subjected to human trafficking, specifically forced labor and forced prostitution. Some victims transit through Gabon en route to exploitation in Equatorial Guinea. According to UNICEF, the majority of victims are boys who are forced to work as street hawkers or mechanics. Girls generally are subjected to conditions of involuntary domestic servitude, or forced labor in markets or roadside restaurants. Stepped-up coastal surveillance over the past year – especially following the October 2009 arrival in Gabonese waters of a sea vessel that was carrying 34 child trafficking victims, some of whom were destined for Equatorial Guinea[tpl]Citation needed|date = |date = July 2013[/tpl][tpl]Clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl] – caused traffickers to change their routes, which included utilizing estuaries and rivers to transport children. The majority of victims were young girls[tpl]Contradiction-inline|date=July 2013[/tpl], a departure from previous patterns of trafficking in the region. Trafficking offenders appear to operate in loose ethnic-based crime networks. Most child traffickers are women, who serve as intermediaries in their countries of origin. In some cases, child victims report that their parents had turned them over to intermediaries promising employment opportunities in Gabon. The government has no reports of international organized crime syndicates, employment agencies, marriage brokers, or travel services facilitating trafficking in Gabon. In 2009, the government began tracking a new trend of young adults between ages 18 and 25 being forced into domestic servitude or prostitution in Gabon."Gabon". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). [tpl]PD-notice[/tpl]
The Government of Gabon does not fully comply with what the U.S. government considers to be minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts – most notably the arrests of seven suspected traffickers and the expansion of protection services for child victims of trafficking – the government did not show evidence of increasing efforts to address trafficking. Specifically, the government, for another consecutive year, did not provide information on prosecutions or convictions of traffickers, despite the arrest of over 30 suspected offenders between 2003 and 2008."Gabon".

[[Human trafficking in the Gambia]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in the Gambia, Crime in the Gambia

Human trafficking in the Gambia covers ongoing activities in trafficking women and children in Gambia as forced labor and prostitution. 
The Gambia is a source, transit, and destination country for this type of exploitation. Within the Gambia, women and girls and, to a lesser extent, boys are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation, as well as for domestic servitude. For generations, parents sent their sons to live with Koranic teachers or marabouts, who more often forced children to beg than ensured their progress in religious studies. However, this practice is declining as the security forces now routinely interrogate the marabout of any beggar they find in the streets. Some observers noted only a small number of trafficking victims, but others see the Gambia’s porous borders as an active transit zone for women, girls, and boys from West African countries − mainly Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, and Benin – who are recruited for exploitation in the sex trade, in particular to meet the demands of European tourists seeking sex with children. Most trafficking offenders in the Gambia are probably individuals who operate independently of international syndicates. The government’s Department of Social Welfare and Tourism Security Unit are compiling electronic databases and conventional lists of trafficking cases, offenders, and victims, which may soon provide a clearer picture of how traffickers operate and how they differ from the migrant smugglers whose cases are now filling the country’s courts.
The Government of the Gambia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. At the highest level, the government acknowledges that trafficking exists in the country. The Gambian government lacks funding and resources to fight trafficking, though it continued to monitor and evaluate the trafficking problem in the country. Every law enforcement agency has anti-trafficking or child protection units. In July 2009, the government took an important step to increase efficiency in law enforcement by adopting a biometric national identity card system called GAMBIS."The Gambia".

Human trafficking in Georgia is common, where people are subjected to forced prostitution and forced labor. In 2009, women and girls from Georgia were forced into prostitution in Georgia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Greece. In recent years, cases of forced prostitution of Georgian victims were also documented in Russia, Germany, and Austria. Men and women have been forced into labor in Georgia, Libya and Turkey. Men from Turkey are also forced into labor in the breakaway region of Abkhazia, which is outside the Georgian government’s control.
The government of Georgia fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government demonstrated strong efforts to identify and assist victims of trafficking and again increased its victim assistance funding to $312,000. The government also demonstrated impressive law enforcement success, significantly increasing the number of individuals convicted of trafficking, and again ensuring all convicted trafficking offenders served some time in prison. The Georgian government also demonstrated strong prevention efforts and continued its close partnership with anti-trafficking NGOs in both victim assistance and prevention efforts."Georgia".

[[Human trafficking in Ghana]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking in Ghana, Human trafficking by country

Ghana is a country of origin, transit, and destination for women and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor and forced prostitution. The nonconsensual exploitation of Ghanaian citizens, particularly children, is more common than the trafficking of foreign migrants. The movement of internally trafficked children is either from rural to urban areas, or from one rural area to another, as from farming to fishing communities. Ghanaian boys and girls are subjected to conditions of forced labor within the country in fishing, domestic servitude, street hawking, begging, portering, and agriculture. Ghanaian girls, and to a lesser extent boys, are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation within Ghana. Internal labor traffickers are commonly freelance operators, and may be known to members of the source community. Uninformed parents may not understand that by cooperating with trafficking offenders, they may expose their children to bonded placement, coercion, or outright sale. Media reports during the year cited 50 Ghanaian women recruited for work in Russia and subsequently forced into prostitution. Women and girls from China, Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso are subjected to forced prostitution after arriving in Ghana. Citizens from other West African countries are subjected to forced labor in Ghana in agriculture or involuntary domestic servitude. Trafficking victims endure extremes of harsh treatment, including long hours, debt bondage, lack of pay, physical risks, and sexual abuse.
The Government of Ghana does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Ghana increased its law enforcement efforts by prosecuting and convicting an increased number of traffickers, including the first convictions relating to forced child labor in the Lake Volta fishing industry. The Ghanaian Police partnered with Interpol to host regional training for law enforcement officials from Anglophone Africa, and the government took steps to establish four regional anti-trafficking units to manage cases more effectively at the regional level. In August 2009, the president appointed new members to the Human Trafficking Management Board, which had been disbanded when the previous government left office in January 2009. However, the government did not demonstrate increased efforts to ensure that victims receive adequate protection, such as funding a shelter for trafficking victims, or increasing assistance to NGOs or international organizations to provide trafficking victim care."Ghana".

Greece is a transit and destination country for women and children who are subjected to human trafficking, specifically forced prostitution and conditions of forced labor for men, women, and children. Female sex trafficking victims originate primarily in Eastern Europe and former Soviet bloc countries. Traffickers use various forms of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as tools of coercion. Greece's EU membership, coupled with a shared border with Turkey, means the country sees massive flows of illegal immigrants looking to enter the EU; traffickers also use Greece not only as a destination but a transit stop on the way to Western Europe.Papanicolaou, Georgios.

The Government of Greece does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government made clear progress in prosecuting labor and sex trafficking offenses, identifying victims, implementing a child victim protection agreement with Albania, and advancing prevention activities.

CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Guatemala, Crime in Guatemala

Guatemala is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically sexual servitude and forced labor. Guatemalan women and children are found in forced prostitution within the country, as well as in Mexico and the United States. Guatemalan men, women, and children are subjected to forced labor within the country, often in agriculture or domestic service, and particularly near the border with Mexico and in the highland region. Guatemalan men, women, and children are also found in conditions of forced labor in Mexico and the United States in agriculture and the garment industry. Indigenous Guatemalans are particularly vulnerable to labor exploitation. In the Mexican border area, Guatemalan children are exploited for forced begging on streets and forced labor in municipal dumps. Guatemala is a destination country for women and girls from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in forced prostitution. Migrants from these Central American countries transit through Guatemala en route to Mexico and the United States; some may become human trafficking victims. Child sex tourism is a problem in certain tourist areas such as Antigua and Lake Atitlan, and child sex tourists predominately come from Canada, Germany, Spain, and the United States. The border with Mexico remains a top concern due to the heavy flow of irregular migrants, some of whom are trafficked.
The Government of Guatemala does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these significant efforts, including prosecuting its first trafficking cases under the recent anti-trafficking law and establishing a new anti-trafficking office, the government did not show overall evidence of increasing efforts to address human trafficking through providing adequate victim services or addressing official complicity in trafficking; therefore, Guatemala is placed on Tier 2, for the fourth consecutive year. Despite the significant number of foreign trafficking victims identified by the government, foreign victims were not generally offered asylum or temporary residency, although the anti-trafficking law provides that authority. As such, most foreign trafficking victims were deported or required to remain in locked migrant detention facilities with no access to specialized victim services."Guatemala".

[[Human trafficking in Guinea]]

CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Guinea, Crime in Guinea

Guinea is a source, transit, and to a lesser extent, a destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor and forced prostitution. The majority of victims are children, and these incidents of trafficking are more prevalent among Guinean citizens than among foreign migrants living in Guinea. Within the country, girls are largely subjected to involuntary domestic servitude and commercial sexual exploitation, while boys are subjected to forced begging and forced labor as street vendors, shoe shiners, and laborers in gold and diamond mines. Some Guinean men are also subjected to forced agricultural labor within Guinea. Smaller numbers of girls from Mali, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Guinea-Bissau migrate to Guinea, where they are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude and likely also commercial sexual exploitation. Some Guinean boys and girls are subjected to forced labor in gold mining operations in Senegal, Mali, and possibly other African countries. Guinean women and girls are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude and forced prostitution in Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Benin, Senegal, Greece, and Spain. Chinese women are trafficked to Guinea for commercial sexual exploitation by Chinese traffickers. Networks also traffic women from Nigeria, India, and Greece through Guinea to the Maghreb and onward to Europe, notably Italy, Ukraine, Switzerland, and France for forced prostitution and involuntary domestic servitude.
The Government of Guinea does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. The government sustained its efforts to investigate alleged trafficking crimes and detain suspected trafficking offenders during the reporting period. The junta, however, has made minimal progress toward combating human trafficking in Guinea since coming to power in a coup d’etat in December 2008. While Guinea has an adequate anti-trafficking legal framework, which it had strengthened by enacting the Child Code of 2008, the junta did not report any trafficking prosecutions or convictions for the second year in a row, and protection and prevention efforts remained weak. Therefore, Guinea is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year. In February 2009, the head of government issued a declaration giving security forces the right to shoot anyone apprehended while trafficking a human being, raising significant human rights concerns. In the same month, the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking met to evaluate the 2005-2006 National Action Plan and to outline an updated version for 2009–2011, but released no such document to the public. Many ministries claimed involvement in efforts to address trafficking, but the country was severely limited in its ability to address the problem due to budget constraints, capacity limitations, and unclear allocation of law enforcement and social welfare responsibilities."Guinea".

[[Human trafficking in Guinea-Bissau]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Guinea-Bissau, Crime in Guinea-Bissau

Guinea-Bissau is a source country for children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor, principally begging, and forced prostitution. Boys are sent to Senegal, and to a lesser extent Mali and Guinea, under the care of Koranic teachers called marabouts, or their intermediaries, to receive Islamic religious education. These teachers, however, routinely beat and subject the children, called talibé, to force them to beg, and subject them to other harsh treatment, sometimes separating them permanently from their families. UNICEF estimates that 200 children are taken from Guinea-Bissau each month for this purpose, and in 2008 a study found that 30 percent of the 8,000 religious students begging on the streets of Dakar are from Guinea-Bissau. Men, often former talibés from the regions of Bafata and Gabu, are the principal traffickers. In most cases they operate in the open, protected by their stature in the Muslim community. Some observers believe girls are also targets, and may be subjected to domestic labor in Guinea-Bissau or Senegal.
The Government of Guinea-Bissau does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Despite these efforts, the government demonstrated weak overall progress in combating trafficking during the reporting period, particularly its lack of any effective law enforcement action; therefore, Guinea-Bissau is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year."Guinea-Bissau".

[[Human trafficking in Guyana]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Guyana, Crime in Guyana

Guyana is a source country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced prostitution and forced labor. Guyanese trafficking victim cases have been identified in the country, as well as in other countries in the region. Identified foreign victims have come from Venezuela and Brazil. Forced prostitution occurs in brothels on the coast and around mining camps as well as in rum shops and Chinese restaurants. The common Guyanese practice of poor, rural families sending children to live with higher income family members or acquaintances in more populated areas has the potential to evolve into forced domestic servitude. Trafficking victims in Guyana may not self-identify to authorities due to fear of retribution from trafficking offenders, fear of resettlement to abusive home situations, and lack of awareness that human trafficking is a crime. Groups particularly vulnerable to human trafficking in Guyana include Amerindian females, foreign women (such as Brazilians) in prostitution, and children. During the reporting period the U.S. Department of Labor reported results of a project that withdrew 984 children from exploitive child labor in logging and saw-milling, fishing, hazardous farming, factory work, mining, and freight handling from 2005 to 2009.
The Government of Guyana does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, the government did not initiate any new prosecutions of trafficking offenses during the reporting period and has yet to convict or punish any trafficking offenders under its five-year old anti-human trafficking law. Therefore, Guyana is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the fourth consecutive year. During the reporting period, the government and NGOs identified four victims of trafficking, two of whom prison officials proactively identified. The government provided some resources toward victim protection and local anti-trafficking groups. No suspected traffickers were charged, limiting the level of safety and protection that could be provided to victims. While the government took some tangible steps to raise awareness of human trafficking, including the establishment of focal point groups and an anti-trafficking task force, some local observers felt that the government discouraged discussions on developing effective strategies for combating this phenomenon of modern-day slavery."Guyana".

[[Human trafficking in Macau]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Macau, Crime in Macau, Human trafficking in China

The Macau Special Administrative Region (MSAR) of the People’s Republic of China is primarily a destination, and to a much lesser extent, a source territory for women and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically commercial sexual exploitation. Victims are primarily from the Chinese mainland, Mongolia, Russia, and Southeast Asia, with many of them from inland Chinese provinces who travel to the border province of Guangdong in search of better employment. There, they fall prey to false advertisements for jobs in casinos and other legitimate employment in Macau, but upon arrival, they are forced into prostitution. Foreign and mainland Chinese women are sometimes passed to local organized crime groups upon arrival, held captive, and forced into sexual servitude. Chinese, Russian, and Thai criminal syndicates are believed to sometimes be involved in bringing women into Macau’s commercial sex industry. Victims are sometimes confined in massage parlors and illegal brothels, where they are closely monitored, forced to work long hours, have their identity documents confiscated, and threatened with violence; all factors that make it particularly difficult for them to seek help. Macau is a source territory for women and girls who are subjected to forced prostitution elsewhere in Asia.
The MSAR does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government continued efforts to raise awareness about trafficking amongst officials and the general public. Authorities convicted one trafficking offender during the past year. However, authorities identified far fewer victims during the reporting period than in the previous year and victim identification and protection efforts need to be further improved. Macau has the resources and government infrastructure to make greater strides in combating trafficking."Macau". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010).

[[Human trafficking in the Republic of Macedonia]]

CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in the Republic of Macedonia, Crime in the Republic of Macedonia

Macedonia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to  trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor. Macedonian women and children are trafficked internally within the country. Women and girls from Albania, Bulgaria and Kosovo were reportedly subjected to forced prostitution or forced labor in Macedonia in 2009. Macedonian victims and victims transiting through Macedonia are subjected to forced prostitution or forced labor in  South Central and Western Europe. Children, primarily ethnic Roma, are subjected to forced begging by their parents or other relatives. Girls were subjected to conditions of forced labor in Macedonian bars and nightclubs. A small number of Macedonian men were allegedly subjected to forced labor in Azerbaijan. Traffickers continued to operate in more hidden, private sectors in an attempt to conceal their exploitation of victims from law enforcement.
The Government of Macedonia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government continued to strengthen its anti-trafficking framework and issued its first annual National Rapporteur’s report on trafficking. The government did not convict any trafficking offenders, identified fewer official trafficking victims, and did not provide funding to  NGOs for the care and assistance of foreign and domestic trafficking victims in Macedonia. The government did not prosecute any officials for trafficking specific crimes, but took significant strides in fighting trafficking-related corruption."Macedonia".

[[Human trafficking in Madagascar]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Madagascar, Crime in Madagascar

Madagascar is a source country for women and children subjected to human trafficking, specifically conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution. An estimated 6,000 Malagasy women are currently employed as domestic workers in Lebanon, with a smaller number in Kuwait. Many of these women come from rural areas and are often illiterate or poorly educated, making them more vulnerable to deception and abuse at the hands of recruitment agencies and employers. Detailed information regarding situations of forced labor and other abuses experienced by Malagasy domestic workers in Lebanon came to light during the year. Numerous trafficking victims returning to Madagascar reported harsh working conditions, physical violence, sexual harassment and assault, confinement to the home, confiscation of travel documents, and withholding of salaries. Eight deaths were reported among this population in 2009.
Children, mostly from rural areas, are subject to conditions of domestic servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, and forced labor in mining, fishing, and agriculture within the country. Most child trafficking occurs with the involvement of family members, but friends, transport operators, tour guides, and hotel workers also facilitate the enslavement of children. A child sex tourism problem exists in coastal cities, including Tamatave, Nosy Be, and Diego Suarez, as well as the capital city of Antananarivo; some children are recruited for work in the capital using fraudulent offers of employment as waitresses and maids before being forced into the commercial sex trade on the coast. The main sources of child sex tourists are France, Germany, and Switzerland. Parents sell young women into marriages, some of which are short-term, often for significant sums of money.
The Government of Madagascar does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Since the March 2009 coup, combating human trafficking has received little attention in Madagascar; the recent focus on the abuse of domestic workers in Lebanon has not resulted in any commensurate governmental response to the problem. The government’s anti-trafficking efforts were insufficient and decreased during the year – especially in the areas of prosecuting trafficking offenders, identifying and protecting victims, and raising public awareness of the problem – while the prevalence of officials’ complicity in human trafficking became more evident. Lack of political will, institutional capacity, and relevant training remained significant impediments to improved anti-trafficking performance, particularly impacting the effectiveness of law enforcement activities; the government failed to investigate or prosecute traffickers in 2009. Therefore, Madagascar is placed on Tier 2 Watch List."Madagascar". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). [tpl]PD-notice[/tpl]

Malawi is primarily a source country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution within the country and abroad. Most Malawian trafficking victims are exploited internally, though Malawian victims of sex and labor trafficking have also been identified in South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, and parts of Europe. To a lesser extent, Malawi is a transit point for foreign victims and a destination country for men, women, and children from Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe subjected to conditions of forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation. Within the country, some children are forced into domestic servitude, cattle herding, agricultural labor, and menial work in various small businesses. Exploited girls and women become “bar girls” at local bars and rest houses where they are coerced to have sex with customers in exchange for room and board. Forced labor in agriculture is often found on tobacco plantations. Labor traffickers are often villagers who have moved to urban areas and subsequently recruit children from their original villages through offers of good jobs. Brothel owners or other prostitution facilitators lure girls with promises of nice clothing and lodging. Upon arrival, they charge the girl high rental fees for these items and instruct her how to engage in prostitution to pay off the debt. South African and Tanzanian long-distance truck drivers and mini-bus operators move victims across porous borders by avoiding immigration checkpoints. Some local businesswomen who also travel regularly to neighboring countries to buy clothing for import have been identified as traffickers. Reports of European tourists paying for sex with teenage boys and girls continue.
The Government of Malawi does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. While the government maintained its efforts to ensure victims’ access to protective services and prevent trafficking, adults trafficked for sex or labor exploitation and children exploited in domestic servitude and prostitution still did not receive the same amount of care as children exploited in forced labor."Malawi".

CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Malaysia, Crime in Malaysia

Malaysia is a destination, and to a lesser extent, a source and transit country for women and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced prostitution and for men, women, and children who are in conditions of forced labor. The majority of trafficking victims are foreign workers who migrate willingly to Malaysia from Indonesia, Nepal, India, Thailand, China, the Philippines, Burma, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam in search of greater economic opportunities, some of whom subsequently encounter forced labor or debt bondage at the hands of their employers, employment agents, or informal labor recruiters. 
While many of Malaysia’s trafficking offenders are individual business people, large organized crime syndicates are also behind some of the trafficking of foreigners in Malaysia. A significant number of young women are recruited for work in Malaysian restaurants and hotels, some of whom migrate through the use of “Guest Relations Officer” visas, but subsequently are coerced into Malaysia’s commercial sex trade. Such women from China are nicknamed "China Dolls".[tpl]cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/1/21/nation/7844742&sec=nation |title=Even non-Chinese are falling for the charms of China Dolls |accessdate= 2011-01-23 |author=Chan Li Leen |date=2011-01-21 |work= |publisher=The Star, Malaysia |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthestar.com.my%2Fnews%2Fstory.asp%3Ffile%3D%2F2011%2F1%2F21%2Fnation%2F7844742%26sec%3Dnation&date=2011-01-23 |archivedate=2011-01-23 [/tpl] Many Malaysian labor outsourcing companies apparently recruited excess workers, who were then often subject to conditions of forced labor. Some Malaysian citizens are trafficked internally and abroad to Singapore, Hong Kong, France, and the United Kingdom for commercial sexual exploitation. There were approximately two million documented migrant workers in Malaysia in 2009, and an additional estimated 1.9 million who were undocumented. 
Many migrant workers in plantations, construction sites, textile factories, and employed as domestic workers throughout Malaysia experienced restrictions on movement, deceit and fraud in wages, passport confiscation, or debt bondage, which are practices indicative of trafficking. Some Malaysian employers reportedly did not pay their foreign domestic workers three to six months’ wages in order to recoup recruitment agency charges, making them vulnerable to trafficking. Refugees were particularly vulnerable to trafficking, and Malaysians from rural communities and indigenous groups were also vulnerable. The People's Volunteer Corps (RELA) continued to conduct raids targeting illegal migrant communities and detained refugees, asylum seekers, and trafficking victims along with allegedly illegal migrants and foreign prostitute.Malaysia is just like home for China prostitutes Some trafficking victims were locked up in warehouses or brothels. The Indonesian and Malaysian governments have not amended or replaced a 2006 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) covering the employment of Indonesian domestic workers in Malaysia, which authorizes Malaysian employers to confiscate and hold the passports of domestic employees.
The Government of Malaysia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Because the assessment that the government had made significant efforts is based in part on its commitments to undertake actions over the coming year – notably greater implementation of Malaysia’s anti-trafficking law against labor trafficking – Malaysia is placed on Tier 2 Watch List. The Malaysian government has shown a greater commitment to address human trafficking that is expected to lead to: increased investigations and prosecutions of labor trafficking offenses and identification of labor trafficking victims; increasing efforts to prosecute trafficking-related corruption by government officials; and greater collaboration with NGOs and international organizations to improve victim services in government shelters. During the reporting period, senior government officials, including the Prime Minister, publicly acknowledged Malaysia’s human trafficking problem, the government increased its investigations of trafficking cases and filed an increased number of criminal charges against traffickers, significantly expanded training of officials on the 2007 anti-trafficking law, conducted a public awareness campaign on human trafficking, opened three more shelters for trafficking victims, and launched a five-year national action plan on trafficking. Nevertheless, these early efforts will require continued attention, as there are many serious concerns remaining regarding trafficking in Malaysia, including the detention of trafficking victims in government facilities."Malaysia".

[[Human trafficking in the Maldives]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in the Maldives, Crime in the Maldives

The Maldives is primarily a destination country for migrant workers from Bangladesh, and, to a lesser extent, India, some of whom are subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor. Some women are also subjected to forced prostitution. An unknown number of the 110,000 foreign workers currently working in the Maldives – primarily in the construction and service sectors – face fraudulent recruitment practices, confiscation of identity and travel documents, withholding or non-payment of wages, or debt bondage. Thirty thousand of these workers do not have legal status in the country, though both legal and illegal workers were vulnerable to conditions of forced labor. Diplomatic sources estimate that half of the 35,000 Bangladeshis in the Maldives went there illegally and that most of these workers are probably victims of trafficking. Migrant workers pay $1,000 to $4,000 in recruitment fees in order to migrate to the Maldives; such high recruitment costs increase workers’ vulnerability to forced labor, as concluded in a recent ILO report.
A small number of women from Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, China, the Philippines, Eastern Europe, and former Soviet Union countries are recruited for forced prostitution in Male, the capital. A small number of underage Maldivian girls reportedly are trafficked to Male from other islands for involuntary domestic servitude; this is a corruption of the widely acknowledged practice where families send Maldivian girls to live with a host family in Male for educational purposes.
Trafficking offenders usually fall into three groups: families that subject domestic servants to forced labor; employment agents who bring low-skilled migrant workers to the Maldives under false terms of employment and upon payment of high fees; and employers who subject the migrants to conditions of forced labor upon arrival.
The Government of the Maldives does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, the government lacks systematic procedures for identifying victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations, and during the reporting period it did not investigate or prosecute trafficking-related offenses or take concrete actions to protect trafficking victims and prevent trafficking in the Maldives. Therefore, the Maldives is placed on Tier 2 Watch List. After 30 years of one-party rule, the new government – formed in 2009 – is continuing to build the institutions of democratic governance."Maldives". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010.

Mali is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor and, to a lesser extent, forced prostitution. Within Mali, women and girls are forced into domestic servitude and, to a limited extent, prostitution. Malian boys are found in conditions of forced begging and forced labor in gold mines and agricultural settings both within Mali and neighboring countries. Reports indicate that Malian children are trafficked to Senegal and Guinea for forced labor in gold mines and for forced labor on cotton and cocoa farms in Côte d'Ivoire. Boys from Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Niger and other countries are forced into begging and exploited for labor by religious instructors within Mali and across borders. Adult men and boys, primarily of Songhai ethnicity, are subjected to the longstanding practice of debt bondage in the salt mines of Taoudenni in northern Mali. Some members of Mali’s black Tamachek community are subjected to traditional slavery-related practices rooted in hereditary master-slave relationships.
The Government of Mali does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, such as assisting with the identification and rescue of 80 child trafficking victims and drafting new anti-trafficking legislation, the government failed to show evidence of progress in prosecuting and convicting trafficking offenders, and did not take action on five pending cases of traditional slavery.

Malta is likely a destination country for men subjected to forced labor as reflected by a report in 2009 that three Pakistani males were forced to work in Pakistani restaurants in Malta.

[[Human trafficking in Mauritania]]

CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Mauritania, Crime in Mauritania

Human trafficking in Mauritania is considered to be a controversial human rights issue.  Mauritania is a suspected source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Supposedly some women, men, and children from traditional slave castes are subjected to slavery-related practices, rooted in ancestral master-slave relationships, which continue to exist in a limited fashion in both rural and urban settings. These individuals, held for generations by slave-holding families, may be forced to work without pay as cattle herders and household help. Mauritanian and West African boys – referred to as talibes – are recruited to study at Koranic schools, but are sometimes subsequently subjected to forced begging within the country by religious teachers known as marabouts. Girls have been trafficked internally and from neighboring West African countries such as Mali, Senegal, and Gambia for involuntary domestic servitude. Mauritanian girls have been married off to wealthy men from the Middle East and taken there in some cases for forced prostitution. Mauritanian women are forced into prostitution within the country, as well as in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf.
The government of Mauritania does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. The government did not show evidence of significant progress in prosecuting and punishing trafficking offenders, protecting trafficking victims, and preventing new incidents of trafficking. Despite its acknowledgment of trafficking as a problem, the government is reluctant to acknowledge that de facto slavery currently exists in Mauritania, and prefers to talk about “the consequences of slavery.” The government has stated it is willing to take action, but does not have the necessary resources to fund needed services, such as shelters for trafficking victims, legal assistance, and training in life-skills and income generating activities. Certain government and civil society leaders have expressed a willingness to work with foreign partners to improve the country’s human rights record; however, in 2009, prosecutions of forced labor or forced prostitution offenses were nonexistent and no government programs were put in place to assist victims of such crimes. Therefore, Mauritania remains on Tier 3."Mauritania". Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). [tpl]PD-notice[/tpl]

[[Human trafficking in Mauritius]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking by country, Human rights in Mauritius, Crime in Mauritius

Mauritius is a source for children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced prostitution within the country. Secondary school-age girls and, to a lesser extent, younger girls from all areas of the country, including from Rodrigues Island, are induced into prostitution, often by their peers, family members, or businessmen offering other forms of employment. Taxi drivers are known to provide transportation and introductions for both the girls and the clients. Girls and boys whose mothers engage in prostitution are reportedly forced into prostitution at a young age. Some drug-addicted women are forced into prostitution by their boyfriends, who serve as their pimps. In Great Britain, two Malagasy nationals were convicted in 2009 of holding a small number of Mauritian nationals, as well as citizens of other countries, in conditions of forced labor; this appears to be an isolated case of transnational human trafficking involving Mauritian citizens.
The Government of Mauritius fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Mauritius sustained its strong efforts to identify, investigate, and prosecute incidences of trafficking during the reporting period. The Mauritius Police Force increased its offerings of anti-trafficking training programs for police officers and continued its awareness campaign in schools and villages. The government’s efforts to coordinate among all relevant ministries, however, remained lacking, leading to inconsistent provision of protective and investigative services to trafficking victims."Mauritius".

She ranked as high as #11 in the world in singles in 1976 and was the winner of four lesser titles on the WTA tour in Portland and South Florida, USA, and in Aukland and Wellington, New Zealand.  She won many doubles titles on the pro tour with several different partners including Ann Kiyomura, Brigitte Cuypers, Julie Anthony, Pam Teeguarden, Karen Krantscke, and Kerry Reid with whom she shared an Australian Open doubles title in 1977. She was a women's doubles and mixed doubles standout in World Team Tennis and was part of the #1 team in the league with Billie Jean King in 1975.
She was born in Marengo, Iowa, and grew up in Iowa City, Iowa, where she was coached for free by Dr. Don Klotz, Ph.D., the men's tennis coach at the University of Iowa.  She was one of the few high school girls in the country to receive a scholarship to college for tennis in the days before Title IX took effect. She graduated from Rollins College in Winter Park, FL, in 1971 with a degree in Behavioral Science before starting her pro tennis career.
She lives in Gilbert, Arizona with her husband, Terry Guerrant, whom she married in 1975.  They have one son, Daniel, born in 1982.  In 2005 they started the Guerrant Foundation which raises money to help the poorest of the world's poor through small loans to start businesses. The Guerrants have supported this effort with their own funds in addition to the money they have raised. They have helped thousands of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

[[Human trafficking in Mexico]]
CATEGORIES: Human trafficking in Mexico, Human trafficking by country

Mexico is a large source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor. Government and NGO statistics suggest that the magnitude of forced labor surpasses that of forced prostitution in Mexico. Groups considered most vulnerable to human trafficking in Mexico include women, children, indigenous persons, and undocumented migrants. Mexican women, girls, and boys are subjected to sexual servitude within the United States and Mexico, lured by false job offers from poor rural regions to urban, border, and tourist areas. Mexican trafficking victims were also subjected to conditions of forced labor in domestic servitude, street begging, and construction in both the United States and Mexico. In one case, 107 trafficking victims, both Mexican and foreign citizens, were freed from a factory disguised as a drug rehabilitation center in Mexico City; many of them had been kidnapped, and all were subjected to forced labor.
The vast majority of foreign victims in forced labor and sexual servitude in Mexico are from Central America, particularly Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador; many transit Mexico en route to the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Western Europe. However, trafficking victims from South America, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa are also found in Mexico, and some transit the country en route to the United States. Unaccompanied Central American minors, traveling through Mexico to meet family members in the United States, fall victim to human traffickers, particularly near the Guatemalan border. Mexican men and boys from Southern Mexico are found in conditions of forced labor in Northern Mexico, and Central Americans, especially Guatemalans, are subjected to forced labor in southern Mexico, particularly in agriculture. Child sex tourism continues to grow in Mexico, especially in tourist areas such as Acapulco and Cancun, and northern border cities like Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Most child sex tourists are from the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, although some are Mexican citizens. In addition to Mexican drug cartels, organized crime networks from around the world are reportedly involved in human trafficking in Mexico.
The Government of Mexico does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Mexican authorities increased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts and achieved the first convictions under the 2007 anti-trafficking law, in addition to opening a government-funded shelter dedicated to sex trafficking victims. The Secretariat of Government assumed more active leadership of the interagency trafficking commission and the Mexican Congress created its own trafficking commission. Given the magnitude of the trafficking problem, however, the number of human trafficking investigations and convictions remained low. While Mexican officials recognize human trafficking as a serious problem, NGOs and government representatives report that some local officials tolerate and are sometimes complicit in trafficking, impeding implementation of anti-trafficking statues."Mexico".

Vladislav Hall is a large room within the Prague Castle complex in the Czech Republic, used for large public events of the Bohemian monarchy and the modern Czech state.  Built between 1493–1502 by Benedikt Rejt during the reign of Vladislav II, the hall was the largest secular space (62m x 16m x 13m) in medieval PragueWatkin, David. A history of Western architecture. Laurence King Publishing, 2005. p. 191   and belongs to the most complex structural and architectural spaces of the late Middle Ages.  In particular, the construction of the complex stone vaulting system, spanning 16m, was a refined engineering feat.  The third and highest floor of the palace, the hall replaced a group of rooms dating from the 14th century.  Immediately underneath, the second floor is a Gothic  addition built during the reign of Charles IV in the 14th century, while the lowest, first floor is a Romanesque palace.    
The hall was used for banquets, receptions, coronations, and other events of the Bohemian court.

CATEGORIES: Liquids, Fluid dynamics, Volumetric instruments, Mechanical engineering

Liquid level floats, also known as float balls, are spherical, cylindrical, oblong or similarly shaped objects, made from either rigid or flexible material, that are buoyant in water and other liquids. They are non-electrical hardware frequently used as visual sight-indicators for surface demarcation and level measurement. They may also be incorporated into switch mechanisms or translucent fluid-tubes as a component in monitoring or controlling liquid level.
Liquid level floats, or float switches, use the principle of material buoyancy (differential densities) to follow fluid levels. Solid floats are often made of plastics with a density less than water or other application liquid, and so they float. Hollow floats filled with air are much less dense than water or other liquids, and are appropriate for some applications.[tpl]cite web|title=Learn More About Liquid Level Floats|url=http://www.globalspec.com/LearnMore/Sensors_Transducers_Detectors/Level_Sensing/Liquid_Level_Floats|publisher=globalspec.com[/tpl]
Stainless Steel Magnetic floats are tubed magnetic floats, used for reed switch activation; they have a hollow tubed connection running through them. These magnetic floats have become standard equipment where strength, corrosion resistance and buoyancy are necessary. They are manufactured by welding two drawn half shells together. The welding process is critical for the strength and durability of the float. The weld is a full penetration weld providing a smoothly finished seam, hardly distinguishable from the rest of the float surface.[tpl]cite web|title=Mechanical & Magnetic Floats|url=http://www.deeter.co.uk/products/mechanical-magnetic-floats|publisher=deeter.co.uk[/tpl]

[[KZTC-LP]]

CATEGORIES: Television stations in San Diego, California, Channel 7 low-power TV stations in the United States, Television channels and stations established in 1990

KZTC-LP is a low-power television station in San Diego, California which operates on analog channel 7, and holds a construction permit for a digital signal on channel 25. KZTC-LP transmits from Mount Woodson, northeast of Poway, and serves mainly the northwest portion of coastal San Diego County. Its signal can also be seen in other parts of east county San Diego, albeit with some interference. When the station is on the air with its VHF signal on channel 7, it blocks Los Angeles television station, KABC-TV, which has a digital signal on channel 7 which can be received when KZTC is off the air for whatever reason.  The station went from airing infomercials to rebroadcasting MundoFox from XHDTV 49.2 (San Diego), operated by Entravision Communication, which also owns XETV Channel 6 in San Diego.
The station's schedule consists of paid programming seven-days a week, twenty-four hours a day. The station's owner, Civic Light Television, claims to have operated low power television operations in the San Diego area since 1990, when the FCC began to authorize television stations of that type. While KZTC's license goes back to 1990 when it operated on UHF channel 63 as "Bay 63" (with the call sign K63EN), it moved to analog VHF channel 7 in July 2010 in order to vacate the defunct channel 52-69 channel space in the Federal Communications Commission UHF revised bandplan.
"Bay 63" originally operated from a small suite in a medical arts building at 2850 6th Avenue in the Hillcrest district of downtown San Diego, adjacent to Balboa Park. The station showed San Diego City Council proceedings and other public domain shows. It was an affiliate of the "Shop At Home" network during the time it operated from downtown San Diego.  Because the station operated from the top floor of the building, it was also known for broadcasting nightly the sun setting off San Diego Bay.  The station attempted to gain commercial traction by being carried by the predominant San Diego cable TV operator, Cox Communications. But those attempts were unsuccessful despite petition drives and ads put in the local TV listing magazine at the time published in the Sunday edition of the San Diego Union-Tribune.

The Cape Colony (Dutch: Kaapkolonie) was between 1652 and 1691 a commandment, and between 1691 and 1795 a governorate of the Dutch East India Company. The colony was founded by Jan van Riebeeck as a re-supply and layover port for vessels of the Dutch East India Company trading with Asia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://vocsite.nl/geschiedenis/handelsposten/kaap.html |title=Kaap de Goede Hoop |author= |date= |work= |publisher=De VOC site |accessdate=8 February 2013[/tpl] Much to the dismay of the rulers of the Dutch East India Company, who were primarily interested in making profit from the Asian trade, the colony rapidly expanded into a settler colony in the years after its founding.
Being the only permanent settlement of the Dutch East India Company not serving as a trading post, it proved an ideal retirement place for employees of the company. After several years of service in the company, employees could lease a piece of land in the colony as a Vryburgher ("free citizen"), on which they had to cultivate crops that they had to sell to the Dutch East India Company for a fixed price. As these farms were labour-intensive, Vryburghers imported slaves from Madagascar, Mozambique and Asia, which rapidly increased the number of inhabitants. After Louis XIV of France revoked the Edict of Nantes (October 1685), which had protected the right of Huguenots in France to practice their religion without persecution from the state, the colony attracted many Huguenot settlers, who eventually mixed with the general Vryburgher population.
Due to the authoritarian rule of the Company, telling farmers what to grow for what price, controlling immigration, and monopolising trade, some farmers tried to escape the rule of the company by moving further inland. The Company, in an effort to control these migrants, established a magistracy at Swellendam in 1745 and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and declared the Gamtoos River as the eastern frontier of the colony, only to see the Trekboere cross it soon afterwards. In order to avoid collision with the Bantu tribes advancing south and west from east central Africa, the Dutch agreed in 1780 to make the Great Fish River the boundary of the colony.
In 1795, the colony was occupied by the British, after the Battle of Muizenberg. Under the terms of the Peace of Amiens of 1802, the colony was returned to the Dutch on 1 March 1803, but as the Dutch East India Company had since been nationalized, the colony was ruled directly by the Batavian Republic. The return was not to last long, however, as the breaking out of Napoleonic Wars invalidated the Peace of Amiens. In January 1806, the colony was occupied for a second time by the British after the Battle of Blaauwberg. This transfer was confirmed in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.

City of Brea (where the landfill is situated) alone provides about 30% of the total daily refuse deposited at the facility.
The landfill was opened in 1960. The facility is owned by Orange County and it is operated by Orange County Waste & Recycling Department (formerly County of Orange Integrated Waste Management Department). 
Currently the landfill is scheduled to close in December 2021. Plans for postponement of landfill's closure by expansion of its area further into Carbon Canyon just west of Brea Olinda High School were cancelled in 1996 as Land and Water Conservation Fund decided to incorporate adjacent federal lands into Chino Hills State Park, rather than to dedicate it for landfill enlargement. After landfill closure the site will be landscaped to become part of Chino Hills State Park.

CATEGORIES: Asymmetric-key algorithms, Modular arithmetic, Logarithms, Computational hardness assumptions, World records

Discrete logarithm records are the best results achieved to date in solving the discrete logarithm problem, which is the problem of finding solutions x to the equation gx = h given elements g and h of a finite cyclic group G.  The difficulty of this problem is the basis for the security of several cryptographic systems, including Diffie–Hellman key agreement, ElGamal encryption, the ElGamal signature scheme, the Digital Signature Algorithm, and the elliptic curve cryptography analogs of these.  Common choices for G used in these algorithms include the multiplicative group of integers modulo p, the multiplicative group of a finite field, and the group of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field.

[[KHL territorial pick]]
CATEGORIES: Kontinental Hockey League

A KHL territorial pick is a special type of draft pick used in the KHL Junior Draft. A Kontinental Hockey League team could protect up to 3 players from its Minor Hockey League affiliate or its hockey school(s) and use its first-round pick to draft one of its protected players.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.russianhockeyfans.com/khl/2010-khl-entry-draft-199.html|title=2010 KHL Entry Draft|date=|accessdate=December 30, 2010|work=russianhockeyfans.com|publisher=Russian Hockey Fans[/tpl]
However, unlike the NBA territorial picks, where NBA teams used territorial draft picks sparsely, KHL teams frequently used such picks to keep local talent. Also, in the KHL, the territorial draft picks are factored into the overall selection count. As such, a KHL team can draft more than one territorial pick; it happened in 2010 when Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, as well as Traktor Chelyabinsk used their two first-round draft picks on territorial picks.
For 2012, the rules have changed: now a team could protect up to 5 players and use any pick, regardless of round, to select them, unless entering the disaster draft, in which case a team can protect as many players as they want for the five years following the disaster draft.

Albert Sherman Osborn is considered the father of the science of questioned document examination in North America.
His seminal book Questioned Documents was first published in 1910 and later heavily revised as a second edition in 1929. Other publications, including The Problem of Proof (1922), The Mind of the Juror (1937) and Questioned Document Problems (1944), were widely acclaimed by both the legal profession and by public and private laboratories concerned with matters involving questioned documents.
Osborn is also known for founding the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners (ASQDE) on September 2, 1942. In 1913 Osborn began inviting select practitioners to informal educational gatherings hosted in his home and those meetings eventually led to formation of the ASQDE.  He became the society's first president and was involved intimately with the discipline and Society until his death four years later.
In the film J. Edgar (2011), Osborn is played by actor Denis O'Hare.

The Fatal Frame (a.k.a. Project Zero) survival horror video game franchise features a cast of interconnected characters, both alive and dead. Most of the series' deceased characters appear as ghosts; the common causes for them are failed dark Shinto rituals, which all lead to disastrous events. These spirits include those who died at the time of disaster (e.g. Ryozo Munakata); or those who become cursed, trapped and killed in the same place at a later time (e.g. Junsei Takamine). Some characters, such as Miku Hinasaki and the Amakura twins, have subsequent roles in latter installments of the series.

Elrington Ball|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl] was an Irish politician, Solicitor-General, and Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). He is mainly remembered for the crushing remark by Daniel O'Connell that McClelland was never an example to the profession either as a barrister or a judge.
He was the son of James McClelland of Millmount, County Down. He attended Dublin University, entered Middle Temple in 1787, and was called to the Irish Bar in 1790. He became the Member of Parliament for Randalstown in 1798, and was appointed as Solicitor-General in 1801, as a reward for his support for the Act of Union 1801. He was raised to the Bench in 1803 as Baron of the Exchequer, (rather against his own wishes, since at 35 he felt he was too young), and served to his retirement in 1830. He married Charlotte Thompson of County Louth in 1797. They are buried at Ballymascanlon, where a memorial  was erected to them.
In 1819 he was accused of  judicial misconduct in ordering soldiers to clear his courtroom: but the House of Commons decided not to pursue the mater, since the allegations, even if true, did not amount to evidence of corruption.Volcansek, Mary L.  Judicial Misconduct- a Cross-National Comparison  University of Florida Press 1996 p.76
Daniel' O'Connell, who despised most of the Irish judges of his time, had a particularly low opinion of McClelland. Although no precise date can be given, historians generally accept as true the story that McClelland saw O'Connell sitting in Court in a case he was not briefed in, in the apparent hope that a younger barrister would ask him to assist. McClelland said that he had never behaved so as a barrister: O'Connell sternly replied that McClelland had never been his model as  a barrister, and he did not propose to take directions from him as a judge.O'Faolain, Sean  King of the Beggars-a life of Daniel O'Connell   1938 Mercier Press Edition p.97

The General Congregation of the Anatolian Turkish Orthodox (in Turkish Umum Anadolu Türk Ortodoksları Cemaatleri) was a pro-Turkish nationalist Orthodox Christian group set up in 1922 and mainly active in the Turkish-speaking, Orthodox Christian Karamanlides population of central Anatolia.The Political Role of the Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate (so-called)  Unlike most Greek Orthodox Christians, they identified themselves as Turkish rather than Greek and supported Kemal Ataturk.Page 58, The last dragoman: the Swedish orientalist Johannes Kolmodin as scholar, Elisabeth Özdalga
At the time, it had support from the Orthodox Bishop of Havza, as well as a number of other congregations.Page 152, The last dragoman: the Swedish orientalist Johannes Kolmodin as scholar, Elisabeth Özdalga  There were calls to establish a new Patriarchate for Turkish-speaking Christians with Turkish as the language of worship.
In 1924, the Autocephalous Orthodox Patriarchate of Anatolia was founded in Kayseri by Pavlos Karahisarithis (Papa Eftim), one of its supporters - who was to later introduce Turkish into the liturgy.  Due to the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, most of the congregation of this church were deported to Greece and it is now mainly centred around the family of the original patriarch Papa Eftim I, patriarch of Autocephalous Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate, also known as the Turkish Orthodox Church.

"Hold It Against Me" is a song by American recording artist Britney Spears, released as the first single from her seventh studio album, Femme Fatale. It was written and produced by Max Martin, Dr. Luke and Billboard, with additional writing by Bonnie McKee. Luke explained that he wanted "Hold It Against Me" to sound unlike his previous productions. The song was originally offered to Katy Perry, but Luke and Martin felt that it did not suit her. A demo version of the track by McKee was leaked on January 6, 2011, and the single became available for streaming on January 10, 2011. It was released the following day.
Musically, "Hold It Against Me" blends pulsating industrial and trance beats with elements of grime. The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats. The song features a dubstep-influenced breakdown, in which Spears moans and blows kisses, and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, and the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit "If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized. McKee stated in an interview that the title was inspired by a discussion she had with Katy Perry about the latter's body.[tpl]cite news|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|title=Gimme Five: Bonnie McKee's Best Pop Star Stories|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5657568/gimme-five-bonnie-mckees-best-pop-star-stories|accessdate=April 8, 2014|magazine=Billboard (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Billboard|date=August 15, 2013[/tpl]
Most reviewers praised "Hold It Against Me", although some criticized its lyrical content. The song debuted at number one in Belgium (Wallonia), Canada, Denmark, Finland and New Zealand, as well as on the US Billboard Hot 100, where it became her fourth chart topper. In the United States, "Hold It Against Me" made Spears the second artist in Billboard[tpl]'[/tpl]s history to debut at number one more than once, behind Mariah Carey. "Hold It Against Me" was Spears's second consecutive single to debut at number one. The feat also made her the third female artist to score number one singles in three consecutive decades, and the seventh artist overall. In 2012, it was voted the best song to reach the top position on the Hot 100 over the past two years. The single has also charted in the top five in countries such as Australia, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Finland and Norway.
The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Jonas Åkerlund. It premiered on February 17, 2011, following a two-week promotional campaign of teasers. The video features Spears as a pop star who fell from space to find fame on Earth. There, she becomes overwhelmed by the pressures of being a celebrity and breaks down. The video received mixed to positive reviews; critics complimented its artistic concept and visuals, but dismissed the use of product placement. Spears performed "Hold It Against Me" at Rain Nightclub, Good Morning America and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. She has also performed it as the opening number of the Femme Fatale Tour (2011).

A number of the world's largest wind turbines were developed and tested under this pioneering program. The program was an attempt to leap well beyond the then-current state of the art of wind turbine generators, and was largely unsuccessful in development of commercial machines. The development of the commercial industry however was delayed by a significant decrease in competing energy prices during the 1980s.

St. John the Baptist Catholic Church is a historic Roman Catholic church in Beloit, Kansas, United States. The church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Architect Joseph Marshall of Topeka, Kansas drew the church plan and design, closely based on the cruciform basilica in a mix of Romanesque and Gothic styles that occur often in Germany and the area of Alsace-Lorraine. The construction uses local Post Rock limestone with Indiana limestone trim at the belt course, doors, and windows. Three flying buttresses on each long wall provide stability to the nave walls and the stone arches above the nave. At the bases of each arch, an immense Vermont granite pillar connects the arch to the foundation and separates the nave from the side aisles. The symmetrical towers are positioned on either side of the nave, and provide separate entry to the side aisles. The sanctuary is a semicircle with a diameter that is the width of the nave, constructed of five pointed arches. The pointed-arch ceilings are built within the pointed roof, made entirely of stone taken from the original church building that the structure replaced.http://www.skyways.org/towns/Beloit/sjtbcc.html
Dimensions:http://www.kshs.org/resource/national_register/nominationsNRDB/Mitchell_StJohntheBaptistCatholicChurchNR.pdf 
The majority of the quarry, delivery, and rock trimming was performed by local farmers under the guidance of the parish pastor, Monsignor Michael Heitz (born in Strasbourg, Alsace-Lorraine, France, date unknown; died 7 February 1941),http://salinadiocese.org/home/sdnb/doc_view/652-priests-necrology-for-the-diocese-of-salina who had learned to dress stone from professional stonemasons. Building the foundation and full-length crypt began late in 1900; the cornerstone was laid and blessed by Bishop John F. Cunningham (died 23 June 1919) on 4 June 1901. As work progressed around it, the old church was torn down in March 1901. Construction was completed in 1904.http://www.kshs.org/resource/national_register/nominationsNRDB/Mitchell_StJohntheBaptistCatholicChurchNR.pdf

The Parti progressiste conservateur du Québec (Eng: Progressive Conservative Party of Quebec) was formed in 1982 with Denis Carignan as leader but was rebuffed by federal Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark who told them to keep their distance.
The party was dormant until January 1985 when Carignan stepped aside to allow André Asselin, a lawyer, mayor of the small town of Ste-Émilie-de-l'Énergie, and president of the Quebec Union of Regional Municipal Councils, to become party leader. However, Brian Mulroney told the press following a meeting with Quebec Liberal Party leader Robert Bourassa that he did not support the creation of a provincial Conservative Party at the time. By the 1980s, the conservative Union Nationale was no longer a contender for office and in terminal decline - though it rebuffed an offer by Asselin for a merger with his Conservative Party. After making an impression in a June 1985 by-election in which Asselin placed second with 30% of the vote in L'Assomption, the party nominated 48 candidates for the December 1985 provincial election but failed to make a major impact, receiving 1.03% popular vote. Asselin blamed the party's poor showing on what he called deliberate sabotage by federal Tory officials who discouraged Conservatives from giving money or otherwise becoming identified with the provincial group.
Asselin resigned as party leader in 1989 leaving Robert Coppenrath to lead the party into the 1989 election where it ran 12 candidates and received 0.14% of the vote. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, the party disbanded shortly afterward.

Henry H. Crocker (January 20, 1839 – January 1, 1913) was a Union Army officer during the American Civil War. He received the Medal of Honor for gallantry during the Battle of Cedar Creek fought near Middletown, Virginia on October 19, 1864. The battle was the decisive engagement of Major General Philip Sheridan’s Valley Campaigns of 1864 and was the largest battle fought in the Shenandoah Valley.
When the war broke out Crocker was living in San Francisco, California. He joined one hundred other pro-Union California men who returned east to fight. The so-called “California Hundred” were organized as a cavalry troop and sent via ship to Camp Meigs in Massachusetts. There they were designated Company A and joined by seven cavalry companies from Massachusetts to form the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry. Crocker eventually became captain of Company F, and mustered out in July 1865. NJ Medal of Honor recipients

Al-Mukhtar al-Qasim (d. 956) was an imam of the Zaidi state in Yemen, who held or claimed power from 936 to 956.
Al-Qasim bin Ahmad was the eldest son of the imam an-Nasir Ahmad who died in 934. An-Nasir's death ushered into a period of internal political turbulence among the Zaidis of highland Yemen. His third son al-Muntakhab al-Hasan demanded the imamate, but the latter's elder brother al-Mukhtar al-Qasim lodged counterclaims.Enzyklopädie des Islam, Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 1216. Al-Muntakhab died in 936. However, a younger brother called al-Mansur Yahya is recognized by Zaidi historiography as the legitimate successor of an-Nasir after 934; he was supported by the majority of the Zaidis after al-Muntakhab's death.Cesare Ansaldi, Il Yemen nella storia e nella leggenda. Roma 1933, p. 130. In 956, al-Mukhtar al-Qasim, who ruled from his base in Sa'dah, was able to seize the important commercial and political centre San'a, which had hitherto mostly belonged to the rival Yu'firid Dynasty. However, before the year was over, al-Mukhtar was murdered by a powerful lord from Hamdan, Muhammad bin ad-Dahhak. With his death, San'a temporarily reverted to the Yafurids.H.C.

The Kingdom of Tahiti was founded by paramount chief Pōmare I, who, with the aid of English missionaries and traders, and European weaponry, unified the islands of Tahiti, Moʻorea, Tetiaroa, Mehetia and at its peak included the Tuamotus, Tubuai, Raivavae and other islands of eastern Polynesia.  Their leaders were Christian following the baptism of Pomare II.  Their progressive rise and recognition by Europeans allowed Tahiti to remain free from a planned Spanish colonization, as well as English and earlier French claims to the islands.  The Kingdom was one of a number of independent Polynesian states in Oceania, alongside Raiatea, Huahine, Bora Bora, Hawaii, Samoa, Tonga, Rarotonga, and Niue in the 19th century.  They are known for bringing a period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity to the islands over the reign of the five Tahitian monarchs.
Tahiti and its dependencies were made a French protectorate in 1842, and largely annexed as a colony of France in 1880. The monarchy was abolished by France shortly thereafter, though there are still pretenders and many Tahitians still wish for a return of the monarchy, some of whom claim that the act of abolishing the monarchy was either outright illegal, or outside of certain jurisdictions.[tpl]dubious|date=March 2013[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

Following a suggestion by Georges Besançon, the secretary of the Ae.C.F., the first eight French aviator's licences were awarded on 7 January 1910 to Louis Blériot, Leon Delagrange, Robert Esnault-Pelterie, Henry Farman, Alberto Santos-Dumont, Captain Ferdinand Ferber and Orville and Wilbur Wright.

These aviation pioneers had amply demonstrated their abilities and they were therefore not required to pass a test in order to receive a licence.  Further licences were awarded on 17 August to
Hubert Latham and Louis Paulhan, on 16 September to Paul Tissandier, on 7 October 1909 to Jean Gobron, Charles de Lambert and Glenn Curtiss, and on 18 November to Maurice Farman and Henri Rougier.

The L&N Station is a former rail passenger station in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States, located in the downtown area at the northern end of the World's Fair Park.  Built in 1905 by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the station was renovated for use in the 1982 World's Fair, and is currently home to the Knox County STEM Academy.Lydia McCoy, "STEM School Classes Start on Monday at Former Knoxville Train Station," Knoxville New Sentinel, 14 August 2011.  Retrieved: 15 August 2011. In 1982, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its architecture and role in Knoxville's transportation history.
The L&N completed a rail line running from Cincinnati to Atlanta in the early 1900s, and built a string of passenger stations and depots to service trains along this line.  The company's Knoxville station was the city's largest, and considered by some the "finest" along the L&N's entire Cincinnati–Atlanta line.  It served as a passenger station until the L&N ceased passenger train service to Knoxville in 1968, and continued to house L&N offices until 1975.  The L&N Station is mentioned in several scenes in author James Agee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, A Death in the Family.James Agee, A Death in the Family (New York: McDowell, Obolensky, 1957), pp. 17, 41, 218-219.

[[Al-Mansur Yahya]]
CATEGORIES: Rulers of Yemen, Yemeni imams, Zaidi imams, Yemeni people, 976 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Al-Mansur Yahya (died 976) was an imam of the Zaidi state in Yemen, whose tenure as imam is counted from 934 to 976.
Yahya bin Ahmad was the fifth son of the imam an-Nasir Ahmad, and the grandson of the founder-imam al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya. Even before the death of an-Nasir in 934, three of his sons quarreled bitterly among themselves. Although the Zaidi imamship was not strictly hereditary but depended on personal qualifications and descent from Muhammad, succession tended to take place within particular families descended from al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860) and his grandson al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya (d. 911). Two sons of an-Nasir, al-Muntakhab al-Hasan (d. 936) and al-Mukhtar al-Qasim (d. 956), contested the dignity.Enzyklopädie des Islam, Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 1216. None of them is recognized as a right imam in later Zaidi chronicles. Their younger brother al-Mansur Yahya is, on the other hand, counted as imam from 934 to his death in 976. The internal dissension among the Zaydiyyah was accentuated by the behaviour of the tribal groups of the northern Yemeni highlands, which supported one side or the other according to their interests. Few details are otherwise known about al-Mansur Yahya, and the politics of highland Yemen were dominated by the rival Yu'firid Dynasty. Personally he was remembered as a man of learning who conveyed much of the religious tradition of his father and grandfather.Wilferd Madelung, Der Imam al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim und die Glaubeslehre der Zaiditen. Berlin 1965, p. 194. At his demise, the imam was succeeded by his son ad-Da'i Yusuf.Robert W. Stookey, Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic. Boulder 1978, p. 97.

CATEGORIES: Politics of Israel, Human rights in Israel, Housing in Israel, Multiracial affairs in Asia, 2010 in Israel

In December 2010, two open letters signed by rabbis in Israel generated heated controversy within and outside the country.
The first letter was a psak din (religious ruling) signed by an estimated 50 rabbis, urged Israeli landowners not to rent to Arabs or other non-Jews.http://www.nif.org/media-center/nif-in-the-news/the-psak-english-hebrew.pdf The second letter, signed by at least 27 rebbetzins (rabbis' wives) and released on December 28 by Lehava, urged young Jewish women not to date Arabs or even to work at locations where non-Jews might be present.
The initiator of the rabbis' letter was the chief rabbi of Safed Shmuel Eliyahu.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4007553,00.html Eliyahu was summoned to an Israeli police interrogation on January 2, 2011, on suspicion of incitement to racism, a crime in Israel,http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4008037,00.html but refused to answer the summons.http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/01/02/2742379/safed-rabbi-refuses-police-summons-over-anti-arab-letterhttp://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4007187,00.html
Many of the rabbis who signed the letter are "local rabbis," in charge of religious services provided by their municipality; they are state employees and receive taxpayer salaries. Among the signers were rabbis from Rishon LeZion, Ramat HaSharon, Herzliya, Kfar Saba and Holon (all suburbs of Tel Aviv), Jerusalem, and other towns and settlements.Promised Land » Blog Archive » 50 Israeli Rabbis issue ruling forbidding renting of homes to Arabs

Zarka or zarqa (Hebrew: זַרְקָא֮, with variant English spellings)  is a cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. It is usually found together with the Segol, with a Munach preceding either or both. The symbol for a Zarka is a 90 degrees rotated, inverted S.Chanting the Hebrew Bible By Joshua R. Jacobson, page 61 The Hebrew word זַרְקָא֮ translates into English as scatterer, since it is a scattering of notes.

[tpl]cite news|last=Segal|first=Julie|title=Win Neuger's Winning Ways|url=http://business.highbeam.com/435607/article-1G1-183115363/win-neuger-winning-ways|accessdate=29 January 2013|newspaper=Institutional Investor|date=July–August 2008[/tpl] Win Jay Neuger (age about 60 in 2008) was the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and Director at AIG Global Investment Corp and then CEO of Pinebridge Investments. In March 2010, with the support of Neuger and his team, AIG sold its Global Investment Corporation renamed PineBridge Investments with Neuger as CEO to Bridge Partners. Bridge Partners, in turn, belongs to Pacific Century Group, an Asia-based investment firm, established by Richard Li.
Neuger is the son of a public relations executive and grew up in the middle-class Minneapolis suburb of Edina. Neuger received an M.B.A. from Dartmouth’s Amos Tuck Graduate School of Business and an A.B. from Dartmouth College. He then went to work for Northwestern National Bank (now Wells Fargo) and eventually ran the fixed income business. Then in 1982, he left to be the chief investment officer at Western Asset Management (now Legg Mason). In 1984, he moved to Banker's Trust on a "rescue mission as BT was bleeding assets as a result of poor performance."[tpl]cite news|last=Segal|first=Julie|title=Winning ways[/tpl] Neuger eventually went on to run fixed income and equities and then moved into new areas such as structured products.
In 1995, he joined AIG, where he came to oversee its global investment portfolio and "to bring AIG's far-flung investment organizations under one roof and build a money manager for outside clients using the same infrastructure."  "Formally launched in 2001, AIG Investments highlighting its services as 'investor to investor', meaning that clients would be investing alongside one of the world's preeminent insurance companies.".  "Neuger built a profitable and innovative investment business" ... "that attracted clients from around the world." In seven years, Neuger had grown AIG Investments into a company with $753 billion of assets, of which $128 billion was outside clients. Neuger focused on building the alternative business of hedge funds and private equity both in developed markets and emerging markets into an alternative business of $46 billion and $23 billion of real estate. The company had 45 asset management offices around the world, spanning Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and USA. The local "on-the ground" presence in global markets gave the company a substantial competitive advantage in attracting assets and large institutional investors.
With the financial turmoil and the crisis of the parent, Neuger recognized the need for an independent asset management company and hence led a treasury-supported auction on the sale of AIG Investments. Some financial journalists, however, such as Matthew Taibbi in his book Griftopia (ISBN 978-0-385-52996-9, pages 102–123), laid a substantial portion of the liquidity crisis at AIG directly on Neuger's doorstep. Reportedly, in his desire to increase profits, Neuger directed his unit to invest in mortgage-backed securities, using collateral from securities lending.Actually, It Might Be All Win Neuger's Fault AIG Collapsed, Not Goldman Sach's, July 9, 2010
Due to its diversified asset class and operations in numerous countries, the auction was very well received[tpl]Clarify|date=November 2013[/tpl] and the business was eventually sold to Pacific Century Group. The sale of AIG Investments which was one of the early contributors to the repayment of the loan that had been extended to AIG by the United States Federal Government, a debt that has now been paid in full. Neuger went on to lead the new company Pinebridge Investments (a name recognizing its roots to 70 Pine Street, headquarters of AIG Inc) as the CEO. He eventually retired as the Vice Chairman of the company in 2013, after building a global asset manager in approximately 20 years.
Win Neuger is also involved with many philanthropic causes and was the Co-Chair of the Board of Directors of Youth, I.N.C. which in 2011 was honored to recognize him at its annual gala.  Steve K. Orr, Executive Director and Founder, noted, "Win's passion and drive to build Youth, I.N.C. into a first class organization has been transformational and has impacted the lives of innumerable city youth."  Neuger is the Treasurer and Finance Chair on the Board of the Robert Toigo Foundation, serves on the Investment Committee of the Margaret A. Cargill Foundation, and is on the Board of Overseers at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.

Heroes World was acquired by Marvel Comics in late 1994 to act as the publisher's sole distributor. This ill-fated move, combined with other marketplace factors of the time, resulted in the financial failure of many other comics distributors and retailers — and the near collapse of the entire North American comic book market.

[[Inner Ring Road, Berlin]]

CATEGORIES: Streets in Berlin, Ring roads in Germany

The Inner Ring Road of Berlin (German: Berliner Innenstadtring) ist a route of major roads around the historic center of Berlin encompassing the boroughs Mitte, Pankow and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. The ring road is named Inner because of the (incomplete) ring road motorway named the City Ring Road as well as the larger Berlin Orbital.
The ring road runs from Berlin Main Station clockwise along  Invalidenstraße, Caroline-Michaelis-Straße, Julie-Wolfthorn-Straße, Bernauer Straße, Eberswalder Straße, Danziger Straße, Petersburger Straße, Warschauer Straße, Am Oberbaum (Oberbaumbrücke), Oberbaumstraße, Skalitzer Straße, Gitschiner Straße, Hallesches Ufer und Reichpietschufer (westbound) / Waterloo-Ufer, Tempelhofer Ufer, Schöneberger Ufer (eastbound) and finally back to the main station via the Tiergarten tunnel.
In the southern and eastern part the route is identical with the historic customs city wall that was begirding the Old Berlin until 1861. The city wall had roads along its length so that after the wall was torn down it opened spaces similar to a boulevard. In the western part there had been the Entlastungsstraße road cut through the Great Tiergarten park to avoid the places around the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag by about a mile. In the northern part the route takes advantage of one of the Hobrecht-Plan ring roads which runs considerably more outside of the Old Berlin limits so that there is no historic connection from Invalidenstraße to Bernauer Straße. The open space at Bernauer Straße is a consequence of the Berlin Wall which led to old buildings along the street to be torn down.
Rebuilding the Invalidenstraße into a major road is the only thing left to close the Inner Ring Road. It was supposed to be finished in 2002 when the new main station had opened but it was blocked by court decision. It was left until end of December 2010 that finally all trials were dismissed and the court approved the plan which will rebuild the street into four lanes plus tram rail tracks and bicycle lanes.http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article1489700/Invalidenstrasse-wird-vierspurig-ausgebaut.html The senator announced that construction will start in spring of 2011 but one can not expect the new road to open before the mid of 2013.http://stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/aktuell/pressebox/archiv_volltext.shtml?arch_1012/nachricht4170.html Berlin's urban planning department expects the last of three phases to be finished during 2015.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/strassenbau/invalidenstr/de/vorhaben.shtml|title=Straßen und Brücken für Berlin: Verkehrsverbindung Nordbahnhof - Hauptbahnhof (Invalidenstraße): Das Vorhaben|publisher= Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt|accessdate=2014-05-1|quote=Die Gesamtlänge des Ausbaus beträgt ca. 2,9 km, die Baumaßnahme ist in drei Phasen gegliedert und wird 2015 fertig gestellt sein.[/tpl]

In the Capitulation of Erfurt on 16 October 1806 a large body of troops from the Kingdom of Prussia under Lieutenant General the Prince of Orange surrendered to Marshal Joachim Murat at the city of Erfurt. The Prussian soldiers were demoralized by their shattering defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October and unwilling to put up much resistance. The event occurred during the War of the Fourth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Erfurt is located on the Gera River about 40 kilometers west of Jena.
Only eight days before, Emperor Napoleon I of France invaded the Electorate of Saxony with a large army and quickly inflicted two minor setbacks on his enemies. This was followed by the catastrophe of 14 October. In the aftermath of the battle, the organization of the Prussian army disintegrated. Large numbers of Prussian fugitives from the battle entered Erfurt and could not be induced to leave. When Murat's French cavalry arrived before the city, it was surrendered without any fighting.

[[The Man in the Moone]]
CATEGORIES: English books, 1630s science fiction novels, History of astronomy, Moon in fiction, 1638 books, English-language novels

The Man in the Moone is a book by the English divine and Church of England bishop Francis Godwin (1562–1633), describing a "voyage of utopian discovery".[tpl]r|Hutton[/tpl] Initially considered to be one of his early works, it is now generally thought to have been written in the late 1620s. It was first published posthumously in 1638 under the pseudonym of Domingo Gonsales. The work is notable for its role in what was called the "new astronomy," the branch of astronomy influenced especially by Nicolaus Copernicus, the only astronomer mentioned by name, although the book also draws on the theories of Johannes Kepler and William Gilbert. Godwin's astronomical theories were greatly influenced by Galileo Galilei's Sidereus Nuncius (1610), but unlike Galileo, Godwin proposes that the dark spots on the Moon are seas, one of many parallels with Kepler's Somnium sive opus posthumum de astronomia lunaris of 1634.
Gonsales is a Spaniard forced to flee the country after killing a man in a duel. Having made his fortune in the East Indies he decides to return to Spain, but falls ill on the voyage home and is set off on the island of St Helena to recover. There he discovers a species of wild swan able to carry substantial loads, the gansa, and contrives a device that allows him to harness many of them together and fly around the island. Once fully recovered Gonsales resumes his journey home, but his ship is attacked by a British fleet off the coast of Tenerife. He uses his flying machine to escape to the shore, but once safely landed he is approached by hostile natives and is forced to take off again. This time his birds fly higher and higher, towards the Moon, which they reach after a journey of twelve days. There Gonsales encounters the Lunars, a tall Christian people inhabiting what appears to be a utopian paradise. After six months of living among them Gonsales becomes homesick and concerned for the condition of his birds, and sets off to return to Earth. He lands in China, where he is immediately arrested as a magician, but after learning the language manages to win the trust of the local mandarin. The story ends with Gonsales meeting a group of Jesuit missionaries, who arrange to have a written account of his adventures sent back to Spain.
Some critics consider The Man in the Moone, along with Kepler's Somnium, to be one of the first works of science fiction.[tpl]sfnp|Poole|2010|p=57|ps=[/tpl] Although the book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by Cyrano de Bergerac and Aphra Behn, modern literary critics do not consider it to be very important. Recent studies have focused on Godwin's theories of language, the mechanics of lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.

[[Tank Hill]]
CATEGORIES: Parks in San Francisco, California, Hills of San Francisco, California

Tank Hill Park is located in San Francisco near the intersection of Clayton Street and Twin Peaks Boulevard, which circumscribes the hill to the south and east. A rocky outcropping defines the north side, which falls in cliffs to houses below.
From the south, and higher side of the hill, along Twin Peaks Boulevard, steps and a path lead to the top of the hill, which offers wonderful views of downtown San Francisco and the Golden Gate. 
The top of the hill offers flat and paved areas that date back to civic waterworks that once existed on the top of the hill.
Tank Hill is a popular area for local residents to gather to watch municipal fireworks on the 4th of July. Crissy Field, to the north, is the usual site of a large San Francisco fireworks display, but the hills also offers views of fireworks in Oakland and the East Bay. Should you decide to take in the views at that time of year, bundle up! The wind often whistles in from the ocean, making the hilltop quite cold. In addition, the Crissy Field fireworks are often obscured by fog, offering a view of colored puffs of light under clouds.

[[Cycling in Syracuse, New York]]

CATEGORIES: Sports in Syracuse, New York, Cycling by city

Cycling in Syracuse, New York is common on the roads and paths for recreation, commuting and as a sport.
During the 1890s bicycling was a new mode of transportation and a popular sport, however, overall bicycle usage declined with the advent of the automobile in the early 20th century. By mid-century, the bicycle was considered a child's toy. Since the 1970s, use of the bicycle for health, fitness and as a non-polluting alternative to the automobile has grown in Syracuse as well as across the United States.
By 1895, Syracuse was the "hub" of the bicycle world, at one time, manufacturing as many as 500 machines in a single day. The most popular and wealthiest bicycle manufacturer in the city was E. C. Stearns Company, producer of the popular Yellow Fellow for nearly a decade.[tpl]cite news |title=When Syracuse was hub of the bicycle world |first=Arlene |last=LaRue |location=Syracuse, New York |date=February 13, 1983 |newspaper=Syracuse Herald-American[/tpl]

[[Tornadoes of 2011]]

CATEGORIES: Tornadoes of 2011, Tornado-related lists by year

This page documents the tornadoes and tornado outbreaks of 2011.  Extremely destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the U.S., Bangladesh and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions.  Tornadoes also appear regularly in neighboring southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer season, and somewhat regularly in Europe, Asia, and Australia.
There were 1,897 tornadoes reported in the US in 2011 (of which 1,704 were confirmed). 2011 was an exceptionally destructive and deadly year for tornadoes; worldwide, at least 577 people perished due to tornadoes: 12 in Bangladesh, two in South Africa, one in New Zealand, one in the Philippines, one in Russia, one in Canada, and an estimated 553 in the United States (compared to 564 US deaths in the prior ten years combined). Due mostly to several extremely large tornado outbreaks in the middle and end of April and in late May, the year finished well above average in almost every category, with six EF5 tornadoes and nearly enough total tornado reports to eclipse the mark of 1,817 tornadoes recorded in 2004, the current record year for total number of tornadoes.
553 confirmed fatalities is also the second-most tornadic deaths in a single year for tornadoes in US history. This total is due in large part to the 325 tornadic deaths that occurred during the April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak across the Southeastern United States and the 158 tornadic deaths in the 2011 Joplin tornado.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.norman.noaa.gov/2009/03/us-annual-tornado-death-tolls-1875-present/ |title=US Annual Tornado Death Tolls, 1875–present |publisher=Norman.noaa.gov |date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2011[/tpl]

Jonathan Christian QC, PC (17 February 1808, Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary – 29 October 1887, Dublin), was an Irish judge.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50586 |title=Christian, Jonathan (1808–1887) |author=Daire Hogan|year=2004 |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=30 December 2010[/tpl] He served as Solicitor-General for Ireland from 1856 to 1858. He was a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) from 1858 to 1867 when he was appointed Lord Justice of Appeal in Chancery. On the creation of the new Irish Court of Appeal in 1878 he served briefly on the Court but retired after a few months.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 2 p.360
Christian was considered one of the best Irish lawyers of his time but as a judge regularly courted controversy. His bitter and sarcastic temper and open contempt for most of his colleagues led to frequent clashes both in Court and in the Press. Though he was rebuked several times by the House of Commons, no serious thought seems to have been given to removing him from office.

Prime Minister Julius Chan resigned on March 27, 1997, following a scandal regarding the hiring of foreign mercenaries to fight rebels on the island of Bougainville. The use of mercenaries by the Chan government resulted in an Papua New Guinea Defence Force mutiny codenamed 'Operasen Rausim Kwik' and riots in Bougainville. Chan stated that he resigned to preserve peace in Papua New Guinea.
The Cabinet chose John Giheno, who was serving as the mining and petroleum Minister at the time, as acting Prime Minister until new elections could be held. Giheno served as Prime Minister as a caretaker until new elections could be held in June 1997. Sixteen government ministers in the Chan government, including both Giheno and Chan, lost their seats in Parliament in the June 1997 general elections.

Bettersworth, who was associated with the journal until his death in 1991.[ref]Phillipps, Robert L., Jr. "Mississippi Quarterly" in Flora, Joseph M, Lucinda H. MacKethan, and Todd Taylor (eds.)

Retrieved on December 30, 2010.[/ref] While it began with a very wide focus, with it initially covering a variety of topics that fell under the umbrella of the social sciences, starting in 1953 the Bulletin gradually narrowed its academic range. Changing its title to its current state in that same year, the newly christened Quarterly soon began to focus almost solely on Southern literature. In 1968 it adopted its current subtitle, further cementing its reputation as a humanities journal. In that year it also began its cooperation with the Society for the Study of Southern Literature through which was produced the "Annual Checklist of Scholarship in Southern Literature". Its editors have included Robert B. Holland, Scott C. Osborn, Peyton W. Williams, Jr., and Robert L. Phillipps, Jr..

[[TGM5]]
TGM5 is a transglutaminase enzyme.
TGM5 encodes one member of the multigene transglutaminase family. Transglutaminases (TGs) are involved in protein cross-linking by catalyzing the formation of gamma-glutamyl-lysine isodipeptide bonds between adjacent polypeptides (Candi et al. 2005; Eckert et al. 2005). This process is particularly important in the terminal differentiation of the epidermis, where TGs heavily cross-link keratins and a range of differentiation-specific structural proteins, such as involucrin, loricrin, filaggrin, and small proline-rich proteins, in the formation of the cornified cell envelope in the biogenesis of the stratum corneum, the outermost, “dead” layer of the epidermis (Kalinin et al. 2002). This continuously shed outer layer of the epidermis performs the main barrier function of the skin. Recessive loss-of-function mutations in TGM1 have been shown to cause lamellar ichthyosis, a disease characterized by excessive scaling and shedding of the outer epidermis (Huber et al. 1995; Parmentier et al. 1995; Russell et al. 1995).

[[12th Guards Tank Division]]

CATEGORIES: Tank divisions of the Soviet Union, Military units and formations established in 1943, Military units and formations disestablished in 1991

The 12th Guards Uman, Orders of Lenin, Red Banner and Suvorov Tank Division was a tank division of the Soviet Ground Forces. It drew its history from the World War II 16th Tank Corps. It was redesignated successively as 12th Guards Tank Corps (1943) and 12th Guards Tank Division (1946). 
The division was initially formed as 16th Tank Corps in the Kiev Military District. It became part of the 2nd Tank Army upon the army's formation. During the war, it participated in fighting at Kharkov, Stalingrad, Kursk, Grel, Uman-Botoshany Offensive, Targul-Fmmes, Lublin-Brest Offensive, Vistula-Oder and other operations and actions. 
It took part in the counter-attacks against the Germans advancing on Stalingrad in the later summer of 1942, the winter counter-offensives of 1942/43, the Battle of Kursk in July (as part of the Central Front), then across Ukraine with the Central, Belorussian, and 1st Belorussian Fronts. In the summer of 1944, it was with the 2nd Tank Army, and took part in the offensives, reaching the outskirts of Warsaw. On 20 November 1944, it was awarded ‘Guards’ status and re-designated the 12th Guards Tank Corps. The Corps took part in the Vistula-Oder and Berlin Operations, ending the war in the Berlin area. 
As part of the occupation forces, it was assigned to the 2nd Guards Tank Army (also 2nd Guards Mechanised Army). In later 1945, it was reorganized into the 12th Guards Tank Division. During the occupation period and post-war era, its assignments remain unclear. Initially it was assigned to the 2nd Guards Mechanised Army, but then transferred to the 4th Guards Mechanised Army, which became the 20th Guards Combined-Arms Army in 1957. It eventually became part of the 3rd Shock Army - actually 3rd Red Banner Army. 3 CAA headquarters was located in the city of Magdeburg. Other divisions of the army were the 10th Guards Uralsko-Lvovskaya Tank Division, the 47th Guards Tank Division, and the 207th Motor Rifle Division.
Division headquarters was located in the town of Neuruppin. On the outskirts of town, closer to Altruppinu was the location of the three regiments: 48th Guards Tank Regiment, the 353rd Guards Tank Regiment and 332nd Guards Tank Regiment. After the withdrawal from Germany, the 12th Guards Tank Division was disbanded. The commander of the 48th Guards Tank Regiment in 1989 Guard colonel Кухновец (Kuhnovets). Chief of Staff was Guard Colonel Fedotov. It was to be deactivated in the Moscow Military District, and the division actually disbanded around 1991.

[[Kim Rossmo]]
CATEGORIES: Canadian criminologists, Living people

D. Kim Rossmo is a Canadian criminologist specializing in geographic profiling. He joined the Vancouver Police Department  as a civilian employee in 1978 and became a sworn officer in 1980. In 1987 he received a Master's degree in criminology from Simon Fraser University and in 1995 became the first police officer in Canada to obtain a doctorate in criminology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonhowell.ca/cases/rossmo.htm|title=Rossmo v. Vancouver (City) Police Board|date=December 19, 2001|publisher=Hamilton Howell|accessdate=22 April 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110706182046/http://www.hamiltonhowell.ca/cases/rossmo.htm|archivedate=2011-07-06[/tpl] His dissertation research resulted in a new criminal investigative methodology called geographic profiling, based on Rossmo's formula.  This technology was integrated into a specialized crime analysis software product called Rigel.  The Rigel product is developed by the software company Environmental Criminology Research Inc. (ECRI), which Rossmo co-founded.Rich, T. and Shively, M (2004, December). P. 14. A Methodology for Evaluating Geographic Profiling Software. U.S. Department of Justice, Retrieved from https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/208993.pdf 
In 1995, he was promoted to detective inspector and founded a geographic profiling section within the Vancouver Police Department. In 1998, his analysis of cases of missing sex trade workers determined that a serial killer was at work, a conclusion ultimately vindicated by the arrest and conviction of Robert Pickton in 2002. A retired Vancouver police staff sergeant has claimed that animosity toward Rossmo delayed the arrest of Pickton, leaving him free to carry out additional murders.http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/internal-police-strife-delayed-pickton-arrest-former-officer-says/article1667514/  His analytic results were not accepted at the time and after a falling out with senior members of the department he left in 2001. His unsuccessful lawsuit against the Vancouver Police Board for wrongful dismissal exposed considerable apparent dysfunction within that department.
After serving as director of research at the Police Foundation in Washington, DC, from 2001 to 2003, he moved to Texas State University-San Marcos where he currently holds the Endowed Chair in Criminology and is director of the Center for Geospatial Intelligence and Investigation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.txstate.edu/rising-stars/kim-rossmo.html|title=Rising Star Dr. Kim Rossmo|publisher=Texas State University-San Marcos|accessdate=22 April 2013[/tpl] Since then, he has applied techniques of geographic profiling to counterterrorism, animal foraging, and epidemiology. He has also researched and published on the subject of criminal investigative failures. He has written two books.

P. biguttatus has sharp stylets in its proboscis or rostrum used to pierce the exoskeleton of its prey.  Saliva is then injected into the prey which liquifies its tissues,and the rostrum is then used to suck out the digested fluids.  If disturbed, it is capable of a defensive bite considered to be more painful than a bee sting.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollinghillswildlife.com/animals/b/bugassassin/indexbug.html|title = ASSASSIN BUG |accessdate=2010-12-30| publisher= Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure [/tpl] It is also known to spit venom that can cause temporary blindness in humans. 
Prey typically consists of cockroaches, crickets, flies, darkling beetles and caterpillars.[tpl]cite web |url=http://khup.com/view/0_keyword-assassin-bug-biguttata/assassin-bug.html |title = Assassin Bug|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]
It was thought that they breed both sexually and through parthenogenesis, this however has recently been proved to not be true. Whilst unmated females will lay eggs, they are infertile.  Development takes six to nine months from egg to adult and life span for the adult is about two years.  The first molt occurs at about two weeks[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/oh3/elytraandantenna/MantidsAssassins/Platymeris_biguttata.htm|title =Platymeris biguttata |accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]  Development is hemimetabolous, meaning that there is no metamorphosis between a larval phase and an adult phase.  The young are called nymphs, and appear to be small adults.
Common names include white-eyed assassin bug, twin spotted assassin bug and white spot assassin bug referring to the two large white spots on the wings.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/z02644p056f.pdf |title = Taxonomic and bionomic notes on the white spot assassin bug Platymeris biguttatus (Linnaeus)|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]
P. biguttatus is endemic to tropical Africa; it is found in countries such as Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, Sudan, Niger in humid tropical forest, particularly hollow tree stumps and decaying logs.

[[Cork on Sunday]]

CATEGORIES: Media in County Cork, Newspapers published in the Republic of Ireland

Cork on Sunday was a Cork Sunday newspaper serving Cork City and County which was published in 1996 and 1997. It was launched in August 1996 by Joseph O'Connor, formerly the boss of Cork super pirate ERI and operated from the former radio studios of both ERI and 96FM.
The newspaper was moderately successful with audited circulation of 4,500 copies per week during this period. This initial success prompted a fundraising effort to relaunch the newspaper in 1998 but new Cork On Sunday was cancelled in late 1998 due to technical difficulties and the withdrawal of a key investor.
The company which was established to launch the new Cork On Sunday later launched The East Cork Express which operated as a newspaper for the East Cork area from 2002 until 2005.

Sir James Flower, 2nd Baronet (14 December 1794 – 17 May 1850)[tpl]Rayment-hc|t|1|date=March 2012[/tpl] was a British Conservative Party politician. He sat in the House of Commons from 1842 to 1846.
Flower was High Sheriff of Norfolk from  1838 to 1839.
In June 1841, he was asked by some of the electors in the borough of Thetford in Norfolk to contest the seat at the imminent general election.[ref]
 [tpl]subscription[/tpl][/ref]
Nominations took place on 29 June, when Flower was nominated by Andrew Young and W. Watts Wickes.[ref]
 [tpl]subscription[/tpl][/ref]
A show of hands declared to be in favour of Flower and his fellow Conservative Bingham Baring, but the third candidate and sitting Liberal MP Earl of Euston demanded a poll. Voting took place the following day, on 30 June, and the result was that Flower and Euston tied for second place with 71 votes each.  Amidst many challenges to the validity of votes, the mayor refused to exercise a casting vote, and returned the tied result; all three candidates were declared elected to the two seats.
Flower submitted a petition,[ref]
 [tpl]subscription[/tpl][/ref]
When the votes were scrutinised, Euston's total was reduced by one, and on 4 May 1842 he was declared unduly elected, thereby giving the seat to Flower.
He did not contest the seat at the next general election, in 1847.

Alvecote Pools is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and nature reserve situated alongside the River Anker, adjacent to the hamlet of Alvecote on the border of Warwickshire and Staffordshire in England. The majority of the reserve lies in the former county. Consisting of two discrete areas, Pooley Fields and Alvecote Meadows, the site covers [tpl]convert|128|ha|abbr=on[/tpl] in total and is the largest SSSI in Warwickshire.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.warwickshire-wildlife-trust.org.uk/home/nature-reserves/reserves-m-r/pooley-fields.aspx/|title= Pooley Fields|accessdate=21 December 2010 |publisher=Warwickshire Wildlife Trust[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.warwickshire-wildlife-trust.org.uk/home/nature-reserves/reserves-a-e/alvecote-meadows-sssi.aspx|title=Alvecote Meadows|accessdate=21 December 2010 |publisher=Warwickshire Wildlife Trust[/tpl] First notified in 1955, the site has been owned by the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust since 1997.
The site is effectively a series of shallow pools alongside the river that have arisen as an effect of colliery subsidence from Alvecote Colliery, which was later merged to form North Warwickshire Colliery and which ceased operation in 1965. In addition to the wetland habitat, there are areas of fen, reedbed and woodland. As a result, the area is regionally important for bird life, and over 100 species are reported annually, with between 60 and 70 breeding. The site is also important for beetles, with 322 species recorded, and spiders (121 species).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003784.pdf|title=Alvecote Pools|accessdate=2 January 2011 |publisher=English Nature|format=PDF[/tpl]

International trade and water is a term that is used to describe the relationship between international trade and the water being used by humans. The substantial increase in human population during the 20th century combined with rapid increases in overall global economic development has resulted in rising challenges for the future of public water management.  The developing world has been particularly impacted by the lack of access to clean water. Each year, millions of people die due to illnesses, diseases, and lack the capital to create the infrastructure necessary to combat the problem.(Segerfeldt 2005) These conditions have increased the global demand for clean water and in turn, have pressured free market economists to suggest that wealthy market players are the most efficient solution to addressing water issues.(Saefong 2006) Several nations stand to benefit from international trade in water. Particularly nations with excess fresh water and abundant capital are looking forward to making healthy profits from either the export of water to other nations, or are interested in the investment returns they will earn from participation in foreign markets. However, not everyone agrees that market forces are best capable of solving water issues. NGO’s, human rights organizations, and various stakeholders oppose viewing water in economic terms. These individuals accuse international trade agreements and international economic institutions including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of attempting to privatize a resource that they consider a basic human right.(Overbeke 2004)  The lack of a common understanding of whether or not water should be viewed as a commodity or a basic human right has resulted in heated debates among legal professionals and leading members of the academia.

During the early part of the 17th century, and persisting in some form into the early 18th century, there were a number of proposals for an English Academy: some form of learned institution, conceived as having royal backing and a leading role in the intellectual life of the nation.Albert Croll Baugh, Thomas Cable, A History of the English Language (1993), pp. 259-265. Definite calls for an English Academy came in 1617, based on the Italian model dating back to the 16th century; they were followed up later, after the 1635 founding of the French Académie, by John Dryden (1664), John Evelyn (1665), and Daniel Defoe (1697).Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage (1995), p. 7a.http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/data/B_HIST_EU.html

Jigu suanjing ("Continuation of Ancient Mathematics" 缉古算经) was the work of early Tang dynasty calendarist and mathematician Wang Xiaotong, written some time before the year 626, when he presented his work to the Emperor. Jigu Suanjing was included as one of the requisite texts for Imperial examination; the amount of time required for the study of Jigu Suanjing was three years, the same as for The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art and The Sea Island Mathematical Manual. 
Wang Xiaotong used an algebraic method to solve three-dimensional geometry problems, and his work is a major advance in Algebra in the history of Chinese mathematics.
Each problem in Jigu Suanjing follows the same format, the question part begins with "suppose we have such and such,... question:...how may are there ?";  followed by "answer:", with concrete numbers; then followed by "The algorithm says:...." , in which Wang Xiaotong detailed the reasoning and procedure for the construction of equations, with a terse description of the method of solution. The emphasis of the book is a how to solve engineering problem by construction of mathematical equations from geometric properties of the relevant problem.
In Jigu Suanjin, Wang established and solved 25 cubic equations, 23 of them from problem 2 to problem 18 have the form
The remaining two problems 19, and 20 each has a double quadratic equation:
Wang's work influence later Chinese mathematicians, like Jia Xian and Qin Jiushao of Song dynasty.

[[Saint-Yves (the elder)]]

CATEGORIES: French artists, Members of the Académie des beaux-arts, 1660 births, 1730 deaths

Saint-Yves, Pierre (de) (1660–1730), was a French painter of the 17th and 18th centuries.
Pierre de Saint-Yves was born in the French Ardennes (near Maubert-Fontaine) on May 3, 1660, within a family protected by Marie de Guise. This princess called both young Saint-Yvess and his brother Charles de Saint-Yves (1667–1733) to Paris in the early 1670s, as pages and sponsored their formations.
Having receiving a King's pension, Saint-Yves completed studies with a three-year stay at the French Academy in Rome before returning to Paris as a painter. On January 28, 1708, Saint-Yves became a member of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, in the caterory of history painter, and he died in Paris on November 4, 1730.
Saint-Yves is an illustrative example of the transition between 17th-century art careers that were usually introduced by protection of high nobility sponsors, and 18th-century art circles organised around and in the glory of the King. To that extent, Saint-Yves' membership to the Academy as a history painter constituted the utmost position in the Court system at the time, although this category of French classical painting declined by the end of the century and has been almost totally forgotten since the 19th century.
Thus, most of Saint-Yves' posterity lies in his art cabinet, which  was bequeathed to the family of his bother Charles and based the reputable art collection of Charles Léoffroy de Saint-Yves.

The former Croton North railroad station is located on Senasqua Road in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, United States. It was built by the New York Central Railroad in the late 19th century. In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
It had long been out of active service, and was converted to office use three years before the listing. Despite the conversion it remains largely intact, and is considered an excellent example of a commuter railroad station from this era, when stations began to reflect the industrial role of the railroads. Included in the listing are two 1930s Pullman electric passenger coaches parked on a disconnected spur north of the station.

CATEGORIES: Fantasy genres, Science fiction genres, Science fiction themes, Subcultures, Science fiction culture

The word arcanepunk refers to a fantasy world where both magic and science exist. It applies to a genre or a design.
The magic and science are advanced enough that most people have access. Not everyone is a scientist or wizard, but most people know how to use technologic and magic items. Scientific knowledge is comparable to the late 19th century or more advanced. This genre is often old fashioned, either by borrowing in fantasy or steampunk.
In most cases, magic and science have evolved in parallel. People use technomagic devices based on magic and science. Coal, oil and electricity are often replaced by crystals, mana or glyphs.
The most popular creature of the genre is the wargolem, something between golem and robot.  It appears in 1998 in Battle Chasers comic books. It is known as warforged in the Eberron campaign setting.

CATEGORIES: Rulers of Yemen, Zaidi imams, Yemeni imams, Yemeni people, 987 births, 1013 deaths

al-Mahdi al-Husayn (987 - 1013) was an imam of the Zaidi state in Yemen who claimed power in the years 1003-1013, in rivalry with another imam.
Al-Husayn bin al-Qasim was a Sayyid originally from Hijaz (present-day Saudi Arabia). His father was the imam al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani who briefly held power in the Yemeni inland in 999-1002, and died in 1003. After the death of al-Mansur, al-Husayn set forth his claim to the imamate, in rivalry with his distant relative ad-Da'i Yusuf. In 1010 he declared himself with the title al-Mahdi, in the chiliastic sense of a redeemer of Islam.Enzyklopädie des Islam, Vol. IV. Leiden 1934, p. 1296. He moreover claimed to be the equal of the Prophet. He was supported by large groups from Himyar and Hamdan. At this time, the key city San'a was governed by the Zaidi sharif al-Qasim bin al-Husayn. The sharif was expelled from the city, pursued and killed in 1012. The rival imam ad-Da'i died in the same year. With this, the power of al-Mahdi al-Husayn extended from Alhan to Sa'dah and San'a. However, already in 1013, the imam was in turn driven out of San'a. He was attacked by a Hamdanite force near Dhu Bin and lost his life. For a long time afterwards, his adherents believed that he was actually not dead.H.C. Kay, Yaman; Its early Medieval History. London 1892, pp. 228-9. Like many Zaidi imams, al-Mahdi al-Husayn was a prominent author. After his demise, his brother Ja'far played a political role as emir in the Yemeni highlands for several decades. He established himself in the impenetrable stronghold Shahara and was the main opponent of the Sulayhid dynasty in the second half of the eleventh century. Ja'far and his offspring headed a Zaydiyyah sect known as the Husayniyya after al-Mahdi al-Husayn.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. XI, Leiden 2002, p. 479.

[[Fiscal space]]
CATEGORIES: Economics, Fiscal policy

Fiscal space is a relatively new termRathin Roy, Antoine Heuty (2009) Fiscal space: policy options for financing human development, UNDP that refers to the flexibility of a government in its spending choices, and, more generally, to the financial well-being of a government. Peter Heller (2005) defined it “as room in a government’s budget that allows it to provide resources for a desired purpose without jeopardizing the sustainability of its financial position or the stability of the economy.” See: Peter Heller Back to Basics -- Fiscal Space: What It Is and How to Get It
There are different exact definitions for the term, and different metrics on how to measure it. The most influential definitions of the term come from international institutions, e.g., the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the United Nations agencies, e.g., United Nations Development Program, World Health Organization and UNICEF, and the aid organizations, e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
The crucial point of debate is in how resources that define the 'fiscal space' should be viewed and thus calculated. In particular, unlike the IMF-World Bank,See: World Bank, "Infrastructure: Lessons from the Last Two Decades of World Bank Engagement," January 30, 2006World Bank, Development Committee, "Fiscal Policy for Growth & Development (FPGD): An Interim Report," April 23, 2006. the UN agencies advocates defining it in relation to the extent to which a government can mobilize resources to a means to combat poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

[[HD 36960]]

CATEGORIES: Orion (constellation), B-type main-sequence stars, Henry Draper Catalogue objects, HR objects

HD 36960 is a B-type main-sequence star in the constellation Orion. At an apparent magnitude of +4.78 it is visible to the naked eye in many areas, though in most urban areas it cannot be seen due to light pollution. The star is also massive along with many other stars of Orion. At over 15 solar masses, it shines with nearly 40,000 times the Sun's luminosity due to its high surface temperature (29,000K). Due to its high mass, the star will expand into a blue supergiant in the next few million years and eventually a red supergiant after that. During this phase, the star will probably be a second or third magnitude star and easily viable to the naked eye (probably about as bright as Kappa Orionis (Saiph) is today). The ultimate fate of the star is most likely a Type II supernova. When it has fully exhausted its fuel, the core will produce heavier elements like Iron. Then, its core will become unstable and collapse with the rest of the star expanding outward in a luminous explosion. Such an event from this distance would shine brightly in Earth's sky. Assuming this event is identical to SN 1054, it would shine with an apparent magnitude of -8.71, about 1/40 as bright as the full moon despite its distance of over 1,800 light years.

In January 1942, as the Finnish government was taking part in the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Egyptian government broke diplomatic relations with Helsinki.
Diplomatic relations were reestablished on February 15, 1947 at a Legation level, but no diplomatic mission was actually established. It was only in 1954 that the Finnish Ambassador to Italy was appointed non-resident Minister Plenipotentiary to Egypt. It was only on July 1, 1959 that relations were elevated to Embassy level, and the Finnish Embassy was opened in September.

[[Schrofen]]

CATEGORIES: Climbing, Mountaineering, Geomorphology

Schrofen is a German mountaineering term that refers to steep terrain, strewn with rocks and rock outcrops, that is laborious to cross, but whose rock ledges (schrofen) offer many good steps and hand holds. It is usually rocky terrain on which grass has established itself, but it can also refer to purely rocky slopes. Schrofen are found especially where the rock has broken off against its angle of dip.
Schrofen differs from trackless terrain in that hands are needed in order to negotiate it. Often there are route markings that only indicate a rough direction.So gehen Sie sicher im Schrofengelände ("How to negotiate schrofen terrain safely") at www.alpin.de. Accessed on 31 Dec 2010 
Schrofen terrain requires at least sure-footedness and is typical of grade I climbing routes. In wet weather schrofen can become very dangerous because of the increased risk of slipping, particularly in the descent. In addition, the risk of falling in schrofen terrain is often underestimated.
In keeping with the base meaning of the word ("rock spikes"), schrofen also forms part of the name of numerous mountains in the Northern Limestone Alps. Alpine farms near a schrofen are often named after it, as are their access roads, e.g.: Ob dm Schrofa, Schrofaweg. The word is linked to the German adjective schroff which means rugged, steep or craggy.

The former Brandreth Pill Factory is a historic industrial complex located on Water Street in Ossining, New York, United States. It consists of several brick buildings from the 19th century, in a variety of contemporary architectural styles. In 1980 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Most of the original buildings succumbed to fire in the 1870s, but the oldest, a Greek Revival building possibly designed by Calvin Pollard in the 1830s, remains. Nearby is a corrugated iron structure that may be the earliest use of that material in Westchester County. The main building itself was one of the first to have Otis elevators installed.Village of Ossining, [tpl]PDFlink|Significant Sites and Structures Guide|20.9 MB[/tpl], April 2010, retrieved July 22, 2011, p. 83.
Benjamin Brandreth made his family's popular medicine, said to treat blood impurities, at the factory, starting in the 1830s. The factory's construction was the beginning of the industrial development of the Ossining waterfront. It continued to be used for manufacturing until the 1940s. Some of the smaller buildings remain in use today, although the former main building is vacant. The village is considering a proposal to convert it to green housing.

The history of English contract law traces back to its roots in civil law, the lex mercatoria and the industrial revolution. Modern English contract law is composed primarily of case law decided by the English courts following the Judicature Acts and supplemented by statutory reform. However, a significant number of legal principles were inherited from recording decisions reaching back to the aftermath of the Norman Invasion.

[[Leukental]]
CATEGORIES: Valleys of Tyrol (state), Kitzbühel Alps, Kitzbühel District, Chiemgau Alps

The Leukental is a valley in North Tyrol in the district of Kitzbühel in Austria. The Leukental runs north to south from the Thurn Pass to the Bavarian border, but is not just defined as the main valley but includes several smaller side valleys. The river flowing through the Leukental is known as the Jochberger Ache from its source at the Thurn Pass to Kitzbühel, then as the Kitzbühler Ache from Kitzbühel to St. Johann in Tirol and, from its confluence with the Fieberbrunner Ache near St. Johann in Tirol, as the Großache. After leaving the Leukentals and Tyrol the river is known in Bavaria as the Tiroler Ache until it discharges into the Chiemsee lake, and its valley is known as the Achental. The parishes in the Leukental are: Jochberg, Aurach bei Kitzbühel, Kitzbühel, Oberndorf in Tirol, St. Johann in Tirol, Kirchdorf and Kössen.
The name "Leukental" might almost have been forgotten by the 20th century because, from the middle of the 19th century the name "Großachental" had become common. This was mainly because it was a time when the imperial and royal monarchy wanted to survey all crown lands precisely and the state surveyors, who were mostly from Bohemia, did not often quite understand Alpine dialects and many names were entered on the maps without being researched. 
For example the erroneous change of the name of the valley to the name of the river could be explained because the state surveyor  may have asked the name of the river and would have been told "that is the große Ache." As a result even today the name "Großachental" appears in most of the maps.
During the 20th century the incorrect belief also arose that the Leukental ran from the Inn valley near Wörgl via Söll and Ellmau to St. Johann, so that the station near Bruckhäusl (in the town of Wörgl) was called "Söll-Leukental" until a few years ago. In 1875, when the station was built, it was thought that you could get off at this station and continue your journey to Söll and then via Ellmau and Going enter the Leukental. Over the decades the error was perpetuated that the Leukental ran from Wörgl via Söll, Scheffau, Ellmau and Going to St. Johann.
The local Kitzühel historian, Peter Brandstätter, who died in November 2008, gave the Leukental its name back by raising the awareness of the issue with the public authorities through letters and publications. He even managed to persuade the Austrian Federal Railways to change the name of the station from "Söll-Leukental" to "Bruckhäusl".

Bacterial ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase may be bound to the thylakoid membrane or anchored to the thylakoid-bound phycobilisomes. Chloroplast ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase ([tpl]EC number|1.18.1.2[/tpl]) may play a key role in regulating the relative amounts of cyclic and non-cyclic electron flow to meet the demands of the plant for ATP and reducing power. It is involved in the final step in the linear photosynthetic electron transport chain and has also been implicated in cyclic electron flow around photosystem I where its role would be to return electrons from ferredoxin to the cytochrome B-F complex.
This domain is present in a variety of proteins that include, bacterial flavohemoprotein, mammalian NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, eukaryotic NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, nitrate reductase from plants, nitric-oxide synthase, bacterial vanillate demethylase and others.

Harold Johann Thomas Ellingham, OBE, (1897–1975) was a British physical chemist, best known for his Ellingham diagrams, which summarize a large amount of information concerning extractive metallurgy.[tpl]citation | last = Ellingham | first = H. J. T. | journal = J. Soc. Chem. Ind. (London) | volume = 63 | page = 125 | year = 1944[/tpl].[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw1st|pages=326–28[/tpl].
Ellingham studied at the Royal College of Science from 1914 to 1916.Although the Royal College of Science had been formally merged with the Royal School of Mines and the City and Guilds Central Technical College in 1907 to form the Imperial College of Science and Technology, it retained an independent identity as a constituent college until 2002. He became a demonstrator at the college in 1919 and reader in physical chemistry in 1937. He was secretary of the Royal College of Science 1940–44 and of the Royal Institute of Chemistry 1944–63. He was made a fellow of Imperial College in 1949 and an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1962.[tpl]citation | title = ELLINGHAM, Harold Johann Thomas (1897-1975) | url = http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=2625&inst_id=3&nv1=search&nv2= | publisher = AIM25 | accessdate = 2010-12-31[/tpl].
Ellingham is best known for his eponymous diagrams plotting the Gibbs energy change for the reaction
against temperature. By normalizing the thermodynamic functions to the reaction with one mole of oxygen, Ellingham was able to compare the temperature stability of many different oxides on the same diagram. In particular, he could show graphically that carbon becomes a stronger reducing agent as the temperature increases.[tpl]#tag:ref|This phenomenon was known before Ellingham's time, but Ellingham demonstrated it more clearly. The reason for the increase in reducing power with temperature is the positive entropy change for the reaction [tpl]nowrap|2 C + O2 [tpl]eqm[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|2 CO[/tpl], as opposed to the negative entropy changes for the formation of solid metal oxides.|group=note[/tpl] The reduction of metal oxides with carbon (or carbon monoxide) to form the free metals is of immense industrial importance (e.g., the manufacture of iron in a blast furnace), and Ellingham diagrams show the lowest temperature at which the reaction will occur for each metal.

The Jug Tavern, also known as the Davids–Garrison House or the Grapevine Inn, is located at the junction of Revolutionary Road and Rockledge Avenue in Sparta section of  Ossining, New York, United States. It is a wood frame building, the oldest elements of which date to the mid-18th century, before the American Revolution, making it possibly the oldest structure in the village.[tpl]cite web|title=Jug Tavern – Sparta Tour|url=http://www.jugtavern.org/spartatour.htm|publisher=Jug Tavern of Sparta Inc.|date=February 20, 2006|accessdate=August 5, 2011[/tpl] It has, however, been expanded and modified since then, and was almost completely rebuilt in the late 19th century. In 1976 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Originally it was located along the Albany Post Road, the central building in the small hamlet of Sparta, a name still used for the neighborhood later absorbed into the village of Ossining and retaining many other intact historic buildings. Much of the house's history is unclear, including whether it was ever even a tavern. Some local legends hold that Revolutionary War figures such as George Washington and John André visited. The name "Jug Tavern" was not even known to have been used for the property until the mid-20th century. A local organization dedicated to preserving the building currently owns the property.

It was built as a high school, in response to the village's rapid growth following industrialization in the early 20th century, from a design by Wilson Potter of New York City, an architect who specialized in schools. It includes what were at the time some of the most progressive and advanced features of school buildings. Its early (for a school) use of the Beaux-Arts style and placement on a rise in the land give it a monumental quality despite its relatively small size.

Laserdance was a Dutch spacesynth-project that was popular in the 1980s with hits such as "Laserdance", "Power Run" and "Humanoid Invasion". Group members were composer Michiel van der Kuy and producer Erik van Vliet. Michiel van der Kuy's first track for Laserdance was "Goody's Return" in 1984, which was influenced by the demise of the Goody record label. After his first release, Michiel developed his sound further on Laserdance's first LP Future Generation (1987), a concept-album, which became the milestone for the spacesynth sound.
The song "Laserdance" was based upon the song "Laserdance" (1979) by the group Sponooch.

[[Great Debasement]]

CATEGORIES: Currencies of England, 1540s in England, Inflation, Monetary economics, Monetary policy

The Great Debasement (1542–1551) refers to the English Crown’s policy of coinage debasement during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI. Coinage debasement occurred when governments replaced to a significant degree the gold or silver content of coinage with a base metal such as copper. By reducing the value of gold or silver content relative to face value, governments extracted usable revenue from domestic money stocks. This stratagem was called debasement because each coin was worth less in terms of its precious metal content.
Normally, the face value of the coined money exceeded its production cost, including the cost of the precious metals. This difference, which the Crown earned as a profit, was called seigniorage. The Crown of England, like many governments, held an exclusive monopoly on the privilege to coin money from precious metals, and used the profits of seigniorage to help pay for government expenditures.
During the Great Debasement the English crown’s profits from debasement rose to unreasonable levels. In March 1542 the value of the silver content of each English coin averaged 75 percent of each coin’s face value. By March 1545 the value of the silver content had fallen to 50 percent, and by March 1546 to 33.33 percent. The value of each coin in silver content fell to only 25 percent of face value by the time the debasement had run its course in 1551.
During a period of coinage debasement, a mechanism called Gresham’s law comes into play. Gresham’s law is sometimes expressed as bad currency drives out good currency. Households and businesses will hoard the good (or undebased) coinage, and use the debased coinage to pay for goods and services. The result is that only the debased currency remains in circulation, and the good currency goes into hiding or is spent on goods from foreign countries where the debased currency is not legal tender and therefore not acceptable.
In 1561 the English government under Elizabeth I instituted a plan to retire the debased currency and replace it with currency the face value of which corresponded with its precious metal content. Because of Gresham’s law, retiring the debased currency was a tricky affair because households and businesses tend to hoard good coinage and pay debts with debased coinage. To retire the debased currency the government enacted laws forbidding the outflow of good coinage to foreign markets, and ending the legal-tender status of the debased coinage beyond a certain date.
During the gold standard era governments achieved the same purpose as debasement by increasing the paper money in circulation relative to the gold bullion held in reserves. Debasement, like printing excess paper money, was a secret form of taxation that monarchs could impose, often without receiving the approval of representative bodies such as Parliament. The secret tax made itself felt by increasing prices relative to measures of wages and other incomes.
An apologist for the debasement policies of the English Crown might point to the need to build up the English navy, and finance other public defence expenditures. Critics would answer that Henry VIII was fond of building palaces and expensive wars - notably his French campaigns. Whatever the driving force of debasement, the public gradually lost faith in the ability of governments to manage money supplies without oversight from private financial sectors that are affected by monetary mismanagement. In the United States a quasi public-private agency, the Federal Reserve System, regulates the money supply, largely independent of the executive and legislative branches of government. Studies have shown that in the 1970s countries with independent monetary authorities experienced lower inflation rates than countries with monetary authorities dominated by government authority.

Elrington Ball|accessdate=2010-12-31[/tpl][tpl]Rayment-hc|M|2|date=March 2012[/tpl] was a judge, politician and Solicitor-General for Ireland, and a noted supporter of the cause of total abstinence from alcohol.
He was  born in Dublin, the fourth son of the Reverend Cecil Crampton, vicar of  Headfort, County Galway, and Nicola Marsh. His namesake, the celebrated doctor Sir Philip Crampton, was a cousin, a fact which benefitted his career. He was educated at the University of Dublin, where he was an outstanding student, and gold medallist; later becoming a Fellow of the University (1807–16) and  Regius Professor of Law in 1816. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1808. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1810.
He was appointed Solicitor-General in 1830. He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Saltash in February 1831,[tpl]Rayment-hc|S|2|date=March 2012[/tpl] and MP for Milborne Port in July 1831. He was judge of the Court of Queen's Bench (Ireland) 1834-1859.
In politics he was a Whig and a strong  supporter of progressive Whig causes such as Parliamentary reform and abolition of the slave trade. Though a fine academic lawyer and a "pleasant and tactful" advocate, he was not considered much of a politician. His various proposals to reform the Irish legal system met with little support, and he clashed repeatedly with Daniel O'Connell (he was to be one of the judges at O'Connell's trial in 1844).
O'Connell opposed Crampton's appointment to the Bench, calling him "utterly incompetent", lacking in integrity, and qualified only by his friendships with senior judges. O'Connell  however disliked and despised nearly all the Irish judges of his time, and his low  opinion of Crampton was not generally shared: when he retired, it was said that no judge's reputation stood higher. Most contemporaries praised him as a true gentleman, a true Christian, and a noted philanthropist.
He married firstly in 1817 Sidney Mary Browne, who died in 1839, and secondly Margaret Duffy. By his second marriage he had one son, Cecil, who died young.
He lived in considerable state at his home St. Valery, near Bray, County Wicklow, but was not noted for hospitality. A strict advocate of temperance, he refused to serve alcohol, and according to a much repeated story, poured the entire contents of the St. Valery wine cellar into the River Dargle.
He retired from the Bench in 1859 and died at St. Valery in 1862. Cecil, his only son died four years later while still in his teens. The estate passed to another branch of the Crampton family.

CATEGORIES: 1700 births, 1775 deaths, British countesses, Hereditary suo jure peeresses, Barons in the Peerage of England, Coke family

Margaret Coke, Countess of Leicester (16 June 1700 – 28 February 1775) was a British peeress. 
She was born Lady Margaret Tufton, the third daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet by his wife Catherine, daughter of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
On 3 July 1718 she was married to Thomas Coke. Their only child Edward was born on 6 February 1726. Coke was raised to the peerage as Baron Lovel on 28 May 1728 and his wife became known as the Lady Lovel. 
On 30 July 1729 her father Lord Thanet died. He was also 18th Baron de Clifford, and as he had no surviving male issue this title fell into abeyance between five co-heirs: Margaret, her two elder sisters Catherine (widow of Edward Watson, Viscount Sondes) and Anne (widow of James Cecil, 5th Earl of Salisbury), and her two younger sisters Mary (widow of Anthony Grey, Earl of Harold) and Isabella (wife of Lord Nassau Powlett). The abeyance was terminated in Margaret's favour on 3 August 1734, and she became 19th Baroness Clifford in her own right. 
On 9 May 1744 Lord Lovel was created Earl of Leicester, and his wife became the Countess of Leicester. Their son Edward (now styled Viscount Coke) died without issue on 31 August 1753, and Lord Leicester died on 20 April 1759.
Lady Leicester died on 28 February 1775, and her barony again fell into abeyance. The co-heirs were now Edward Southwell (grandson of the eldest sister Catherine); James Cecil, 6th Earl of Salisbury (son of the second sister Anne); the fourth sister Mary (now widow of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower); and the fifth sister Isabella, (widow of Sir Francis Blake Delaval) or her daughter Isabella (wife of John Perceval, 3rd Earl of Egmont). The abeyance was terminated in favour of Edward Southwell 17 April 1776.

Bolton Priory is a historic home built in 1838 for the Reverend Robert Bolton and his family in the Town of Pelham in Westchester County, New York. The home stands upon a wooded tract of land overlooking Pelham Bay; the once large estate surrounding it has now diminished to 3.7 acres. Influenced by the Romantic Movement in England, Bolton chose to design the house in the Romantic idiom. The building was designed to appear as if it had been constructed over a period of time – stone was used in one section and brick in another, to give the impression of various additions.[tpl]cite book|title= A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening|date=May 1967|accessdate=May 24, 2012|author=Andrew Jackson Downing|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|page=347[/tpl]
Bolton Priory serves as a good reflection of the lifestyle and tastes of a cultivated, influential family in mid-19th century rural Pelham, as well as a great example of the romantic theories of architectural design emerging in America at that time. The Priory was illustrated in the first edition of Andrew Jackson Downing's influential Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening published in 1841, in which he described it as a "highly unique residence in the old English style".[tpl]cite book|title= A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening|date=May 1967|accessdate=May 24, 2012|author=Andrew Jackson Downing|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls (1967)|page=347[/tpl]

''Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren; or, Fortunatus and the Water of Life, the Three Bears, the Three Gifts, the Three Wishes, and the Little Man who Woo'd the Little MaidW. R. Osman had written a pantomime called "Harlequin Cock Robin and the Children in the Wood" in 1866. See Nicoll, Allardyce. A History of English Drama'', 1660–1900, Volume 6, p. 206, Cambridge University Press, 2009 ISBN 0-521-10933-7 was a pantomime written by W. S. Gilbert. As with many pantomimes of the Victorian era, the piece consisted of a story involving evil spirits, young lovers and "transformation" scenes, followed by a harlequinade.
The piece premiered at the Lyceum Theatre, London on 26 December 1867. It was the only pantomime written by Gilbert alone, although before and afterwards he collaborated with other authors on pantomimes for the London stage. It was written early in his career, when he was not yet an established playwright, and the script was regarded as of less importance than the spectacle. However, the first night was under-rehearsed, and the spectacular effects and scenery failed to work properly. Later performances were satisfactory in that respect, and the piece received some good reviews.

Sir Francis Blake Delaval KB (16 March 1727 – 7 August 1771) was a British actor, soldier and Member of Parliament.
He was the eldest son of Captain Francis Blake Delaval RN of Seaton Delaval Hall, and succeeded to the estate in 1752.
Francis was an actor in a group of Samuel Foote. He was a gambler but could not afford that lifestyle. He married the wealthy (and much older) Isabella, daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet and widow of Lord Nassau Powlett, but it was not a happy marriage. His wife filed a lawsuit against him because of adultery with an actress, Miss La Roche, for which Isabelle unknowningly forked out ₤1500.
His military career was of short duration. He took part in the Raid on St Malo, and received a knighthood for his bravery when storming the Brittany beach, although there were no French troops present to offer resistance.
He represented Hindon in Parliament from 1751 to 1754 and Andover from 1754 to 1768.
He suffered a stroke, and was memorized by his obituarist as "'the very soul of frolic and amusement (who) overbalanced a few foibles by a thousand amiable qualities". He died without issue and was succeeded by his younger brother John Hussey Delaval, later Baron Delaval.

[[The Leader (novel)]]
CATEGORIES: Alternate history novels, World War II novels, 2003 novels

The Leader is a 2003 alternative history of World War II by Guy Walters.
The book's premise is that King Edward VIII does not abdicate but reigns as King with Wallis Simpson as Queen, eventually appointing Oswald Mosley as a dictatorial Prime Minister. The resulting fascist Britain is allied with Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.
The book is distinguished from some other alternate histories - like Robert Harris's Fatherland - which reach a similar result from a military defeat and conquest of Britain, with the Nazis restoring an already abdicated King Edward VIII to the throne of the occupied country.  The Leader takes place in 1937, well before the Second World War and deals with point of departure entirely contained within British politics of the time.

It was a mirror of the equivalent court in England and one of the four courts which sat in the building still called The Four Courts. The title Chief Baron was first used in 1309 for Walter de Islip. In the early centuries it was partly a political office, and as late as 1442 it was thought necessary to recommend that the Chief Baron be a properly trained lawyer. The last and probably greatest Chief Baron, The Rt. Hon. Christopher Palles, continued to hold the title after the Court was merged into a new High Court of Justice in Ireland in 1878, until his retirement in 1916, when the title lapsed.

This is a list of U.S. states by historical population, as enumerated every decade by the United States Census. As required by the United States Constitution, a census has been conducted every 10 years since 1790. Although the decennial census collects a variety of information that used in demographic studies, marketing, and other enterprises, the purpose of the census as stated in the Constitution is to produce an "actual enumeration" of the number of persons in the states in order to calculate their Congressional apportionment.
As the United States has grown in area and population, new states have been formed out of U.S. territories or the division of existing states. The population figures provided here reflect modern state boundaries. Shaded areas of the tables indicate census years when a territory or the part of another state had not yet been admitted as a new state.

Abdellatif Zeroual (born 1951, Berrechid, Morocco, died on 14 November 1974, at "Derb Moulay Chérif"  in Casablanca) was a philosophy teacher and  member of the national committee of the  "Ila Al Amame" movement.

Abdellatif was the son of Haj Abdelkader Zeroual, a militant who fought the French before Morocco became independent.
In 1970, when the Moroccan authorities launched a crackdown on the Ila al-Aman movement, he went into hiding with Abraham Serfaty and was protected by Christine Daure-Serfaty. In 1973 he was sentenced to death in absentia by a Casabalanca court. On 5 November 1974 he disappeared after being snatched by a group of plain-clothed men while on his way to a meeting.

A week later a body was registered at a hospital in Rabat, which human rights organisations claim to be his, although the Moroccan authorities have never confirmed this.

[[Hackenköpfe]]
CATEGORIES: Mountains of the Alps, Mountains of Tyrol (state), Two-thousanders, Kaiser Mountains

The Hackenköpfe are a row of peaks in the western Kaisergebirge range in Austria. Their maximum height is [tpl]Convert|2126|m|ft[/tpl]. They are located in the ridge running west from the Sonneck between the Treffauer and Scheffauer. To the north their rock faces, up to 800 metres high, drop into the Kaisertal valley; to the south they present steep, craggy rock flanks. They are most usually scaled either over the arête from the Sonneck or along the one from the Scheffauer. Both normal routes include sections of UIAA grade II climbs and are not signed or secured. The popular, but challenging crossing of the crest running from the Scheffauer to the Sonneck from the base at Scheffau am Wilden Kaiser also involves the Hackenköpfe.

[[Black hole complementarity]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum gravity

Black hole complementarity is a conjectured solution to the black hole information paradox, proposed by Leonard Susskind and Larus Thorlacius,[tpl]cite arXiv|eprint=hep-th/9306069|author1=Susskind|author2=Thorlacius|author3=Uglum|title=The Stretched Horizon and Black Hole Complementarity|class=hep-th|year=1993[/tpl] and Gerard 't Hooft.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/0550-3213(85)90418-3[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1016/0550-3213(90)90174-C[/tpl]
Ever since Stephen Hawking suggested information is lost in an evaporating black hole once it passes through the event horizon and is inevitably destroyed at the singularity, and that this can turn pure quantum states into mixed states, some physicists have wondered if a complete theory of quantum gravity might be able to conserve information with a unitary time evolution. But how can this be possible if information can't escape the event horizon without traveling faster than light? This seems to rule out Hawking radiation as the carrier of the missing information. It also appears as if information can't be "reflected" at the event horizon as there is nothing special about it locally.
Leonard Susskind proposed a radical resolution to this problem by claiming that the information is both reflected at the event horizon and passes through the event horizon and can't escape, with the catch being no observer can confirm both stories simultaneously. According to an external observer, the infinite time dilation at the horizon itself makes it appear as if it takes an infinite amount of time to reach the horizon. He also postulated a stretched horizon, which is a membrane hovering about a Planck length outside the event horizon and which is both physical and hot. According to the external observer, infalling information heats up the stretched horizon, which then reradiates it as Hawking radiation, with the entire evolution being unitary. However, according to an infalling observer, nothing special happens at the event horizon itself, and both the observer and the information will hit the singularity. This isn't to say there are two copies of the information lying about — one at or just outside the horizon, and the other inside the black hole — as that would violate the no cloning theorem. Instead, an observer can only detect the information at the horizon itself, or inside, but never both simultaneously. Complementarity is a feature of the quantum mechanics of noncommuting observables, and Susskind proposed that both stories are complementary in the quantum sense.
An infalling observer will see the point of entry of the information as being localized on the event horizon, while an external observer will notice the information being spread out uniformly over the entire stretched horizon before being re-radiated.
To an infalling observer, information and entropy passes through the horizon with nothing strange happening. To an external observer, the information and entropy is absorbed into the stretched horizon which acts like a dissipative fluid with entropy, viscosity and electrical conductivity. See the membrane paradigm for more details. The stretched horizon is conducting with surface charges which rapidly spread out over the horizon.
Global symmetries don't exist in quantum gravity[tpl]why|date=July 2012[/tpl]. Baryon number is violated, but only at very small scales, and the proton has a very long lifetime. But with a short enough time resolution, the proton oscillates between different baryon numbers and the time warping near the horizon magnifies that. Alternatively, the hot temperatures of the stretched horizon cause the proton to decay. But an infalling observer never has time to see the proton decay.

Bābu Genu Said ([tpl]lang-mr|बाबू गेनू सैद[/tpl]) (Said) (1908 – December 12, 1930) was an Indian freedom fighter, a revolutionary.
Shahid Babu Genu Said was born in poor farmer family in Mahalunge Padwal , he was a worker in one of the cotton mills in Mumbai.  He was an active participant in the protests, organized by Indian freedom fighters, against the import of foreign-made cloth.
On December 12, 1930, a cloth merchant named George Frazier of Manchester was moving loads of foreign-made cloth from his shop in old Hanuman galli in the Fort region to Mumbai Port.  He was given police protection per his request.  The freedom fighters begged not to move the truck, but the police forced the protesters aside and managed to get the truck moving.  Near Bhaangwadi on Kalbadevi Road,Shahid Babu Genu stood in front of the truck, shouting praises for Mahatma Gandhi.  The police officer ordered the driver to drive the truck over Shahid Babu Genu.  but driver was indian, he didn't and said "I am Indian and he is also Indian, So, we both are the brothers of each other, then how can I murdered my brother?". After that, the english police officer sat on the driver seat and drove the truck over Babu Genu and crushed him to death under the truck.  This resulted in a huge wave of anger, strikes, and protests throughout Mumbai.

CATEGORIES: Triumph vehicles

The Triumph Super 9 was first introduced by the Triumph Motor Company in 1931 at a price of £185. It continued through into 1933. It had an RAC rating of 8.9 hp. 
There were three significant models on the same chassis, a 4-door six-light saloon, a 4-door tourer and a 2-door 4-seat tourer known as the Southern Cross. 
The Super 9‘s were the first Triumphs to use 12-volt electrics (early Southern Cross’s still used 6-volt for a short period) and the first to be fitted with a Coventry Climax engine, which was made under licence by Triumph. They had a track of 3 ft [tpl]frac|7|1|2[/tpl] in and a wheelbase of 7 ft 8 in.  The front doors on the saloon were hinged at the front, while those at the back were hinged to the rear. A sliding sun roof was standard, operated by a rotating handle above the driver. Folding rear arm rests were fitted but do not appear on the prototype. The most noticeable differences between 1931 cars and the later models was a change to the radiator surround and different profiling of the front wings. Two 6-volt batteries were housed under the rear passenger floor, while the prototype had a single 12-volt battery on the bulk head. (Very advanced for the period.)  Many of the  chassis and transmission components were left overs from the Super 7’s and 8’s.
Optional extras were a luggage rack, chrome bumpers and Stevenson Jacking system. The upholstery was leather cloth with leather seating. The only known Super 9 to have Bedford Cord throughout is the prototype; this also has a smokers vent in the roof which is shown on brochures, but is not seen on any production 9’s. Instruments consisted of a speedometer, clock, oil gauge and ammeter. After 1931 a petrol gauge was added, prior to this a fuel tap was incorporated to give a reserve supply. Dash switches consisted of, a dash light, interior light, ignition, and a starter button, also choke and fast running control. External lights switching, battery charge rate, and ignition timing  were all at the centre of the steering wheel.

The Government began actively supporting red tourism in 2005 to promote the "national ethos" and socioeconomic development in those areas, which are typically rural and poorer than East China. In July 2010, officials representing 13 Chinese cities signed a "China Red Tourism Cities Strategic Cooperation Yan'an Declaration" to develop red tourism; the cities are: Guang'an, Yan'an, Xiangtan, Jinggangshan, Ruijin, Zunyi, Baise, Shijiazhuang, Linyi, Anyang, Yulin, Qingyang, and Huining.[ref]

St. Patrick's was a mission church of Immaculate Conception in Amenia, NY. In 1864, Father John Arsenigo, pastor at Croton Falls would say Mass in the homes around Millerton. It was he who purchased the land and started to build the churches in Amenia and Millerton.LaMorte, Rev. Richard, ''Immaculate Conception-St. Patrick Parish. 1868 to Present 1988
Father Arsenigo was succeeded by Father Tandy, who in turn was succeeded by Father F.E. Lavelle. Father Lavelle inherited responsibility for the mission and its $2,000 debt. The debt proved a severe burden for the mission due to the closing of the neighboring mines and furnaces. A substantial portion of the funds were raised by Martin Griffith, who around 1905 penned polite notes to county officials and acquaintances.Hasbrouck, Frank, ed.

The head is more colourful with a reddish-yellow frons. The wings are marked with three incomplete dark cross-bands and an isolated dark spot.
This insect, first found in 2001, surprisingly, appears to be more closely related to congeners from the Indomalaya ecozone rather than other European species. The location of the type locality, far from airports and major cities, suggests accidental introduction is unlikely. The specific name merzi is in honour of the entomologist Bernhard Merz.

Indianapolis Park or Athletic Park (II) is the name of a former baseball ground located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The ground was the Sunday home field of the Indianapolis Hoosiers baseball club of the National League from 1888 to 1889.Indianapolis Hoosiers Attendance, Stadiums, and Park Factors at baseball-reference.com, URL accessed December 7, 2009. Archived 12/7/09
It was located on a block bounded by New York Street (north); Arsenal Avenue (east); East Ohio Street (south); and Hanna Street (now Oriental Street) (west).
The venue was used for Sunday games, due to blue laws that prevented play at their primary home, Tinker Park. During 1887, the club had used the Bruce Grounds for Sundays, but it was thought to be too far away from the city center to draw well.
The ballpark site is now occupied by a residential neighborhood.

Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners (LPHC) No. 3 ''R H Smyth'' is a preserved Irish steam locomotive.
Built by Avonside Engineering Company of Bristol, England works No. 2021 in 1928.  A fairly typical 0-6-0 saddle tank built to the 5'3" Irish broad gauge, she led a rather uneventful life shunting the dual gauge (5'3" and 3') docks in Derry on the west bank of the River Foyle in Northern Ireland.  She was equipped with a single off-centre buffer and coupling at each end for shunting 3' gauge stock, in addition to conventional buffers and drawhooks for 5'3" gauge.  After withdrawal, she was bought privately in 1968 before being sold for £1 to the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland at Whitehead in 1972.[tpl]cite web | title=Five Foot Three No.14| work=RPSI| url=http://www.steamtrainsireland.com/5ft3/5ft3_14.html#smyth| accessdate=2011-02-15[/tpl]  The engine then acquired the nickname 'Harvey' in honour of showjumper Harvey Smith. 
In 2000, 30 years after the end of mainline steam in Northern Ireland, No. 3 achieved something of a celebrity status when she was hired by Henry Boot Ltd to help engineering work on the relaying of the  Bleach Green Junction - Antrim railway line.  This was followed in 2005 by another contract assisting the relaying of the Carrickfergus - Whitehead railway line.

[[Kingdom of Candia]]
CATEGORIES: Kingdom of Candia, Byzantine Empire successor states

The Kingdom of Candia ([tpl]lang-it|Regno di Candia[/tpl]) or Duchy of Candia ([tpl]lang-it|Ducato di Candia[/tpl]) was the official name of Crete during the island's period as an overseas colony of the Republic of Venice, from the initial Venetian conquest in 1205–1212 to its fall to the Ottoman Empire during the Cretan War (1645–1669). The island was at the time and up to the early modern era commonly known as Candia after its capital, Candia or Chandax (modern Heraklion). In modern Greek historiography, the period is known as the Venetocracy ([tpl]lang-el|Βενετοκρατία[/tpl], Venetokratia or Ενετοκρατία, Enetokratia).
The island of Crete had formed part of the Byzantine Empire until 1204, when the Fourth Crusade dissolved the empire and divided its territories amongst the crusader leaders (see Frankokratia). Crete was initially allotted to Boniface of Montferrat, but, unable to enforce his control over the island, he soon sold his rights to Venice. Venetian troops first occupied the island in 1205, but it took until 1212 for it to be secured, especially against the opposition of Venice's rival Genoa. Thereafter, the new colony took shape: the island was divided into six provinces (sestieri) named after the divisions of the city of Venice itself, while the capital Candia was directly subjected to the Commune Veneciarum. The islands of Tinos and Cythera, also under Venetian control, came under the kingdom's purview. In the early 14th century, this division was replaced by four provinces, almost identical to the four modern prefectures.
During the first two centuries of Venetian rule, revolts by the native Orthodox Greek population against the Roman Catholic Venetians were frequent, often supported by the Empire of Nicaea. Fourteen revolts are counted between 1207 and the last major uprising, the Revolt of St. Titus in the 1360s, which united the Greeks and the Venetian coloni against the financial exactions of the metropolis. Thereafter, and despite occasional revolts and Turkish raids, the island largely prospered, and Venetian rule opened up a window into the ongoing Italian Renaissance. As a consequence, an artistic and literary revival unparalleled elsewhere in the Greek world took place: the Cretan School of painting, which culminated in the works of El Greco, united Italian and Byzantine forms, and a widespread literature using the local idiom emerged, culminating with the early 17th-century romances Erotokritos and Erophile.
After the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571, Crete was Venice's last major overseas possession. The Republic's relative military weakness, coupled with the island's wealth and its strategic location controlling the waterways of the Eastern Mediterranean attracted the attention of the Ottoman Empire. In the long and devastating Cretan War (1645–1669), the two states fought over the possession of Crete: the Ottomans quickly overran most of the island, but failed to take Candia, which held out, aided by Venetian naval superiority and Ottoman distractions elsewhere, until 1669. Only the three island fortresses of Souda, Gramvousa and Spinalonga remained in Venetian hands. Attempts to recover Candia during the Morean War failed, and these last Venetian outposts were finally taken by the Turks in 1715, during the last Ottoman–Venetian War.

The Legend of Sun Knight (simplified Chinese: 吾命骑士; traditional Chinese: 吾命騎士; Pinyin: wú mìng qíshì) is a 2010 Taiwanese novel by Yu Wo adapted into a manhua illustrated by Os Rabbit Cat. This work is based on an inspiration by the author to "expose a knight's true colors."[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] It is written in a relaxed style, filled with nonsensical humor. Written in first person, the story takes place in a fantasy world where there are multiple gods and the earth is divided into many countries and religions. Among these religions, the Sanctuary of the God of Light is the one that has the longest history and is one of the three largest religions on the continent. The novel details the story of the Sanctuary of the God of Light's 38th generation Sun Knight, Grisia Sun, and his companions. Sun Knight appears to be a kind warrior that forgives even the worst criminals, but the reader learns that he actually hates having to talk about the Sun God every time he speaks. The story is, at first, a comedy-drama about the Sun Knight's antics in his facade of purity and chivalry, and progresses into his transformation into a Demon King and back into the Sun Knight.

Walk forward optimization is a method used in finance for determining the best parameters to use in a trading strategy.  The trading strategy is optimized with in sample data for a time window in a data series.  The remainder of the data are reserved for out of sample testing.  A small portion of the reserved data following the in sample data is tested with the results recorded.  The in sample time window is shifted forward by the period covered by the out of sample test, and the process repeated.  At the end, all of the recorded results are used to assess the trading strategy.[tpl]cite book|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=Charles D.|last2=Dahlquist|first2=Julie R.|title=Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I5SgX5q5sQEC&pg=PA548|accessdate=13 June 2011|date=2010-11-15|publisher=FT Press|isbn=978-0-13-705944-7|page=548[/tpl]
It means to get the most suitable/stable parameters of the system and run the system with these parameters using another segment of data and these two segments of data do not overlap each other. It is the culmination of the following methods and helps in creation of robust systems.
Backtesting is using past data to test a trading system. It's useful because if a system was not profitable in the past it will not be profitable in the future. It refers to applying a trading system to historical data to verify how a system would have performed during the specified time period.Investopedia: Backtesting And Forward Testing
Forward testing is also known as Walk forward testing is the simulation of the real markets data on paper only. It means that though you are moving along the markets live, but you are not actually putting in real money, but doing virtual trading in lie markets to understand the movements of markets better. Hence, it is also called as the Paper Trading. Forward performance testing is a simulation of actual trading and involves following the system's logic in a live market.

Postmodern interpretations of the law can involve critically considering legal inequalities connected to gender, class, race and ethnicity by acknowledging "diversity and multiplicity".  Critical practices connected to postmodern philosophy, such as critical literacy and deconstruction, can be used as an interpretative tool to ensure that a range of different and diverse values and norms are acknowledged or considered.Deflam, Mathieu (2008) Sociology of Law: Visions of a Scholarly Tradition - Chapter 10, Cambridge University Press

The Curtiss-Wright KD2C Skeet was an American target drone produced by Curtiss-Wright that began development in 1945. 
"The Skeet was a pulsejet-powered, air-launched expendable drone designed for the U.S. Navy for fleet gunnery training. It could use a 36-centimeter (14-inch) McDonnell J-11, McDonnell J-9 or Continental pulsejet engine. Control was provided by two axis elevators and ailerons through a radio receiver and gyro stabilizing system. The drone could fly for 30 minutes and reach 540 kilometers (335 miles) per hour."
"The Skeet project began in August 1945 and produced its first experimental model was produced in 1947. However, the Skeet's unusual internally mounted pulsejet proved unsatisfactory because it produced low speed and high fuel consumption in both wind tunnel and flight tests at the Navy's Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, California. The project was cancelled in 1949."

Cattleya alaorii, commonly known as the Laelia alaorii, is a species of orchid endemic to Brazil (Bahia). It was discovered in the 70's in an isolated mountain chain near Itabuna, Bahia, where it grows in very wet rainforest at about 600m above sea level. The plants are epiphytes in tall trees up to 40m high, and grow in the top branches where they get a fair amount of light. Their environment is always foggy and minimum temperatures in winter are never less than 15C. The species was named after Mr. Alaor Oliveira, former employee at the University of São Paulo at Piracicaba, who first collected this species in a field excursion in the late 60's.

He had previously won several important races including the Long Walk Hurdle, Reynoldstown Novices' Chase, Mumm Club Chase as well as finishing third to Jodami in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/horse_home.sd?horse_id=12310#topHorseTabs=horse_race_record&bottomHorseTabs=horse_form |title=Royal Athlete Record By Race Type |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05[/tpl]
The horse had been among the favourites for the 1993 Grand National but fell in the race, which was later declared void due to an unrecalled false start. In 1995 his trainer Jenny Pitman tried to talk the owners, Gary and Libby Johnson out of running him at Aintree, confessing to the BBC's Des Lynam in a post race interview that she thought they were "Mad bringing him here 'cause he could win the Scottish National (scheduled to be run two weeks later) doing triple toeloops." As it was, Royal Athlete was pulled up in that race at Ayr and was retired shortly afterwards.
Royal Athlete returned to Aintree for the next seven years to take part in the parade of champions before his death in May 2003 at the age of 20.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grand-national.me.uk/royalathlete1995.php |title=Royal Athlete 1995 Grand National |publisher=Grand-national.me.uk |date=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2014-01-05[/tpl]

The Globe KD5G was an American target drone produced by Globe Aircraft Corporation that began development in 1949. 
"The XKD5G-1 was an early pulsejet-powered U.S. Navy target drone. The pulsejet was mounted externally, as on the German V-1 missile of World War II, but was smaller. The drone could fly 540 kilometers (335 miles) per hour and could be recovered by parachute for reuse."
"The XK5DG-1 originated in 1949 and was tested at the Naval Air Test Center, Point Mugu, California. By 1951-52, speed requirements for drones had increased, and pulsejets were not effective beyond an altitude of 9,144 meters (30,000 feet). Thus, further development of the XKD5G-1 was abandoned. The XKD5G-1 was one of the last uses of pulsejets by the U.S. military."

Robert Bigsby (11 April 1806 - 27 September 1873) was an English antiquarian and author.
Bigsby was born in Castle Gate, Nottingham in 1806, son of Robert Bigsby, the registrar of the archdeaconry of Nottingham.
His father had visited the United States in 1787 where he had often been the guest of George Washington.
He was educated at Repton School during the headmastership of William Boultbee Sleath, and originally intended to become a lawyer. However, he turned to the study of antiquities and in particular to collecting memorabilia of Sir Francis Drake, the famous navigator of the Elizabethan era. He had inherited Drake's astrolabe, and in 1831 he presented the instrument to King William IV, who in turn presented it to Greenwich Hospital.
He presented other relics of Drake to the British Museum.
Bigsby was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Glasgow, became a member of several foreign literary societies, was voted a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and in 1837 a Fellow of the Royal Society (although ejected in 1845 for non-payment) and became secretary and registrar of the English "Langue" of the Knights Hospitaller. He was a prolific author, writing poetry and drama but mainly concentrating on antiquarian subjects, publishing sixteen books and many articles in magazines and reviews.
He died on 27 September 1873 at Peckham Rye, aged 67.

The mass includes the usual text, such as the Kyrie and the Agnus Dei, and also other text, hymns, and instrumental pieces. The mass is an environmental liturgy of contemporary music. It features the instrumentation of the Paul Winter Consort along with a choir, vocal soloists, and the calls of wolves, whales, and many other animals that are woven into the pieces, sometimes used as the melody.
Since it was first written, the mass is performed annually at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine at The Feast of St. Francis which is the blessing of the animals.

Recording and writing for the album roughly began in the summer of 2010, but full production did not begin until August 2010, after U-Know Yunho and Max Changmin debuted their first performance as a duo at the SM Town Live '10 World Tour concert in Seoul, South Korea.
Bringing in a new line of producers, including E-Tribe and Outsidaz, Keep Your Head Down largely consists of dance-pop songs with urban and electronic arrangements.

Released in two different versions, the album spawned two promotional singles with one lead single, "Keep Your Head Down". Lyrically, the album explores dark themes of relationships, betrayal and self-empowerment.
In South Korea, the album debuted at number one on the Gaon Albums Chart for the week of January 8, 2011, and maintained its number-one position for a second week. By the end of the month, Gaon reported that 230,227 copies were shipped. By the end of the year, 263,412 copies of the album were sold in South Korea alone,[tpl]cite web|url=http://star.mk.co.kr/new/view.php?mc=ST&no=447887&year=2012|title=List of 2012 sales for S.M.

In basketball, a three-point field goal (also known as a "three-pointer" or "3-pointer") is a field goal made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc radiating from the basket.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/baskBasi/glos.asp|title=Basketball glossary|work=FIBA.com|accessdate=March 5, 2010[/tpl] A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-point line. The National Basketball Association's (NBA) three-point shooting leader is the player with the highest three-point field goal percentage in a given season. The statistic was first recognized in the 1979–80 season when the three-point line was first implemented that season. To qualify as a three-point shooting leader, the player must have at least 55 three-point field goals made. This has been the entry criteria since the 1999–2000 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/rate_stat_req.html|title=Rate Statistic Requirements|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=March 5, 2010[/tpl]
Craig Hodges, Steve Kerr, Jason Kapono and Kyle Korver have each led the league in three-point shooting for two seasons. Kapono is the only player to do so in consecutive seasons.  Korver, who shot 53.6% from beyond the arc in the 2009–10 season, holds the all-time record for three-point field goal percentage in a season.

USS ''Yarrow'' (SP-1010) was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919. 
Yarrow was built in 1913 as a private wooden-hulled motorboat of the same name by Kargard at Chicago, Illinois. In 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired Yarrow from her owner, K. D. Clark, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned on 27 July 1917 as USS Yarrow (SP-1010) and the Navy formally acquired her from Clark under a free lease on 27 August 1917.
Assigned to the 9th Naval District, Yarrow patrolled the waters of Lake Michigan for the rest of the 1917 Great Lakes shipping season. After being laid up for the winter of 1917-1918 while the lakes were frozen over, she resumed her patrol duties in the spring of 1918 and continued them through the end of the 1918 shipping season late in the year. 
The Navy returned Yarrow to Clark on 7 March 1919 and she was stricken from the Navy List the same day.

Putnam and Mellor Engine and Hose Company Firehouse was a historic fire station located at Port Chester, Westchester County, New York. It was built in 1888 and is a three story, three bay wide, masonry building in the Queen Anne style.  It is constructed of red brick  with stone stringcourses and terra cotta decoration.  It features a low hipped roof with decorative gable ends and a corner bell tower.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10679|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:Putnam and Mellor Engine and Hose Company Firehouse|date=August 1983|accessdate=2010-12-30 |author=Austin N.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
The official name of this firehouse was the South Main Street Firehouse.  The address was 46 South Main Street, Port Chester, NY.  As described above, it housed the Putnam Engine & Hose Company, No.2 (founded Oct. 1854) and the Mellor Engine & Hose Company, No.3.  The fire engines for these companies are Engine 63 and Engine 61, respectively.  
In 1995 the rear wall of the South Main Street Firehouse collapsed, rendering the firehouse uninhabitable.  Putnam and Mellor were temporarily displaced and eventually relocated to their current home – the South End Fire Station (51-53 Grace Church Street, Port Chester, NY).  This new firehouse was completed in 2001.
Despite public outcry and despite being on the Register of Historic places, on November 17, 2007 the South Main Street Firehouse was demolished.

[[Miliband–Poulantzas debate]]

CATEGORIES: Marxist theory, Debates

The Miliband–Poulantzas debate was a debate between Marxist theorists Ralph Miliband and Nicos Poulantzas concerning the nature of the state. Their exchange was published in the New Left Review beginning with Poulantzas’ review of Miliband’s 1969 publication on bourgeois democracies, The State in Capitalist Society.Poulantzas, N. & Miliband, R. (1972). The Problem of the Capitalist State. In R. Blackburn (ed.) Ideology in Social Science: Readings in Critical Social Theory. NY: Pantheon Books. Pp. 238-262.Block, F. (1987). State Theory in Context. In Revising State Theory: Essays in Politics and Postindustrialism. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press. pp 3-38.[tpl]rp| 6-7[/tpl] In their exchange, Miliband argues for an instrumentalist model of the capitalist state, whereas Poulantzas takes a structural position.
In The State in Capitalist Society, Miliband puts forth his theory how the state functions to serve capitalist interests. It does so because of (a) the social origins of members of state government and (b) the personal ties and influence between members of state government and the ruling class elites.Miliband, R. (1969). The State in Capitalist Society. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson.
Poulantzas disagrees with Miliband's approach, adopting a  structural position. He claims the state is objectively a capitalist entity, which can serve no purpose other than preserving the capitalist mode of production. Furthermore, he argues that if members of the Ruling class are the same people managing the state it is merely a coincidence: the state serves capitalist interests regardless of who is in charge.In his critique he claims,
 
 “The relation between the bourgeois class and the state is an objective relation. This means that if the function of the state in a determinate social formation and the interests of the dominant class coincide, it is by reason of the system itself: the direct participation of members of the ruling class in the state apparatus is not the cause but the effect…”[tpl]rp| 247[/tpl]

In a response to Poulantzas' criticisms, Miliband counters that Poulantzas’ position allows no room for agency and is therefore too limiting. His point of view does not allow individuals to make decisions based on their own free will, but rather, their decisions are determined solely by the structure of society.
 
 "For what his exclusive stress on ‘objective relations’ suggests is that what the state does is in every particular and at all times wholly determined by these ‘objective relations’: in other words, that the structural constraints of the system are so absolutely compelling as to turn those who run the state into the merest functionaries and executants of policies imposed upon them by ‘the system’"[tpl]rp| 258-9[/tpl]

[[Genera of Syrphidae]]
CATEGORIES: Hoverflies

(Document translated and modified from Italian Wiki Pagehttp://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generi_di_Syrphidae)
The family Syrphidae consists of more than 6000 living species. The internal taxonomy of the family and the number of genera varies greatly between sources leading to considerable discrepancy across the literature.  This is currently in the process of reorganization on the basis of phylogenetic studies but knowledge is still incomplete, especially in light of recent studies of larval characters suggesting relationships which don't correspond with the phylogeny based solely on adult characters. 
The current classification is therefore still based on the morphology of adults and basically refers to the taxonomic scheme adopted by Thompson & Rotheray in the Manual of Palaearctic Diptera (1998), which divides the family into three subfamilies and fourteen tribes. 
The nomenclature given here is derived partly from the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera (BDWD) and a working classification created by a group of molecular biologistsLifedesks: Classification of Syrphidae http://syrphidae.lifedesks.org/node/1476 which no doubt will alter greatly in the future.
The distribution of genera in traditional ecozones is derived from the BDWD.

It is a four story, "L" shaped building built of granite blocks in the Renaissance Revival style.  It features a five story tower and a corbelled battlement parapet that conceals a flat roof.  It was designed by Stanford White and built in 1892 as a dwelling for Whitelaw Reid. Frederick Law Olmsted was hired to landscape his estate.  Reid Hall occupies the footprint of the previous property owner Ben Holladay's Ophir Hall, which burnt down and was rebuilt by Reid with the massive granite crenellated mansion. The building was expanded in 1912 by McKim, Mead & White with a large library wing and guest cottage.  Reid Hall was at one time a potential site for the United Nations.  The property was purchased by Manhattanville College in 1951.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10683|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:Reid Hall, Manhattanville College|date=March 1973|accessdate=2010-12-30 |author=Edna Hibbs, Joan M.

USS ''Geraldine'' (SP-1011) was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1918.
Geraldine was built in 1916 as the private motorboat Albion by George Lawley & Son at Neponset, Massachusetts. She later was renamed Geraldine.
On 24 July 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired Geraldine from her owner, Frederick S. Fish of South Bend, Indiana, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. Fish delivered her to the Navy at Chicago, Illinois, on 8 September 1917, and she was commissioned as USS Geraldine (SP-1011) on 13 September 1917 with her owner, Ensign Frederick S. Fish, USNRF, in command. 
Assigned to the 9th Naval District and based at Great Lakes, Illinois, Geraldine patrolled in Lake Michigan until late in 1917, when she was laid up at Chicago for the winter because of the annual icing over of the Great Lakes. Returning to service on Lake Michigan on 6 April 1918 after the spring thaw, Geraldine resumed her patrol and guard ship duties for the rest of World War I. She also served as a dispatch boat in the Sault Ste, Marie, Michigan, area from 12 May 1918 to 19 August 1918. 
Geraldine was stricken from the Navy List on 17 December 1918 and the Navy returned her to Fish on 7 January 1919.

It provides mobile connectivity for on-demand traffic information services and internet provided maps displayed inside select Honda vehicles. The service began August 1997 and was first offered in the 1998 Honda Accord and the Honda Torneo sold only in Japan starting July 1998. The service received a revision to services offered October 2002, adding traffic information delivery capabilities for subscribers to the Internavi Premium Club, and was optional on most Honda vehicles sold in Japan. VICS was integrated into the service starting September 2003. Membership in the service has steadily grown to exceed 5 million subscribers as of March 2007.
The subscription service replaces the need to periodically update in-car navigation systems that use CD, or DVD installed maps that must be updated with the latest information. The maps are sent by internet connections established through the drivers cellphone with a data download plan associated with the cellphone. 
The service is available without having to purchase a Honda vehicle installed with the technology; The Internavi LINC is available at both the Apple App Store and Android Market and can be installed on compatible mobile devices.
One of the features offered is the ability to overlay weather information on the in-car map screen in 3D. Route guidance is provided in conjunction with VICS provided information so as to display a large weather disturbance approaching, such as a snow storm or typhoon, allowing drivers to take alternate routes.

[[Word-of-mouth marketing]]

CATEGORIES: Promotion and marketing communications

Word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM, WOM marketing), also called word of mouth advertising, differs from naturally occurring WOM, in that it is actively influenced or encouraged by organisations (e.g. 'seeding' a message in a network, rewarding regular consumers to enage in WOM, employing WOM 'agents'). While it is difficult to truly control WOM, research [tpl]cite journal|last=Lang|first=Bodo|coauthors=Hyde, Ken|title=Word of mouth: what we know and what we have yet to learn|journal=Journal of consumer satisfaction, dissatisfaction and complaining behavior|year=2013|volume=26|pages=1-18|url=Available through ProQuest database. ProQuest document ID: 1478021321|accessdate=January 2014[/tpl] has shown that there are three generic avenues to 'manage' WOM for the purpose of WOMM: 1) Build a strong WOM foundation (e.g. sufficient levels of satisfaction, trust and commitment), 2) Indirect WOMM management which implies that managers only have a moderate amount of control (e.g. controverisal advertising, teaser campaigns, customer membership clubs), 3) Direct WOMM management, which has higher levels of control (e.g. paid WOM 'agents', "friend get friend" schemes). Proconsumer WOM has been suggested as a counterweight to commercially motivated word of mouth.

[[Sandbakelse]]

CATEGORIES: Norwegian cuisine, Cookies, Christmas food, Cuisine of Minnesota

Sandbakelse or Sandbakkels (meaning sand tarts) or Sandkaker are a Norwegian sugar cookie.  They are a Christmas tradition in many families.
Sandbakelse are made of flour, butter, eggs, sugar, and almond extract - possibly with vanilla or cardamom. After the dough is mixed and cooled, it is pressed into fluted tins. Children as young as two or three can help with this phase, so it is a first baking experience for many. After ten minutes in the oven, popping the cookies out of the hot tins is best left to adults.
In 1845 a recipe for sandbakelse appeared in a Norwegian cookbook, but they were not widespread until later in the 19th century. They became popular later than the similar krumkake because sandbakelse required fine flour, which wasn't yet widely available.Stokker, Kathleen. Keeping Christmas: Yuletide Traditions in Norway and the New Land. Minnesota Historical Society Press, St. Paul, 2001, p. 27. Emigrants took their tins and recipes west across the sea, where sandbakelse remain an "old-country" Christmas tradition for many Norwegian-Americans.

He became the Member of Parliament for Ballynakill in 1756 and Lisburn in 1768. He was appointed as Solicitor-General in 1764 and became Chief Justice of Common Pleas in 1770. He held office until his death although he had been contemplating retirement due to ill health.
He was a native of Ennis, County Clare; and was the third son of Montrose Paterson. He went to school in Limerick and graduated from the University of Dublin.
In character he seems to have been an eighteenth-century "rake": he was famed for his hospitality, shortened his life by heavy drinking and fought numerous duels. On the other hand he was  a considerable scholar, a fine lawyer and a diligent and zealous law officer.

The church was rebuilt after a fire in the 11th century, but was eventually destroyed again in the 13th century and not rebuilt; it is known today due to excavations directly under extant administrative buildings.  The surviving foundations indicate a rectangular nave and a semicircular apse; archaeological surveys uncovered tombs for members of the royal Přemyslid dynasty which was prominent in Bohemia during the early Christian era.

The Tarantelle in A-flat major, Op. 43 is a short piano piece in tarantella form, written by Frédéric Chopin in June 1841 and published in October 1841.Internet Chopin Information Centre  It takes about 3 minutes to play.Classical Archives
The Tarantelle is a moto perpetuo marked Presto, and requires an advanced technique.  It was inspired by Gioachino Rossini's song La Danza, also written in the tarantella's characteristic 6/8 rhythm.  Chopin went to some lengths to ensure the time signature was the same as Rossini's, and he enlisted his friend Julian Fontana to check the best editions of the Rossini work for this detail.  The manuscript shows Chopin changed his time signature from 12/8 to 6/8.Sotheby’s Auctions  There is no evidence the work was commissioned, nor was it dedicated to anyone.
Robert Schumann described it as being in "Chopin's most extravagant manner; we see before us the dancer, whirling as if possessed, until our senses reel. To be sure, nobody could call this music lovely, but we willingly forgive the master his wild fantasy. For is he not once in a while permitted to display the dark side of his soul?..."Schumann, Gesammelte Schriften, edited by M. Kreisig (1914), II, 151, quoted at http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159486148Frederick Niecks, Chopin as Man and Musician
Chopin himself said "I hope I won't write anything as dreadful too soon".The Chopin Project  Despite this self-criticism, it has become a recording favourite, although it is less frequently performed in recital.

On the southeast side of the islet, a small distance away, there is another larger islet called Souda. In ancient times these two islets were referred to as Leukai (Greek for "white ones") and pronounced "Lefkai". Their name came from the ancient Greek myth about a musical contest between the Sirens and the Muses.  Out of their anguish from losing the competition, writes Stephanus of Byzantium, the Muses plucked their rivals' feathers from their wings; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera ("featherless") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai.Caroline M.

[[Mutschel]]

CATEGORIES: Breads, Reutlingen, Swabian cuisine, Dice games

The Mutschel is a traditional star-shaped bread from Reutlingen, Germany. The pastry, and the corresponding Mutscheltag (Mutschel Day), have probably existed since the 13th century. Mutscheln are roughly circular and come in various sizes: usually approximately six inches in diameter, but bakeries often offer breads three or more feet in diameter. They are sometimes made in sweet varieties.
There are several theories about the origin of the bread form. One is that the high central part of the bread represents the castle atop the Achalm, a hill next to Reutlingen, and the eight points of the star represent medieval guilds. The star could also have Christian allegorical meaning as the Star of Bethlehem. A third possibility is that Reutlingen baker Albrecht Mutschler invented the shape in the 14th century. This baker was mentioned first in the 1435 Reutlinger Heimatbuch.Reutlinger Heimatbuch. 1954, p. 37.

[[Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands]]
CATEGORIES: Japanese home islands campaign, History of the Northern Mariana Islands, World War II aerial operations and battles of the Pacific theatre

During World War II, a series of Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands took place between November 1944 and January 1945. These raids targeted United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bases and sought to disrupt the bombing of Japan by B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers operating from the islands. The Japanese lost 37 aircraft during this operation, but destroyed 11 B-29s and damaged a further 43. Preparations were also made for commando raids on the bases in early and mid-1945 but these did not go ahead.
While the attacks on the Mariana Islands did not seriously disrupt the USAAF air campaign, they had an effect on other American operations. After determining that the Japanese raiders were staging through Iwo Jima, American forces stepped up their attacks on that island. While the decision to invade Iwo Jima had been made before the raids commenced, stopping the attacks formed part of the justification for the landing. In addition, further air defense units were deployed to the Mariana Islands to protect the B-29 bases.

After a blockade by Royal Navy ships under Horatio Nelson, a landing was made and British troops were put ashore where they joined with around 1,200 Corsicans. The town was dominated by two defensive towers, one to the north at Mortella Point and the other at the strong Convention Redoubt. Once these had been taken the town agreed to surrender and the British fleet under Lord Hood was able to sail into its harbour.Gregory Anglo-Corsican Kingdom p.67-68 A large number of its defenders were able to escape to Bastia where they participated in its defence.
Saint-Florent was one of three major French garrisons on Corsica. The Anglo-Corsican forces successfully followed it up by capturing Bastia in May and Calvi in August 1794.

[[Clontarf (ship)]]

CATEGORIES: Clippers

The Clontarf was an immigration clipper ship which sailed from England to New Zealand between 1858 and 1860 on commission for the Canterbury Provincial Government. Sailing under the flag of Willis, Gann and Co, its first voyage sailed from Plymouth 20 September 1858, and after a journey of 105 days arrived at Lyttelton on 5 January 1859 with 412 immigrants. With one successful run complete it returned to England to collect its next passengers. On 30 November 1859 The Clontarf left London with 430 people on board. This voyage met with unforgiving bad weather, and a rampant plague of measles, whooping cough and tropical diseases swept mercilessly through the ship. It arrived at Lyttelton after 105 days with many fatalities. On a normal voyage for any other immigration ship of that time it was expected that up to five people may die from frailty, accident or birth at sea. On the second voyage of the Clontarf 41 people perished. Among the dead were five adults, but it was the large amount of children death that was to give Clontarf her infamy. Thirty-six children died on board. 
Due to her reputation immigrants chose not to sail on her again, and she was officially dismissed of her duties of ferrying immigrants to New Zealand in 1861.

[[Purnell's Old Folks Country Sausage]]

CATEGORIES: Brand name meats, Companies based in Kentucky, Kentucky cuisine, Shelby County, Kentucky, Sausage companies

Purnell's "Old Folks" Country Sausage is a brand of breakfast sausage that is manufactured in Simpsonville, Kentucky, by the F.B. Purnell Sausage Company. Products are distributed throughout the Midwest and the South.
Purnell's was founded by Fred B. "Old Folks" Purnell with the help of his wife Clara (who lived to be 102 years old) http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/04/26/biz_biz2lp.html, the father of Allen Purnell, Sr. who is the current spokesman for all of Purnell's commercials.  Fred was nicknamed "Old Folks" as a boy because he loved hearing stories from the "old folks".  He first created his sausage in 1932 because he missed the homemade sausage he grew up with and used the "whole hog" with the best cuts of hams, loins, and shoulders and his special blend of salt, pepper, and seasonings (all of which remain a trademark of their sausage to this day).  One day, a co-worker at the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company (Fred was a steam engine mechanic) tried some of his sausage and wanted to buy some.  Soon word spread of how good his sausage was and by the time Fred retired, he decided to start his own sausage business in Louisville, Kentucky, in the 1950s, later building its plant in nearby Simpsonsville. http://itsgooo-od.com/about-us/a-story-of-family
Since the 1960s, Purnell's sausage advertisements (typically starring Al Purnell and later his children and grandchildren) have been a staple during University of Kentucky basketball games.  Purnell's is also known for its slogan "It's Gooooood!"  In addition to its breakfast sausage (sold in boxes of patties, links, or 16 ounce rolls in its original medium flavor and a variety of others—including lower fat turkey sausage), Purnell's also sells bologna, franks, Italian sausage links and rolls, smoked sausage, fresh and cooked bratwurst, chorizo, souse, frozen sausage biscuits, prepared sausage gravy and frozen sausage balls.
Purnell's products are served in Cracker Barrel and Dairy Queen restaurants, among others.

Armstrong Row is a series of 11 brick row houses in Maysville, Kentucky built between 1820 and 1833 by John Armstrong, a local industrialist, entrepreneur and real estate developer.   Vacant lots were purchased by an Armstrong owned company that operated the Maysville cotton mill.  The company continued to operate as the January & Wood Company until 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abandonedonline.net/industry/january-and-wood-company/|title= January and Wood Company|accessdate=2011-01-02|work=Abandonedonline.net[/tpl]  Armstrong also developed a number of other row house projects in Maysville including the  Federal style row houses on Limestone Street,  Mechanic's Row, and the  "Allen Block". 
The Armstrong Row houses are two story brick with gable roofs and stepped parapet walls in both Federal and Greek Revival style.  The facade is Flemish bond and sides are common bond.  Although similar in construction, the gable roofs vary in pitch suggesting the buildings were constructed either by more than one builder or over a period of time.  
John Armstrong was born in Ireland in 1779 and emigrated to America with his family circa 1790.  He bought his first Maysville property in 1800 from Jacob Boone, a first cousin of Daniel Boone.   He later operated several wholesale houses on front street becoming wealthy in the process. 
Armstrong was instrumental in the early development of the city and was the first to sign a petition to move the county seat from Washington to Maysville.  He was a member of the company responsible for building the Maysville and Lexington Turnpike, he established the first bank in Kentucky  in Maysville in 1818, and was a member of the committee that welcomed General Lafayette to Maysville in an 1825 visit.

Bidaram Krishnappa was a Konkani-speaking Gowda Saraswath Brahmin and a native of Nandalike in modern Udupi district, Karnataka. When he was a boy he had a chance encounter with a rich businessman who loved music. This happened when hungry Krishnappa, who came from a poor family, was singing a devotional song (devaranama) in a local temple. Impressed with his voice, the merchant sponsored Krishnappa to train under the guidance of a musician called Ramaswamy. He later came under the influence of Tammayya and Veena Sheshanna.Pranesh, Meera Rajaram (2003), Musical composers during Wodeyar dynasty, 1638-1947 A.D.. Vee Emm Publications, p149 Bidaram Krishnappa is credited with having popularised the singing of Kannada devaranama on stage. He adapted certain concepts of Hindustani music into his Carnatic compositions. For his scholarship in music, he earned the titles "Shudda Swaracharya", "Pallavi Krishnappa" and "Gana Visharada". One of his disciples, T. Chowdiah, went on to become a music legend. Krishnappa was most famous for writing and rendering devaranama and kirtans.Pranesh (2003), p151

In 3+1D and higher, propagating gravitational waves exist, but not in 2+1D or 1+1D. In 2+1D, general relativity becomes a topological field theory with no local degrees of freedom, and all 1+1D models are locally flat. However, a slightly more complicated generalization of general relativity which includes dilatons will turn the 2+1D model into one admitting mixed propagating dilaton-gravity waves, as well as making the 1+1D model geometrically nontrivial locally. The 1+1D model still does not admit any propagating gravitational (or dilaton) degrees of freedom, but with the addition of matter fields, it becomes a simplified, but still nontrivial model. With other numbers of dimensions, a dilaton-gravity coupling can always be rescaled away by a conformal rescaling of the metric, converting the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. But not in two dimensions, because the conformal weight of the dilaton is now 0. The metric in this case is more amenable to analytical solutions than the general 3+1D case. And of course, 0+1D models cannot capture any nontrivial aspect of relativity because there is no space at all.
This class of models retains just enough complexity to include among its solutions black holes, their formation, FRW cosmological models, gravitational singularities, etc. In the quantized version of such models with matter fields, Hawking radiation also shows up, just as in higher-dimensional models.

[tpl]nihongo|Lady Saigō|西郷の局[tpl]lang|en| or [/tpl]西郷局|Saigō-no-Tsubone[/tpl] (1552 – 1 July 1589), also known as Oai, was the first consort and trusted confidante of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the samurai lord who unified Japan at the end of the sixteenth century and then ruled as Shogun. She was also the mother of the second Tokugawa shogun, Tokugawa Hidetada.
During their relationship, Lady Saigō influenced Ieyasu's philosophies, choice of allies, and policies as he rose to power during the late Sengoku period, and she thus had an indirect effect on the organization and composition of the Tokugawa shogunate. Although less is known of her than some other figures of the era, she is generally regarded as the "power behind the throne", and her life has been compared to a "Cinderella story" of feudal Japan.Mochida (2000–2013). Her contributions were considered so significant that she was posthumously inducted to the Senior First Rank of the Imperial Court, the highest honor that could be conferred by the Emperor of Japan.
Once she was in a respected and secure position as first consort and mother to Ieyasu's heir, Lady Saigō used her influence and wealth for charitable purposes. A devout Buddhist, she donated money to temples in Suruga province, where she resided as the consort of Ieyasu, first in Hamamatsu Castle and later in Sunpu Castle. As she was quite near-sighted, she also established a charitable organization that assisted visually impaired women with no other means of support. Lady Saigō died at a fairly young age, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Although murder was suspected, no culprit was identified.
Lady Saigō bore four children: she had a son and a daughter (Saigō Katsutada and Tokuhime) while married, and she later bore two sons as the consort of Tokugawa Ieyasu: Tokugawa Hidetada and Matsudaira Tadayoshi. Among the descendants of Lady Saigō was the Empress Meishō (1624–1696), one of very few women to accede to the Chrysanthemum Throne as empress regnant.

Adults are day-flying and have orange (female) or clear (male) wings with a wingspan of 20-24 mm. Adults emerge in late summer, and larvae develop during the fall, winter, and spring. The species is mostly univoltine, but the presence of some large larvae and pupae during most months indicated some variation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WBP-45NJWD5-2&_user=10&_coverDate=03%2F31%2F1995&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1593600826&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e42369d2bf950f6472729133f609fab7&searchtype=a |title=Bionomics of Carmenta haematica (Ureta) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) Which Attacks Snakeweeds (Gutierrezia spp) in Argentina |publisher=Sciencedirect.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl]
The larva of the species have been found on plants in the genus Gutierrezia, including Gutierrezia solbrigii and Grindelia chiloensis. They have seven instars and are about 24 mm long when full grown. The larvae enter the plant at the base of the twigs or leaves or sometimes bore directly into the crowns. They are cannibalistic after the second instar and usually only one large larva occurs in a single plant. Larger larvae tunnel in the larger roots and make an exit hole in a large stem. A silken tube is often protruded from the exit hole.

Azolla pinnata is a species of fern known by several common names, including feathered mosquitofern and water velvet. It is native to much of Africa, Asia from China to Japan, India and the Philippines, and parts of Australia. It is an aquatic plant, its frond floating upon the surface of the water. It grows in quiet and slow-moving water bodies, because swift currents and waves break up the plant.Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk
This is a with a triangular frond measuring up to 2.5 centimeters in length which floats on the water. The frond is made up of many rounded or angular overlapping leaves each 1 or 2 millimeters long. They are green, blue-green, or dark red in color and coated in tiny hairs, giving them a velvety appearance. The hairs make the top surface of the leaf water-repellent, keeping the plant afloat even after being pushed under. A water body may be coated in a dense layer of the plants, which form a velvety mat that crowds out other plants. The hairlike roots extend out into the water. The leaves contain the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which is a symbiont that fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere that the fern can use.Sood, A., et al. (2005). Indicators of phosphorus deficiency in Azolla pinnata (Salviniales, Pteridophyta). Acta Botanica Hungarica 47:1-2 197. This gives the fern the ability to grow in habitats that are low in nitrogen.
The plant reproduces vegetatively when branches break off the main axis, or sexually when sporocarps on the leaves release spores.Azolla pinnata. Nonindigenous Aquatic Species. USGS
It is present in New Zealand as an introduced species and an invasive weed that has crowded out a native relative, Azolla rubra. It is a pest of waterways because its dense mats reduce oxygen in the water.Azolla pinnata. Idaho Agriculture. The weevil Stenopelmus rufinasus is used as an agent of biological pest control to manage Azolla filiculoides, and it has been found to attack A. pinnata as well.Pemberton, R. W. and J. M. Bodle. (2009). Native North American Azolla Weevil, Stenopelmus rufinasus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), uses the invasive old world Azolla pinnata as a host plant. Florida Entomologist 92:1 153.
Rice farmers sometimes keep this plant in their paddies because it generates valuable nitrogen via its symbiotic cyanobacteria. The plant can be grown in wet soil and then plowed under, generating a good amount of nitrogen-rich fertilizer.Kaur, H. Biomass production of Azolla pinnata R. Br. in contaminated soils of Punjab (India). The plant has the ability to absorb a certain amount of heavy metal pollution, such as lead, from contaminated water.Jain, S. K.

Founder member Bryan, who is lead singer, is originally from Newton Aycliffe in North East England.
The Hotel FM story began in,2005 when the Romanian composer Gabriel Băruţa recruited a few very talented musicians from his hometown Oradea to create a new sound, a modern pop-rock feel based on melody and innovation, specific to the songs he wrote.
Throughout the years, Hotel FM attracted exquisite young musicians like Nicolae Vedinaş (vocals, flute), Berek Szilard (vocals), Marius Pop (guitar), Vlady Săteanu (bass), Gabi Drăgan (drums) and Sanyi Zakar (guitar), united by the same vision and passion for music.
The band has played many concerts in cities of Romania and Germany and released a promotional CD in the spring of 2006.
The members of Hotel FM have always balanced the band’s activity with exciting side-projects: David is recording Shakespeare’s Sonnets on the music of Florian Chelu Madeva (Rock Filarmonica Oradea) and plays with the only Pink Floyd tribute band in Romania, “Speak Floyd”; Gabriel writes song for talented children and has won many national and international songwriting competitions. As a producer, he has worked with artists from many different genres, from rock to pop, hip-hop and even house. He has recently opened a brand new studio in Bucharest.

The Kaiserbach or Sparchenbach is a stream in the Kaisertal in the Kaisergebirge mountains in the Tyrolean  Unterland of Austria. It rises at about [tpl]Höhe|1500|DE-NN|link=true[/tpl] near the Stripsenjoch saddle and empties near Kufstein/Sparchen into the River Inn.
The Kaiserbach was important for forestry until the beginning of the 20th century. Felled logs were hauled from many wooded mountainsides in the side valleys of the Kaisertal to the stream. The Kaiserbach was impounded ast several weirs. On subsequently opening the lock gates a strong current flowed, enabling the assembled logs to be transported in several stages to Kufstein.
The weirs were known as Klausen and the log transportation as Trift. Today all that has survived is the Haupttrift Klause, a restored collection basin on the stream bed, and its associated Klaushütte (weir hut) that used to provide worker accommodation.
The stream forms most of the municipal boundary between Kufstein and Ebbs.

[[Nigel Hankin]]
CATEGORIES: 1920 births, 2007 deaths, Language creators, English lexicographers, Indian businesspeople from Delhi, Cinema pioneers, Tour guides

Nigel Bathurst Hankin was brought up by his grandmother in Bexhill, Sussex. He was sent to Burma during late World War II but the war ended around the time he reached Bombay, India (now Mumbai, India). He liked the bustle of the Indian Subcontinent (Delhi, India in particular) and consequently he lived there for the rest of his life.
One of his early formative experiences was watching the crowds at the funeral for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi while he still wore the uniform of the newly defunct British Raj just after the formal Partition of India. His subsequent eclectic activities in India included running a mobile cinema. Later he worked for the British High Commission and during his tenure there he helped newcomers to India interpret the local mores and lingo. In 1992 he formally compiled his know-how into the book ""Hanklyn-Janklin"" which became well known to locals and foreigners to the Subcontinent alike.  This cross cultural dictionary is what he is most well known for and many critics compare it to the 19th Century book Hobson-Jobson.
Hankin never married, had no children and kept English traits such as eating an "English Breakfast" that included cornflakes. He also gave tours of Delhi which were highly sought after but hard to book. They featured sights such as hidden bazaars and Hankin's walk and talk through Coronation Park. His brother and other relatives occasionally visited him in India before his death at age 87.[tpl]cite news|author=Roland Watson Political Editor December 7, 2011 12:01AM |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3118067.ece |title=The Times | UK News, World News and Opinion |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-07 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1574988/Nigel-Hankin.html |title=Nigel Hankin |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2008-01-09|accessdate=2011-12-07 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E2saAQAAIAAJ&q=inauthor:%22Nigel+B.+Hankin%22&dq=inauthor:%22Nigel+B.+Hankin%22&hl=en&ei=BgUfTZ_EMcT6lweWlrC4DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA |title=Hanklyn-janklin: a stranger's rumble ... - Nigel B.

The Miao Rebellion of 1735-36 was an uprising of autochthonous people from southwest China (called by the Chinese "Miao", but including more than the antecedents of today's Miao national minority). The uprising was the greatest of several rebellions of 1720-30. against the Chinese Empire. They were all caused by the encroachment of the Han Chinese on their territories and abuses by the imperial administration.
Since the Ming dynasty southwestern China (Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi) were within the Chinese empire, but the state control of these territories was weak. Yongzheng emperor decided to strengthen it, replacing local, semi-independent chieftains, called tusi, with regular Chinese administration. To achieve this goal, Manchu prince Ortai led several war campaigns into the area, pacifying them between 1726-32.[tpl]cite book|title=Search for Modern China|year=1990|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=0-393-02708-2|author=Jonathan Spence|location=New York|pages=82[/tpl] However, military control did not stop the official abuse and extortion, suppressing only the reaction against them.
By 1735 misrule and extortion proved too much and the local people rose to fight. Some of them were desperate enough as to kill their wives and children before joining the rebellion, this way burning all the bridges behind them. The uprising started in Taigong, then covering the area of Liping and Duyun. Local Chinese administration, unable to cope with the rebels, suggested making a kind of agreement with them, but new emperor, Qianlong, recalled the previous commanders and appointed general Zhang Guangsi, experienced Ortai's officer, to quell the rebellion. The uprising was bloodily suppressed, the last rebels doggedly fighting at Niupidajing. Altogether Chinese armies destroyed ca. 1200 Miao's forts and killed over 18 thousands warriors.[tpl]cite book|author=Herold J.

The campaign lasted from February till November 1736. Zhang, meanwhile appointed general governor of Guizhou, started to build roads, strengthening the garrisons and opening the mines, to enhance both the imperial control and the economics of the region.[tpl]cite book|editor=Arthur W.

The suppression of the revolt granted the area half a century of peace, but the deep causes of unrest remained unchanged and the tensions grew again, until Miaos rebelled anew in 1795.

[[The Ten Computational Canons]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics manuscripts, Chinese mathematics

The Ten Computational Canons was a collection of ten Chinese mathematical works, compiled by early Tang dynasty mathematician Li Chunfeng (李淳风 602－670），as the official mathematical texts for imperial examinations in mathematics.
The Ten Computational Canons includes:

File:周髀算經.jpg|Zhou Bi Suan Jing
File:九章算術.gif|The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art
File:海岛算经.jpg|The Sea Island Mathematical Manual
File:Sun Zi Suanjing.JPG|The Mathematical Classic of Sun Zi

File:Jigu Suanjing.JPG|Jigu Suanjing
File:WUCHAO SUANJING-073-073.jpg|Shushu jiyi

It was specified in Tang Dynasty laws on examination that The Mathematical Classic of Sun Zi and the Computational Canon of the Five Administrative Sections together required one year of study; The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art plus The Sea Island Mathematical Manual three years; Jigu Suanjing three years; Zhui Shu four years; and Zhang Qiujian and Xia Houyang one year each.
The Song dynasty government actively promoted the study of mathematics. There were two government xylograph editions of The Ten Computational Canons in year 1084 and 1213. The wide availability of these mathematical texts contributed to the flourishing of mathematics in Song dynasty and Yuan dynasty, inspiring Jia Xian, Qin Jiushao, Yang Hui, Li Zhi and Zhu Shijie.
In the Ming dynasty during the reign of Emperor Yongle, some of the Ten Canons were copied into the Yongle Encyclopedia. Qing dynasty scholar Dai Zhen copied out  Zhou Bi Suan Jing, The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, The Sea Island Mathematical Manual, The Mathematical Classic of Sun Zi, The Mathematical Classic of Zhang Qiujian, Computational Canon of the Five Administrative Sections, Xia Houyang's Computational Canons, Computational Prescriptions of the Five Classics, Jigu Suanjing, and Shushu jiyi from  Yongle Encyclopedia, as basis for copying into Siku Quanshu.

Gainesville u.a.: University Press of Florida, 1998. pp. 10-11 However, it was not a publicly communist newspaper. The first issue of the newspaper declared that it would speak on behalf of the interests of the poor and victims of injustice. The second issue presented the political line of the People's Party, advocating industrial and agricultural development, formation of labour unions, compulsory education and secularism.
The third, fourth and fifth issues of al-Insaniyyah expressed more strident positions, attacking the French Mandate and calling for protection of workers rights. The Syrian-Lebanese People's Party published its manifesto in the fourth issue of al-Insaniyyah issued on June 7, 1925, calling on workers to participate in the upcoming elections to defend their class interests and struggle for independence against French colonial rule (a political position later reversed by the Communist Party, as the French authorities organized elections on sectarian basis).Lebanese Communist Party. الحزب الشيوعي اللبناني والانتخابات النيابية في عهد الانتداب (1925 - 1943)
The newspaper was shut down by the French authorities on June 16, after only five issues werepublished. Arrest orders were issued on the editors of the newspapers and other members of the Communist Party leadership. Yazbak fled to France.

CATEGORIES: Indigenous peoples of the Philippines, Palawan

The Palawan tribal people, also known as the Palawano or the Pala'wan, are an indigenous ethnic group of the Palawan group of islands. They are divided into four ethno-linguistic subgroupings based on Lewis (2009), Ethnologue: Languages of the World.Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com/. These are the Quezon Palawano which is also known as the Central Palawano; the Bugsuk Palawano or South Palawano; Brooke's Point Palawano; and Southwest Palawano. Palawanos are more popularly known as Palawans, which is pronounced faster than the name of the province.
The Quezon Palawano subgroup are found in Southern Palawan, particularly on the western section of the municipality of Quezon, Palawan including the eastern part of Abo-abo of the municipality of Sofronio Espanola, going southward down to the northern section of the municipality of Rizal. A large group of Palawans can also be found in Sitios Gugnan, Kambing, Tugpa, and Kalatabog of Barangay Panitian. The Taw't Bato of the municipality of Rizal at the foot of Mt. Matalingahan also belongs to this same Palawan tribal group although their language is 15 percent different from the Quezon Palawanos.

[[Acetic oxalic anhydride]]

CATEGORIES: Acid anhydrides

Acetic oxalic anhydride is an organic compound with formula [tpl]chem|C|6|H|6|O|6[/tpl] or (H3C-(C=O)-O-(C=O)-)2.  It can be viewed as a mixed anhydride, formally derived from acetic acid (H3C-(C=O)OH) and oxalic acid ((-(C=O)OH)2), in 2:1 molecular ratio, by the loss of two water molecules.
It is an unstable colorless crystalline solid, soluble in diethyl ether, that decomposes at about −3 °C into acetic anhydride ([tpl]chem|H|3|C[/tpl]-(C=O)-)2O, carbon dioxide ([tpl]chem|CO|2[/tpl]) and carbon monoxide (CO).  It is hydrolyzed by water into acetic and oxalic acids.
Unlike some other anhydrides, it cannot be obtained directly from the acids. It was synthesized in 1953 by W. Edwards and W. M. Henley, by reacting silver oxalate ([tpl]chem|Ag|2|C|2|O|4[/tpl]) suspended in diethyl ether with acetyl chloride at temperatures below −5 °C and distilling off the solvent under low pressure. It can also be obtained by reacting anhydrous oxalic acid with ketene ([tpl]chem|H|2|C[/tpl]=C=O).W. R. Edwards and Walter M. Henley (1953), Acetic Oxalic Anhydride. J. Am. Chem. Soc., volume 75, issue 14, pages 3857-3859. [tpl]doi|10.1021/ja01110a505[/tpl]  
Acetic oxalic anhydride was conjectured to be an intermediate in the decomposition of anhydrous oxalic acid by acetic anhydride.

[[Königsberg fortifications]]
CATEGORIES: Königsberg, Fortifications in Russia

The fortifications of the former East Prussian capital Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) consist of numerous defensive walls, forts, bastions and other structures. They make up the First and the Second Defensive Belt, built in 1626—1634 and 1843—1859, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://world-ocean.ru/en/monuments/posolstvo/past.php|title=The Past...|publisher =Museum of the World Ocean|accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl] The 15 metre-thick First Belt was erected due to Königsberg's vulnerability during the Polish–Swedish wars. The Second Belt was largely constructed on the place of the first one, which was in a bad condition. The new belt included twelve bastions, three ravelins, seven spoil banks and two fortresses, surrounded by water moat. Ten brick gates served as entrances and passages through defensive lines and were equipped with moveable bridges.  
The Königsberg fortifications had become largely vulnerable already before the construction was finished due to rapid development of artillery. Following the military setbacks of Nazi Germany, however, they became strategically important again (particularly during the East Prussian Offensive).

CATEGORIES: Brandenberg Alps, Mountain ranges of Tyrol (state)

The Brandenberg Alps ([tpl]lang-de|Brandenberger Alpen[/tpl]) are a sub-group of the Northern Limestone Alps, that run in front of the Eastern Alps for their whole length. They lie entirely in Austria between Achensee in Tyrol, the Inn Valley and the Bavarian Prealps.
They are widely known in German as the Rofangebirge, although the actual Rofan (also Sonnwendgebirge) is only the western part of the area between the Brandenberger Ache stream and the Achensee lake. It consists of a central mountain group and three individual mountains. The Guffert (2,195 m), which is located outside the central group, forms a distinct mountain block. It is located north of Kramsach, between the Tegernsee Blauberge and the central Rofan. The Unnütze, at the northern end of the Achensee east of Achenkirch, and the Ebener Joch (1,957 m) east of Maurach at the southern end of the Achensee, are also outside the central mountain range.

[[Radbruch formula]]
CATEGORIES: Philosophy of law

The Radbruch Formula (German: Radbruchsche Formel) is a theory of law which was formulated for the first time in an 1946 essay by the German law professor and politician Gustav Radbruch. According to the theory, a judge who encounters a conflict between a statute and what he perceives as just, has to decide against applying the statute if - and only if - the legal concept behind the statute in question seems either "unbearably injust" or in "deliberate disregard" of human equality before the law.
Radbruch's Formula is rooted in the situation of a Civil Law System. It is believed to be a reaction of Radbruch's experience of the judiciary in Nazi Germany and has been applied in the decision of courts in the Federal Republic of Germany numerous times. By some authors, the Radbruch essay Gesetzliches Unrecht und übergesetzliches Recht, which first included his theory, is regarded as one of the most influential legal-philosophical writings of the 20th Century.E.g. S. Paulson and R.Dreier, 'Einführung in die Rechtsphilosophie Radbruchs', in: Gustav Radbruch: Rechtsphilosophie, Studienausgabe (Heidelberg, 1999), pp. 235–250, p. 245.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974, p. 803.  Some published editions of the work bear the author's name as "Alexander Anglus" ("Alexander the Englishman"), but he is further identified in a 1496 edition which states that the work was compiled "a cuiusdam fabri lignarii filio" -- "by a certain son of a worker of wood," i.e., a carpenter's son.Ludwig Hain: Repertorium Bibliographicum in Usum Scholarum Directory for Scholarly Use", J. G. Cottae Stuttgartiae et Jul. Renouard Lutetiae Parisiorum, 1826, Vol. I, Pt. I, p. 72. This identifier also states that the work was begun in 1429, which rules out authorship by Alexander of Hales (ca. 1185-1245) which had by some scholars been considered a possibility. Alexander Carpenter authored other works, termed Homiliae eruditae ("Learned Sermons"), but they are not at present known.
Carpenter is thought by some to have been a follower of the English theologian John Wycliffe (ca. 1328-1384), but that is disputed.John Bale, Scriptorum illustrium maioris Britanniae, quam nunc Angliam et Scotiam vocant, catalogus of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, now called England and Scotland", Basel: 1557-1559, vol.

[[Tube domain]]
CATEGORIES: Fourier analysis, Harmonic analysis, Several complex variables

In mathematics, a tube domain is a generalization of the notion of a vertical strip (or half-plane) in the complex plane to several complex variables.  A strip can be thought of as the collection of complex numbers whose real part lie in a given subset of the real line and whose imaginary part is unconstrained; likewise, a tube is the set of complex vectors whose real part is in some given collection of real vectors, and whose imaginary part is unconstrained.
Tube domains are domains of the Laplace transform of a function of several real variables (see multidimensional Laplace transform).  Hardy spaces on tubes can be defined in a manner in which a version of the Paley–Wiener theorem from one variable continues to hold, and characterizes the elements of Hardy spaces as the Laplace transforms of functions with appropriate integrability properties.  Tubes over convex sets are domains of holomorphy.  The Hardy spaces on tubes over convex cones have an especially rich structure, so that precise results are known concerning the boundary values of Hp functions.  In mathematical physics, the future tube is the tube domain associated to the interior of the past null cone in Minkowski space, and has applications in relativity theory and quantum gravity.[tpl]harvnb|Gibbons|2000[/tpl]  Certain tubes over cones support a Bergman metric in terms of which they become bounded symmetric domains.  One of these is the Siegel half-space which is fundamental in arithmetic.

The sternum (from Greek στέρνον, sternon, "chest"; plural "sternums" or "sterna") or breastbone is a long flat bony plate shaped like a capital "T" located anteriorly to the heart in the center of the thorax (chest). It connects to the rib bones via cartilage, forming the anterior section of the rib cage with them, and thus helps to protect the lungs, heart and major blood vessels from physical trauma.  Although it is fused, the sternum can be sub-divided into three regions: the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process.[tpl]cite book |author=Saladin, Kenneth S. |year=2010 |title=Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function, Fifth Edition |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |page= 266 |isbn= 978-0-07-352569-3[/tpl]

[[Our Lady of the Nativity of Our Blessed Lady's Church (Bronx, New York)]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic churches in New York, Churches in the Bronx

The  Nativity of Our Blessed Lady is a Roman Catholic parish church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located at 1510 East 233rd Street and the corner of Secor Avenue, Bronx, New York in the Eastchester neighborhood of the northern Bronx. The church was designed by Don Shepherd, a designer and not an architect. The AIA Guide to New York City described it as "a minor work but one which calls attention to itself because of its location and the rusted steel crucifix that dominates the corner of the site." The church's cornerstone is dated 1969.
The original church of this parish was erected in 1924 (just across the street from its current location) within the confines of the present playground area (closer to Light Street) of The Nativity of Our Blessed Lady School (3893 Dyre Avenue), a Roman Catholic grammar school which opened in 1953 and has seen different orders of educators, including the Sisters of Mercy (who practiced light physical punishment on students during their tenure, including the use of their own hands as disciplinary instruments, as well as rulers), the Sisters of Charity, & several Dominican nuns. 
While the original church was being constructed, masses for the community's primarily Italian, German, and Irish parishioners were conducted at Brienlinger's Hall (approximately one quarter-mile from East 233rd Street) at the corner of Boston Post Road (Route 1) and Dyre Avenue. Nativity parishioner Angelina "Lilly" Cosentino remembers that Brienlinger's was a popular party and dance hall, recalling (at the age of 99 in 2012), "During the winter & spring of 1922-1923, prior to the church's opening in 1924, Sunday Masses were held at Brienlinger's. The priests at that time were Fathers Ross, Quill, and Ferris. They had a German festival every Sunday night at Brienlinger's, which had surrounding property with a picnic area, swing sets, a carousel, and a puppet show theater where they used to put on presentations of 'Punch & Judy.' My brother Benny Cosentino and Neil Zottoli used to organize a lot of the dances there. In the summer of 1923, a huge tent was erected on the corner of East 233rd and Secor Avenue, where the present Nativity church now stands, and they held Masses there. It was very hot and humid under that tent." When the original church opened in 1924, Marina Cosentino (Lilly's mother) made and donated the crocheted-border tablecloths for the altar. Lilly also remembers movie nights and minstrel shows inside the original church during the 1920s.
Lilly Cosentino remembers the priests of the parish well: "Fr. Ross made it clear that he did not like the Italians, and during Mrs. Greco's Funeral Mass, he told the congregation that New York's Sing-Sing prison was full of young Italian boys. When Fr. Ross married my brother Benny years later, my brother reminded him of that callous remark, and Fr. Ross apologized. Fr. Ferris told us that despite how the Catholic Church stressed the need for confession with the priests, we should make our own private confessions to God, kneeling at the altar's Communion rail. Fr. Ferris loved the children of the parish. He was ice-skating with a group of them down at the creek one winter when he suffered a heart attack and died."
The original Nativity church was destroyed by fire in 1958 when the parish priests included Frs. Murray and O'Hara. Parishioner Marie Sforza remembers, "During the fire, two or three men rushed into the church to climb up into the niche above the altar and rescue the beautiful wood-carved statue of the Blessed Mother and carry it out of the church before it burned. About 20 years later, I happened to ask the school's custodian Pat Rose whatever became of that statue. To my horror, he told me it was kept in a school janitorial closet for all those years, and he added that just the day before I asked, he had 'chopped her up' and put it out for garbage" (in keeping with the practice that Catholic religious statues must be destroyed to protect them from desecration).  
There was a great sense of community associated with Nativity church and school and its parishioners during the Sixties and Seventies. Praise Cleaners, a staple business on Dyre Avenue for decades owned and operated by parishioner Jimmy Ricciardi, was located directly across from Nativity's convent (1534 East 233rd Street), and offered free dry-cleaning services to the nuns who taught at Nativity school. Marie Sforza, a member of the Nativity Women's Bowling League for over 30 years (the League remains in existence today), enrolled her four children in Nativity School during the 1960s and volunteered her time typing school newsletters, performing lunch duty and playground supervision, sorting bags of raffle tickets for card party events, helping with bizarres, book fairs, bake sales and Bingo, cleaning the church's altar, and donating baked goods to the convent and the rectory (1531 East 233rd Street), both of which still stand opposite each other. Marie's husband, Mickey, painted the interiors of the current church, as well as the convent, in the 1970s with son Michael, and they would sometimes be obliged to stop their painting at the request of then-Monsignor Griffin, so he could say daily Masses. Mickey & Marie's two daughters, Jeannie and Theresa, participated with other female students in housekeeping duties (within the convent to assist the Sisters). Marie's in-laws, Antoinette and Crescenzo ("John") Sforza (a WWI veteran) from nearby Pratt Avenue, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary while still parishioners, and they were very involved with the Altar Rosary Society (which relied upon women volunteers to launder and iron the altar cloths and help secure donations from parishioners), and with Bingo, as was Louis DeFeo from Conner Street. John Sforza and Louis DeFeo's involvement with running Bingo for the parish continued when the games moved from the school auditorium on Dyre Avenue to the Loew's Theater on Boston Post Road near Corsa Avenue in the Hillside section of the Bronx. At DeFeo's suggestion, the large theater offered better ventilation than the cramped school auditorium with its heavy smoking congregation. DeFeo (a WWII veteran) remembers how Monsignor Griffin would never supply enough funds to furnish the prize money during the Bingo games, so DeFeo would often borrow money from the pizzeria next to the theater, then repay the owner when enough money was collected from the players. DeFeo's wife, Jeanette, was very involved with the P.T.A., and along with friend & parishioner Rita Tosi, organized feasts for the Saints under the direction of Monsignor Donavan. A lifelong artist, Jeanette, with the help of Fr. Escrita, painted a mural which she donated to the school. Parish priests during the 1970s and 1980s included Frs. Corrigan, Jadoff, O'Neil and the stern Monsignor Ziccarelli.  
After the original church burned, Masses and church events were held in the school auditorium for a decade, with a makeshift altar on the auditorium's small stage and rows of folding chairs serving as pews. Large oscillating fans were brought into the auditorium during the summer months to help keep the congregation cool. Masses continued there until the construction and opening of the new and present Nativity church in 1969, the interior of which features textured stucco-type walls and dark wood accents on the altar and confessionals, as well as contrasting red wood pews. A large Crucifix hangs on the back wall at the center of the altar, and a very contemporary, very large, even overpowering wood-sculpted risen Christ with arms extended to Heaven covers the altar's side wall by the organ and added piano. The Stations of the Cross hang as large wood-carved plaques, partially illuminated by ten skylights (in addition to the large skylight positioned directly above the altar's center table structure, divided into four sections by two substantial crossing beams), and more modern additions include carpeting on the altar, electronic candle bays, and a large painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe near the original tabernacle (a much smaller tabernacle now occupies the back of the altar, partially obscuring the large Crucifix there). The acoustics system is exceptional in its clarity and resonance. The church's congregation now represents many ethnic groups, reflecting the residential population of the Eastchester area. Male parishioners continue the tradition of collecting the monetary offerings during Mass, and October is observed as "The Month of the Rosary," during which a statue of the Blessed Mother is moved to a new home each Friday and stays one week for a "Rosary Visit." According to the weekly bulletin, current weekend Masses include a Saturday evening vigil and a Sunday Spanish Mass, as well as 7a.m. weekday Masses. The current parish clergy are Rev. Cyprian Onyeihe (Administrator) and Rev. James Sheehan (Sunday Mass Associate), and Ralph Carbonaro serves as the Nativity's School Principal. Before Sunday Mass, Rev. Onyeihe asks members of the congregation who have celebrated a birthday in the past week to stand while the remaining parishioners serenade these individuals with the "Happy Birthday" song. Rev. Onyeihe involves the congregation in his homilies, stepping off the altar into the center aisle and encouraging audience participation. Tag sales are held in the school auditorium to help raise funds for the parish.

The local council had plans to remove the bus shelter, but after he sent them a letter asking them not to and explaining that the shelter is where he kept his bike while at school, the council left it there and furnished it. Every year, the shelter is redecorated in accordance with what is going on in Bobby's life. In 2009 the shelter was decorated in pink to represent the fact that Bobby was working for a Breast Cancer charity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]

"Born This Way" is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga, from her second studio album of the same name. Written by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen, who produced along with Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow, it was developed while Gaga was on the road with The Monster Ball Tour. Inspired by the 1990s empowering music for women and the gay community, Gaga explained that "Born This Way" was her freedom song. She sang part of the chorus at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards in 2010 and announced the song as the lead single from the album. The single was released on February 11, 2011.
The song is backed by rumbling synth sounds, a humming bass and additional chorus percussion, with sole organ toward the end. The lyrics discuss the self-empowerment of minorities including the LGBT community as well as racial minorities, referring to "cholas" and "orients", which drew criticism from Latino and Asian communities. Critics positively reviewed the song, calling it a "club-ready anthem", though it faced criticism for having similarities with Madonna's 1989 single "Express Yourself". The song reached number one in over 25 countries and was her third single to top the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the 1000th song in history to reach number one. "Born This Way" has sold 8.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time.
Nick Knight directed the accompanying music video, which was inspired by painters like Salvador Dalí and Francis Bacon and their  surrealistic images. Gaga is depicted as giving birth to a new race during a prologue. A series of dance sequences later, the video concludes with the view of a city populated by this race. Critics noted cultural references to the work of Madonna, Michael Jackson, Björk, late fashion designer Alexander McQueen, as well as to Greek mythology and surrealism.
Gaga performed the song at the 53rd Grammy Awards after coming out of an incubating vessel. It was also performed during the last leg of The Monster Ball Tour and in television shows such as Saturday Night Live, Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve and Good Morning America. The song was treated with different remixes, including a Country Road version recorded by Gaga herself and another by Indian production duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant. Alice Cooper, Madonna, Katy Perry, Maria Aragon, and the cast of the TV series Glee have covered the song.

The South African Open, formerly the South African Championships, was an annual tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts from 1891 to 2011. The tournament was not played from 1900 to 1902 due to the Boer War, from 1915 to 1919 due to World War I, and from 1941 to 1945 due to World War II. It was also suspended from 1996 until 2006.
Sets were played on advantage until 1971; "lingering death" tie-breaks at six games all were subsequently adopted. Finals were the best-of-five-sets until the tournament's suspension in 1990; upon its return in 1992 finals were reduced to the best-of-three-sets. 
The most successful male player at the South African Championships – played from 1891 to 1967 during the Amateur Era – was Eric Sturgess, who won eleven titles between 1939 and 1957 and lost a further final in 1947 to Eustace Fannin. He also holds the overall record for the most consecutive titles won – seven between 1948 and 1954. Five players share the record for the most male wins at the tournament in the Open Era – Rod Laver (1969, 1970), Jimmy Connors (1973, 1974), Harold Solomon (1975, 1976), Vitas Gerulaitis (1981, 1982) and Aaron Krickstein (1992, 1993).

Thomas Henry Brand, 4th Viscount Hampden CMG (30 March 1900 – 17 October 1965) was a British and English peer, both Baron Dacre (dating from 1307) and Viscount Hampden. 
The son of Thomas Brand, 3rd Viscount Hampden GCVO, KCB, CMG, and of Lady Katharine Mary Montagu-Douglas-Scott, a daughter of the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, he was educated at Eton, holding the office of Page of Honour to King George V between 1913 and 1916. After Eton, he joined the British Army and was commissioned as a Lieutenant into the Rifle Brigade.'HAMPDEN, 4th Viscount (born 30 March 1900, died 17 Oct. 1965)' in Who Was Who, A. & C. Black, 1920–2008; online edition by Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 1 January 2011 (subscription required)Thomas Henry Brand, 4th Viscount Hampden of Glynde at thepeerage.com, accessed 1 January 2011
On 26 July 1923 he married Leila, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Frank Seely, of Ramsdale Park, Nottinghamshire, and they had four daughters, Sarah Elizma (1924–1937), Gian Katherine (1927–1929), Rachel Leila (born 1929), and Tessa Mary (born 1934). 
In 1931 he became Managing Director of Lazard Brothers & Co. During the Second World War he served as Chief Executive Officer on the British side of the Combined Production and Resources Board, from 1942 to 1944, then from 1944 to 1945 was Chairman of Supplies for Liberated Areas Official Committee. He was appointed CMG in 1943, and in 1953 and 1954 was Chairman of the Issuing Houses Association. He succeeded to his father's titles in 1958 and in 1965 became Chairman of Lazards.  
After Hampden's death on 17 October 1965 his brother David succeeded as Viscount Hampden, while his two surviving daughters were left as co-heiresses to the Barony of Dacre, which thus went into abeyance. However, the abeyance was terminated in 1970 in favour of his daughter Rachel Douglas-Home, 27th Baroness Dacre (born 1929).

[[Dillingham Flaw]]
CATEGORIES: Immigration to the United States

The Dillingham Flaw is a term coined by U.S. sociologist Vincent N. Parrillo to identify a centuries-old phenomenon of faulty logic when nativists misinterpret and react negatively to the presence of immigrants in their midst.Parrillo, Vincent N., “Diversity in America: A Sociohistorical Analysis,” Sociological Forum 9:4 (1994): 523-45.
The term draws its name from a special commission created in 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt to look into the “immigration problem.” Named after its chairman, U.S. Senator William P. Dillingham of Vermont, the Dillingham Commission over a 4-year period listened to testimony from civic leaders, educators, social scientists, and social workers and made on-site visits to Ellis Island and New York City’s Lower East Side. In 1911, the Commission issued a 41-volume report of its findings.  Unfortunately, the report was flawed in its interpretation of the data that the Commission had so tirelessly collected. The Commission erred in its use of simplistic categories for diverse immigrant groups and in making an unfair comparison of “old” and “new” immigrants, despite the changed structural conditions and longer time interval that previous immigrants had to assimilate and to achieve some measure of economic security.Benton-Cohen, Katherine, “The Rude Birth of Immigration Reform,” The Wilson Quarterly 34:3 (Summer 2010): 16-22; Weisberger, Bernard A., “Genes, Brains, and Bunk,” American Heritage 46:2 (1995): 28-9; Lund, John M., “Boundaries of Restriction: The Dillingham Commission,” History Review 6 (1994), accessed at http://www.uvm.edu/~hag/histreview/vol6/lund.html.
Quite simply then, the term Dillingham Flaw refers to inaccurate comparisons of immigrant groups based on simplistic categorizations and anachronistic observations. Parrillo argued that this erroneous thinking can occur in assessments of the past, present, or future.

The W. B. Thompson Mansion, also known as Alder Manor, is a historic home located on North Broadway (U.S. Route 9) in Yonkers, New York, United States. It is an early 20th-century mansion designed by Carrère and Hastings in the Renaissance Revival architectural style. In 1982, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
It was built by William Boyce Thompson, a mining tycoon and financier, as his weekend home. At that time, large riverside estates characterized much of Yonkers; today the Thompson Mansion is one of the few to have survived the city's suburbanization. The Thompson family lived there until the mid-20th century; afterwards it was willed to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and became Mary Elizabeth Seton High School, the first Catholic school in Yonkers.
After ten years as a high school, it was upgraded to a junior college. A few years after merging with Iona College, the campus was closed. While the other buildings on the property were repurposed, the mansion fell into neglect and was looted until Tara Circle, an Irish American cultural organization, bought it from the city. To raise money for its restoration, Tara Circle holds occasional events there and rents it out for weddings and filming for movies such as Mona Lisa Smile[tpl]cite web|last=Bennett|first=Maria|title=Hidden Gems of Yonkers|url=http://www.westchestermagazine.com/Westchester-Magazine/January-2003/Hidden-Gems-of-Yonkers/|publisher=Westchester Magazine|date=May 21, 2007|accessdate=February 29, 2012[/tpl] and A Beautiful Mind.[tpl]cite web|title=Movie Location Itinerary|url=http://tourism.westchestergov.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=324&Itemid=|publisher=Westchester County|year=2011|accessdate=February 29, 2011[/tpl]

Emilio Luigi Carlo Giuseppe Maria Ghione (July 30, 1879 – January 7, 1930), known as Emilio Ghione, was an Italian silent film actor, director and screenwriter. Ghione was best known for writing, directing and starring in the Za La Mort series of adventure films, in which Ghione played a likeable French Apache and 'honest outlaw.' Ghione directed, wrote and acted in every genre of film, and directed some of the most famous stars of the time, including Francesca Bertini, Lina Cavalieri, Alberto Collo and Hesperia.  After his final film role in 1926, Ghione briefly performed on a theatrical tour of Italy. Ghione wrote three novels based around his Za La Mort character, an autobiography, and an essay on Italian Silent Cinema, before his death from tuberculosis in 1930.
In 1979, a retrospective of Ghione's films was held at the Venice Film Festival. In 2008, a retrospective of his films was held at the Cinema Ritrovato festival in Bologna, and a temporary exhibition of photographs and film stills documenting Ghione's career was opened at the Cineteca of Bologna.

[[Eristalini]]
CATEGORIES: Hoverflies

Eristalini is a tribe of hoverflies. Several species are well-known honeybee mimics, such as the drone fly Eristalis tenax, while other genera such as Helophilus and Parhelophilus exhibit wasp-like patterns of yellow and black stripes, both strategies to avoid predation by visual predators such as birds.
They breed in decaying organic materials such as run-offs from dung heaps (Eristalis) or in ponds and ditches (e.g. Anasimyia). Some others, such as Myathropa and Mallota, breed in wet rotting tree stumps and rot holes. 
A characteristic feature of this tribe is the "rat-tailed maggot" with a rear positioned telescopic breathing tube, allowing the larvae to breathe while living submerged in water or mud. This feature is also shared with another hoverfly tribe the Sericomyiini though those flies do not share the characteristic eristaline dip in wing vein R4+5.[tpl]cite book |author=Alan E.

The Minneapolis and Rainy River Railway was a [tpl]convert|97|mi|km|0[/tpl] long American short line railroad used primarily for logging activities in northern Minnesota in the early 20th century.  It was incorporated on July 20, 1901 and was owned by the Itasca Lumber Company. Less than two weeks after its inception, the railway purchased the property of the Itasca Railroad.[tpl]cite book |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=AGg-qdQMnVwC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=minneapolis+and+rainy+river+railroad&source=bl&ots=g-4aQL9PfE&sig=oVhOU61Jz5rbnhPeHPVzVfT-IVs&hl=en&ei=WmsfTb-cDImnnQfT16DRDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=minneapolis%20and%20rainy%20river%20railroad&f=false |title = MInnesota Logging Railroads |author = Frank Alexander King |publisher = University of Minnesota Press |pages = 35, 41 |year = 2003 |accessdate = 1 January 2011 [/tpl]
Due to the abundance of liver sausage in the logging camps along the line, it was nicknamed the "Gut and Liver Line." Ironically, despite its name, the Minneapolis and Rainy River Railway never got within 200 miles of Minneapolis nor within 75 miles of the Rainy River.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edgeofthewilderness.org/tour/g_l_line.htm |author=Northern Itasca Joint Powers Board |title=Gut and Liver Line: Whistle Stops in the Wilderness |year=2010|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl]
Faced with the dramatic reduction of logging activities and the effects of the Great Depression, the railway reduced its services and ultimately abandoned its activities in 1932.

The 2011 Roger Federer tennis season was one of no grand slam victories for the Swiss Maestro, but was not entirely unsuccessful. For Federer, 2011, the year he turned 30, represented something of a decline. It was the first year since 2002 that he did not win a Grand Slam title, and, with the ascendance of Novak Djokovic to World No. 1, his ranking dropped from 2 to 3 behind Rafael Nadal. However, the year had some high spots for him. In the French Open semifinals, Federer defeated Djokovic and ended Djokovic's 43-match win streak. Also, he ended the year well by winning three straight titles, including a title at the Paris Masters, which completed his record of Masters series titles, and he successfully defended his title at the year-end ATP Championships.

The B-4 mainly powered the small and economical Heath Parasol monoplane, which Heath sold in kit form for homebuilders in the 1920s and '30s."
"The low-cost, reliable Henderson motorcycle engine was well-suited for the Heath airplane design because it helped make sport flying affordable for many people. Service was simple and economical because parts were cheap and easy to obtain throughout the country."

[[Fleet racing]]
CATEGORIES: Sailing (sport), Racing sports

Fleet racing is a form of competitive sailing that involves sailboats racing one another over a set course. It is the most common form of sailboat racing and contrasts with match racing and team racing.[tpl]cite book|title=Sailing For Dummies|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ukOmqlx7u-QC&pg=PA269&dq=fleet+racing&hl=en&ei=yHgfTemXFIPfceehsAM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=fleet%20racing&f=false|year=2006|publisher=For Dummies|isbn=0-471-79143-1|page=269[/tpl]
Fleet racing can take place in two main formats. In the "one design" basis, all boats in the fleet are of the same class (i.e., the same design, length, and sail area). Alternatively, different classes of boats can race on a handicap basis, where faster classes give time to slower classes either by starting the race later or having their finishing times adjusted after the race's completion.[tpl]cite book|title=Sailing For Dummies|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ukOmqlx7u-QC&pg=PA269&dq=fleet+racing&hl=en&ei=yHgfTemXFIPfceehsAM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=fleet%20racing&f=false|year=2006|publisher=For Dummies|isbn=0-471-79143-1|page=270[/tpl] Racing can occur around or between buoys or geographical features such as islands, and take place over short inshore courses or long distances offshore (such as the Volvo Ocean Race). 
The rules for fleet racing are set by the International Sailing Federation and can be supplemented by race-specific rules set by the organisers of a particular race. Contraventions of the rules are resolved either by a boat voluntarily taking a penalty during the race, or by protest lodged and heard after the race. The rules of match racing, on the other hand, are normally enforced by umpires issuing penalties during a race.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slsailing.com/2010/06/%E2%80%9Cmatch-racing%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-part-ii-what-is-match-racing/|title=“Match Racing” – Part II: What is Match Racing?|last=Woodget|first=Bea|date=11 June 2010|work=SL Sailing|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl]

Pilophorus acicularis, commonly known as the nail lichen or the devil's matchstick, is a species of lichen in the Cladoniaceae family. It was originally described in 1803, and transferred to the genus Pilophorus in 1857. A fructicose (shrub-like) species, it grows directly on silicate rocks in dense clusters. The lichen starts out as a granular crust on the rock surface, and develops stalks, or pseudopodetia, up to [tpl]convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] tall and about 1 mm thick that have rounded black apothecia at the tips. The stalks are erect and curved so as to appeared combed. It is found on the west coast of North America up to Alaska, and in eastern Eurasia. In addition to green algae, the lichen contains cyanobacteria that help contribute to soil fertility by supplying fixed nitrogen.

[[Breast cancer awareness]]

CATEGORIES: Cancer awareness, Public health education, Medical activism, Breast cancer, Health campaigns

Breast cancer awareness is an effort to raise awareness and reduce the stigma of breast cancer through education on symptoms and treatment. Supporters hope that greater knowledge will lead to earlier detection of breast cancer, which is associated with higher long-term survival rates, and that money raised for breast cancer will produce a reliable, permanent cure.
Breast cancer advocacy and awareness efforts are a type of health advocacy. Breast cancer advocates raise funds and lobby for better care, more knowledge, and more patient empowerment. They may conduct educational campaigns or provide free or low-cost services.  Breast cancer culture, sometimes called pink ribbon culture, is the cultural outgrowth of breast cancer advocacy, the social movement that supports it, and the larger women's health movement.
The pink ribbon is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness, and in many countries the month of October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Some national breast cancer organizations receive substantial financial support from corporate sponsorships.[tpl]sfn|King|2006|p=2[/tpl]

Dukes, a current Wal-Mart employee, and others have alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotion policies and practices in Wal-Mart stores.AAUW Stands with the Women of Wal-Mart During U.S. Supreme Court Hearing, American Association of University Women.
The Court agreed to hear argument on whether a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2) that provides for class-actions where the defendant's actions make injunctive relief appropriate can also be used to file a class-action that demands monetary damages. The Court also asked the parties to argue whether the class meets the traditional requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.10-277 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

The [tpl]nfly|2011[/tpl] Carolina Panthers season was the franchise's 17th season in the National Football League and the first season for Ron Rivera as the head coach. In Week 16 of the 2010 season, the team clinched the NFL's worst record of the year and was given the #1 pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, with which the team selected quarterback Cam Newton, the 2010 Heisman Trophy winner. They improved on their 2–14 record from 2010, and finished 6–10, missing the playoffs for the third year in a row.
Despite their losing record, Carolina made many improvements. According to Football Outsiders, the Panthers had the biggest year-to-year offensive improvement in their history: they were dead last in 2010, and moved up to 4th offensively in 2011, according to Football Outsiders' statistical formulas. In addition, Football Outsiders states that Carolina had the best running game in their calculations' history. This was due to the addition of Cam Newton's running ability to the high-quality running tandem of running backs DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart.Football Outsiders: Final 2011 DVOA Ratings The rushing attack eclipsed that of the previous record holder, the 2000 St. Louis Rams. In the process, Carolina became the first team in NFL history to have three players with 700 or more yards rushing in the same season: running back DeAngelo Williams with 836, running back Jonathan Stewart with 761 and quarterback Cam Newton with 706.  The Panthers also set the team record for net yards with 6,237 yards, breaking the record originally set by the 2004 team. 
Carolina's defense, however, was ranked last in the league, according to Football Outsiders.Ibid. They allowed the fifth-most total yards in the league on defense in 2011, and the sixth-most points.Their pass defense gave up 7.6 yards per pass attempt (tied for worst in the league), and their 6.2 yards allowed per play was tied for third-worst in the league.Pro-Football-Reference.com: 2011 NFL Opposition & Defensive Statistics

Jama and Mohamed were arrested in Gothenburg and Stockholm in May and June 2010 following an investigation by the Swedish Security Service. The court said in its ruling that the accused "had taken it upon themselves and decided with the Somali islamist militia al-Shabaab to commit terrorist crimes in the form of suicide attacks".
In March 2011 they were both released from custody, following trial in Court of appeal for Western Sweden ("Hovrätten för västra Sverige")that soon after announced the exculpatory verdict.
The prosecution based its case on interrogations of the two suspects, witness accounts and a long line of tapped telephone conversations, claimed to have proof the two men had been in contact with al-Shabaab leader Yassin Ismail Ahmed.
The recorded telephone conversations also showed that Mohamed had attended an al-Shabaab training camp in Somalia and that he aimed to "return to Somalia and wanted to become a martyr," while Jama "was preparing for a future suicide mission," the charge sheet said.

The city centre is located at the confluence of the Ottawa and Rideau Rivers. The Ottawa River forms the entire northern boundary of the city which it shares with the province of Quebec's municipalities of Pontiac and Gatineau. The northern boundary begins in the west at Arnprior and continues east to Rockland.  The boundary then turns south in a straight line, separating the former Township of Cumberland (now in Ottawa) and the City of Clarence-Rockland. It then turns west in another straight line separating the former Township of Cumberland with the municipalities of The Nation and Russell. It then turns south separating Russell from the former Township of Osgoode (now in Ottawa). That boundary runs south in a straight line, then turns west separating Osgoode from the municipality of North Dundas. That boundary runs west in a straight line before turning north separating Osgoode from the municipality of North Grenville. This is another straight line, running north until the Rideau River near Kemptville. The boundary follows the River upsteam until almost reaching Merickville. The boundary then runs in a northwest direction in a straight line with a number of jogs. It separates the municipalities of Montague, Beckwith and Mississippi Mills from the former townships of Marlborough, Goulbourn, Huntley and Fitzroy.

American Electric Power Company v. Connecticut, [tpl]scite|564|___|2011[/tpl], was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court, in an 8–0 decision, held that corporations cannot be sued for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) under federal common law, primarily because the Clean Air Act (CAA) delegates the management of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Brought to court in July 2004 in the Southern District of New York, this was the first global warming case based on a public nuisance claim.

The South African Open, formerly the South African Championships, was an annual tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts from 1891 to 2011. The tournament was not played from 1900 to 1902 due to the Boer War, from 1915 to 1919 due to World War I, and from 1941 to 1945 due to World War II. The women's tournament was stopped in 1987 and was not played in any of the editions of the Open that followed, except for 1990.
Sets were played on advantage until 1971; "lingering death" tie-breaks at six games all were subsequently adopted. All matches were the best-of-three-sets. 
The most successful female player at the South African Championships – played from 1891 to 1967 during the Amateur Era – was Mrs H.A. Kirby, who won six titles between 1904 and 1912. She also shares the overall record for the most consecutive titles won with Miss H. Grant. Both players won four consecutive titles – Grant won the first four South African titles from 1891 to 1894 and Mrs Kirby won four titles between 1904 and 1907. Margaret Court and Brigitte Cuypers share the record for the most wins at the tournament in the Open Era. Court won three titles in 1968, 1970 and 1971 and Cuypers won in 1976, 1978 and 1979.

Regulatory science refers broadly to the scientific and technical foundations upon which regulations are based in various industries - particularly those involving health or safety.  Regulatory bodies employing such principles in the US include for example the FDA for food and medical products, the EPA for the environment, and OSHA for work safety.  "Regulatory Science" is contrasted from regulatory affairs and regulatory law, which refer to the administrative or legal aspects of regulation, in that the former is focused on the regulations' scientific (natural, not social) underpinnings and concerns - rather than the regulations' promulgation, implementation, compliance, or enforcement.

The Salzachgeier ([tpl]Höhe|2469|AT[/tpl]) is a rugged peak on the edge of the Kitzbühel Alps on the border of the Austrian states of Salzburg and Tyrol. In the cirques and high alpine meadows (Hochalmen) of its eastern slopes and the two neighbouring peaks of Fünfmandling ([tpl]Höhe|2401[/tpl]) and Schwebenkopf ([tpl]Höhe|2354[/tpl]) are the headstreams of the Salzach, the largest river north of the Salzburg Central Alps.
The Salzachgeier has a double summit where five sharp ridges run together. The eastern summit is only three metres lower and towers immediately above the two aforementioned source regions (the Salzachboden and Schwebenalm).
Whilst the southern slopes of the three peaks descend towards the Gerlos Pass, the watershed to the north (the Salzachjoch 1,983 m) is only a kilometre from the eastern cirques. Here on the state border, high over the Roßwildalm, is a mountain chapel, the Markkirchl (St. Mark's Chapel) and somewhat lower down is the New Bamberg Hut run by the German Alpine Club (DAV). To the west the slopes are just as steep, but less rocky, and drain into the Frommbach stream in the direction of Kitzbühel.
The Salzachgeier is part of the touring area for the Bamberg Hut and is a popular ski tour in winter.

It is the largest known complex of prehistoric flint mines in Europe.Sałaciński S. & Zalewski M., 1987: Krzemionki. Wydawnictwa Geologiczne, page 9. 
The flint mining in Krzemionki began about 3900 BC and lasted until about 1600 BC. During Neolithic times the mine was used by members of the Funnelbeaker culture who spread the flint mining area far up to 300 km. The Globular Amphora Culture also used the pits and even more intensely, enlarging the area of exploration to about 500 km. 
The site is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated October 16, 1994.  Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland.

[[Radiodrome]]

CATEGORIES: Curves, Differential equations, Analytic geometry

In geometry, a radiodrome is the path followed by a point which is pursuing another point. The term is derived from the Latin word radius (beam) and the Greek word dromos (running). The classical (and best-known) form of a radiodrome is known as the "dog curve"; this is the path a dog follows when it swims across a stream with a current after food it has spotted on the other side. Because the dog drifts downwards with the current, it will have to change its heading; it will also have to swim further than if it had computed the optimal heading. This case was described by Pierre Bouguer in 1732.
It is also the name of a weekly radio show hosted by internet personality Brad Jones and Josh Hadley.
A radiodrome may alternatively be described as the path a dog follows when chasing a hare, assuming that the hare runs in a straight line at a constant velocity.
It is illustrated by the following figure:

[[Bolero (Chopin)]]
CATEGORIES: 1833 compositions, Compositions by Frédéric Chopin, Solo piano pieces

The Bolero, Op. 19, was written by Frédéric Chopin in 1833 and published the following year.  It is one of his lesser-known piano pieces, although it has been recorded numerous times.
The overall key of the Bolero is difficult to establish.  The work opens with three unison octaves in G fortissimo, then a lengthy Introduction in C major, moving to A minor for the Bolero proper.  It is interrupted by sections in A major, A-flat major and B-flat minor before returning to A minor.  It ends triumphantly in A major.
The work was dedicated to the Scottish-born but half-French Mademoiselle la Comtesse Émilie de Flahaut,Otto-Haas Music then aged only 14, but later to become Countess of Shelburne.  
The apparent inspiration for the Bolero was Chopin's friendship with the French soprano Pauline Viardot, whose father, the famed Spanish tenor Manuel Garcia, had introduced boleros to Paris by the time of Chopin's arrival there.Naxos  His biographer Frederick Niecks speculated that it was inspired by the Bolero in Daniel Auber's La muette de Portici (1828).
Despite the ostensibly Spanish flavour of the piece, it has been described as a polonaise in disguise, or a bolero à la polonaise,Chopin Files as its rhythms are more redolent of the national dance of Chopin's homeland than anything Spanish.  It was written five years before Chopin first visited Spain (1838).

FEVR is characterized by exudative leakage and hemorrhage of the blood vessels in the retina, along with incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina, and can easily be confused with retinopathy of prematurity in premature infants.  The disease process often leads to retinal folds, tears, and detachments.  Although FEVR is a genetic condition, it does not affect other parts of the body.

Monticolomys is a genus of rodents within the subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, and is closely related to Macrotarsomys. The only species, Monticolomys koopmani, also known as the Malagasy mountain mouse or Koopman's montane voalavo, is found in the highlands of eastern Madagascar. A small mouse-like rodent, M. koopmani is dark brown on the upperparts and dark gray below. It has small, rounded, densely haired ears and broad feet with well-developed pads. The long tail lacks a tuft at the tip. The skull is delicate and lacks crests and ridges on its roof.
First collected in 1929, Monticolomys koopmani was not formally described until 1996, but it is now known to have a broad distribution. Active during the night, it occurs in both montane forest and human-disturbed grasslands and feeds on fruits and seeds. A scansorial animal, it climbs trees but also lives on the ground. Although habitat destruction may pose a threat, it is classified as "Least Concern" on the IUCN Red List.

The boûkète, also spelled bouquette in French, is a Belgian pancake made with buckwheat flour, frequently decorated with raisins, fried in a pan with lard, which are eaten hot or cold, garnished with sugar from a local brown sugar called cassonade or with sirop de Liège.
It derives its name from wheat or buckwheat called "bouquets" and "Boquete", derived from Dutch "boekweit" in a name attested since the early 17th century before taking the meaning of pancake, attested to the first time in 1743.
The introduction of the bouquet in Liège dates back to the 18th century, when it was imported from Flanders by the court of the Prince-Bishops from the County of Loon and around Tongeren. It was eventually adopted by Liege at the end of the 19th century.
It is traditionally eaten accompanied by mulled wine during the holidays of the year but is also being honored at the festival on August 15 in the "free Republic of Outre-meuse" (in Liège).

[[Learning circle]]

CATEGORIES: Social groups, Types of organization, Group processes, Peer learning

The use of a circle as both the organizational structure and descriptive metaphor for a meeting of equals is likely to have been a part of our history for as long as fire has. The learning circle is a mechanism for organizing and honoring the collective wisdom of the group and is present in many indigenous cultures. For example, in early native councils of elders came together to understand problems in a spirit of shared community in “wisdom circles.” The term Learning Circle has been used to describe group efforts with clear links to social change . Over time and across countries, civic organizations, neighborhood communities, trade unions, churches and social justice groups have used the idea of learning circles to empower their members to make choices and take action. The web can help locate the many ways both present and past that groups have used the term   Study circle or  Learning Circle as a form of adult and student education. For example, Educators for Community Engagement,http://www.e4ce.org/ Educators for Community Engagement find that learning circles—with their principles of equal participation, reciprocity, and honoring of collective wisdom -embody the democratic principles of effective service-learning partnerships. They use learning circles, rather than more traditional forms of group meetings, to structure their annual conferences. Primary teachers use a simple form of learning circles when they gather the students at the rug for "circle time." However many educators are using learning circles to connect students from around the world.http://www.iearn.org/circles IEARN Learning Circles Australian Model of Learning Circles in Educationhttp://globalteenager.org The Global Teenagers Project uses Learning Circleshttp://sites.google.com/site/onlinelearningcircles/Home/action-research-learning-circles Action Research Learning Circles  Among the goals of this activity are helping students to develop the trust and respect for diversity of experience, and fostering both listening and speaking skills among peers. Researchers have used learning circles as a form of professional development to improve their practice. A similar term, "Quality circle" was used in the 80's to characterize the successful practice in corporate settings in which the hierarchical boundaries between workers and managers are flattened to encourage participatory management and team leadership.  Quality circles,  originally associated with Japanese management and manufacturing techniques developed in Japan after world war II, based on lectures of W. Edwards Deming (Joel & Ross, 1982). The goal was to encourage everyone to develop a strong sense of ownership over the process and products of the group.

Founded by Tomislav Wruss in 2003http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/nedjeljni-jutarnji-list-od-2-ozujka-na-kioscima/121703.aspx in the long tradition of Croatian Sunday papers such as Nedjeljna Dalmacija, it was brasher and less polite than the daily edition of Jutarnji.
Nedjeljni typically publishes fewer political and more urban-tabloid and human interest stories than its daily counterpart. The approach is more populist and entertaining, yet it has also been a platform for serious debate and important crusading issues.

Aurora, Colorado counts among the 60 largest cities in the United States, with a population greater than such cities as Pittsburgh, Buffalo or Salt Lake City, but lacks a skyline typical of cities its size. This is due to Aurora’s largely suburban character and relatively small central business district. Indeed, “Original Aurora”, the city’s traditional downtown, has only one building of notable height. During Aurora’s most intense period of growth in the 1970s and 1980s, the area in the geographic center of the city near the I-225 freeway and Aurora Mall (now Aurora Town Center) was envisioned as “Aurora City Center”, a new downtown complete with a collection of tall office buildings. However, these plans have yet to materialize and a large tract of undeveloped land still lies east of Aurora Town Center. As is typical of suburban development patterns of the postwar era, Aurora’s tallest buildings are located along the I-225 corridor, largely either in the vicinity of the Parker Road interchange in the southwestern portion of the city, or near the Colfax Avenue interchange in the northwestern portion of the city, where a large medical services and research campus has emerged. In recent years, a number of hotel properties have also been built in Aurora along I-70 in the environs of Denver International Airport (DIA).

The Aswan Low Dam or Old Aswan Dam is a gravity masonry buttress dam on the Nile River in Aswan, Egypt. The dam was built at the former first cataract of the Nile, and is located about 1000 km up-river and 690 km (direct distance) south-southeast of Cairo. When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had ever been attempted; on completion, it was the largest masonry dam in the world. The dam was designed to provide storage of annual floodwater and augment dry season flows to support greater irrigation developmentPower from the Assuan Dam to Be Used to Increase Still Further the Cotton Crop in Egypt, The New York Times, July 27, 1913, (pdf file) and population growth in the lower Nile. The dam, originally limited in height by conservation concerns, worked as designed, but provided inadequate storage capacity for planned development and was raised twice, between 1907–1912 and again 1929–1933. These heightenings still did not meet irrigation demands and in 1946 it was nearly over-topped in an effort to maximize pool elevation. This led to the investigation and construction of the Aswan High Dam [tpl]Convert|6|km|mi|0[/tpl] upstream.[tpl]cite web|title=The First Aswan Dam|url=http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Exhibits/AncientNubia/PhotoIntro.html|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl]

It was considered one of the finest inns of the day and hosted a number of prominent guests including Henry Clay and Governor John Chambers.   The inn became a popular stop on the way for summer tourists destined for the Blue Licks Spring.  A number of parties and masked balls were held in its generous rooms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/77000634.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form|accessdate=2010-12-31|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service[/tpl]
The complex consists of an original structure facing Sutton Street built by Dr. William Murtagh (circa 1798), the building facing Front Street (1844) and a three story addition of 16 hotel rooms (circa 1850).  Most of the design elements are Greek Revival and the brickwork is Flemish bond.   Construction of the floodwall in the early 1950s protected the structure from flooding, but blocked the river view from the lower two stories. 
The structure was bought in 1863 by Charles B. Hill and was known for some time as the Hill House.  In 1977, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

CATEGORIES: Eating behaviors, Biological interactions

Consumer-resource interactions are the core motif of ecological food chains or food webs,Bascompte, J. (2009). Disentangling the web of life. Science, 325, 416–419. and are an umbrella term for a variety of more specialized types of biological species interactions including prey-predator (see predation), host-parasite (see parasitism), plant-herbivore and victim-exploiter systems.  These kinds of interactions have been studied and modeled by population ecologists for close on a century, as reviewed in synthetic monographs on this topic by Murdoch et al.Murdoch, W.W., Briggs, C.J. & Nisbet, R.M. (2003) Consumer–Resource Dynamics. Princeton University, Press, Princeton, NJ. and Turchin.Turchin P. (2003). Complex Population Dynamics. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 450 pp.  Species at the bottom of the food chain, such as algae and other autotrophs, consume non-biological resources, such as minerals and nutrients of various kinds, and they derive their energy from light (photons) or chemical sources.  Species higher up in the food chain survive by consuming other species and can be classified by what they eat and how they obtain or find their food.

She made little impression on the racecourse as a two-year-old, winning only one race out of six. She started her three-year-old season well, winning a listed race. Snow Fairy then started the Epsom Oaks at 12/1. Ridden by Ryan Moore, she won by a neck. Again ridden by Moore, she won the Irish Oaks easily. When taking on older horses for the first time in the Yorkshire Oaks, she finished second to Midday. Following a run in the St Leger, she went to Japan and won the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup followed by the Hong Kong Cup. As a four-year-old in 2011, she won the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup for a second time, but also placed in a number of top races, including third in the Arc de Triomphe and second in the Irish Champion Stakes. She stayed in training for the 2012 season and won the G1 Prix Jean Romanet at Deauville in August (later disqualified), and then the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September.
Snow Fairy was retired in July 2013 after aggravating a tendon injury.[tpl]cite web|title=Snow Fairy: Dual Oaks winner retired because of injury|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/23334291|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2013[/tpl] Her owner announced that the filly would be sent to Islanmore Stud in County Limerick for breeding.[tpl]cite news|last=Wood|first=Greg|title=Brilliant racemare Snow Fairy suffers career-ending injury|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jul/16/snow-fairy-career-ending-injury|work=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=17 July 2013|location=London|date=16 July 2013[/tpl]

[[Miscellaneous compositions (Chopin)]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Frédéric Chopin, Solo piano pieces, Piano compositions by composer

The great bulk of Frédéric Chopin's output consists of pieces for solo piano: his ballades, études, impromptus, mazurkas, nocturnes, polonaises, preludes, rondos, scherzos, sonatas and waltzes.  There are also the two piano concertos, four other works for piano and orchestra, and a small amount of chamber music.
However, Chopin also produced a number of other compositions, mostly for solo piano, but some for other forces.  Some of these are well-known, such as the Barcarole in F-sharp, the Fantaisie in F minor, the Berceuse in D-flat, and some of the 19 Polish songs.  Most of the other lesser-known works were published only after his death, contrary to his express wishes that all his unpublished manuscripts should be burned.  
While often disregarded in the concert repertoire (particularly the posthumously published works), these miscellaneous works are nevertheless part of his oeuvre and most have been recorded, in some cases numerous times.

Following the closure of the Nagasaki Naval Training Center by his political opponents within the Tokugawa shogunate, Katsu Kaishū made a visit to the United States aboard the Japanese steamship Kanrin Maru, and returned even more determined that Japan needed to build a modern navy in order to prevent colonization by the Western imperialist powers. He obtained official permission to establish a training school at what was then the small fishing village of Kobe in Settsu Province with the three-fold purpose of creating an officer’s training academy, a shipyard for the construction of modern warships, and a modern seaport.
From the beginning, Katsu encountered opposition to his plans from within the shogunate, and as official funding was withheld, he was forced to support the center largely out of his own funds and the donations of a few sympathetic daimyō. The presence of a large number of pro-Sonnō jōi rōnin within the membership of the center also brought the project under suspicion, especially in the wake of the Kinmon Incident and the Ikedaya Incident, and the center was closed in mid-1865,
A number of students of the Kobe Naval Training Center subsequently went on to play a major role in the Meiji Restoration, including Sakamoto Ryōma, Mutsu Munemitsu and Itoh Sukeyuki.

Post SV Berlin is a German association football club from the city of Berlin. It was formed 29 September 1924 and was one of many the sport clubs established by police and postal workers in the 1920s.Grüne, Hardy and Karn, Christian (2009). Das große Buch der Deutschen Fusballverein Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. ISBN 978-3-89784-362-2. Through most of its history the club has been a lower-tier local side.
Post played just a single season in the top-flight Oberliga Berlin in 1932–33, just prior to the restructuring of German football under the Third Reich. The country's existing regional leagues were replaced by 16 Gauligen and Post failed to qualify for the new Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg (I) after its 7th place Oberliga finish. They took part in qualification for Gauliga play at the end of the 1935–36 season, but did poorly. The team's only cup appearance also took place in 1930s when they played in the 1932 Berliner Landespokal (Berlin Cup). They advanced out of the quarterfinals past Südstern Neukölln (1:0) to be put out by Hertha BSC Berlin in their semifinal matchup (2:5).
Following World War II, occupying Allied authorities banned most organizations across the country, including sports and football clubs, as part of the process of de-Nazification. Post was lost in 1945 and not re-formed until 1949 when the club re-appeared as Blau-Gelb Berlin, named for the traditional blue and yellow of the national postal service. It was not until 1952 that the club resumed its historical identity as Post Sportverein Berlin.Grüne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklopädie des deutschen Ligafußballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. ISBN 978-3-89784-147-5. The division of the city into eastern and western sectors during the Cold War led to the formation of the postal workers club BSG Post Berlin which became part of the separate football competition that emerged in East Germany.
In 1972, Post joined SpVgg Berlin 74 to create Post SV 1974 Berlin. Following German reunification, BSG Post Berlin became part of Post SV 74 in 1990. In 2005, the club was renamed Pro Sport Berlin 24.

In the case of budget bills and urgent matters, a bill must be passed in the same session of Parliament.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20(A5).pdf |format=PDF |title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan (English). Article 13 – Passing of Bills |publisher=Government of Bhutan |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl]
Once bills have passed Parliament, they are submitted to the King for royal assent within fifteen days.
If the other house neither passes nor returns the bill by the end of the next session, the bill is deemed to have passed, and the house in which the bill originated shall present the bill within fifteen days to the King for assent.
If the King does not grant assent to the bill, he returns the bill with amendments or objections for Parliament to deliberate and vote on the bill in a joint sitting. After Parliament deliberates and passes the bill in a joint sitting, Parliament resubmits the bill to the Druk Gyalpo who must then grant assent to the bill.
Acts passed predating the enactment of the Constitution in 2008 were passed under different procedures, some originating as promulgations by the King as indicated in their preamble. Below is a list of Acts of the Kingdom of Bhutan.

[[Illegality in English law]]
CATEGORIES: English contract law, English tort law, English trusts law

Illegality in English law is a potential ground in English contract law, tort or trusts for a court to refuse to enforce an obligation. The illegality of a transaction, either because of public policy under the common law, or because of legislation, potentially means no action directly concerning the deal will be heard by the courts. The doctrine is reminiscent of the Latin phrase "Ex turpi causa non oritur actio", meaning "no cause of action arises from a wrong". The primary problem arising when courts refuse to enforce an agreement is the extent to which an innocent party may recover any property already conveyed through the transaction. Hence illegality is raises important questions for English unjust enrichment law.

CATEGORIES: 1985 albums, Living Music albums, Paul Winter albums

Canyon is an album released in 1985 by Paul Winter, featuring his Paul Winter Consort. It was recorded in a small side canyon located in the Grand Canyon, which the members of the Consort nicknamed Bach's canyon, due to its 7 second reverberation, which made a perfect place to record music. The original idea of playing music in the canyon began when Winter played his saxophone while standing on the edge of the canyon, and felt that the long echoes coming back from the canyon almost seemed like the Earth was responding back to him.
Paul Winter and the members of his band rafted down the river searching for an ideal location to record, settling on Bach's canyon. Paul Winter has since gone back and recorded in the canyon for other albums.
Canyon was nominated for a Grammy in 1986.http://www.livingmusic.com/catalogue/albums/canyon.html

The War of the Roses is a 1989 American black comedy film based upon the 1981 novel The War of the Roses by Warren Adler. The film follows a wealthy couple with a seemingly perfect marriage. When their marriage begins to fall apart, material possessions become the center of an outrageous and bitter divorce battle.
This is the third film to co-star Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito, after Romancing the Stone and its sequel, The Jewel of the Nile. DeVito directed the film, which also had producer James L. Brooks and actor Dan Castellaneta working on a project outside of The Simpsons. The opening title sequence was created by Saul Bass.
In both the novel and the film, the married couple's family name is Rose, and the title is an allusion to the battles between the Houses of York and Lancaster at the end of the Middle Ages.

The Wars of the Roses was a series of dynastic wars for the throne of England. They were fought between supporters of two rival branches of the royal House of Plantagenet, the houses of Lancaster and York. They were fought in several sporadic episodes between 1455 and 1487, although there was related fighting before and after this period. The conflict resulted from social and financial troubles that followed the Hundred Years' War, combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of Henry VI, which revived interest in the alternative claim to the throne of Richard, Duke of York.
The final victory went to a Lancastrian claimant, Henry Tudor, who defeated the last Yorkist king, Richard III, at the Battle of Bosworth Field. After assuming the throne as Henry VII, Henry Tudor married Elizabeth of York, the daughter of Edward IV, thereby uniting the two houses. In an era leading to what is sometimes referred to as the "Golden Age" of Elizabeth, [tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] the House of Tudor ruled England and Wales until 1603.

[[The Cat House on the Kings]]

CATEGORIES: Non-profit organizations based in California, Animal welfare organizations in the United States, Domestic cat welfare organizations

The Cat House on the Kings is a nonprofit corporation that operates the largest no-kill, lifetime cat sanctuary and adoption center in California.http://community.cbs47.tv/blogs/kathryn_herr_blog/archive/2009/10/31/4263038.aspx It is located in Parlier in Fresno County, and currently supports over 700 cats as well as a small number of dogs and goats in a cage-free environment on land with the Kings River (California) as its border. The organization's founder, Lynea Lattanzio, started informally in 1992 when she became active in caring for abandoned and homeless kittens and cats on the 6 acre property. Since its inception the facility has received donations and volunteers to expand up to 12 acres. The cats are allowed freedom to go indoors or out whenever they wish, but some are segregated due to age, illness, or sociability. The corporation also offers temporary boarding services and holds adoption fairs.
The mission of the organization is to place rescued cats and kittens into loving, permanent homes; to provide a safe, happy and healthy home for unwanted cats and kittens in a unique, no-cage facility; to prevent pet overpopulation through spaying and neutering; and to educate the public about responsible pet ownership.
How much does it cost to run the Cat House? As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, it receives no government or public funding and relies on private donations to fund its operations.http://www.cathouseonthekings.com/contribute.php The cost now is about $80,000 per month to run the Cat House, just for the basic needs of the animals they care for plus the spays/neuters/medical care for the community cats. With medicine and vaccine costs rising this amount will continue to rise. The Cat House on the Kings relies on donations of all kinds to keep their animals in the comfort that they deserve as well as reduce the amount of homeless animals in our community. 	
The Cat House on the Kings has partnered with Petco and the Petco Foundation to build a 1500 sq. ft. adoption center inside Petco at 4144 N. Blackstone at Ashlan in Fresno. The adoption center at Petco is open daily 10am-5:00pm and Wednesday 10am-6:00. Call (559) 222-0228 for more information. 	
The PETCO Adoption Center Has A Live Kitten Cam 
Visit their website, you too can sponsor a webcam. To enable many people to view the video stream from a webcam simultaneously, they must pay a video streaming service. By sponsoring a webcam you help defray the cost for providing this view into The Cat House on the Kings. This video stream is helping kittens and cats find new loving adoptive families.
The Cat House on the Kings offers a variety of services:http://www.cathouseonthekings.com/whatwedo.php
Advice and Education
They offer assistance and education in behavioral problems with cats and assist people in finding new homes for their cats. They also advise thousands of people from around the world who contact them through their web site (they have sponsors as far away as Denmark and Australia) and at the local, public events about all manner of cat issues.
Adoption Center
All of their cats are available for adoption. "We do our utmost to find the best possible homes for our cats; none are euthanized except to relieve suffering. The cats live out their lives in our sanctuary until they are either adopted or die of old age — however long that may be." Every year, The Cat House adopts out approximately 500 cats (and many dogs).
Sanctuary
They are best known for their sanctuary, where they care for over 700 unwanted cats and kittens. Individuals may surrender their cats  for a fee of $5000 per cat, this allows the sanctuary to provide lifetime support and care. As a courtesy, payments towards the fee may be made monthly at a minimum rate of about $2.00 per cat per day. Upon arrival at The Cat House, every cat is given any necessary medical care, and is spayed/neutered and vaccinated. They are then placed in cottages where they can become familiar with their surroundings. Once they're comfortable with their new digs, they are released onto the sanctuary grounds, and can roam about at will. The grounds are fully fenced and secure.
Boarding
Several sections of the facility are reserved for both short and long-term boarding.
Low cost spay/neuter
The Cat House works with local veterinary clinics to provide affordable rates for spay/neuter surgery. They also provide transport between The Cat House and the surgery clinic. They have been selected in several spay/neuter grants for their productivity and efficiency.

[[Topology (chemistry)]]
CATEGORIES: Molecular topology, Molecular geometry, Supramolecular chemistry, Topology, Cheminformatics, Mathematical chemistry

In chemistry, topology provides a convenient way of describing and predicting the molecular structure within the constraints of three-dimensional (3-D) space.  Given the determinants of chemical bonding and the chemical properties of the atoms, topology provides a model for explaining how the atoms ethereal wave functions must fit together.  Molecular topology is a part of mathematical chemistry dealing with the algebraic description of chemical compounds so allowing a unique and easy characterization of them.
Topology is insensitive to the details of a scalar field, and can often be determined using simplified calculations.  Scalar fields such as electron density, Madelung[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] field, covalent field and the electrostatic potential can be used to model topology.Brown, David; Topology and Chemistry; Structural Chemistry Volume 13, Numbers 3–4, 339–355, [tpl]doi|10.1023/A:1015872125545[/tpl]
Each scalar field has its own distinctive topology and each provides different information about the nature of chemical bonding and structure. The analysis of these topologies, when combined with simple electrostatic theory and a few empirical observations, leads to a quantitative model of localized chemical bonding. In the process, the analysis provides insights into the nature of chemical bonding.
Applied topology explains how large molecules reach their final shapes and how biological molecules achieve their activity.

The Hunter Station Bridge is a truss bridge that carries U.S. Route 62 across the Allegheny River in rural Tionesta Township in Forest County, Pennsylvania. The structure was named for a railroad stop on the long defunct Ridgway & Oil City Railroad.
The bridge features an unusual design, in which the roadway is built into the middle of the truss, as opposed to the bottom of the structure. This was done to prevent flooding from submerging the highway, which was relatively common before the upstream construction of the Kinzua Dam. In 1971, the bridge was reconstructed, several years after the completion of the dam.

The Mexican expedition was undertaken in 1862 on order of emperor Napoleon III following a financial dispute with the Republic of Mexico and his personal desire to create a Catholic empire on the continent to counterbalance U.S. influence.  On 7 January 1862, approximately 3,000 French soldiers landed at Vera Cruz.  Small British and Spanish contingents that were originally part of the adventure preferred to withdraw quickly leaving only the French forces assisted by small numbers of Austrian, Belgian and Turkish troops.[tpl]cite web  | authorlink = Marc Champenois | title = France Phaléristique web site | publisher = Marc Champenois | date = 2004-01-01 | url = http://www.france-phaleristique.com/accueil.htm| language = French | accessdate =2013-10-29 [/tpl]
These forces, whose numbers would later rise to approximately 38,000 men, were successively placed under the command of generals Charles de Lorencez,  Élie Frédéric Forey and finally François Achille Bazaine.  The campaign was the scene of some of the most notable battles in French military history, such as the glorious struggle for the village of Camaron where, on 30 April 1863, sixty two legionnaires resisted bravely for nine hours against over two thousand Mexicans, allowing for the capture of the city of Puebla on 17 May 1863 thus paving the way to Mexico.  In the capital, an assembly of notables recognized Archduke Maximilian of Habsburg, brother of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.
However, even with the support of 20,000 Mexicans who embraced the new emperor, Maximilian's forces were harassed in their work of pacification by the troops of President Benito Juárez who had the support of the United States.  In February 1867, Emperor Napoleon III ordered the repatriation of all remaining French troops from Mexico, the last elements left the port of Vera Cruz on 12 March 1867. An abandoned Emperor Maximilian, defeated and captured near the city of Querétaro, was executed in June of that year.

[[Football in the Philippines]]

CATEGORIES: Football in the Philippines, Sports in the Philippines

Association football is an emerging sport in the Philippines, played by amateur and professional Filipino football clubs. The Philippine Football Federation (PFF) is the governing body of international football in the country.
Football is a popular sport among the country's Southeast Asian neighbors, yet it is overshadowed by basketball, which is the most popular sport in the Philippines.  However, football has a long history in the archipelago, dating back to more than 100 years ago when Paulino Alcántara became the first Filipino and Asian player to play for a European club.  He made his debut as a striker at the age of 15 at Barcelona, which made him the club's youngest and second highest goalscorer behind Lionel Messi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/3/16/5514714/lionel-messi-barcelona-goal-scoring-record-video|title=Lionel Messi becomes Barcelona's all-time leading scorer|author=Woosley, Zach|publisher=SB Nation|date=16 March 2014|accessdate=26 March 2014|quote=Lionel Messi is officially the greatest goal scorer in FC Barcelona history.

To promote and revive the sport, some international and local football clubs helped the Philippines. FIFA also assisted the country by building and upgrading facilities including the creation of the PFF headquarters in 2009. As well, the establishment of the United Football League (UFL) and the National Men's Club Championship to provide more local competitions.
The Philippines national football team is the representative of men's international football for the Philippines. They won the Far Eastern Games once (in 1913) and became a two-time Philippine Peace Cup champion (in 2012 and 2013). The Philippines women's national football team, representing women's international football in the Philippines, achieved a third-place (bronze) finish at the 1985 Southeast Asian Games.
There are many stadiums that can be found in the Philippines like the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila which is the national stadium of the country. It is also the home stadium of the Philippine football team. Meanwhile, the Panaad Stadium in Bacolod is the secondary venue for the Philippines.

Winter (born 2005) is a bottlenose dolphin at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Clearwater, Florida, USA, widely known for having a prosthetic tail. She is the subject of the film Dolphin Tale, a dramatization of her story, and the upcoming sequel Dolphin Tale 2. Winter was found in the coastal waters of Florida in December 2005, caught in a crab trap, which resulted in the loss of her tail. She was found and taken to Clearwater Marine Aquarium.  The loss of her tail caused her to swim unnaturally with her tail moving side to side instead of up and down. As a result, she was fitted with a silicone and plastic tail that enabled her to swim normally. She has since become a highly popular attraction at the aquarium, which led to the film's making. She lives in her pool with another dolphin, Hope, who will be the subject of the 2014 sequel to Dolphin Tale, Dolphin Tale 2.

In the Battle of Prenzlau or Capitulation of Prenzlau on 28 October 1806 two divisions of French cavalry and some infantry led by Marshal Joachim Murat intercepted a retreating Prussian corps led by Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen. In this action from the War of the Fourth Coalition, Hohenlohe surrendered his entire force to Murat after some fighting and a parley. Prenzlau is located about 90 kilometers north of Berlin in Brandenburg, Germany at the intersection of routes B109 and B198. 
After their catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October, the Prussian armies fled north to the Elbe River with Emperor Napoleon I of France's victorious army in hot pursuit. The Prussians crossed the Elbe near Magdeburg and marched northeast, trying to reach safety behind the Oder River. Part of Napoleon's army thrust east to seize Berlin, while the rest followed the retreating Prussians. From Berlin, Murat moved north with his cavalry, trying to head off Hohenlohe. 
After several clashes on 26 and 27 October, Murat arrived at Prenzlau on the heels of Hohenlohe's corps. Fighting occurred in which several Prussian units were captured or cut to pieces. Murat then bluffed the demoralized Hohenlohe into surrendering his entire corps by claiming that the Prussians were surrounded by overwhelming forces. In fact, apart from a brigade of infantry, only Murat's cavalry were in the vicinity. In the days afterward, the French cowed several more Prussian forces and fortresses into surrendering. Finding its way to the northeast blocked, a second corps of retreating Prussians under Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher veered northwest toward Lübeck.

[[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)]]
CATEGORIES: Arthropod anatomy, Insect anatomy

The labrum is a flap-like structure that lies immediately in front of the mouth in almost all extant Euarthropoda. The most conspicuous exceptions are the Pycnogonida, which probably are chelicerate-relatives. In entomology, the labrum amounts to the "upper lip" of an insect mouth, the corresponding "lower lip" being the labium.
The evolutionary origin, embryogenesis and morphological development of the labrum have proved to be by far the most controversial and challenging topic in the study of arthropod head structures.

Blas Videla (circa 1785 - 1831) was an Argentine soldier and Unitarian politician.
He was born into a wealthy family of merchants and landowners in San Luis Province. In 1803 he became a lieutenant in a volunteer regiment of the provincial cavalry. In 1806 he marched to Buenos Aires under the command of the viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte to fight against the British invasion. Though he arrived too late to join in the reconquest of the city, he aided in the defense of the city the following year.Vicente Cutolo, Nuevo diccionario biográfico argentino, 7 volúmenes, Ed. Elche, Bs. As., 1968-1985. [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
In 1810 he participated in the provincial militia in support of the Revolution of May. He commanded a contingent of 225 San Luis soldiers, who joined with the Army of the North. He participated in the battles of Tucumán, Salta, and Vilcapugio. He was apparently wounded in the latter, because he did not figure in any of the later activities of the Army of the North, and returned to San Luis.
Later he joined the Army of the Andes, but took no part in the famous Chilean campaign, as he was committed to the defense of the border against the Ranquel. In 1819 he helped to put down a royalist mutiny among the officer corps.
For many years Videla remained posted to the border. He was involved in a notable incident in 1822 in which he repelled an invasion, and the following year he advanced into the "desert" of the interior in order to collect intelligence on the military capabilities of the Ranquel and Pehuenche people. 
He took part in the Unitarian Revolution of 1829, and upon its failure he retreated to Córdoba Province under the protection of Colonel Juan Gualberto Echeverría. The following year, after participating in the Battle of Oncativo, he returned to his native province in order to support the governments of his brothers Ignacio and Luis. Early in 1831 he fought against Facundo Quiroga in the Battle of Río Quinto under the command of Colonel Juan Pascual Pringles.Antonio Zinny, Historia de los gobernadores de las Provincias Argentinas, Ed, Hyspamérica, 1987. ISBN 950-614-685-3 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] He withdrew his forces to Mendoza Province, where he joined up with the army of José Videla Castillo, who confronted Quiroga in the Battle of Rodeo de Chacón. After the battle Videla fled south and was taken prisoner. Other prisoners alleged that he had attempted to gain his freedom by betraying his comrades to the Federales. Whatever the truth of these accusations, he remained imprisoned. 
A few weeks later, in the middle of March, Quiroga learned of the assassination of his friend José Benito Villafañe, who had been returning to Chile, and decided to exact vengeance: he ordered the execution of 26 officials, almost all of whom were prisoners taken at Río Quinto or Rodeo de Chacón. Among these was Blas Videla. He died in Mendoza. 
Blas Videla is today best known as the great-great-grandfather of Jorge Rafael Videla, the dictator of Argentina between 1976 and 1981.Materiales del informe "Nunca más" [tpl]es icon[/tpl]

The Cocó Ecological Park ([tpl]lang-pt|Parque Ecológico do Cocó[/tpl]) is an area of conservation and state park located in the city of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, considered of great importance, both for the city, and for the biodiversity that is protected within its borders.http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-northeast/fortaleza/sights/outdoors/parque-ecologico-coco
Containing various endemic and threatened species of plant and animal life, it is considered the most important part of Fortaleza’s natural and ecological heritage. Environmentally, it serves to reduce air temperatures in the city, and also forms a basin which prevents floods at times of high-rainfall. Economically, it is extremely important for the city, generating a large annual income from tourism.http://www.parquedococo.com.br/
The ecological reserve is currently under threat from a government proposal to build a viaduct that will cut into the reserve, resulting in large loss of local flora and fauna. The proposal has drawn widespread criticism from critics, including architects, university professors, environmental groups and various non-governmental organisations.

[[Errored second]]

CATEGORIES: Data transmission, Network performance, Error measures

In telecommunications and data communication systems, an errored second is an interval of a second during which any error whatsoever has occurred, regardless of whether that error was a single bit error, or a complete loss of communication for that entire second; the type of error is not important for the purpose of counting errored seconds.
In communication systems with very low uncorrected bit error rates, such as modern fiber optic transmission systems, or systems with higher low-level error rates that are corrected using large amounts of forward error correction, errored seconds are often a better measure of the effective user-visible error rate than the raw bit error rate. 
For many modern packet-switched communication systems, even a single uncorrected bit error is enough to cause the loss of a data packet by causing its CRC check to fail; whether that packet loss was caused by a single bit error or a hundred-bit-long  error burst is irrelevant.
For systems using large amounts of forward error correction, the reverse applies; a single low-level bit error will almost never occur, since any small errors will almost always be corrected, but any error sufficiently large to cause the forward error correction to fail will almost always result in a large burst error.  
More specialist and precise definitions of errored seconds exist in standards such as the T1 and DS1 transport systems.

[[SPPEF]]
CATEGORIES: Private equity

 
A SPPEF is a Special Purpose Private Equity Fund. It is a legal entity, frequently a Limited Liability Company (LLC) incorporated in the US State of Delaware but it can be any type of corporation or partnership entity and of any domicile. It is formed so as to enable a group of investors, usually individuals, to invest collectively in another entity. It is mostly used to enable private investors in early stage technology companies pool their resources and invest on the same terms as a traditional venture capital fund would. Such investors are typically referred to as Angel Investors.
For angel investors investing in technology companies that are involved in sectors that they have been successful in offers an opportunity to make informed bets and to leverage their networks and experience as advisors so as to leverage their intellectual capital as well as their financial capital. However they often face scope and scale issues. Many are limited to relatively small investment amounts, often in the $50K-$250K range. That therefore usually requires investing in very early stage companies so as to have a relevant investment. They often struggle to maintain their pro-rata investment through subsequent venture capital rounds. Others with more capital to invest fare better but still lack significant leverage. Only the "super angels" can truly leverage their investment and they often lack the time to manage the investment effectively.
One solution for angels is to belong to angel investment groups. These tend to be most effective in California. However there is often a good process for investment presentation, due diligence and placement but not for ongoing management.

Labanoras is a small town within the Labanoras Regional Park in Lithuania. It is situated on Lake Labanoras and is surrounded by the Labanoras Forest, the largest forest in Lithuania. As a center of the regional park, the town attracts tourists. A hotel and restaurant were opened in a former school building in 2003. According to the 2001 census, the town had 75 residents.
Its alternate names include Labanary, Labanoro, Łabonary (Polish), and Labanore (Yiddish).United States Board on Geographic Names – Lithuania – Labanoras. Accessed January 28, 2014.[tpl]cite book|author=Dov Levin|title=The Litvaks: A Short History of the Jews in Lithuania|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p23svLo1fOMC&pg=PA273|year=2000|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-264-3|page=273[/tpl]
The settlement is known from 1373. In 1386, Grand Duke Jogaila gifted Labanoras and other settlements to the newly established Diocese of Vilnius. In 1965 a hoard of about 470 coins was found near the town cemetery. It contained Prague groschens minted by Charles IV (1316–1378) and Wenceslaus (1361–1419) as well as early coins from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Vytautas (1350–1430) and Casimir IV Jagiellon (1427–1492). It is believed that the treasure was buried during the 1470s. The first church was mentioned in 1522, folwark in 1539, manor in 1568, parish school in 1781. The town had 196 residents in 1866, 443 in 1923, 264 in 1959, and 186 in 1979.
A miraculous painting of Mother of God was first mentioned during a canonical visitation in 1655. A wooden church was built in 1820, but it burned down in December 2009. As of January 2011, no official report had been released. Unofficially, the possibility of an accidental fire due to faulty electrical installation was ruled out leaving arson as the main suspect. It is believed that the church was robbed of its over 30 valuable paintings (15 of them were state-protected monuments of art) and then burned to cover up the crime. During the cleanup, 1,017 coins (German pfennigs, Russian kopeks, Lithuanian centas) were found under the burned altar. A reconstruction is underway, financed by the government and private donations.

[[Donaldson ministry]]

CATEGORIES: New South Wales ministries

The Donaldson ministry was the first ministry of the Colony of New South Wales, and was led by the Honourable Stuart Donaldson. Despite the first free elections for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly being held in March 1856, it took over two months for Donaldson to form Government. It was sworn in on 6 June 1856,  after the 1856 election and lasted just eighty days. 
The title of Premier was widely used to refer to the Leader of Government, but not enshrined in formal use until 1920.
There was no party system in New South Wales politics until 1887. Under the constitution, ministers were required to resign to recontest their seats in a by-election when appointed. These by-elections are only noted when the minister was defeated; in general, he was elected unopposed.
This ministry covers the period from 6 June 1856 until on 25 August 1856, when Donaldson resigned his commission, having lost the confidence of the Assembly.[ref]

Elections in the Kingdom of Great Britain were principally general elections and by-elections to the House of Commons of Great Britain. General elections did not have fixed dates, as parliament was summoned and dissolved within the royal prerogative, although on the advice of the ministers of the Crown. The first such general election was that of 1708, and the last that of 1796.
In 1801, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland replaced the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland. For the period after 1801, see Elections in the United Kingdom.

Although not the highest mountain in the Kitzbühel Alps (that honour goes to the Kreuzjoch at [tpl]Höhe|2558|AT[/tpl]), the Großer Rettenstein is the most striking in this range of otherwise gentle grass-covered mountains. It also has a mighty, craggy, summit block made of limestone, four hundred metres high, that stands atop base of grauwacke and primary rock (Urgestein - quartz phyllite). The Rettenstein is the dominating peak of the  Spertental valley. Its isolated location also makes the summit an outstanding viewing point and it is therefore a popular destination. To the north the Rettenstein sends a long ridge out to the Spiessnägel, that separates the oberer Grund and unterer Grund.

[[Thomcord]]
CATEGORIES: Table grape varieties, Hybrid grape varieties

Thomcord is a seedless table grape variety and a hybrid of the popular Thompson Seedless or Sultanina grape (a Vitis vinifera variety) and Concord grape (a Vitis labrusca variety).  Thomcord was developed in 1983 by Californian grape breeders working for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), as part of a test to better understand a new seedless grape breeding procedure.
Its aromatic, "labrusca" flavor is similar to that of Concord, but mellowed by the mild, sweet taste from Thompson Seedless.  Thomcord grows well in hot, dry climates, ripens between late July and mid-August, and tolerates powdery mildew.  It is a productive variety, yielding an average of [tpl]convert|15.1|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] of grapes per vine, but has produced as much as [tpl]convert|30|to|32|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] per vine in grower trials.  The berries weigh between [tpl]convert|2.72|and|3.38|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl] and have a medium-thick, blue-black skin that adheres to the fruit, unlike Concord, which has a thick skin that can slip off the pulp easily.  The aborted seeds in the fruit body are relatively small, but larger than those in Thompson Seedless.
The plant is not restricted for propagation and distribution.  Virus-free propagation material is available from the Foundation Plant Services (FPS) at the University of California, Davis, and its genetic material is archived at the National Plant Germplasm System.  After 17 years of testing, it was declared ready for use in 2003.  It is expected to appear in supermarkets, possibly as a specialty item.

The Linsly School, formerly known as the Linsly Military Institute, is a boarding and day school located in Wheeling, West Virginia. It was founded in 1814 by Noah Linsly and chartered by the State of Virginia in the same year. The school is the oldest preparatory school west of the Alleghenies. It was originally known as the Lancastrian Academy.
In 1861, the school adopted the dress and discipline of an all-boys military school. In 1978 the board of trustees voted to change the military structure and adopt the philosophy of a traditional boys preparatory school.
In 1988, Linsly became a co-ed school.http://www.linsly.org/podium/default.aspx?t=49897
In 2007, Linsly ranged from 5th to 12th grade with a student body of about 420. Linsly boasts a 100% college acceptance rate for its graduating seniors [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl].  In the 2013-2014 school year, the Linsly School has about 440 students in grades 5-12. As a both day and boarding school, Linsly is home to students from many countries, including China, Finland, Canada, North Korea, and Japan.
In celebration of Linsly's 200th academic year, a campaign is underway to raise $10,000,000 for an addition to Banes Hall, the main academic building, renovations to many other on-campus facilities, and to enrich Linsly's instructing capability. "Forward and No Retreat," is the school theme for the 2013-2014 school year, the same motto in which the school was founded under in 1814.

CATEGORIES: New South Wales ministries

The Cowper ministry (1856) or First Cowper ministry was the second ministry of the Colony of New South Wales, and was led by the Honourable Charles Cowper. It was the first of five occasions that Cowper was Leader of the Government. Cowper was elected in the first free elections for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly held in March 1856, and fought unsuccessfully with Stuart Donaldson to form Government. When Donaldson's Government faltered a little over two months after it was formed, Cowper formed Government.
The title of Premier was widely used to refer to the Leader of Government, but not enshrined in formal use until 1920.
There was no party system in New South Wales politics until 1887. Under the constitution, ministers were required to resign to recontest their seats in a by-election when appointed. These by-elections are only noted when the minister was defeated; in general, he was elected unopposed.
This ministry covers the period from 26 August 1856 until on 2 October 1856, when Cowper resigned his commission, having lost the confidence of the Assembly.[ref]

Brother of artist Axel Olson. Olson is represented, for example, at the National Museum and the Museum of Modern Art. Erik Olson is known as a Swedish surrealist. He devoted himself to dream-like, over realistic artwork.

After school he started to work as a company copiers. In the evenings he cultivated his main interest, drawing and painting, by studying at Halmstad Technical School. His father had hoped for the son to be an engineer, but Eric, as well as the two year older brother Axel Olson and cousin Waldemar Lorentzon, participated in 1919 in an amateur show in Halmstad secondary schools. In the summer of 1919, they met the established artist Gosta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN). This meeting influenced them strongly, taking impression from his painting and his art theories.
In 1924 Erik Olson went to Paris together with Waldemar Lorentzon. They became students of Fernand Léger'sSvenskt biografiskt lexikon, Volume 28, Part 1, 1992, P. 272 painting academy Academie Moderne and school spirit of cubism. Between December 1924 and March 1925 Eric Olson went to Italy for further studies. After his military service, he returned to Paris in 1927 and started working for Léger. In 1929 he marries painter Solvig Sven-Nilsson. The same year he is a co-founder of Halmstadgruppen. Late in the year 1930, he painted 'Handsken är kastad', (gloves are off), which is considered to be his first surrealist work.
Erik Olson lived during periods in France and Denmark. Starting in the 30s, his works participated at exhibitions in, for example, Copenhagen, London, Paris and New York. He mostly spent his summers at the coast of Halland where he participated in Söndrumskolonin during the 40s. In 1950 Erik Olson converted to the Catholicism and spent some of his later years to renew the religious art.

CATEGORIES: Jeux Sans Frontières, Living people

Denis Pettiaux (1956) is a Belgian acrobat and former referee of the EBU production Jeux Sans Frontières.
His first contact with Jeux Sans Frontières was in 1981 when he participates in an episode in the French town of Annecy. The Belgian team played Pettiaux on a tightrope walking game and also played their Joker on it, which gives extra points. Pettiaux performed very well on this game, and this helps the Belgian team to win that night. They also qualify for the final, but they have no success, as they finish rock bottom there. Also in 1988 he participated for a Belgian team and once again his team picks the win.
In 1990 Pettiaux became the international referee of Jeux Sans Frontières. First with Bernhard Galley, since 1992 on his own. He uses his talent for acrobatics in demonstrations for certain games. In 1996 he can demonstrate a game with a unicycle. His famous quote "Attention, prêts?" announced the start of a game, before he blows his whistle. He is the referee until the end in 1999, a total of 122 episodes long.
After the end of Jeux Sans Frontières Pettiaux returns to his original job as a teacher for people with disabilities.

Untermyer Park (also known as Untermyer Gardens, previously part of an estate known as Greystone) is a historic park of 43 acres, situated in Yonkers, Westchester County, New York, just north of New York City. Untermyer Park is on a hillside above the Hudson River and features a rock garden, a "Grecian garden" (actually a Persian Paradise garden), a small Grecian-style amphitheater, a classical pavilion, pergola, statuary, and a view of the river.
The Untermyer Gardens were developed during the first 40 years of the 20th century, when the area now enclosed by the park was part of an 150-acre site that was the estate of the lawyer and civic leader Samuel Untermyer.
Greystone had previously been owned by defeated Presidential candidate Samuel Tilden. Untermeyer purchased Greystone when Tilden died in 1899; when Untermyer himself died in 1940, his plan had been to donate the whole estate to the Nation, or the State of New York or at least to the City of Yonkers. Eventually the city of Yonkers agreed to accept part of the estate; this parcel of land, which was the core of the gardens, was renamed Untermyer Park in his honor.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.backyardgardener.com/ginsburg/column175.html |title=Untermyer park |accessdate=2007-01-11[/tpl] The Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

The former Yonkers Trolley Barn is located on Main Street in the in Yonkers, New York, United States. It is a massive steel frame brick building in the Renaissance Revival style built at the beginning of the 20th century. In 2002 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the last remaining trolley barn in Westchester County and the only remnant of Yonkers' trolley system.
After a half-century of use in the city's trolley network with its hub in Getty Square (downtown Yonkers), it was taken out of service. For another two decades it served as a city government office building. It was then vacant for almost 30 years, until a developer converted it into loft apartments, gutting the interior in the process.
After the partners in that effort were unable to complete the building due to the lawsuits they filed against each other, another developer bought it and finished the project. Today it is home to many tenants. A chase scene in the film Catch Me If You Can was filmed on the sidewalks around it.[tpl]cite web|title=Movie Location Itinerary|url=http://blog.westchestergov.com/tourism/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=324&Itemid=354|publisher=Westchester County|date=2012|accessdate=October 31, 2012[/tpl] In 2014, a local brewery announced that it would be moving into the Trolley Barn.[tpl]cite news|last=Garcia|first=Ernie|title=Yonkers Brewing hopes to tap Metro-North bar crawls|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/lohud-real-estate/2014/03/01/yonkers-brewing-hopes-to-tap-metro-north-bar-crawls/5908119/|newspaper=The Journal News|date=March 1, 2014|accessdate=April 9, 2014[/tpl]

It was the first outdoor game in the history of the AHL as well as the first outdoor minor league hockey game. Syracuse won the game 2–1 with the help of goaltender Kevin Lalande, who stopped 36 of the 37 Binghamton shots, and Alexandre Picard, who scored the first outdoor goal in AHL history. The game was played in front of a then AHL record crowd of 21,508, on a rink constructed at the New York State Fairgrounds on a dirt auto racing track.
Crunch owner, Howard Dolgon, pursued the ideal of having his team in an outdoor game, but unlike the National Hockey League's (NHL) Winter Classic the Crunch were responsible for funding the entire event. In order to afford the cost of hosting an outdoor game sponsorship deals with several independent organizations were made including Mirabito Energy Products, which lent its name to the title of the event. In part because of his success in putting on the event, Dolgon was awarded the James C. Hendy Memorial Award as the AHL's outstanding executive. Following the success of the Mirabito Outdoor Classic other AHL Outdoor Classics were held by other AHL teams.

The houses were home to a number of prominent industrialists in Yonkers at the time, since they enjoyed an excellent view over the Hudson River. They are built in Late Victorian and other turn of the 20th century revival architectural styles. One has one of the few remaining Eastlake interiors in the city.

[[Formalities in English law]]
CATEGORIES: English contract law, English trusts law

Formalities in English law are required in some kinds of transaction by English contract law and trusts law. In a limited number of cases, agreements and trusts will be unenforceable unless they meet a certain form prescribed by statute. The main kinds of formality that a statute can require are to put the transaction in writing, to make a deed, or to register it at a government registrar (such as HM Land Registry or Companies House).
While contracts and trusts can be generally created without formality, some transactions are thought to require form either because it makes a person think carefully before they bind themselves to an agreement, or merely that it serves as clear evidence.See L Fuller, ‘Consideration and Form’ (1941) 41 Columbia Law Review 799

[[Entry March of the Boyars]]
CATEGORIES: Compositions by Johan Halvorsen, 1893 compositions

Entry March of the Boyars ([tpl]lang-no|Bojarernes Indtogsmarsch[/tpl]) is an orchestral composition, published in 1893 from the pen of the Norwegian Johan Halvorsen (1864–1935). It is one of the most popular works of the composer, and quickly became an international success.
The piece has an occupational inspiration behind it. Halvorsen was offered a post at Bucharest Conservatory but he declined. He became however interested about the city and read about it and the entry of the Romania boyars into Bucharest in the 18th century. The scene almost "forced" him to compose music out of it. The music was first used as stage music at the Bergen theatre where he worked as the director of music. Two years later Halvorsen published an arrangement of the piece for symphony orchestra.
The melody has been used as a signature tune for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation's weekly radio program Ønskekonserten since its start in 1950.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |title=Ønskekonserten |encyclopedia=Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Ønskekonserten |language=Norwegian | accessdate=16 July 2011 [/tpl] It is used as incidental music in the play by August Strindberg, The Dance of Death in which Edgar asks Alice to play it for him on the piano.

[[Round Hill, Brighton]]

Round Hill (sometimes spelt Roundhill)[tpl]Harvnb|Various authors|2004|p=7.[/tpl] is an inner suburban area of Brighton,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/downloads/conservation/UrbanStdy_Round_Hill_final.pdf|title=Round Hill Neighbourhood|date=January 2009|work=Brighton and Hove Urban Characterisation Study|publisher=Brighton and Hove City Council|page=103|format=PDF|accessdate=2 August 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IZwvuwNs|archivedate=2 August 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl] part of the coastal city of Brighton and Hove in England. The area contains a mix of privately owned and privately rented terraced housing, much of which has been converted for multiple occupancy, and small-scale commercial development. It was developed mostly in the late 19th century on an area of high land overlooking central Brighton, and with good views in all directions, the area became a desirable middle-class suburb—particularly the large terraced houses of Roundhill Crescent and Richmond Road, and the exclusive Park Crescent—and within a few decades the whole of the hill had been built up with smaller terraces and some large villas.
Non-residential buildings include the landmark St Martin's Church, Brighton's largest place of worship,[tpl]Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=185.[/tpl] with its dramatically extravagant interior; the Brighton Forum, a Gothic Revival former college now in commercial use; Brighton's main fire station; and the oldest working cinema in Britain.  The first hospital in England catering for mental illness was established in a house in Roundhill Crescent in 1905.[tpl]Harvnb|Various authors|2004|p=63.[/tpl] Brighton's first Jewish cemetery, although a short distance outside Round Hill according to Brighton & Hove City Council's definition, has been associated with the suburb throughout its near 200-year history.[tpl]Harvnb|Various authors|2004|p=11.[/tpl] The London Road viaduct, a distinctive, sweeping piece of railway architecture, forms the northern boundary of the area and "a literal gateway" between outer and inner suburbia. All of these buildings have been listed by English Heritage for their architectural and historical importance, and the core of Round Hill, around Roundhill Crescent, is one of 34 conservation areas in the city.  Round Hill's steep slopes and road layout encouraged the introduction of another feature which gives the area its character: the "cat's-creep" staircase. The area has good tree cover, and increasingly heavy traffic along the three main roads which run through the area.
Past features of Round Hill include a windmill, which took advantage of the windy conditions on the [tpl]convert|223|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] hilltop until 1913; 19th-century laundries, which sought the same advantage; early 19th-century pleasure gardens, now occupied by the houses of Park Crescent; the landmark Cox's Pill Factory, demolished in the 1980s; glasshouses and smallholdings, some of which survived until after the Second World War despite being surrounded by houses; and the Kemp Town branch line, a passenger and freight railway which cut through the area and had a short-lived station serving Round Hill.  The former St Saviour's Church survived until 1983, and a Congregational church elsewhere in the suburb closed but retained its façade after its conversion into housing.

CATEGORIES: Elections in Seychelles, 2011 elections in Africa, 2011 in Seychelles

A presidential election was held in Seychelles from 19 May to 21 May 2011.http://africanelections.tripod.com/sc.html#2011_Presidential_Election
The election will be contested by at least four candidates:
The elections will be reviewed by independent observers from the Southern African Development Community, La Francophonie and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Local independent NGO groups have applied for accreditation as observers, given their understanding of the Creole language and their knowledge of districts and past polling concerns. The Electoral Commissioner has denied observer status to all local observer applicants. A "cooling-off" period is underway for three days before the election when no electioneeering, campaigning or wearing of campaign material or party colours is permitted by regulation. Electioneering material must be removed from all sites within 500 metres of all polling stations before the elections. The first day of the elections is 19 May 2011 commencing on the Outer Islands, then 20 May 2011 on the Inner Islands and 21 May the main island of Mahé.
The results continue a similar trend seen in previous presidential elections in Seychelles, with James Michel winning 55% of the votes. The results were announced late at night on Saturday 21 May 2011. The main opposition candidate Wavel Ramkalawan obtained 41%.

The Volunteer Pilots Association (VPA) is an American Public Benefit Flying (PBF) group founded in 1990. The Volunteer Pilots Association provides free non-emergency air transportation to and from medical appointments for patients with a financial need. Headquartered in southwestern Pennsylvania, the VPA is an all-volunteer non-profit organization. All member pilots fly privately owned planes and donate their time and flight expenses.
The VPA also transports donor organs and other time-critical medically related items and provides emergency/disaster relief as part emergency preparedness.
The VPA is one of only 70 volunteer pilot organizations in the nation—and the only one based in southwestern Pennsylvania—that fly medical assistance missions. The organization serves residents of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware and usually flies patients to and from health care centers that are up to 300 miles from their homes. For missions outside that radius, the VPA partners with other volunteer pilot organizations. Flights are made in general aviation aircraft, usually seating four to six people, including the crew.
By using general aviation aircraft the VPA is able to operate in areas that don't have airline service. The VPA can operate in rural areas and, unlike airlines, can land and take off on relatively short runways. In the US there are over 13 thousand public and private airports that can be used by general aviation aircraft, of which only a few hundred can be used by the airlines.
The VPA is a member of the Air Care Alliance.

United Russia won the elections with 49.32% of the vote, taking 238 seats or 52.88% of the Duma seats.
This result was down from 64.30% of the vote and 70% of the seats in the 2007 elections. 
The Communist Party of the Russian Federation received 19.19% of the vote and 92 seats, while A Just Russia received 13.24% and 64 seats, with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia getting 56 seats with 11.67% of the vote. Yabloko, Patriots of Russia and Right Cause did not cross the 7% election threshold. The list of parties represented in the parliament did not change.
United Russia lost the two-thirds constitutional majority it had held prior to the election, but it still won a majority of seats in the Duma, even though it had less than 50% of the popular vote. The Communist Party, Liberal Democratic Party and A Just Russia all gained new seats compared to the previous 2007 elections.
The election received various assessments from abroad: positive from the Commonwealth of Independent States observers, mixed from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and critical from some European Union representatives and the United States. Reports of election fraud and voter discontent with the current government have led to major protests particularly in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The government and United Russia were in their turn supported by rallies of the youth organizations Nashi and Young Guard. Later, the actions of anti-government protesters sparked the fear of a colour revolution in Russian society, and a number of the "anti-Orange" protests were set upАнтиоранжевый митинг проходит на Поклонной горе RIAN [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] (the name alludes to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the most widely known color revolution to Russians) including one on the Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow, the largest protest action of all the protests so far according to the police.Митинг на Поклонной горе Interfax [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]Померились цифрами vz.ru [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]Как митинг на Поклонной собрал около 140 000 человек politonline.ru [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]

The Nimoo Bazgo power project is a run-of-the-river power project on the Indus River situated at village Alchi, 70 kilometers from Leh in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The project was conceived on July 1, 2001 and approved on June 8, 2005, and construction began on June 9, 2005. The project involves construction of a 57-metre-high concrete dam with five spillway blocks of 13 m each having ogee profile. The Nimoo Bazgo power project envisages utilizing a rated net head of 34 m to generate 239.30 GWh (million units) in a 90% dependable year. The project has three surface power units of 15 MW each with an total installed capacity of 45 MW. Every unit has a 3.3 m dia, each 63 m long Penstocks. Each operating unit will be designed for a discharge of 48.7 cubic metres per second and also have transformer yard and switch yard. The project will be connected to the northern grid through a 220 kV transmission line from Leh to Srinagar (the line is scheduled for commissioning with project commissioning). The dam diverts water from the river by a 372 m long diversion channel and involves a flooding of only 3.42 km². Thus the power density is 45 MW per 3.42 km², i.e. 13.16 W/m². The project is being developed by M/s National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Ltd. BHEL is doing the ElectroMecahncial works with Mr. Bijaya Kumar Das as the Construction Manager under the able guidance of Sh.

[[Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide]]

CATEGORIES: Pheromones, Biochemistry

The pheromone biosynthesis activation neuropeptide (PBAN) is a neurohormone (member of the PBAN/pyrokinin neuropeptide family) that activates the biosynthesis of pheromones in moths. Moth females release PBAN into their hemolymph during the scotophase to stimulate the biosynthesis of the unique pheromone that will attract the conspecific males. PBAN release is drastically reduced after mating, contributing to the loss in female receptivity.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Rafaeli |first1=Ada |title=Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN): Regulatory role and mode of action |journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology |volume=162 |issue=1 |pages=69–78 |year=2009 |pmid=18495120 |doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2008.04.004[/tpl]

[[Sunnykids]]

CATEGORIES: Children's charities

SunnyKids is an Australian children's charitable organisation. Established in 1999 as a domestic and family violence service on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia, the service initially partnered with government and the community to build and purchase a series of properties in the region to accommodate women and children escaping domestic violence and family violence.
By 2003, SunnyKids was providing 7000 nights accommodation per year with 75% of this provided to children, many of whom represented the third and sometimes fourth generation of their family to live in refuge. Even though in Australia 75% of people living in refuges are children,Najidah 2006 government practice has been to fund the parent in the service, and to only view the child as "accompanying" the parent. The logic behind this is the idea that if the parent is helped the child automatically benefits, and therefore does not require a direct service.QLD Department of Communities Homelessness Funding Performance Measures
In 2003, SunnyKids observed that many people using crisis accommodation services, including SunnyKids' own services, did so in a somewhat cyclical manner. Young people requiring youth refuge accommodation often required crisis accommodation as adults, and children who entered services as an "accompanying" child with their parent frequently returned to such services again as adults, often with their own children now "accompanying" them. In an effort to break such cycles, the Board of SunnyKids determined to develop their practice into child-focussed interventions aiming to break intergenerational cycles of poverty and disadvantage.
Between 2003 and 2009, SunnyKids developed integrated support systems and child-focussed programs. During this time accommodation provision grew to 10,000 nights per yearSunnyKids Annual Report View annual report. At this time, the organisation also began to gain national profile as its services and programs won national recognition in multiple awards programs.
In 2009, the organisation received multiple requests to establish similar programs in communities across Australia so the SunnyKids partners program, and SunnyKids children's charity were established. Today SunnyKids is establishing:

An Industry Moves South, Readers Digest, March, 1956

The Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District is a national historic district located at Yonkers, Westchester County, New York. It includes 85 contributing buildings.  It encompasses 19 stylistically varied mill buildings and six rows of workers' housing. They were developed between 1871 and 1930 along the banks of the Saw Mill River.  The main mill building was originally built in 1871 and expanded between 1876 and 1883. It is a three story, rectangular building, 52 bays wide and five bays deep in the Second Empire style.  It features a four story tower and a five story tower.  The workers' housing, known as Moquette Row, North and South, was built between 1881 and 1886.  The carpet works were developed by Alexander Smith (1818-1878).  The company closed the Yonkers mills and relocated to Greenville, Mississippi in 1954.  It was later absorbed into Mohawk Carpet, later Mohasco Corporation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10827|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|date=April 1983|accessdate=2011-01-01 |author=Karen Morey Kennedy and Austin N.

Dr Samuel Henry Kellogg (1839–1899) was an American Presbyterian missionary in India who played the major role in revising and retranslating the Hindi Bible.Dictionary of Premillennial Theology p 228 Mal Couch - 1997 "Kellogg's final task in India was to head a triad of translators of the Old Testament into Hindi. "So highly did his colleagues regard his knowledge of the Bible and Indie philology that after his death they asked for no successor," His colleagues in the translation were William Hooper and Joseph Arthur Lambert.
Kellogg was also one of the leading advocates of the change in American Evangelical theology from postmillennialism to premillennialism between 1870 and 1910.Mal Couch Dictionary of Premillennial Theology 1997 Page 228 "KELLOGG, SAMUEL H. Samuel Kellogg (1839-1899) is indicative of those who helped turn the tide among evangelicals from postmillennialism to premillennialism between the Civil War and World War I. Kellogg was a Presbyterian scholar, ..."
Samuel Henry Kellogg is also remembered for his brilliant treatise on Hindi grammar called HINDI VYAKARAN. This book was published by Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag (Allahabad). That textbook on Hindi grammar is still considered a fine textbook. Especially, the way he explains Hindi genders to non-native speakers is brilliant.

[[Metal acetylacetonates]]
CATEGORIES: Chelating agents, Acetylacetonate complexes, Ligands

Metal acetylacetonates are coordination complexes derived from the acetylacetonate anion and metal ions, usually transition metals.  The ligand acetylacetonate is often abbreviated acac.  Typically both oxygen atoms bind to the metal to form a six-membered chelate ring. The simplest complexes have the formula M(acac)3 and M(acac)2.  Mixed-ligand complexes, e.g. VO(acac)2, are also numerous.  Variations of acetylacetonate have also been developed with myriad substituents in place of methyl.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Albrecht | first1 = M. | last2 = Schmid | first2 = S. | last3 = deGroot | first3 = M. | last4 = Weis | first4 = P. | last5 = Fröhlich | first5 = R. | year = 2003| title = Self-assembly of an Unpolar Enantiomerically Pure Helicate-type Metalla-cryptand | url = | journal = Chemical Communications | volume = 2003 | issue = | pages = 2526–2527 | doi = 10.1039/b309026d [/tpl] Many such complexes are soluble in organic solvents, in contrast to the related metal halides. Because of these properties, acac complexes are sometimes used as catalyst precursors and reagents. Applications include their use as NMR "shift reagents" and as catalysts for organic synthesis, and precursors to industrial hydroformylation catalysts. C5H7O2− in some cases also binds to metals through the central carbon atom; this bonding mode is more common for the third-row transition metals such as platinum(II) and iridium(III).

The summit can be scaled over a small and simple Klettersteig. From the summit area there are views of Hohe Salve, Bad Häring, the Lower Inn valley, the Wilder Kaiser, the Loferer Steinberge and Söll. The ridge is one of the less well-known mountains and hence less frequented by tourists. Occasional aircraft noise interrupts the quiet atmosphere because this region is well suited to gliders due to the good  thermals.
The mountain has quarries that extract marl and limestone and are used by the cement industry in Kirchbichl.

The 1949 Salad Bowl was a college football bowl game played between Drake Bulldogs and Arizona Wildcats at Montgomery Stadium in Phoenix, Arizona. The game marked the second bowl game for each school. Drake had previously played in the 1946 Raisin Bowl, while Arizona was featured in the 1921 San Diego E-W Christmas Classic. The game was sponsored by Phoenix Kiwanis Club.
The Wildcats out-gained Drake in total yards 355-206; however, the Bulldogs capitalized from three costly Arizona turnovers during the contest. Drake's Frank Metzger scored on a 1-yard run to give the Bulldogs an early 7-0 lead. The second quarter would see the Bulldogs go up 14-0 thanks to a Floyd Miller 20-yard interception return. An Ed Walgast 15-yard run would cut the lead to 14-7 at half. Late in the third quarter, Charlie Hall returned a punt 79-yards for a touchdown, but the ensuing extra point by one of the nation's top kickers Tackett hit the upright, preserving a 14-13 lead. Neither team would score in the four quarter. With time running out Arizona fumbled at the Drake 11-yard line on a potential game winning drive, allowing Drake to capture a 14-13 victory.http://www.arizonawildcats.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/ariz/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2009MiscellaneousInformationhttp://www.mmbolding.com/bowls/Salad_1949.htm

The Assyrian conquest of Aram (854-846 BC) was an invasion by the armies of Assyria led by King Shalmaneser III to conquer Syria, then named Aram. The war resulted in the formation of what became known as the Twelve Kings alliance against Assyria. It peaked with the 853 BC Battle of Qarqar which was indecisive but nonetheless resulted in Assyria withdrawing their forces due to them having suffered heavy casualties. Despite these losses the war continued until 846 BC, but ultimately this particular invasion was a failure. Eventually however King Shalmaneser III did conquer Syria and most of Palestine, and Syria was incorporated into the Assyrian Empire.http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/MESO/ASSYRIA.HTM

The pins are printed with the numbers from 1 to 12, and the triangular tiles have up to three dots in each of their corners. The object of the game is, for any arrangement of the pins, to choose the positions and orientations of the triangles so that the total number of dots on the five joining corners of each pin equals the number of the pin. The manufacturer asserts that there is a solution for each pin arrangement.  The puzzle is shipped in a solved state. The pins are not suitable for children under three, but this toy is otherwise suitable for all ages.

[[Nunley's Happyland]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct amusement parks in the United States

Nunley's (later called Smiley's) Happyland was an amusement park in the hamlet  of Bethpage on Long Island, New York, located at the intersection of Hempstead Turnpike (Route 24) and  Hicksville Road (Route 107).  It operated from 1951 through 1977 or 1978. Futrell, Jim, "Amusement Parks of New York," Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania, Stackpole Books, 2006
Happyland was established by William Nunley, a third-generation amusement park entrepreneur, who already operated facilities in  Baldwin,  Rockaway Beach, Yonkers, and  Broad Channel, N.Y. The new park would be larger than Nunley's other locations, and unlike its predecessors, was designed from the start for year-round operation, with a heated indoor ride area. Kirby, Irwin, "Indoor Kiddie park ends second successful season," The Billboard, November 28, 1953 Two walls of the pavilion were designed with large movable glass panels which could be opened in warm weather or closed when it was cold. (The glass doors used were salvaged from the French pavilion at the 1939-40  New York World's Fair.)"Nunley's Happyland, 250G Indoor Kid Spot, Opens Big," The Billboard, October 27, 1951
When Nunley announced plans for the new park, some colleagues in the amusement business questioned the wisdom of building an expensive facility at a site that seemed too far from population centers to be successful, calling the location "virtually deserted."  However, the postwar suburban construction boom soon proved such doubts unfounded, as the area around Happyland was rapidly developed for housing. The park proved popular with young families who moved into  surrounding communities such as Bethpage,  Levittown, Massapequa, and  Farmingdale, and attendance in the first years of operation surpassed expectations. In a further departure from tradition, Happyland was not located near a railroad or trolley line, but was set up to cater to the motoring public, with a parking lot that initially held 400 cars. Kirby, op cit.
William Nunley never got the chance to see Happyland in operation: he died in April 1951, six months before the park opened on October 12, 1951.  His wife Miriam took over management of Happyland and the other family properties and remained involved in their operation, with partner Norman Russell, for years to come. "Nunley's Happyland, 250G Indoor Kid Spot, Opens Big," loc. cit; Kirby, op cit.; Nunley, Miriam, "Little League Valuable As Publicity And Money-Winner," The Bllboard, April 28, 1956
Adjacent to the main Happyland building and connected to it by a glass-walled passageway was a fast food-style restaurant called the Jolly Roger (alternatively "Jolly Roger's"). This was built by Max Lander and owned by 2 partners (Robert Rubin and Bill Feldstein). Over time, confusion arose between the park and restaurant names, and it was (and remains) common to hear the entire facility referred to by Long Islanders  as  "Jolly Roger's Amusement Park." e.g. "Long Island High School Reunion Forum" http://www.activeboard.com/forum.spark?aBID=30470&p=3&topicID=28668800 
The Smiley's Happyland Park was owned by Mildred Tarnow (later by her husband John Tarnow after she died) and the Giddens family. John Tarnow ran the park as well as kept the carousel and other rides in good mechanical shape. The Jolly Roger restaurant (which had never been known as Nunley's) changed its name to "Robin Hood" in 1974. While the name of the restaurant changed, in the restaurant, everything else was the same. The restaurant (as Robin Hood)   closed in 1976, and the park followed in 1978. (Some sources say 1977.)

The Mason House is a historic residence in the unincorporated community of Coal Run in Washington County, Ohio, United States.  A saltbox built in 1802, it is among the most well-preserved buildings in Washington County constructed before Ohio's statehood in 1803.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places.  Vol. 2.  St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1395-1396.
The Mason House is a wooden clapboard structure built on a foundation of sandstone; it is covered with a slate roof, and its architecture includes elements made of brick and of other kinds of stone.Mason House, Ohio Historical Society, 2007.  Accessed 2011-01-02.  Its first owners (and likely its builders) were Daniel Davis and Joseph Thompson; a veteran of local Indian wars, Davis was a member of the garrison for Fort Frye in nearby Waterford.  The Mason House's first residents, like many other pioneers in southeastern Ohio, were natives of New England who had moved to what was then the western part of the United States.  Among the cultural elements that they brought with them was their architecture; the saltbox style of construction is more common in New England than in Ohio.
In 1979, the Mason House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it qualified for inclusion because of its well-preserved and historically significant architecture.  Seventeen years later, much of Coal Run was designated a historic district and added to the Register; the Mason House was named one of its eighty-nine contributing properties.National Register District Address Finder, Ohio Historical Society, 2011.

The barrage of the project is at Sarze village and the powerhouse is located on the right bank of the Suru near Chutak Village. The project construction began on  September 23, 2006, and the first three generators were commissioned in November 2012. The fourth was commissioned in January 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=NHPC declares COD for Unit 4 of its hydro electricity project in J&K|url=http://www.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=wclrdhtm&nvdt=20130130124428253&nvpc=099000000000&nvtype=TIDINGS&ver=pf|publisher=Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt.

The project includes construction of a [tpl]convert|47.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] barrage, having 15 m height above the crest level, an underground powerhouse, and 3.3 m dia and 10.02 km long head race tunnel and installation of four nos. of vertical Francis turbine of 11 MW each.
The project envisages utilizing a gross head of [tpl]convert|63.4|m|abbr=on[/tpl] to generate 216.41 GWh in a 90% dependable year with an installed capacity of 44 MW. Each 11 MW underground generating unit will operate under a rated head of 52 m and a rated discharge of 24.05 cubic metres per second.  The barrage diverts water from the river and involves a flooding of only [tpl]convert|0.135|km2|abbr=on[/tpl]. Thus the power density is 44 MW per 0.135 km2, i.e. very high 326 W/m2, compared to dam-based hydroelectric projects. The project will be connected to the Northern Grid by the 220 kV Leh-Srinagar transmission line, which is to be scheduled for commissioning along with project’s commissioning.[tpl]cite web|title=Chutak Hydroelectric Project|url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/filestorage/1/H/3/1H3VZ75BUA8C0SRTPG2OYKM9ELQIJ6/CDM_PDD_Chutak_HydroProject_v11_clean_2025.pdf?t=b1p8bW9nYWNyfDA_nTGvxr-Act8mP0jslzK2|publisher=UN Clean Development Mechanism|accessdate=15 June 2013|date=31 March 2009[/tpl]

[[Cyberstalking legislation]]
CATEGORIES: Cyber-bullying, Privacy law, Computer law

Cyberstalking and cyberbullying are relatively new phenomena, but that does not mean that crimes committed through the network are not punishable under legislation drafted for that purpose. Although there are often existing laws that prohibit stalking or harassment in a general sense, legislators sometimes believe that such laws are inadequate or do not go far enough, and thus bring forward new legislation to address this perceived shortcoming. In the United States, for example, nearly every state has laws that address cyberstalking, cyberbullying, or both.http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=13495

[[Bombing of Ludwigshafen and Oppau in World War II]]
CATEGORIES: Oil Campaign of World War II, World War II strategic bombing lists

The bombing of Ludwigshafen and Oppau in World War II attacked several strategic targets in the area, including targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II.  Ludwigshafen oil plants were managed by Dr. Wurster of the Ludwigshafen Military Government, and their chief function was to improve "gasoline quality by dehydrogenation" using the DHD process.  Ludwigshafen also refined "30-50 tons/day of crude oil...brought in from Brücksel, near Karlsruhe...to products including lube oils."  About 2.5 miles away from Ludwigshafen, an Oppau plant produced fertilizer and up to "800 T/day nitrogen as ammonia and a considerable part of this was exported as liquid ammonia to Hochst, Wolfen and Bittefeld."  A separate Oppau plant produced up to 60 T/day of urea.  Dr. Gogel was head of the "high pressure department" at Oppau.  After visiting the Ludwigshafen and Oppau factories from March 25–31 and 27–30 May, in August 1946, a post-war team published the Report On Investigations by Fuels and Lubricants Teams At The I.G. Farbenindustrie, A. G., Works, Ludwigshafen and Oppau.http://www.fischer-tropsch.org/Bureau_of_Mines/info_circ/ic_7375/ic_7375.htm

USS ''Tech III'' (SP-1055) was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from August to October 1917.
Tech III was built as a private motorboat of the same name in 1916 by Adolph Apel at Atlantic City, New Jersey. On 6 August 1917, the U.S. Navy leased her from her owner, the engineer and politician T. Coleman du Pont (1863–1930) of Wilmington, Delaware, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned on 7 August 1917 as USS Tech III (SP-1055).
Assigned to the 4th Naval District, Tech III served on patrol duties there.

Hockeyettan, formerly named Division 1 between 1975–2014, is the third-tier league of ice hockey in Sweden. From 1944 to 1975, Division I was the name of the highest league in the Swedish ice hockey system, but prior to the 1975–76 season, Division I was scrapped and replaced by the Elitserien (now known as the SHL), and Division 1 was created as the new second-tier league. Prior to the 1999–2000 season, Allsvenskan (now named HockeyAllsvenskan) was created as the new second-tier league, making Division 1 the third-tier league. The league was renamed "Hockeyettan" in April 2014. Today, the league consists of 47 teams divided geographically into four groups (Hockeyettan North, East, West, and South). The teams play half a season in the four groups, after which the highest ranked teams in each group form two new groups, organized more broadly into North and South (Allettan Norra and Allettan Södra). In the meantime, the teams which failed to make it out of their groups from the first half-season continue playing with the remaining teams in their group.
On 19 September 2012, the clubs in the league at that time formed an interest group called Hockeyettan, which aims to promote the league in Sweden, and is also responsible for running the Hockeyettan.com website.Hockeyettan.

The Building Societies Act 1986 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom governing building societies (mutually-owned mortgage-lending institutions). It removed certain restrictions on the range of services they could offer, so that they could compete with banks on a level basis: they could now make unsecured loans, offer cheque accounts, exchange currencies, provide stockbroking services, manage Personal Equity Plans (tax-privileged investment accounts) and portfolios of unit trusts, arrange and advise on insurance, etc. A new regulatory agency, the Building Societies Commission, was set up to supervise the activities of the societies, which were allowed to de-mutualise and become public limited companies subject to the agreement of their depositors.fairinvestment.co.uk – Building Societies Act 1986
This Act and the Big Bang stockmarket reform, also in the UK, also in 1986, were the two central planks of the move to financial deregulation in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The Financial Services Act 1986 was also part of that movement.

[[Pepper No. 30]]
CATEGORIES: 1930 works, Black-and-white photographs

Pepper No. 30 is one of the best-known photographs taken by Edward Weston.  It depicts a solitary green pepper in rich black-and-white tones, with strong illumination from above.
In the late 1920s Weston began taking a series of close-up images of different objects that he called "still lifes".  For several years he experimented with a variety of images of shells, vegetables and fruits, and in 1927 he made his first photograph of a pepper.[tpl]cite book|first=Amy |last=Conger|title= Edward Weston: Photographs from the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Tucson: Center for Creative Photography |year=1992| pages=Fig. 562[/tpl] He received mixed feedback about that image,[tpl]cite book|first=Edward |last=Weston|editor=Nancy Newhall |title= The Daybooks of Edward Weston, Volume II|publisher=NY: Horizon Press |year=1961| pages=42[/tpl] but two years later he started a new series that focused on peppers alone. He recorded twenty-six negatives of peppers taken during 1929, mostly taken against plain burlap or muslin backdrops.
A year later, during a four-day period from August 2–6, 1930, Weston took at least thirty more negatives of peppers.Conger, Fig. 606 He first tried again with plain muslin or a piece of white cardboard as the backdrop, but for these images he thought the contrast between the backdrop and the pepper was too stark. On August 3 he found a large tin funnel, and, placing it on its side, he set a pepper just inside the large open end. He wrote:
 
 It was a bright idea, a perfect relief for the pepper and adding reflecting light to important contours. I still had the pepper which caused me a week's work, I had decided I could go no further with it, yet something kept me from taking it to the kitchen, the end of all good peppers. I placed it in the funnel, focused with the Zeiss, and knowing just the viewpoint, recognizing a perfect light, made an exposure of six minutes, with but a few moments' preliminary work, the real preliminary was on in hours passed. I have a great negative, ‒ by far the best!
It is a classic, completely satisfying, ‒ a pepper ‒ but more than a pepper; abstract, in that it is completely outside subject matter. It has no psychological attributes, no human emotions are aroused: this new pepper takes one beyond the world we know in the conscious mind.
To be sure, much of my work has this quality...but this one, and in fact all of the new ones, take one into an inner reality, ‒ the absolute, ‒ with a clear understanding, a mystic revealment. This is the "significant presentation" that I mean, the presentation through one's intuitive self, seeing "through one's eyes, not with them": the visionary." Daybooks ,II, 180

By placing the pepper in the opening of the funnel, Weston was able to light it in a way that portrays the pepper in three dimensions, rather than as a flat image. It is this light that gives the image much of its extraordinary quality.
Photo historian Amy Conger, in her extensive catalog of Weston's prints at the Center for Creative Photography, said Weston made at least twenty-five prints of this image, making it his most popular pepper. She wrote, "There are many reasons for this, the long, smooth, barely turned surfaces; the glow of the light reflecting unpredictably on the firm skin; the gentle "S" curves ‒ all factors enhanced by the almost exaggerated contrasts between light and dark, concave and convex, abstract and tactile; the firm waxed surfaces toughing the scratched tin. Even the rotten spot on the lower right of the back of the pepper does not detract from the sensuous and sensual intensity.  Instead the spot grounds the subject, heightening the tension between the subject and form as well as ideal and real."Conger, Fig. 606
Years later, Weston wrote about the lasting impact of his pepper images:
 
 I have done perhaps fifty negatives of peppers: because of the endless variety in form manifestations, because of their extraordinary surface texture, because of the power, the force suggested in their amazing convolutions. A box of peppers at the corner grocery hold implications to stir me emotionally more than almost any other edible form, for they run the gamut of natural forms, in experimental surprises.Daybooks ,II, 225

At the same time he expressed a some very candid frustration with those who described his peppers in sexual tones:
 
 The peppers which are libeled more than anything I have done, ‒ in them has been found vulvas, penises or combinations, sexual intercourse, Madonna with child, wrestlers, modern sculpture, African carving, ad nauseam, according to the state of mind of the spectator: and I have a  lot of fun sizing up people from their findings!
Now call the above explanation my defense mechanism become active sic, I say that it is disgust and weariness over having my work labeled and pigeonholed by those who bring to it their own obviously abnormal, frustrated condition: the sexually unemployed belching gaseous irrelevancies from an undigested Freudian ferment.Daybooks ,II, 225

On the back of a print of one of his peppers that he gave to a friend, Weston wrote, "As you like it ‒ but this is just a pepper ‒ nothing else ‒to the impure all things ‒ are impure."Conger, Fig. 562
Weston made this photograph using his Ansco 8×10 Commercial View camera with a Zeiss 21 cm. lens. The smallest aperture on this lens is f/36.
All prints of Pepper No. 30 are silver gelatin contact prints, approximately 9[tpl]fraction|1|2[/tpl]" × 7[tpl]fraction|1|2[/tpl]" (24.1 × 19.2 cm) ‒ the exact size of the 8" × 10" film he used. Some slight variations in size exist due to paper shrinkage over time. Most of the original prints made by Weston are now is museums, including the Center for Creative Photography, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Minneapolis Institute of Art and the George Eastman House.
After his death, his son Cole Weston made multiple prints of this image according to his father's specifications; all of these prints are clearly labeled as "Printed by Cole Weston."

[[Lincolnshire bagpipes]]

CATEGORIES: Bagpipes, English musical instruments, Culture in Lincolnshire

It is unclear whether Lincolnshire bagpipes refer to a specific type of pipes native to Lincolnshire, England, or to the popularity of a more general form of pipes in the region. Written records of bagpipes being associated with Lincolnshire date back to 1407,Bishop John Bales: Parker Society, XXXVI, p102 but it is difficult to find certain proof that any regional variation of the bagpipe existed which was peculiar to Lincolnshire.  Despite the lack of evidence for a uniquely local instrument, it is clear that the bagpipe was enjoyed by the people of Lincolnshire.Thomas Fuller, D.D. The history of the worthies of England, Volume 2 (Edited by his son John and published in 1662, after Thomas Fuller's death). Vol. 2, Pg. 267

By 1881, later researchers had identified that the 19th century farmer, John Hunsley, had played the bagpipes "up to a short time before his death, which took place twenty or thirty years ago (i.e. between 1851 and 1861)."Lincolnshire Notes and Queries http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=aH8uTZXrK4Sq8AbR-52KCQ&ct=result&id=YZKE_wpQImUC&dq=%22john+hunsley%22+lincolnshire&pg=PA95&sig=ACfU3U3P52Y-pkasehsYjsiiEuUBKRw35Q&q=%22john+hunsley%22+lincolnshire 1881 John Hunsley lived in Manton, near Kirton-in-Lindsey.  In 1984 John Addison, a pipemaker in South Somercotes began his research to try to establish whether a uniquely local "Lincolnshire bagpipe" existed,John Addison: The Lincolnshire Bagpipe in A Prospect of Lincolnshire, by Naomi Field and Andrew White (Published by Field & White, 1984), pp 127 - 129.

[[Tessera (Venusian geography)]]
CATEGORIES: Surface features of Venus

Tessera is a "complex ridged" surface feature seen on Venusian plateau highlands (and maybe on Neptune's moon Triton). Tessera is thought to be caused by crustal folding, buckling, and breaking. The presence of tessera on Venus suggests that the Venusian surface may be subject to piecewise lateral motions.[tpl]cite journal|last=Basilevsky|first=A.|coauthors=J.

The 2012 United States Senate election in Tennessee took place on November 6, 2012, as part of the general election including the 2012 U.S. presidential election, elections to the House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Bob Corker won a second term. Corker easily won the Republican primary with 85% of the vote. He faced Democratic Party nominee Mark E.

[[Inka (beverage)]]

CATEGORIES: Coffee substitutes, Barley-based beverages, Polish beverages, Polish brands

Inka is a Polish roasted grain beverage. Developed in the late 1960s during the communist era, Inka has been produced in Skawina since 1971, a centre of coffee production since the early 20th century. Currently it is manufactured by GRANA Sp. Z O.O. While it was used in part as a coffee substitute to alleviate coffee shortages in the 1970s, Inka remains popular, in part to the fact that it is caffeine-free. It is exported to Canada and the United States as Naturalis Inka in packaging reminiscent of that used in Poland in the early 1990s.
Inka is a roasted mixture of rye, barley, chicory, and sugar beet. Cereals make up 72% of the content and in the classic version there are no artificial ingredients or other additives. Additional varieties include supplements or flavouring.http://www.grana.pl/en/our_brands/
The unique flavour of this beverage makes it an ideal substitute for those who enjoy coffee yet want to stay away from caffeine. The drink is safe for consumption by children, pregnant and breast-feeding mothers.
Inka is sold in the following varieties:

Robert George Irwin (1908–1975), an artist-sculptor and recurring mental hospital patient, pled guilty to killing three persons on Easter weekend in 1937 in the Beekman Hill area of New York City’s Turtle Bay neighborhood.
One of his victims, Veronica “Ronnie” Gedeon, was a model who often appeared in seductive pulp magazine pictures. The crime, its investigation, Irwin’s arrest, and the resulting court proceedings were heavily publicized, often with eye-catching photos of Miss Gedeon and headlines describing Irwin as the “mad sculptor.”“‘Mad Sculptor’ Awaits Trial for his Triple Murder Easter Morn,” Cumberland (MD) Times, 1938-10-16 at p. 3. Veronica Gedeon left behind a portfolio of sexy photos that, in retrospect, had no relevance to the crime, its cause or Irwin’s responsibility for it.  However, that coincidence kept the story on front pages of newspapers around the country for months, publicity which ultimately helped to bring Irwin into custody.
Irwin’s prosecution, which ended through a plea-bargain that kept him incarcerated for life, renewed debate about the use and scope of New York’s version of the insanity defense.Curtis Gathje, “A Model Crime: A True Fiction” (Donald I. Fine: 1995) ISBN 1-55611-428-1.“Irwin May Be Termed ‘Insanity Faker’ by Lunacy Commission,” Lowell Sun, 1938-03-24 at p. 1.Editorial, “Upsetting an Insanity Plea,” Syracuse Herald, 1938-03-26 at p. 2.  Once sentenced, Irwin was deemed “definitely insane” by state psychiatrists.“Doctors Declare Irwin ‘Definitely Insane,’” The Daily Messenger, Canandaigua (NY), 1938-12-10 at p. 1. He spent the rest of his life in secure mental institutions.  A new book about Robert Irwin, Harold Schechter's The Mad Sculptor (2014),  has been well-received.  Wall St. J., March 22, 2014, p. C8.

[[Rosh Pinah Primary School]]
CATEGORIES: Primary schools in Barnet, Jewish schools in England, Voluntary aided schools in London

Rosh Pinah Primary School is a school in Edgware, in London, England.
On 1 December 2002, the founder, the Reverend Amias, died at the age of 95. He wrote this in 1996 for the 40th anniversary celebrations at the school, which describes how the school came into being.
"It was in the late 1920s that four members of the then very small number of Jewish residents in Edgware, organise some Jewish communal life, starting with Hebrew classes for their children. They placed an advertisement in the Jewish Chronicle for 'a Hebrew Teacher'.
From the four applicants I was chosen. My brief was to organise and to teach a class and to seek out and get the interest of local Jewish residents to join the newly formed Hebrew Congregation. I began Hebrew classes on Sunday mornings in a hired room in Broadfields Avenue with five pupils, three from the same family.
During the war I served as an army chaplain in both the UK and Europe. I returned to Edgware upon my release ... My great ambition always was to start a Jewish school, and in 1948 with the active support of the Zionist Federation Educational Trust, I started a Jewish nursery with a handful of pupils with my late sister, Helen, as the first Headmistress. My suggestion of the name "Rosh Pinah" was accepted by the ZFET. From little acorns great oak trees grow - and so this nursery grew, first under Helen and then Rochelle Israel who only very recently retired. I came to believe it necessary for these children to progress in a similar Jewish atmosphere. 
In 1956 we opened the Rosh Pinah Primary School; we had one pupil and three qualified teachers, one for secular studies, one for Jewish studies and myself! This was all happening in the Mowbray Road building. I recall with great pleasure that first pupil of the school, growing up as children do, to become my first Rosh Pinah bride, and I am happy now to see her son attending Shul quite regularly!
As the founder of my beloved Rosh Pinah I was appointed Hon. Principal, a position I hold to this day and one of which I am extremely proud. For many years I was a member of the Education Committee of the London Borough of Barnet.
The late Mr Chaim Beckman was appointed Headmaster in 1961 and led the school until his retirement in 1982. He was succeeded by Mr Mervyn Leviton.
Our new purpose-built school came into being in 1986 and has a sound-proof music room, resource areas for handicrafts, an audio-visual room used for teaching Hebrew and a gym/hall. There is a chess club as well as football and netball teams, a school choir and Israeli dance club. Jewish feasts and festivals are celebrated in the appropriate manner."

[[Capes, Cowls & Villains Foul]]
CATEGORIES: Role-playing games

Capes, Cowls and Villains Foul is a pen & paper roleplaying game about comic book style superheroes and their adventures, developed and published by Parsons, Kansas-based Spectrum Games. It officially debuted in the form of an illustrated 13-page PDF document released for free, called the Quickstart Preview in 2010. A full rulebook was released in 2012. It was written by Barak Blackburn, and uses a significantly modified version of a rules system that was first introduced in Cartoon Action Hour: Season 2 in late 2008.
Capes, Cowls and Villains Foul, abbreviated as CC&VF or CCVF, adapts the narrative and open-ended trait system of Cartoon Action Hour: Season 2 to the genre of superhero comics, and aims to make each roleplaying game session feel as much as possible like writing and editing a comicbook. Conceptually, it operates on the edge of the narrative school of game design, aiming to make characters and their abilities as flexible as possible while still maintaining its own system and dice roll mechanics. It is arguably among the most versatile superhero games that do not completely forgo the elements of dice, tables, or numbers. Tim Kirk's Hearts & Souls and Chad Underkoffler's Truth & Justice, both written for the same genre, share similar goals and design features, but are unrelated publications that came out about five years before CC&VF.
While Cartoon Action Hour and CC&VF are closely related systems, both are de facto independent rules frameworks, and the texts in either are written from scratch to reflect the chosen genre, and the “parent medium” emulated (animated cartoon shows for CAH, printed comicbooks for CC&VF). For CC&VF, the popular references to cartoon series, action figures and pop culture of the 1980s were cut in favor of terms and references taken only from the printed comic book medium.
Unlike other games by Spectrum Games, CC&VF does not use a default time period, location, or style of superhero stories, but the majority of its illustrations and a few hints and allusions in the flavor text suggest a tribute to superhero comics of the early to late Silver Age, and maybe the Bronze Age.

[[Wine Location Specialist]]

CATEGORIES: Wine terms

In a collaboration between the CIVC (Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne) and the IVDP (Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e Porto) through the Center for Wine Origins, the Wine Location Specialist or WLS program was initiated in July 2010. Approved sommeliers and beverage directors apply to take the test after extensive self-guided study of two of the world’s most famous wines, Champagne and Port, and the regions in which they are produced.
The book provided to pre-approved participants was written by Master of Wine, Sandy Block. Exam takers must make a minimum of 80% on the multiple choice test as well as meet minimum requirements on the essay portion of this demanding test. Only 19 wine professionals in the United States have been awarded the Wine Location Specialist Certificate with the first class. The January 2011 class of 25 wine professionals represent all facets of the wine industry. http://www.wineorigins.com/?p=1216.
This certification means that those who carry the WLS designation after their name are accredited by the CIVC and the IVDP to lead wine education seminars, wine-tastings and dinners specific to the Champagne and Port regions.

John Mackenzie, Lord MacLeod (1727 - 2 April 1789) born Castle Leod near Strathpeffer, Scotland eldest son of George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie and Isabel Gordon. He was an initiated Freemason due to his father being the Grand Master, Grand Lodge of Scotland 1737-38. He married Hon. Margery Forbes, daughter of James Forbes, 16th Lord Forbes. 
John Mackenzie, Lord MacLeod was styled as Lord MacLeod in 1731. Sailing to join the rebel army on board the sloop "Hound", he fought with his father's clan at the Battle of Falkirk leading the Cromartie's Regiment of about 500 clansmen in the Uprising of 1745 during which he was taken prisoner, with his father and 218 others, on 15 April 1746 at Dunrobin Castle, by a party of the William Sutherland, 17th Earl of Sutherland’s militia the day before the Battle of Culloden, and noted as the last siege fought on the mainland of Great Britain. On 20 December 1746 he was not brought to trial before the Commissioners, though he pleaded guilty to high treason, but received full pardon on 26 January 1748 on condition "that within six months of his 21st birthday he would convey to the Crown all his rights in the Earldom" which was not restored until the reign of Queen Victoria.
He would later author The Memorials of John Murray of Broughton: sometime secretary to Prince Charles. Narrative by John Mackenzie, Lord Macleod eldest son of the Earl of Cromartie., the only other person not to stand trial for treason and pardoned.
Leaving Scotland he initially lived in Berlin with Field Marshal Keith, who assisted him in obtaining a commission in the Swedish Army in 1750. Receiving financial assistance to equip himself for service from the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, on the recommendation of Lord George Murray, he entered service in Swedish Pomerania as a mercenary. Described by Lord George as "a young man of real merit," he was expected to gain promotion in the service of the Swedish King. This expectation was realized during his service to the Crown of Sweden for twenty-seven years with distinction, obtaining the rank of Lieutenant-General, and subsequently being decorated with the award of Commander, Order of the Sword of Sweden. During the Seven Years’ War he joined the Prussian Army as a volunteer, serving through the second campaign of 1757. Created a Count of Sweden he returned to Scotland in 1771 and was the first Colonel of the 73rd Foot (MacLeod's Highlanders, 71st Foot) from 1772, and then 1st Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry in 1777. On 9 December 1778 his Swedish title was recognised by King George III. From 1779 he served with his regiment in the East Indies Campaign against Hyder Ali, joining the army under Major-General Sir Hector Munro assembled at St. Thomas Mount, Madras, in July 1780. Although he wasn't with the battalion at the time, it was completely destroyed during the Battle of Conjeveram on 10 September 1780. Following disagreement with Major-General Munro on the loss of the battle, John Mackenzie returned to Scotland, but remained the regiment's Colonel until his death. He was promoted to Major-General in 1784.
Returning to Scotland John Mackenzie settled in Ross-shire where he entered politics holding the office of Member of Parliament (Tory) between 1780 and 1784. Promoted to the rank of Major-General in 1782, he regained his family estates in 1784, restored to him by Act of Parliament, for a payment of £19,010 for debts on the estates. He spent the rest of his life on the estate which he greatly improved, planting thousands of trees, and building a new mansion at Tarbat. 
John Mackenzie died at Edinburgh on 2 April 1789 following a year of illness, without descendants and was buried at the Canongate Kirkyard, Edinburgh. The estates passed to his cousin, Kenneth Mackenzie.

Little Theatre in the Adelphi was a theatre in London, on what is now John Adam Street just west of the Royal Society of Arts. It should not be confused with either the Haymarket Theatre (also known as the Little Theatre) or the Adelphi Theatre both of which are in the West End. The theatre was constructed in 1910 from a banking hall previously used by Messrs Coutts, part of the original Adam Brothers Adelphi development between the Strand and the River Thames.  
The first lessee of the Little Theatre was the actor-manager Gertrude Kingston, who had it built largely to her specification, making it the first British theatre to adopt certain lighting techniques, including ‘dimmer’ lights, which had been invented in the United States.[Kate Steedman, ‘Kingston, Gertrude (1862–1937)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57056 accessed 21 April 2011 The theatre was twice bombed, once in 1917, being reconstructed on its original lines in 1920, and again in 1941.

[[Tumtum (Judaism)]]
CATEGORIES: Gender and Judaism, Talmud concepts and terminology

Tumtum (טומטום in Hebrew, meaning "hidden") is a term that appears in Jewish Rabbinic literature and usually refers to a person whose sex is unknown, because their genitalia are covered or "hidden."  Although they are often grouped together, the Tumtum has some halachic ramifications distinct from those of the Androgynos (אנדרוגינוס), who has both male and female genitalia (see Talmud Bavli, Tractate Hagigah, 4a).
It is not clear what the actual anatomy of a Tumtum is; however, it would seem that according to medieval commentator Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (more commonly known as Rash"i), a Tumtum may have exposed testicles and an unexposed penis (ibid.).
The Mishnah (Zavim, 2, 1) says that Tumtum and Androgynos have both men's and women's Chumras, meaning that where the law is stricter towards men than women, they are treated as men, but where the law is stricter towards women, they are treated as women.
Tumtum is not defined as a separate gender, but rather a state of doubt. A Tumtum must be either male or female, but since we do not know which one, the strictest gender-dependent obligations or prohibitions are taken on. To this end, Positive commandments from which women are exempted are considered binding on a Tumtum.Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Mada, Avoda Zara, 12, 4.
Nathan ben Jehiel says on his book Aruk (on ערך טם) that the word Tumtum came from the word Atum which means blocked or covered.

The Brooks Bridge is a four-lane steel and concrete structure that carries highway U.S. Route 98 over Santa Rosa Sound (mile 223 of the Gulf Coast Intracoastal Waterway) just west of the Choctawhatchee Bay between downtown Fort Walton Beach, Florida and the three-mile section of Okaloosa Island controlled by the city of Fort Walton Beach. It is named for John T. Brooks, a long-time local developer and city figure. It has a charted clearance of 50 feet above the water."Waterway Guide 1970 / Southern Edition", Sidney J. Wain, Inc., Chesapeake, Virginia, Volume 23, Number 2, page 259.
Constructed in 1965–1966, it replaced a 1935-vintage low-level steel through-truss center-pier swing-span structure immediately west of the current bridge which had become increasingly unreliable with age, the center-pivoting span having been known to get stuck in the open position while allowing for transit of maritime traffic. Removal of the steel work and the old concrete pivot pier began in March 1966 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as the new Brooks Bridge reached completion with removal taking about three weeks.Fort Walton Beach Florida, "Old Bridge Is Removed At Brooks", Playground Daily News, Tuesday 15 March 1966, Volume 20, Number 27, page 3.
As the only local crossing of the Santa Rosa Sound, it is subject to traffic congestion. Vehicular speed limits on the span are 35 miles per hour eastbound and 25 miles per hour westbound.  An additional bridge between Fort Walton Beach and Okaloosa Island has been discussed for many years, but as of 2011, no firm plans have ever emerged.

[[Structure of liquids and glasses]]

CATEGORIES: Condensed matter physics, Glass, Liquids

The structure of liquids, glasses and other amorphous solids is characterized by the absence of long-range order which defines crystalline materials. Liquids and amorphous solids do, however, possess a rich and varied array of short to medium range order, which originates from chemical bonding and related interactions. Metallic glasses, for example, are typically well described by the dense random packing of hard spheres, whereas covalent systems, such as silicate glasses, have sparsely packed, strongly bound, tetrahedral network structures. These very different structures result in materials with very different physical properties and applications.
The study of liquid and glass structure aims to gain insight into their behavior and physical properties, so that they can be understood, predicted and tailored for specific applications. Since the structure and resulting behavior of liquids and glasses is a complex many body problem, historically it has been too computationally intensive to solve using quantum mechanics directly. Instead, a variety of diffraction, NMR, Molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulation techniques are most commonly used.

[[Smoking in South Korea]]
CATEGORIES: Smoking by country, Drugs in South Korea, Health in South Korea, South Korean society

Smoking in South Korea is similar to other developed countries in the OECD, with a daily smoking rate of 22.90% in 2012 compared to the OECD average of 21.13%. However, male smoking is among the highest at 40.80% while female smoking among the lowest at 5.20%.http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/12/02/01/index.html?itemId=/content/chapter/factbook-2013-98-en
South Korea enforced strict smoking bans in public places from July 2013, with fines of 100,000 won on any spotted smoker and up to 5 million won on shop owners not following the law. From December 2012, smoking has been completely banned in bars and restaurants larger than 150 square meters (extended to 100 square meters from 2014), cafes, internet cafes, government buildings, kindergartens, schools, universities, hospitals, youth facilities, libraries, children's playgrounds, private academies, subway or train stations and their platforms and underground pathways, large buildings, theaters, department stores or shopping malls, large hotels and highway rest areas. More places now offer smoking areas separated by glass walls. 
The law has extended to bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters since January 2014. South Korea will completely ban smoking on all bars, restaurants and cafes regardless of size from January 2015. Cafes which are currently permitted to have smoking rooms must remove any smoking rooms by this date.

CATEGORIES: 1911 establishments in Ohio, American art, American artist groups and collectives, Cleveland School, Organizations based in Cleveland, Ohio, Art organization stubs, Organizations established in 1911

The Kokoon Arts Club, sometimes spelled Kokoon Arts Klub, was a Bohemian artists group founded in 1911 by Carl Moellman, William Sommer and Elmer Brubeck to promote Modernism in Cleveland, Ohio. Moellman had been a member of New York City's Kit Kat Club, which served as inspiration for Kokoon. From 1913 to 1946 Kokoon's annual Bal-Masque balls scandalized Cleveland with risqué activities, provocative art, and nudity, and was sometimes wagishly referred to as the "Cocaine Club". A fierce rivalry stood between Kokoon and the more conservative Cleveland Society of Artists.

Finlaycolor was an early color photography process.
In Uncle Tungsten,[tpl]cite book|title=Uncle Tungsten|author=Oliver Sacks|year=2001|isbn=0-375-40448-1[/tpl] Oliver Sacks reminisces:[tpl]cquote|The most exciting way of getting instant color was by a process called Finlaycolor, in which, in effect, three color-separation negatives were taken simultaneously by using a grid ruled with microscopic red, green and violet lines. One then made a positive, a lantern slide from this negative, and brought it into exact alignment with the grid. This was tricky, delicate, but when one had them in perfect register, the previously black-and-white slide would burst into full color. Since the screen, with its microscopic lines, simply appeared grey, one saw, when it was juxtaposed with the slide, the most magical, unexpected creation of color, where seemingly there had been none before. (The National Geographic originally used Finlaycolor, and one could see the fine lines on these if one looked with a magnifying glass.[/tpl])

The 2012 United States Senate election in California took place on November 6, 2012, concurrently with the 2012 U.S. presidential election as well as other elections to the United States Senate and House of Representatives and various state and local elections.
The primary election on June 5 took place under California's new blanket primary law, where all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party. In the primary, voters voted for any candidate listed, or write-in any other candidate. The top two finishers — regardless of party — advanced to the general election in November, even if a candidate managed to receive a majority of the votes cast in the June primary. In the primary, less than 15% of the total 2010 census population voted. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein announced her intention to run for a fourth full term in April 2011[tpl]cite news|first=Carla|last=Marinucci|title=US Sen.

The second-place finisher was Republican candidate and autism activist Elizabeth Emken, who won 12.7% of the vote.
Feinstein and Emken contested the general election on November 6, with Feinstein winning re-election in a landslide, by 62.5% to 37.5%. Feinstein's 7.75 million votes set the all-time record for the most votes cast for one candidate in one state in one election, beating Senator Barbara Boxer's 6.96 million votes in 2004.

The first book revolves around Billy, a young skeleton boy who lives in a secrets-closet with his parents, Lars and Decette Bones. It is the job of these secrets keepers to archive the Biglum family’s lies, fibs, and secrets. Not an easy task, as each family whopper is more despicable than the last. Struggling against unearthly creatures and an unfriendly Afterlife government, Billy and an orphaned girl named Millicent must sort out a number of mysteries—the biggest being their own. Billy discovers that not all Biglums are horrible, because he happens to be one himself and Millicent is his real life niece. The two supernatural sleuths also discover that Mr. and Mrs. Bones have some dark secrets of their own. The two kindly skeletons broke Afterlife rules by adopting Billy. Billy’s skeleton uncle, the Grim Reaper, tries to straighten things out but only makes matters worse by un-murdering the boy, thereby breaking even more of the many Afterlife rules. In an explosive conclusion, Billy and Millicent save the day by exposing the Biglum secrets to the Light of Truth, and then capture a particularly nasty Afterlife official, who wrongfully imprisoned Billy’s skeleton parents.

The fourteenth legislative assembly election was held on 13 April 2011 to elect members from 234 constituencies in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Results were released on 13 May 2011. Two major parties Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) faced the election as coalitions of multiple political parties: DMK front consisted of 8 parties and the AIADMK of 11 parties. Vijayakanth's Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), which had contested the previous elections independently, allied with AIADMK coalition. Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam boycotted the election following disagreement with Jayalalithaa over seat-sharing. Tamil film actor Vijay was openly involved in Tamil Nadu politics for the first time by extending his support for ADMK.
The outgoing Karunanidhi government was noted for the construction of new assembly building in Chennai, execution of various developmental projects and implementation of new entitlement programs including free health care for the poor and issuance of a range of freebies such as colour television to all. However, these numerous achievements were overshadowed by other major issues such as increasing prices of essential items, 2G spectrum scam and undue influence of Karunanidhi's extended family in various aspects of Tamil politics and business.
The election commission enforced stringent measures to curb the widespread abuse of power to bribe voters that was common in previous elections; it also imposed strict campaign descipline by imposing the 10 PM curfew. The commission headed by the chief election officer Praveen Kumar was commended for conducting the election in a strict and fair manner. The election recorded the highest polling ever in the state - 77.8% of the total electorate voted in the election surpassing 76.57% polled in 1967 election.
AIADMK front won the election winning in 203 constituencies; the AIADMK party alone secured a simple majority by carrying 150 seats and became eligible to form the government without requiring the support of its coalition partners. DMDK won 29 seats, more than the 23 seats won by DMK and opted to serve as the official opposition party. Political analysts concluded that the election was a referendum on the outgoing DMK government and the powerful anti-incumbency sentiment helped the ADMK colaition. J. Jayalalithaa along with 33 ministers was sworn-in as the Chief minister of Tamil Nadu for the third time on 16 May 2011 by governor Surjit Singh Barnala.

[[Cyclam]]

CATEGORIES: Nitrogen heterocycles, Macrocycles

Cyclam (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) is an organic compound with the formula (NHCH2CH2NHCH2CH2CH2)2. It is a white solid that is soluble in water.  The compound is notable as  macrocyclic ligand, which binds strongly to many transition metal cations. The compound was first prepared by the reaction of 1,3-dibromopropane and ethylenediamine.J. van Alphen "On Aliphatic Polyamines IV" Rec. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas 1937, volume 56, 343–350.
The compound features four secondary amines.  Its complexes therefore can exist as several diastereomers, depending on the relative orientation of the N-H centres.   Its complexes feature alternating five- and six-membered chelate rings.  The closely related ligand cyclen ((CH2CH2NH)4) forms only five-membered C2N2M chelate rings and tends not to form square-planar complexes.

The Aéro-Club de France issued Aviators Certificates from 1909.The details provided in this and related lists covering the years 1909 to 1914 have been collected and collated largely from the following sources (as listed in the bibliography): "Flying Pioneers - Les Vieilles Tiges; Alphabetical lists of aviators licensed in France prior to 2 August 1914" (Fr.: "Liste Alphabétique des pilotes aviateurs brevetés en France avant le 2 août 1914") by Jacques Moulin; Grace's Guide; Flight global PDF archive. These were internationally recognised under the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.
French aviators' licences were issued from 1 January 1910, but by this time many aviation pioneers, e.g. Louis Blériot and the Wright brothers, had amply demonstrated their abilities and they were therefore not required to pass an examination in order to receive a licence. The first fourteen licences were awarded in alphabetical order, with Blériot being awarded Licence No. 1 and Wilbur Wright receiving No. 15 (No. 13 was not awarded); two further such 'honorary' licences were awarded subsequently and inserted into the sequence as '5bis' and '10bis'.Lassalles, Émile

Unlike the adventure orientation of Der Pimpf, intended for Hitler Youth, Das deutsche Mädel urged hiking, tending the wounded, hard work in factories, and preparing for motherhood.

Silver Lake is an unincorporated community in Preston County, West Virginia, United States. Silver Lake is located along U.S. Route 219 [tpl]convert|7.5|mi|km[/tpl] north of Thomas in Tucker County.
The community is named for a man-made lake of the same name, which is located within a private campground in the community.  Built in 1928, the lake is retained by a small concrete splash dam and is located at the headwaters of the Youghiogheny River.  The park and campground was also built in the 1930s, and was at one time one of the more popular vacation destinations in the area, featuring camping, boating, swimming, picknicking, a restaurant and game room, a small motel, and six small vacation cabins.  The park's overnight facilities were particularly popular during the 1940s and early 1950s, prior to the development of rental cabins and a large lodge at nearby Blackwater Falls State Park, although the vacation cabins at Silver Lake were available for nightly rentals into the late 1990s.  The restaurant closed in the early 2000s and today, the park is primarily a private campground, with many camping trailers permanently placed around the lake, and the cabins rented to monthly tenants.
The trailhead to Hoye-Crest, the highest point in Maryland, is just south of Silver Lake.  Hoye-Crest, the summit of Backbone Mountain, lies along the eastern edge of the West Virginia - Maryland state line, while Silver Lake is just west of the border.  The Hoye-Crest trail, a one-time logging road on private property, is about one mile (1.6 km) long with [tpl]convert|700|ft|m[/tpl] of elevation gain.

The Parker ministry was the third ministry of the Colony of New South Wales, and was led by the Honourable Henry Parker. Parker was elected in the first free elections for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly held in March 1856 and, following the failure of the Donaldson and Cowper Governments to maintain the confidence of the Assembly, was asked to form Government.[ref]
</ref> 
The title of Premier was widely used to refer to the Leader of Government, but not enshrined in formal use until 1920.
There was no party system in New South Wales politics until 1887. Under the constitution, ministers were required to resign to recontest their seats in a by-election when appointed. These by-elections are only noted when the minister was defeated; in general, he was elected unopposed.
This ministry covers the period from 3 October 1856 until on 7 September 1857, when Parker resigned his commission, having lost an electoral bill. During this period, there was a slight re-arrangement to the ministry, following the resignation of William Manning on account of ill-health.[ref]

[[List of outdoor ice hockey games]]
CATEGORIES: Outdoor ice hockey games, History of ice hockey, Ice hockey-related lists

Playing hockey games outdoors, in soccer, football and baseball stadiums, is an increasingly popular trend for junior, college, professional and international competitions in the 21st century.  The popularity of outdoor games has resulted in attendance records in several leagues, and the current world record total of 104,173 was set at The Big Chill at the Big House, a December 2010 National Collegiate Athletic Association game between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University.
While other indoor sports such as basketball have been able to use outdoor tennis courts and even aircraft carriers for outdoor games, this is rarely possible in ice hockey because a regulation rink is generally much wider and longer than the playing surface available in either of those venues. Ice hockey has however been played at Stade Roland Garros, venue of the French Open. Staging a Vysshaya liga game on the Russian carrier Admiral Kuznetsov has been considered as well. To compensate for the varying weather conditions at outdoor ice hockey games (which are played during the Winter times), the teams may switch sides after each half of a period.

Coromantee (derived from the name of the Ghanaian coastal town "Kormantse"), also called Coromantins, Coromanti or Kormantine was the English name given to Akan slaves from the Gold Coast or modern-day Ghana. The term Coromantee is now considered archaic as it simply refers to Akan people, and was primarily used in the Caribbean. Coromantins actually came from several Akan ethnic groups – Ashanti, Fanti, Akyem, etc. – presumably taken as war captives. Owing to their militaristic background and common Akan language, Coromantins organized dozens of slave rebellions in Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean. Their fierce, rebellious nature became so notorious among white plantation owners in the 18th century that an Act was proposed to ban the importation of people from the Gold Coast despite their reputation as strong workers. The Akans had the single largest African cultural influence on Jamaica, including Jamaican Maroons whose culture and language was seen as a derivation of Akan. Names of some notable Coromantee leaders such as Cudjoe, Quamin, Cuffy, and Quamina correspond to Akan day names Kojo, Kwame, Kofi, and Kwamina, respectively.

[[Spectral hole burning]]
CATEGORIES: Spectroscopy

Spectral hole burning is the frequency selective bleaching of the absorption spectrum of a material, which leads to an increased transmission (a  "spectral hole") at  the  selected frequency.  
Two basic requirements, that  must be met  for the  observation of this phenomenon,  are:  1) The  spectrum  is  inhomogeneously broadened and 2) the material undergoes, subsequent to light absorption, a modification which changes its absorption spectrum. Typical materials include dye molecules dissolved in  suitable host matrices and the frequency selective irradiation is usually realized by a narrow band laser.
In most cases, molecules and atoms always return from the excited state back to the initial ground state. There are situations, however, when this is not always the case. For example, some organic dye molecules can undergo a photochemical reaction, which alters the whole chemical structure of the molecule. If such photochemically active molecule absorbs light, then with a probability of a few % it will not return to the initial state called educt, but rather switches over to a new ground state called product. Often the homogeneous absorption spectrum of the product is much different from the educt, so that the corresponding inhomogeneous bands do not even overlap.

Lawyer Eugene Volokh argued in his article The Mechanism of the Slippery Slope that judicial logic could eventually lead to a gradual break in the legal restrictions for euthanasia,[tpl]harvnb|Volok|2003|pp=1057–1058[/tpl] while medical oncologist and palliative care specialist Jan Bernheim believes the law can provide safeguards against slippery-slope effects, saying that the grievances of euthanasia opponents are unfounded.

Atlantic Symphony Orchestra was a professional Canadian symphony orchestra in Atlantic Canada that was active during the second half the 20th century. It has the distinction of being the only full-time regional professional orchestra in Canadian history. The orchestra was formed shortly after the demise of both the Halifax Symphony Orchestra and New Brunswick Symphony Orchesta. Seeing a need for a full-time professional symphony in the Atlantic region, the orchestra was established by joint committees in Halifax, Sydney, Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton on 12 June 1968. Conductor Klaro Mizerit led the orchestra from 1968–1977 and conductor Victor Yampolsky led the orchestra from 1977 until the orchestra's demise due to financial problems in 1983. The orchestra made several commercial recordings in the 1970s and was featured on numerous broadcasts on CBC Radio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000147|title=Atlantic Symphony Orchestra|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=January 2, 2011|author=Shirley A.

[[Cowper ministry (1857–1859)]]
CATEGORIES: New South Wales ministries

The Cowper ministry (1857–1859) or Second Cowper ministry was the fourth ministry of the Colony of New South Wales, and second occasion of being led by the Honourable Charles Cowper. 
Cowper was elected in the first free elections for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly held in March 1856, and fought unsuccessfully with Stuart Donaldson to form Government. When Donaldson's Government faltered a little over two months after it was formed, Cowper formed Government on the first occasion, but he also lost the confidence of the Assembly a few months later. Henry Parker formed Government, lasting a little under twelve months, until it lost an electoral bill,[ref]
</ref> when Cowper was again asked to form Government.
The title of Premier was widely used to refer to the Leader of Government, but not enshrined in formal use until 1920.
There was no party system in New South Wales politics until 1887. Under the constitution, ministers were required to resign to recontest their seats in a by-election when appointed. These by-elections are only noted when the minister was defeated; in general, he was elected unopposed.
This ministry covers the period from 7 September 1857 until on 26 October 1859, when Cowper resigned his commission, having lost an educational bill. Cowper resigned from the Assembly on the next day.[ref]
</ref> During the period of this ministry, there were a large number of arrangements, with no fewer than 13 men holding the seven positions in its life of just over two years.<ref name=Cdab/><ref>

[[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories]]
CATEGORIES: 1941 establishments in Yugoslavia, 1944 disestablishments in Yugoslavia, History of Bačka, History of Baranya (region), History of Croatia by region or territory, History of Hungary, 20th century in Serbia, History of Slovenia, History of Vojvodina, Hungary in World War II, Serbia in World War II, World War II crimes, Yugoslavia in World War II, History of the Drava Banovina, Hungary–Yugoslavia relations, The Holocaust in Yugoslavia, History of Yugoslavia, 20th century in Slovenia, 20th century in Croatia, World War II occupied territories

The Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories was the military occupation then annexation of the Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje and Prekmurje regions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by Hungary during World War II. These territories had all been under Hungarian rule prior to 1920, and had been transferred to Yugoslavia as part of the post-World War I Treaty of Trianon. They now form part of several states: Yugoslav Bačka is now part of Vojvodina, an autonomous province of Serbia, Yugoslav Baranja and Međimurje are part of modern-day Croatia, and Yugoslav Prekmurje is part of modern-day Slovenia. The occupation began on 11 April 1941 when 80,000 Hungarian troops crossed the Yugoslav border in support of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia that had commenced five days earlier. There was some resistance to the Hungarian forces from Serb Chetnik irregulars, but the defences of the Royal Yugoslav Army had collapsed by this time. The Hungarian forces were indirectly aided by the local Volksdeutsche, the German minority, which had formed a militia and disarmed around 90,000 Yugoslav troops. Despite only sporadic resistance, Hungarian troops killed many civilians during these initial operations, including some Volksdeutsche. The government of the newly formed Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), consented to the Hungarian annexation of the Međimurje area, which dismayed the Croat population of the region.
The occupation authorities immediately classified the population of Bačka and Baranja into those that had lived in those regions when they had last been under Hungarian rule in 1920 and the mostly Serb settlers who had arrived since the areas had been part of Yugoslavia. They then began collecting thousands of Serb members of the population into concentration camps and expelled them to the NDH, Montenegro, and the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, ultimately deporting tens of thousands of Serbs from the occupied territories. This was followed by the implementation of a policy of "magyarisation" of the political, social and economic life of the occupied territories, which included the re-settlement of Hungarians and Székelys from other parts of Hungary. "Magyarisation" did not impact the Volksdeutsche, who received special status under Hungarian rule, and in Prekmurje the Hungarian authorities were more permissive towards ethnic Slovenes.
Small-scale armed resistance to the Hungarian occupation commenced in the latter half of 1941 and was answered with harsh measures, including summary executions, expulsions and internment. The insurgency was mainly concentrated in the ethnic-Serb area of southern Bačka in the Šajkaška region, where Hungarian forces avenged their losses. In August 1941 a civilian administration took over the government of the "Recovered Southern Territories" ([tpl]lang-hu|Délvidék[/tpl]), and they were formally annexed to Hungary in December. In January 1942 the Hungarian military conducted raids during which they killed over 3,300 people, mostly Serbs and Jews.
In March 1944, when Hungary realised that it was on the losing side in the war and began to negotiate with the Allies, Germany took control of the country, including the annexed territories, during Operation Margarethe I. This was followed by the collection and transport of the remaining Jews in the occupied territories to extermination camps, resulting in the deaths of 85 per cent of the Jews in the occupied territories. Prior to their withdrawal from the Balkans in the face of the advance of the Soviet Red Army, the Germans evacuated 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche from Bačka and Baranja to Austria. Bačka and Baranja were restored to Yugoslav control when the Germans were pushed out of the region by the Red Army in late 1944. Međimurje and Prekmurje remained under occupation until the last weeks of the war.

Watch the Throne is a collaborative studio album by American rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West, released on August 8, 2011, by Roc-A-Fella Records, Roc Nation, and Def Jam Recordings. Before the album, Jay-Z and West had collaborated on their respective singles and with West as a producer on Jay-Z's work. As longtime friends, they originally sought out to record a five-song EP together, but the project eventually evolved into a full length album. Recording sessions took place at various locations and began in November 2010. The album was produced by West, 88 Keys, RZA, Swizz Beatz, Jeff Bhasker, and Mike Dean, among others. 
Expanding on the dense production style of West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne incorporates orchestral and progressive rock influences, unconventional samples, and dramatic melodies in its sound. Jay-Z and West's braggadocio lyrics exhibit themes of opulence, fame, materialism, power, and the burdens of success, as well as political and socioeconomic context. The album expresses other topics such as Jay-Z's thoughts on fatherhood, West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and their legacy as performers. Music writers interpreted the subject matter to concern the rappers' plight as African Americans struggling with financial success in America.
The album produced seven singles, including the international hits "Otis", "Niggas in Paris", and "No Church in the Wild", which all received music videos. "H•A•M" and "Gotta Have It" were successful Billboard singles, with "Why I Love You" and "Lift Off" attaining success internationally. Jay-Z and West promoted the album with the Watch the Throne Tour that spanned October 2011 to June 2012 and became the highest grossing hip-hop concert tour in history. 
Watch the Throne debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 436,000 copies its first week. It received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its production and the rappers' performances, although some criticized its subject matter and cohesiveness. It was also one of the top-ranked albums in year-end lists by critics and publications and earned Jay-Z and West seven Grammy Award nominations. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of June 2012, has sold 1,573,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

The Papal conclave of 18 February to 17 August 1740, convoked after the death of Pope Clement XII on 6 February 1740, was one of the longest conclaves since the 13th century.
The initial favourite to succeed as Pope, the elderly Pietro Ottoboni (1667–1740), Dean of the College of Cardinals, died shortly after the beginning of the conclave, and cardinals loyal to the House of Bourbon repeatedly proposed Pompeo Aldrovandi, but eventually had to accept that he could not secure two-thirds of the votes.
After six months, other possible candidates had also failed, and Prospero Lambertini, Archbishop of Bologna, who had been a Cardinal since 9 December 1726, was elected. He became the 247th pope of the Holy Roman Church, taking the name of Benedict XIV.

The [tpl]nfly|2011[/tpl] Baltimore Ravens season was the team's 16th in the National Football League and city of Baltimore, and the 14th to host home games at M&T Bank Stadium. 2011 marked one of the most successful seasons in Baltimore Ravens franchise history. It would be the first time since 2006 that the Ravens would sweep Pittsburgh in the AFC North division. The Ravens completed the season with a 12–4 record, matching their record from 2010, and winning the AFC North division title for the third time in franchise history. By earning a playoff berth in 2011, the Ravens set a franchise record by going to the postseason for four consecutive seasons. 
John Harbaugh coached his fourth season for the franchise. Over his first four years, Harbaugh compiled an overall record of 44–20 in regular season and 5–4 in postseason. The Ravens avenged their 2010 divisional round playoff loss against the Steelers in week 1 of the season with a big 35–7 victory at home. The 2011 campaign also marked the first time the Ravens played a Thanksgiving game: the Ravens played the San Francisco 49ers and won 16–6. (San Francisco was coached by John Harbaugh's brother Jim, and many dubbed the Thanksgiving game the "Harbaugh Bowl.") 
After defeating the Cincinnati Bengals in week 17, the Ravens earned the first-round bye for the first time since 2006 as the second seed but fell to the New England Patriots in the Conference Championship game, 23–20. Lee Evans failed to catch what would have been the game-winning touchdown on 2nd down and 1, and Billy Cundiff missed a potentially game-tying 32-yard field goal attempt in the final minute. 
Linebacker Terrell Suggs was named Defensive Player of the Year.

[[China Men]]

CATEGORIES: Works by Maxine Hong Kingston, National Book Award for Nonfiction winning works, Single-writer short story collections, Asian-American short story collections, American short story collections, 1980 short story collections, Alfred A. Knopf books

China Men is a 1980 collection of "stories" by Maxine Hong Kingston, some true and some fictional. It is a sequel to The Woman Warrior with a focus on the history of the men in Kingston's family. It won the 1981 National Book Award for Nonfiction.[ref]
"National Book Awards – 1981". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-21.[/ref][ref]
This was the award for hardcover "General Nonfiction".  From 1980 to 1983 in National Book Awards history there were several nonfiction subcategories including General Nonfiction, with dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories.[/ref]
Kingston wrote The Woman Warrior and China Men as one and would like them to be read together; she decided to publish them separately in fear that some of the men's stories might weaken the feminist perspective of the women's stories.[tpl]cite book|last=Kim|first=Elaine H.|title=Asian American Literature: An Introduction to the Writings and Their Social Context|year=1982|publisher=Temple UP|isbn=0-87722-260-6|authorlink=Elaine H. Kim|location=Philadelphia|pages=207–213|chapter=Chinatown Cowboys and Warrior Women: Searching for a New Self-Image[/tpl] 
The collection becomes what A. Robert Lee calls a "narrative genealogy" of Chinese settlement in the United States, along the lines of the Anglo-American stories of the first colonies, but traced back across the Pacific Ocean. To tell their stories, many of which Kingston heard only through the talk-story of the women in her family, 
she mixes the known history of her family with hypothetical imaginings and with the legal history of Chinese America. Her book presents a picture of a United States still changing in its reciprocal influence with China.[tpl]cite book|last=Lee|first=A. Robert|title=Multicultural American Literature: Comparative Black, Native, Latino/a and Asian American Fictions|year=2003|publisher=UP of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-645-X|authorlink=A. Robert Lee|pages=35–36|chapter=Landmarks: Ellison, Momaday, Anaya, Kingston[/tpl] 
At the same time, the title reflects a deliberate rejection of American racism against the Chinese: whereas the term "Chinaman" was a common slur (such as in John Chinaman), the Chinese referred to themselves as the "China Men" of the title: tang jen.
Some of the main characters in the book include Kingston's great-grandfather Bak Goong, who worked on the sugar plantations in Hawai'i; her grandfather Ah Goong, who worked for the railroad construction companies; her father BaBa, a gambling house owner and laundryman; and her unnamed brother, who receives no honor for fighting for the USA in Vietnam. 
These characters are at times presented more as archetypes than as individuals, and at times there are competing versions of the story, as if the characters represent all the possible forefathers of the Chinese American population; as Elaine H. Kim points out, the father character "immigrates to America in five different ways, by way of Cuba, Angel Island, or Ellis Island ... He could have entered the country legally, or he could have come as a paper son or by some other avenue. He is both 'the father from China' and 'the American father.'"

CATEGORIES: Musar movement, Living people, 1949 births, American Jews, Canadian Rhodes Scholars, Canadian anthropologists, People from Toronto, Alumni of the University of Oxford, Hindu studies scholars

Alan Morinis (born 1949) is an anthropologist, filmmaker, and writer who has been a leading figure in the contemporary revival of the Musar movement, a Jewish ethical movement.
He was trained as an anthropologist as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University.  His scholarly expertise is in the study of religious pilgrimages, especially in Hinduism.  He authored the book Pilgrimage in the Hindu Tradition: A Case Study of West Bengal.
Morinis was born into a secular Jewish home in Toronto, Canada.  His later studies in Judaism, under the tutelage of Rabbi Yechiel Perr, led him to discover the Musar movement, a process which he described in his book Climbing Jacob's Ladder.  He founded the Mussar Institute, based in Vancouver, British Columbia.  His other books on Musar include Everyday Holiness and Every Day, Holy Day.
He has been credited as being, along with Rabbi Ira F. Stone, the leading figure in the contemporary revival of the Musar movement among non-Orthodox Jews.Geoffrey Claussen, "The American Jewish Revival of Musar," The Hedgehog Review. Retrieved 10 January 2011. In Climbing Jacob's Ladder, Morinis describes the Musar movement as having largely died off after the Holocaust.  Some critics, however, contend that the Morinis exaggerates the extent to which the movement died off.[tpl]cite news|last=Ellenson|first=Ruth Andrew|title=An Assimilated Jew's Connection With an Old Tradition|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/111127325.html?dids=111127325:111127325&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+23%2C+2002&author=RUTH+ANDREW+ELLENSON&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Religion%3B+BOOK+REVIEW%3B+An+Assimilated+Jew%27s+Connection+With+an+Old+Tradition%3B+%22CLIMBING+JACOB%27S+LADDER%22+By+Alan+Morinis%3B+Broadway%2C+226+pages%2C+%2423.95&pqatl=google|accessdate=10 January 2011|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=23 March 2002[/tpl]
Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of the web site Spirituality & Practice have described Morinis's teachings as offering "a treasure trove of spiritual practices," "explications of the practical spiritual tradition of Mussar," and "insights into how to change your behavior and bring out your soul."Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, "Living Spiritual Teachers Project: Alan Morinis". Retrieved 10 January 2011.  Geoffrey Claussen of Elon University has described Morinis as emphasizing "the honesty, humility, patience, and discipline that doing Musar requires" but as giving less attention to the importance of "traditional liturgy and community."Geoffrey Claussen, "The American Jewish Revival of Musar," The Hedgehog Review.

In 37 BC Darius had died and Arsaces succeeded his brother as King of Pontus. He was made King by Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. According to Strabo, in Arsaces’ reign “he played the role of the sovereign and excited rebellion without the permission of a Roman prefect”.

[[Park district]]
CATEGORIES: Cultural organizations, Local government in the United States, Parks

A park district is a form of local special-purpose district for providing public parks and recreation in or near its geographic boundaries.  Some park districts also own or maintain related cultural facilities such as monuments, zoos, sports venues, music venues, or museums.
Park districts are prevalent in the United States.  State statutes often have a general law to provide for park districts' creation, dissolution, geographic borders, and annexation; the selection of governing boards, often referred to as park boards; and the criteria for levying property taxes on behalf of the district.  Park districts sometimes obtain additional revenue by charging admission fees for some venues and through donations or voluntary memberships in a similar way to not-for-profit organizations; in addition, sometimes a park district is assisted by a private not-for-profit organization set up specifically for the purpose of assisting the local public park system.
Park district jurisdiction over public recreation is usually not exclusive; other local government bodies may also have their own parks.  Local government bodies besides park districts also own museums and public event venues such as arenas; in some places the main public museums are instead part of the local library district or a separate museum district.  State parks and national parks, and other related state and national areas, are controlled at the level of government that created them, rather than by any local park district.
Illinois statute provides specifically for an administrative body known as the Chicago Park District, which is under the control of a "chief executive officer" appointed by the mayor of Chicago rather than a publicly elected park board as with other park districts in Illinois.[tpl]ILCS|70|1505|3|title=Chicago Park District Act |accessdate=2013-10-30[/tpl]
In some states, such as Illinois, park districts are also authorized to have their own park police departments, independent of the other local police departments or state or national park police.[tpl]ILCS|70|1205|4-7|title=Park District Code |accessdate=2013-10-30[/tpl][tpl]ILCS|70|1325|title=Park District Police Act |accessdate=2013-10-30[/tpl]
In Ohio, the Ohio Revised Code section 1545 provides for general park districts, often known as "metro parks", in addition to "township park districts" allowed under ORC section 511.18.  Township park districts may be converted into "metro parks" by public election.  Section 1545 park districts are authorized to operate their own park police as well.  Park districts in Ohio are controlled by park commissioners appointed by a local judge, rather than by a publicly elected park board.

Vilcashuamán was an Inca administrative center, established after the Incas conquered the Chancas and the Pocras. According to chroniclers, Vilcashuamán was home to 40,000 people. The city was located around a large plaza where ceremonies involving sacrifices were performed. Around this plaza were the city's two most important buildings: the Sun Temple (Templo del Sol) and the Usnu which remain to this day. It is believed that the city had the shape of a falcon, in which the Usnu was located in the head.
The Usnu is a truncated pyramid which is accessed through a double door jamb, characteristic of the most important compounds. In its upper platform is a large stone with unique carvings that is known as the Seat of the Inca (Asiento del Inca); it is believed to have once been covered with gold leaf.
