[[The Neon Judgement]]
CATEGORIES: Post-punk music groups, Belgian industrial music groups, Musical groups established in 1981, Belgian New Wave musical groups

The Neon Judgement is a Belgian new wave band, formed in Leuven in 1981 by Dirk Da Davo (keyboards/vocalist) and TB Frank (guitarist/vocalist). These Belgian musicians have often been considered the pioneers of electronic body music (EBM), together with another Belgian band, Front 242. EBM is a high-tech genre from the early '80s, combining industrial and electro music, from which later originated new beat and techno.
Davo Da Davo and TB Frank veered between minimalistic industrial drones and odd, new wave synthpop and dance music, underlain by cold, mechanical rhythms. Their initial music is aggressive, danceable and dominated by synthesizers and drum-machines. A bit later on in their career, the guitar also had a prominent place in their music.
The Neon Judgement recorded most of their output for the Play It Again Sam label in Belgium, beginning with 1986's Mafu Cage. Their first American release did not come until 1987, with the sex-themed concept album, Horny As Hell. Subsequent recordings included Blood and Thunder (1989), The Insult (1990), and Are You Real (1992).
The duo took a three-year hiatus to rethink the direction of their music, after which they returned in 1995 with At Devil's Fork, an LP recorded with percussionist Ben Forceville entirely in a wooded area.
The band briefly stopped performing in 1998, but reformed in 2004 and started performing live again to promote a series of remixes and re-releases of their material. The touring continued into 2006, with the band promising on their website that, "Live, The Neon Judgement will continue to give art terrorism a good name, finding new ways of marrying noise and beauty, machines and magic".
Dirk Da Davo is also in the side project Neon Electronics, for which he started his own record label Dancedelic-D and he both reworks old classics and composes new material.
In November 2005, the Neon Judgement did a show at the Machina Festival at the Broadway Club in São Paulo, Brazil. The festival celebrated the first eight years of the site FiberOnline and the launch of the label Fiber Records. Fiber Records released the DVD The Neon Judgement – Live at Machina Festival in 2005 featuring the whole concert of 13 songs.The Neon Judgement live at Machina Festival DVD out now 
In 2007, the band released the compilation album Redbox.The Neon Judgement announces Redbox The release comes after the success of the 100% vintage 2 CD Box released in October 2005. Redbox mainly contains the band's work during the second half of the 1980s. The album also features remixes from acts such as David Carretta, Blackstrobe, Lifelike, and Helmut Kraft. Redbox also contains a brand new recording, namely a cover version of "Heroes" (by David Bowie and Brian Eno).
The band's most recent album is Smack, released in 2009.

He was a scholar from the Wu region and served as an advisor to the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han Dynasty before the founding of Eastern Wu. He held several military posts from time to time, and was noted in his successful subjugation of the lords and barbarians in the south. After he became famous and influential within the regime, he started to actively engage himself in the central government's politics, and was one of those accounted for leading to the destructive result of the crown prince case in Wu's history. As a consequence, he was relocated to Xiling; during his tenure there, he established his clan as a unrivaled local power. He was later called back to Jianye to be the chancellor, but died soon on the post.

The river Canche (Dutch: De Kwinte) is one of the rivers that flow from the plateau of the southern Boulonnais and Picardy, into the English Channel. The Somme is the largest example. The basin of the Canche extends to 1,274 square kilometres and lies in the southern end of the département of Pas-de-Calais. Forming an alluvial valley from 1 to 2 kilometers wide, the Canche is a verdant landscape of calm waters, marshes, meadows and small woods. The gentle gradient, averaging 1.5%, gives the river a meandering course.
The river rises at Gouy-en-Ternois and passes Frévent, Hesdin, Montreuil-sur-Mer before leaving the chalk to flow to the coast between Étaples and Le Touquet-Paris-Plage. Its principal tributaries are the Ternoise, the Planquette, the Créquoise, the Bras de Bronne, the Course, the Dordogne (not the Dordogne) and the Huitrepin which all join on its right bank, i.e. to the north of the Canche. The lie of the land means there’s no notable tributary from the south until the Grande Tringue, which flows from marshland into the small, dredged estuary.

[[Coxless pair]]
CATEGORIES: Rowing racing boats

A coxless pair is a rowing boat used in the sport of competitive rowing. It is designed for two rowers, who propel the boat with sweep oars. 
The crew consists of a pair of rowers, each having one oar, one on the stroke side (rower's right hand side) and one on the bow side (rower's lefthand side). As the name suggests, there is no coxswain on such a boat, and the two rowers must co-ordinate steering and the proper timing of oar strokes between themselves or by means of a steering installation which is operated by a foot from one of the rowers. The equivalent boat when it is steered by a cox is referred to as a  "coxed pair". 
Racing boats (often called "shells") are long, narrow, and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to reduce drag to a minimum.  Originally made from wood, shells are now almost always made from a composite material (usually carbon-fibre reinforced plastic) for strength and weight advantages. Pairs have a fin towards the rear, to help prevent roll and yaw. The riggers are staggered alternately along the boat so that the forces apply asymmetrically to each side of the boat. 
A coxless pair is often considered the most difficult boat to row, as each rower must balance his/her side in cooperation with the other, apply equal power, place their catch and extract the blade simultaneously in order to move the boat efficiently. It requires excellent technique, communication and experience.
"Coxless pair" is one of the classes recognized by the International Rowing Federation and is competed in the Olympic Games.FISA World Rowing - Olympic Games

CATEGORIES: Education policy in the United States

The James B. Hunt, Jr. Institute for Educational Leadership and Policy was founded at the close of Governor James B. Hunt, Jr.'s fourth term as governor of North Carolina.
The Hunt Institute's mission is to work with leaders to secure America's future through quality education. The Institute fulfills this mission by convening leaders in sessions led by experts in policy and practice. The result is the sharing and development of ideas and practices about educational leadership and the conversion of strategic ideas into action.
The Hunt Institute's primary constituency is governors. Recognizing, however, that governors alone can not effect change and progress, the Hunt Institute also works with lieutenant governors, legislators, mayors, business leaders, and PK-16 education leaders.
The board of the Hunt Institute consists of elected officials, business leaders, and educational experts. Former Governor James B. Hunt, Jr. serves as chair of the board which meets twice a year to review Hunt Institute objectives and identify emerging issues in education.
"The Hunt Institute provided me with the information, guidance and a sounding board on education topics that are important to Virginia, like senior year standards. The Institute serves as a unique resource in helping a governor flesh out and develop education policies within the context of political realities."

Released as a reissue of the original version of Fender Precision Bass, it was named as "Telecaster" after the Telecaster guitar model. The Telecaster Bass differs in shape from the original Telecaster guitar in that the latter is a single cutaway guitar and the bass is double cutaway, a feature which makes it resemble the Squier 51.

[[Grana (cheese)]]

CATEGORIES: Italian cheeses

Grana originally referred to a class of hard, mature cheeses from Italy which have a granular texture and are often used for grating. These cheeses are typically made in the form of large drums. The structure is often described as crystalline, and the drums are divided by being split with a fairly blunt triangular knife designed for the purpose, rather than being sliced, cut or sawn. Within the European Union, the term Grana is now legally protected by Grana Padano Protected Designation of Origin, such that only Grana Padano may be sold using the term in EU countries.
The two best-known examples of grana-type cheeses are Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano.  The two cheeses are broadly similar, with the latter being less sharp, crumbly and grainy.
The main difference between the two is that cows producing Parmigiano-Reggiano eat only grass and cereals (no silage), no preservatives and no antibiotics. Cows that have been treated with antibiotics are suspended from production of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Silage is a fermented forage that requires the addition of a natural preservative (lysozyme) to Grana Padano.
Other Grana cheeses include:
Grana cheeses typically contains cheese crystals, semi-solid to gritty crystalline spots that at least partially consist of the amino acid tyrosine.

Nathaniel Merriweather Presents... Lovage: Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By is the 2001 debut and so far only album of Lovage. Lovage is a studio supergroup featuring Dan the Automator producing, Mike Patton and Jennifer Charles on vocals, Kid Koala on the turntables, Brandon Arnovick (as Astacio the Nudist) on guitar, Daniels Spills on keyboards and SweetP on harpsichord & noseflute.
Dan the Automator provides trip hop beats while the vocals mostly consist of Mike Patton and Jennifer Charles engaging in sultry and provocative dialogue. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the album is tongue-in-cheek. The album cover is an homage to Serge Gainsbourg's second album. The song "Sex (I'm A)" was originally written and performed by 1980s New Wave band Berlin. The Lovage version differs significantly from the original. The album features many references to Alfred Hitchcock, most notably the titles of the songs "To Catch a Thief", "Lifeboat", and "Strangers on a Train", which were all named after the movies, and contain re-dubbed excerpts. The album title itself also refers to an album Hitchcock appeared on in 1956 titled Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Music to Be Murdered By.

As a footballer though he played his best years for Panathinaikos being one of the key players behind Club's European runs in 1992 and 1996. He played with Panathinaikos through 1998. He was one of the best defenders his country has ever seen.
He also spent six months as a coach with Panathinaikos in 2001, before resigning from his position at the end of the year and eventually taking up the task of coaching the Olympic team for Athens 2004.
During his playing career, Apostolakis was capped 96 times by the National Football Team of Greece (5 goals)[tpl]cite web|publisher=RSSSF|author=Mamrud, Roberto|title=Efstratos Apostolakis - International Appearances|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/apostolakis-intl.html|date=2004-09-25[/tpl] and was a member of the 1994 World Cup squad.

Kostas Eleftherakis ([tpl]lang-el|Κώστας Ελευθεράκης[/tpl], born 18 July 1950) is a retired Greek association football midfielder. His nickname was "the deer" (to elafi).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pao.gr/el/history/pastlegends/?itemid=002a3096-df18-4d2b-b8eb-0b8fca0368fc|title=Kostas Eleftherakis|publisher=pao.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=18 May 2012[/tpl]
He started his career in 1964–65, playing for Beta Ethniki side Fostiras.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.athlitikihxo.gr/showhighlights.php?papercode=109291|title=Atromitos - Fostiras 1-3, match report|last=Fount.|date=22 November 1965|work=Athlitiki Echo|language=Greek[/tpl] He later joined Panathinaikos in 1968. At age 21 he played for Panathinaikos at 1971 European Cup Final in Wembley Stadium against Ajax Amsterdam. He scored 2 goals during that campaign to reach the final.
Following that game, Real Madrid and Everton expressed interest in acquiring him. Real Madrid would offer an inconceivable (for the time) 35 million drachmas for Kostas Eleftherakis. But Costas Aslanidis (Secretary General of Athletics, appointed by the Greek military junta of 1967-1974) would stand in the way.  The same happened when Everton made an offer through Billy Bingham who coached Greece in the early 1970s.
He was invited to play for the World XI.
An injury he sustained in May 1977 would force him to stay away from the game for six months. He would never regain his form completely after that. Five years later he retired from football, but not before he won another Greek league title with AEK in 1980–81.[tpl]cite web|publisher=RSSSF|title=Greece 1980/81|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/grk81.html|accessdate=2009-04-13[/tpl] He ended his career playing again at Fostiras.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.athlitikihxo.gr/showhighlights.php?papercode=138868|title=Το στατιστικό περισκόπιο (The statistical periscope)|last=Pagiotelis|first=Giorgos|date=14 February 1982|work=Athlitiki Echo|language=Greek[/tpl]
He played a total of 331 games in the Greek A Division, 308 of which with Panathinaikos, and scored 88 goals.

Panagiotis "Takis" Ikonomopoulos ([tpl]lang-gr|Παναγιώτης (Τάκης) Οικονομόπουλος[/tpl]; born 19 October 1943) is a former football (soccer) goalkeeper from Greece.
In 1963, a month after coach Stjepan Bobek arrived at Panathinaikos, Takis Ikonomopoulos was transferred to Panathinaikos from Proodeftiki. He was nicknamed "The Bird" after his impressive flings and had a glorious career wearing the colours of PAO.
While playing for Panathinaikos,  he managed to keep the opponents from scoring for 1,088 minutes (in a span of 13 consecutive games - a record for Greece which he still holds!). He kept a clean slate from 17 January 1965 until 9 May 1965 - when he was finally beaten. Takis Ikonomopoulos' record places him in spot number 19 in the World's Top Division Goalkeepers of all time with the longest time without conceding a goal (the second highest for Greece, ranking at world spot 38 is Vasilis Konstantinou of Panathinaikos who went 988 minutes without giving up a goal, from 30 December 1979 until 16 March 1980).
He played for Panathinaikos at the 1971 European Cup Final.
Ikonomopoulos had set up a gym at home and used to put extra hours of training there. One of the boys who used to hang out and watch the bird train was Giannis Kyrastas.
Besides Proodeftiki and Panathinaikos, Ikonomopoulos also played for Apollon Athens and Panachaiki. After retiring as a football player, he went on to work with Panathinaikos as a goalkeeping coach.
In 2002, Takis Ikonomopoulos  became responsible for coaching Panathinaikos' first team during the four last matches of the season - after coach Sergio Markarian had been barred from entering any stadium for 40 days following an incident with Olympiakos Piraeus FC.

Currently 15 species are known, but the most commonly grown are F. albivensis and its cultivars. They are spreading evergreen perennials growing [tpl]convert|10|-|15|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall. They bear lush green leaves with accented veins of white to deep pink and have a short fuzz covering their stems. Small buds may appear after time where the stem splits into leaves. Flowers are small with a white to off-white color. Plants are best kept in a moist area with mild sunlight and temperatures above [tpl]convert|55|F|C|abbr=on[/tpl], therefore in temperate areas they must be grown as houseplants. Without water for a few days, this plant is known to "faint" but is easily revived with a quick watering and resumes its healthiness. The fittonia is known to be hard to grow so it is best bought at a nursery then cared for. Its spreading habit makes it ideal as groundcover.

The Flight to Lucifer is the only novel by the American literary critic Harold Bloom (born 1930 in New York).  Published during 1979, it was composed as a sequel to the David Lindsay novel A Voyage to Arcturus, which supplied the concept of a voyage through space to a distant planet created by a demiurge, and a few other incidental features of the book. However, most of its content derives fairly directly from Gnosticism, which Bloom had studied. 
Bloom has stated that he does not like the novel and has disowned it, although it has received very positive reviews from other sources.

Crisis Command — Could You Run the Country? was a 2004 BBC2 role-playing interactive drama documentary which was based on realistic scenarios and dramatised situations that Britain could face one day.
The programme gave three people the chance to run the country during a potential disaster. The crises included terror attacks on London, flood, plague and hostage taking. Viewers were able to make decisions interactively at the same time as the studio players. The programmes were filmed in real time and edited down to one hour programmes. Each scenario was played once on BBC2, and then redone with a different set of "Ministers" on BBC4 immediately afterwards.
They receive advice from military, police and communication experts, but the final decisions are down to them alone. Presented by Gavin Hewitt, Crisis Command — Could You Run The Country? was a test of confidence and the ability to prioritise and keep calm in a tense and rapidly evolving situation.
It examined the dilemmas ministers face when dealing with crisis, and the hard decisions necessary to make to save lives.
Against the clock, the participants were able to call upon three advisors: military advisor Lord Tim Garden, communications adviser Amanda Platell and emergency services advisor Charles Shoebridge.

"Another Weekend" is the name of a 1988 hit single by the British pop group Five Star. It peaked at #18 on the UK singles chart, but reached #1 on the UK Dance chart. In the US, the single reached #23 on the R&B charts.
The single was a return to the charts for the group after a short break to record their fourth LP Rock The World. Due to declining record sales, the group were intent on changing their clean-cut image. They opted for a new, raunchier leather-clad look in the accompanying video, whilst the track demonstrated a slightly harder edged dance sound. However, the changes were not enough to reverse the group's decline, and sales continued to dwindle.

[[Family Allowances Act 1945]]
CATEGORIES: United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1945, United Kingdom pensions and benefits

The Family Allowances Act 1945 (8 & 9 Geo. VI c. 41) was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. It came into operation from August 6, 1946, and was the first law to provide child benefit in the United Kingdom. 
Family allowances had been one of the items proposed by the Beveridge Report in 1942. The Labour Party briefly debated pressing for allowances during the Second World War, but a party conference resolution to this end was opposed by the trades unions for fear that the amount paid would be taken into account in wage negotiations, leaving workers no better off.
As passed, the Act empowered the Minister of National Insurance to pay an allowance of five shillings per week for each child in a family other than the eldest; later Acts increased this sum. It was payable whilst the child was of school age, up to the age of eighteen, if apprenticed or in full-time school education.

[[GNSS reflectometry]]
CATEGORIES: Satellite navigation systems

GNSS reflectometry involves making measurements from the reflections from the Earth of navigation signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems such as GPS. It is also known as GPS reflectometry.
Deliberately bouncing signals off something to learn about it (e.g. radar, echolocation) is active sensing; sensing what is already available in the surrounding environment without changing the environment to do so (e.g. eyesight, hearing) is passive sensing. GNSS reflectometry is passive sensing that takes advantage of and relies on separate active sources - the satellites generating the navigation signals.
The UK-DMC satellite, part of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, carries a secondary reflectometry payload that has demonstrated the feasibility of receiving and measuring GPS signals reflected from the surface of the Earth's oceans from its track in low Earth orbit to determine wave motion and windspeed.[ref]S. Gleason et al., Processing of bistatically reflected GPS signals from low Earth orbit for the purpose of ocean remote
sensing, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol. 43, No. 6, pp. 1229-1241, June 2005.[/ref]M. P. Clarizia et al., Analysis of GNSS-R delay-Doppler maps from the UK-DMC satellite over the ocean, Geophysical Research Letters, 29 January 2009.

[[The Brains]]
CATEGORIES: American New Wave musical groups, Musical groups from Georgia (U.S. state), Music of Atlanta, Georgia

The Brains were a rock band from Atlanta, Georgia, led by songwriter Tom Gray in the early 1980s.  Their 1980 debut album was entitled The Brains, and was produced by Steve Lillywhite for Mercury Records. The set is probably most noteworthy for the band's own song, "Money Changes Everything", which was covered three years later by Cyndi Lauper, becoming a hit single for her.  After a second Mercury recording in 1981, Electronic Eden (also produced by Lillywhite) and then an independently released E.P., Dancing Under Streetlight, the band split up. (A song from Electronic Eden, "Heart in the Street," was covered by Manfred Mann's Earth Band on their 1980 album Chance as "Heart on the Street.")
The band was noted for its live performances, such as its July 1980 performance opening for Devo at Atlanta's Fox Theatre, its April 1981 headlining performance at JB Scotts in Albany, New York, and its May 22, 1982, headlining performance at the Milestone Club in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Drummer Charles Wolff died from cancer on September 10, 2010. Keith Christopher went on to to join the Georgia Satellites, but was replaced as bass player in that band by Rick Price, guitarist for the Brains. The Brains' last drummer Mauro Magellan was the original drummer for the Satellites.

Gestures are a form of nonverbal communication in which visible bodily actions are used to communicate important messages, either in place of speech or together and in parallel with spoken words.[tpl]Cite book|last=Kendon|first=Adam|year=2004|title=Gesture: Visible Action as Utterance|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-83525-9[/tpl] Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. Physical non-verbal communication such as purely expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention differ from gestures, which communicate specific messages. Gestures are     culture-specific and can convey very different meanings in different social or cultural settings.[tpl]Cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Desmond|last2=Collett|first2=Peter|last3=Marsh|first3=Peter|last4=O'Shaughnessy|first4=Marie|year=1979|title=Gestures, Their Origins and Distribution|location=London|publisher=Cape|isbn=0-224-01570-2[/tpl] Gesture is distinct from sign language. Although some gestures, such as the ubiquitous act of pointing, differ little from one place to another, most gestures do not have invariable or universal meanings but connote specific meanings in particular cultures. A single emblematic gesture can have very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive.[tpl]Cite book|last=Kendon|first=Adam|year=1994|chapter=Human gestures|editor=K.R.

Glacier morphology, or the form a glacier takes, is influenced by temperature, precipitation, topography, and other factors.  Types of glaciers range from massive ice sheets, such as the Greenland ice sheet or those in Antarctica, to small cirque glaciers perched on a mountain.  Glaciers types can be grouped into two main categories, based on whether or not ice flow is constrained by the underlying bedrock topography.

[[Fender (boating)]]
CATEGORIES: Nautical terms

In boating, a fender is a bumper used to absorb the kinetic energy of a boat or vessel berthing against a jetty, quay wall or other vessel. Fenders are used to prevent damage to boats, vessels and berthing structures. To do this, fenders usually have high energy absorption and low reaction force.http://max-groups.com/rubber-fenders-types-things-note/ Fenders are typically manufactured out of rubber, foam elastomer or plastic. Rubber fenders are either extruded or made in a mould. The type of fender that is most suitable for an application depends on many variables, including dimensions and displacement of the vessel, maximum allowable stand-off, berthing structure, tidal variations and other berth-specific conditions.  The size of the fender unit is based on the berthing energy of the vessel which is related to the square of the berthing velocity.
Historically, fenders were woven from rope in a variety of patterns. Fenders of woven rope are still used today by historic boat owners. 
Yachts, small leisure craft and support vessels typically have mobile fenders which are placed between the boat and the dock as the boat approaches the dock. Docks and other marine structures, such as canal entrances and bases of bridges, have permanent fenders placed to avoid damage from boats. Old tires are often used as fenders in such places.

The eastern terminus at State Route 7 is in Gallipolis. The route is very scenic as it travels through rural areas of Lawrence and Gallia Counties.  The road is hilliest in the westernmost [tpl]convert|12|mi|km[/tpl].  As you move further east, the road becomes somewhat flatter as it often parallels Symmes Creek.  Traveling the road from end to end, one will cross Symmes Creek five times and pass through several communities including Ironton, Hecla, Kitts Hill, Aid, Wilgus, Arabia, Waterloo, Cadmus, Gage, Centenary, and Gallipolis. Symmes Valley High School and Symmes Valley Elementary School are also located along State Route 141, just to the east of Aid. Because of the close proximity to Symmes Creek through the central portion of the route, the roadway is sometimes flooded in rainy periods.  This occurs most notably just south of Cadmus.  The route in Gallia County is scenic in that there are several Amish settlements.

[[Coker unit]]
CATEGORIES: Oil refineries, Chemical equipment, Petroleum production

A coker or coker unit is an oil refinery processing unit that converts the residual oil from the vacuum distillation column or the atmospheric distillation column into low molecular weight hydrocarbon gases, naphtha, light and heavy gas oils, and petroleum coke. The process thermally cracks the long chain hydrocarbon molecules in the residual oil feed into shorter chain molecules leaving behind the excess carbon in the form of petroleum coke.
This petroleum coke can either be fuel grade (high in sulphur and metals) or anode grade (low in sulphur and metals).  The raw coke from the coker is often referred to as green coke.Petroleum coke on the website of the IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology   In this context, "green" means unprocessed. The further processing of green coke by calcining in a rotary kiln removes residual volatile hydrocarbons from the coke. The calcined petroleum coke can be further processed in an anode baking oven in order to produce anode coke of the desired shape and physical properties.  The anodes are mainly used in the aluminium and steel industry.

A desalter is a process unit in an oil refinery that removes salt from the crude oil.  The salt is dissolved in the water in the crude oil, not in the crude oil itself. The desalting is usually the first process in crude oil refining. The salt content after the desalter is usually measured in PTB - pounds of salt per thousand barrels of crude oil.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4352288.html|title= Measurement of salt content in petroleum flow lines - Patent 4352288|accessdate=2009-03-11 |work= |publisher= |date= [/tpl]   Another specification is Basic sediment and water
The term desalter may also refer to a water desalination facility used to treat brackish water from agricultural runoff.  This may be done either to produce potable water for human or animal consumption, or to reduce the salinity of river water prior to its crossing an international border, usually to comply with the terms of a treaty.  Desalters are also used to treat groundwater reservoirs in areas impacted by cattle feedlots and dairies.

Charles Shoebridge is a writer, broadcaster, and unaffiliated authority on security, intelligence, terrorism and crime issues.
A graduate of history and politics, and of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he served for almost two decades (until 2000) in diverse front-line policing and military roles, specialising in counter-terrorism and intelligence operations.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Prior to his service at Scotland Yard and elsewhere with the Metropolitan Police, he also worked in counter terrorism as a commissioned officer in the British Army.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
In August 2000 he won £300,000 in an out-of-court settlement with the Metropolitan Police after he was wrongly accused of indecently assaulting a female colleague. He had been suspended as a result of the allegation. His alleged victim had been one of three women officers who had lodged a complaint of bullying against him. Shoebridge's mental and physical health had deteriorated as a result of the allegations and he 'suffered from sweating, bouts of crying, pain in the back of his neck and a loss of interest in sex'.Daily Telegraph, 18 August 2000
After retirement he worked as a pundit, making numerous TV, radio and newspaper contributions, including as one of the host presenters of the television series Crisis Command. This work, however came to an abrupt end. In 2005 Shoebridge took legal action against the Metropolitan Police, claiming that senior Scotland Yard officials unlawfully used their influence with the media to have him denied work.http://shoebridge-v-metpolice.info/index.htmlSky News denied that it had been influenced by the Metropolitan Police by pulling Shoebridge off the air. Shoebridge was described as "not very good" on Sky's contacts database. Sky News said the real reasons Mr Shoebridge was dropped was "because staff personally disliked him, with one branding him "a creep", and that he lacked knowledge on all the topics he was willing to talk about."The Guardian, 17 March 2005 In December 2005 he was vindicated and awarded £52,146 in damages and loss of earnings.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4554310.stm

Caribou is a small rural community in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, Canada.
Located on the Northumberland Strait northwest of the town of Pictou, Caribou is named after the Woodland Caribou which used to live in Nova Scotia until European settlers hunted the herds to extinction in the 19th century.  Nearby geographic locations using the name include Caribou Harbour, which the community is situated upon, as well as Caribou Island to the north, Central Caribou and Caribou River.
Caribou became an important port after it was selected by the federal government in the late 1930s to be the Nova Scotia terminal for a seasonal ferry service to eastern Prince Edward Island.  The service, operated by Northumberland Ferries Limited since its inception in 1941, carries passenger, vehicle and truck traffic to Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island between May and December.
Caribou also hosts a small passenger-only seasonal ferry service to Pictou Island, departing from the small craft fishing harbour adjacent to the NFL ferry terminal.

The gardens were established in the early 1930s by Mrs. David R. Coker on the land, which had become a neglected dump.  Mrs. Coker made trails, dug a pond, and planted ornamental species including azaleas, camellias, tea olives (Osmanthus fragrans), and wisteria.  In 1935 she opened the gardens to the public, and in 1965 she gave them to Coker College. The centerpiece of the gardens is the Thomas Hart House, built in the 1820s, and the home of the town's founder.  It and the gardens are on the National Register of Historic Places.
Kalmia Gardens encompasses a blackwater swamp along Black Creek, and uplands of pine, oak, and holly. Due to its unique geology, being situated on a 60-foot north-facing bluff, it has an abundance of naturally-occurring mountain-laurel Kalmia latifolia. The namesake plant blooms in great profusion in May. Other montane plants grow together with coastal plain plants, making for a unique assemblage of flora.  Many animal species live in the dense woodlands as well, and Kalmia Gardens is well known as an excellent birding spot.

"Put Your Lights On" is a single performed by Santana and Everlast on Santana's album, Supernatural (1999).  It barely charted on the US pop chart, reaching #18 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, but did considerably better on rock radio, peaking at #8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.
"Put Your Lights On" won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 2000 Grammy Awards.
Everlast wrote the song while recovering from a major heart attack that he had suffered in February 1998 (directly after completing recording his first solo album, Whitey Ford Sings the Blues). He has referred to it as "one of the most personal songs I ever wrote", stating that the song was "kind of all about hope, but it’s coming from a really dark place you know, so... and really questioning a lot of your beliefs, and affirming, you know, stuff in your soul."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh8crd9YVR0
Everlast converted to Islam in 1996, and the end of the song contains the words "La ilaha illa Allah", ("There is no deity but one God" in Arabic), the first part of the Shahada, the Islamic profession of faith.
Santana called Everlast in 1998, asking him if he could contribute a song for Supernatural, and Everlast suggested "Put Your Lights On". According to Everlast, Santana loved the song, and "from then on everything went very fast." Everlast has stated that he was unsure whether to include the Arabic-language portion in the recorded song, because "I did not want to sell Allah's words", but that Santana insisted that they be included.2001 Everlast interview with the Association for New German Muslims

CATEGORIES: Irish rugby union teams, Rugby union clubs in County Cork, Clonakilty, Sport in County Cork

Clonakilty RFC is an Irish rugby club. They play in Division 1 of the Munster Junior League.
Clonakilty Rugby Club as it is now was formed in 1977 at a meeting in the Kilty Stone Tavern which has remained the spiritual home of the club ever since. The main reason at that time for the reformation of the club was to provide a social outlet for those involved.
Rugby had been played for periods previously in the town. In 1890 a Clonakilty side competed in the Munster Senior Cup for the first time. The club played their games in The Showgrounds but disbanded in the early 1900s. Clonakilty RFC took the field again in the 1930s when Paul Blewitt, father of former Hon. Sec. Jimmy Blewitt was a stalwart player and administrator. The club disbanded again before the Second World War and was not heard of again until that fateful evening in the Kilty Stone Tavern in 1977.
Clonakilty RFC is located in a small town of approximately 4.000 inhabitants; this is remarkable in that most of the principal clubs come out of Cork (120,000) and Limerick (90,000).
The club commenced competitive rugby at Minor A level and won its first trophy, the Dromleena Cup in 1978. 
Following victories in 1980 and 1982 in the Minor A league it was decided to move up to Junior grade in 1982/83.
The O'Neill Cup was won in the 1995/96 season (against Bandon in the final) and the Junior 1 team won promotion to the 1st Division as well as winning two local cups and the annual "Jimmy Blewitt Memorial Cup" played between Clonakilty and Donaghadee.
In 2001, Clonakilty reached the top of Munster regional rugby and obtained promotion through a round-robin league by winning over champion sides of the three other provinces. 
Since then, the club won the title of the Senior Third Division in 2006. 
Promoted to Senior second division, and obtained a brilliant third place the following season in the Second Division places.
Clonakilty Rugby Football Club: playing in the Division 1 of the Junior League. Catering for 3 men's adult teams and under 20's, 2 ladies' teams and the full range of underage teams from under 8's to under 18's.

"Down Low (Nobody Has to Know)" is an R&B song about infidelity, released as a single by R. Kelly and featuring The Isley Brothers, on his self-titled album, in 1995. The song was a hit, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and reaching number one on the R&B Singles Chart for seven weeks, making it Kelly's fifth single to do so on the latter.
The music video was directed by Hype Williams.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The song was a tongue-in-cheek song that had the narrator fooling around with another man's woman and telling the woman to keep their relationship as a closely guarded secret, hence the chorus "Keep it on the down low / Nobody has to know." While Kelly sings along, the "husband", Ronald Isley, sings in his trademark falsetto exclaiming "How could you go so low?"

Devil's Backbone is a rock formation and peninsula formed by the flow of Fourteen Mile Creek into the Ohio River, and is currently situated in Charlestown State Park near Charlestown, Indiana and across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky.  According to local legend, on this bedrock ridge once stood a stone fortress that was built by Welsh explorers led by Prince Madoc sometime in the 12th century.Falls of the Ohio - Legends & Stories
The Backbone is believed to have been formed by the processes of glaciation where a combination of ice sheet advances, meltwater flows and a diversion of the Ohio River left an isolated bedrock ridge remaining between two valleys.
Rose Island, an amusement park popular during the 1920s that was destroyed by the 1937 Flood, stood on this rugged peninsula, at the base of the ridge on a level area.
Charlestown State Park hiking trails do not provide access to the Backbone, but a loop around the old Rose Island site passes below the ridge.  
There is another location by the same name near Fort Ritner, Indiana, east of Bedford.

Active in politics, literature and art, Ćosić has exhibited, published, and been active since 1994. He is well known for his challenging, ground-breaking work as a pioneer in the field of net.art. His constantly evolving oeuvre is characterized by an interesting mix of philosophical, political, and conceptual network-related issues on the one hand, and an innovative feeling for contemporary urban and underground aesthetics on the other. One of the pioneers of net.art, Ćosić became interested in ASCII code during a long period of research (1996–2001) on low-tech aesthetics, the economy, ecology and archaeology of the media, on the intersections between text and computer code, on the use of spaces in information, its fluid nature and infinite convertibility. Out of this came History of Art for the Blind, ASCII Unreal (an art game), ASCII Camera, ASCII Architecture, Deep ASCII and ASCII History of Moving Images, a history of the cinema converted into text format.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imal.org/HolyFire/en/?page_id=22|title=Vuk COSIC|accessdate=2008-04-28|author=|=|date=|work=|publisher=[/tpl]  He is a co-founder of Nettime, Syndicate, 7-11, and Ljubljana Digital Media Lab.

[[United States Conference of Mayors]]
CATEGORIES: Organizations based in Washington, D.C., Organizations established in 1933, Non-governmental organizations of elected officials in the United States

United States Conference of Mayors, sometimes incorrectly referred to as the United States Council of Mayors, is the official non-partisan organization for cities with populations of 30,000 or more.  The cities are each represented by their mayor or other chief elected official.  The organization arose from the shadows of the Great Depression and coalesced under Herbert Hoover until its original charter was signed at the Mayflower Hotel on the eve of the inauguration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
The organization sets policy as the collective voice of municipalities and their leaders. Committees and task forces develop policies that the entire body votes on before sending their resolutions to elected leaders in Washington.  They also undertake studies on issues related to their special interests and fund grants and awards to incent execution of their ideals.  The group has continuously evaluated the landscape of public policy and has current issues related to homeland security and economic recovery.
By standing as a unified voice through this organization, municipal leaders have influenced United States Presidents and United States Congresses to enact legislation that has provided a legacy of benefits to cities.  Mayors received relief during the Great Depression and later lobbied during the 1970s for relief during that economic slowdown.  Community Development Block Grants (CDBGs) are a legacy of the latter.

[[Swartland]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of the Western Cape

The Swartland begins some 50 kilometres north of Cape Town and consists of the regions between the towns of Malmesbury in the south, Darling in the west, Piketberg in the north and the Riebeek West and Riebeek Kasteel in the east. Jan van Riebeeck called this softly undulating country between the mountain ranges "Het Zwarte Land" (the Black Land) because of the endemic Renosterbos (Elytropappus rhinocerotis). After the rains, mainly in winter, the Renoster Bos takes on a dark appearance when viewed from the distance in large numbers. This is due to the fine leaf-hairs adhering to the leaves when wetted. The wide fertile plain is the bread basket of Cape Town with its wheatfields reaching up to the foot of the mountains, interrupted by wine, fruit and vegetable farms.
Viticulture in the Swartland is still comparatively young, and is practised under dryland conditions, with minimal irrigation. On the well sign-posted Swartland Wine Route the wine farms may be visited and their products sampled.
The Swartland is also home to the oldest colonial hotel of South Africa, The Royal Hotel in Riebeek Kasteel.

The area around the mountains is conducive to the farming of wheat, while the area on top of the mountains, being cooler and generally frost-free, is suited to the farming of fruit and Rooibos Tea.
Piketberg possesses a large white Dutch Reformed Church designed by the architect Carl Otto Hager in his trademark neo-Gothic style.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thewesterncape.co.za/town.php?town=151|title=Piketberg Tourism and Accommodation: Visitor Information Centre|publisher=The Western Cape|accessdate=June 19, 2010[/tpl]

[[List of inhabited islands of Croatia]]
CATEGORIES: Islands of Croatia, Lists of islands by country, Lists of landforms of Croatia

In the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea, there are 718 islands, 389 islets and 78 reefs, making the Croatian archipelago the largest in the Adriatic Sea and the second largest in the Mediterranean Sea, the Greek archipelago being the largest.
Of the 718 islands, only 47 are inhabited in the sense that at least one person resides on that island. Some sources indicate that Croatia has 67 inhabited islands, which is the number of islands that have a settlement on them, but 20 of these islands have lost all of their permanent population as a result of the population decline occurring throughout the Croatian islands due to insufficient economic activity.
The islands of Croatia have been populated at least since the time of Ancient Greece. For example, Hvar was already populated between 3500 BC and 2500 BC and Dionysius I of Syracuse founded a colony on Hvar and Vis in the 4th century BC. The combined island population reached its peak in 1921, at 173,503 inhabitants, and went into steady decline in the following decades, dropping to pre-1850s level by 1981. The depopulation trend was reversed only in the 1990s, with the 2001 census registering a population of 122,418, up from 110,953 in 1991.
The main industries on the islands are agriculture, fishing and tourism. The islands' agriculture is primarily devoted to viticulture and olive growing. The local economy is relatively underdeveloped while the cost of living is 10 to 30% higher than on the mainland, so the Croatian government provides various kinds of support and protection through its Islands Act ([tpl]lang-hr|Zakon o otocima[/tpl]) to stimulate the economy of the islands, including charging no tolls on bridges, and providing cheaper or free ferry tickets for islanders.

[[Line source]]

CATEGORIES: Air pollution, Atmospheric dispersion modeling, Experimental physics, Noise pollution, Optics, Water pollution

A line source is a source of air, noise, water contamination or electromagnetic radiation that emanates from a linear (one-dimensional) geometry.  The most prominent linear sources are roadway air pollution, aircraft air emissions, roadway noise, certain types of water pollution sources that emanate over a range of river extent rather than from a discrete point, elongated light tubes, certain dose models in medical physics and electromagnetic antennas. While point sources of pollution were studied since the late nineteenth century, linear sources did not receive much attention from scientists until the late 1960s, when environmental regulations for highways and airports began to emerge. At the same time, computers with the processing power to accommodate the data processing needs of the computer models required to tackle these one-dimensional sources became more available.
In addition, this era of the 1960s saw the first emergence of environmental scientists who spanned the disciplines required to accomplish these studies. For example, meteorologists, chemists, and computer scientists in the air pollution field were required to build complex models to address roadway air dispersion modeling.  Prior to the 1960s, these specialities tended to work within their own disciplines, but with the advent of NEPA, the Clean Air Act, the Noise Control Act in the USA, and other seminal legislation, the era of multidisciplinary environmental science had begun.
For electromagnetic linear sources, the principal early advances in computer modeling arose in the Soviet Union and USA when the end of World War II and the Cold War were fought partially by progress in electronic warfare, including the technologies of active antenna arrays.

Miss Universe 2000,  the 49th Miss Universe pageant was held at Eleftheria Indoor Hall, Nicosia, Cyprus on May 12, 2000. Seventy-nine delegates competed in this year. At the conclusion of the final night, Lara Dutta of India, aged 21, was crowned as the new Miss Universe 2000 by Miss Universe 1999, Mpule Kwelagobe of Botswana. 
The pageant was marked by certain political issues relating to the contestants. Turkey did not send a delegate to the pageant for the first time in thirteen years because of its relations with Cyprus; the Lebanese and Israeli delegates refused to speak to each other; and Corrinne Crewe of Zimbabwe had to deal with the threat of escalating violence in her country.[tpl]cite news|title=Global conflicts cast shadows at Miss Universe pageant |first=Vijay|last=Joshi|date=2000-05-09[/tpl]  There were also protests from religious and feminist groups on the island who claimed the event was un-Christian and an affront to women.[tpl]cite news|title=Church, women's group denounce Miss Universe pageant|first=Alex|last=Efty|date=2000-05-11[/tpl] The three finalists, Miss India, Miss Venezuela, and Miss Spain, were asked to respond to these protests and convince people that beauty pageants were good. Lara Dutta of India, aged 22, the winner of the competition, responded by saying she believed beauty pageants were a platform for women to voice their opinions and help them enter the field they wanted to enter, be it entrepreneurship, the armed forces, politics, and so forth. She also said beauty pageants made women the strong, independent individuals they are today because of all the help they give women. This spectacular answer to a difficult question completely impressed the judges and entire audience, showing Lara was not only gorgeous but a highly intellectual individual as well. This answer is believed to have greatly contributed to her victory.
That same year, two other Miss India contestants, Priyanka Chopra and Dia Mirza, won the Miss World 2000 and Miss Asia Pacific 2000 titles respectively. This was the second time a country had won all three major international beauty pageants in the same year, the first being Australia in 1972.

[[Ukrainian grammar]]
CATEGORIES: Grammars of specific languages, Ukrainian language, Ukrainian grammar

The grammar of the Ukrainian language describes the phonological, morphological, and syntactical rules of the Ukrainian language. As Ukrainian has maintained much of its inheritance from the Indo-European, Ukrainian grammar is quite complex compared with English, containing 7 cases and 2 numbers for its nominal declension and 2 aspects, 3 tenses, 3 moods, and 2 voices for its verbal conjugation. Adjectives must agree in number, gender, and case with their nouns.
In order to understand Ukrainian grammar, it is necessary to understand the various phonological rules that occur due to the collision of two or more sounds. Doing so, decreases markedly the number of exceptions and makes understanding the rules better. The origin of some of these phonological rules can be traced all the way back to Indo-European gradation (ablaut). This is especially common in explaining the differences between the infinitive and present stem of many verbs.
This article will present the grammar of the literary language, which is in the main followed by most dialects. The main differences in the dialects are vocabulary with occasional differences in phonology and morphology. Further information can be found in the article Ukrainian dialects.

Little Beard's Town, also known as Chenussio (in Seneca) and "Genesee Castle", was a powerful Seneca town in the Genesee River Valley near modern Leicester in Livingston County, New York, where Cuylerville stands today. 
"It surrounds Rt. 39, between Geneseo and Cuylerville, New York.
It was named after its founder, Little Beard, a prominent Seneca sachem in the late 18th century. The town was famous for its beautiful surroundings and the productivity of its vegetable gardens, fruit orchards, and fields of corn. It had about 130 houses-- "finely built log cabins with ample furnishings; some even had glass window panes," as well as a large council building, built around a central square. It was located near three other Seneca towns, all of which were destroyed during the Sullivan Expedition in the American Revolutionary War. 
The Seneca and three other Iroquois nations fought on the British side during the American Revolutionary War.  Little Beard and his warriors participated in the Cherry Valley massacre and the Boyd and Parker ambush, in which two soldiers were brought to Little Beard's Town and tortured. Subsequently, troops of the Continental Army under Major General John Sullivan attacked Little Beard's Town and other Iroquois settlements in the Genesee and Mohawk valleys, destroying buildings and crops. The residents had to flee. 
"Little Beard's Town was burnt by Sullivan-Clinton’s forces on Sept. 14-15, 1779."  
One famous resident fled with the Seneca to more secure villages, around Niagara Falls, with three children. This was Mary Jemison, a Scots-Irish immigrant colonist who had been captured by the Seneca at age 15 with her family, most of whom were killed.  She was adopted and married into the tribe, and lived with them all her life.
A fictional account of the burning of the town is given in The Scouts of the Valley by Joseph A. Altsheler.
"The Men in Sullivans Army were so greatly impressed by the 22 inch long ears of corn, the fine vegetable gardens and the fruit orchards that many determined to return and settle on this land after the war." Cuylerville was later built on the site of Little Beard's Town by European-American settlers.
In 2004, the 225th Anniversary of the Groveland Ambuscade and the Boyd-Parker Massacre, local historical societies set up a civilian camp for re-enactors at the site of Little Beard’s Town.

It was formed mainly by tectonic uplift during the early Alpine orogeny, caused by the Adriatic Plate's northwest movement across the Piemont-Liguria Ocean[tpl]Verify source|date=July 2007[/tpl] towards the end of the Cretaceous. There is no real present-day analog, but overall, the island of Hainan (off the coast of China) is perhaps closest as regards climate, geology and topography, though still not a particularly good match. The vegetation, for example, was of course entirely distinct from today, as was the fauna.
The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa theorized that "limited resources" found on the island commonly have an effect of "reducing the size of animals" over the generations, producing a localized form of dwarfism. Nopcsa's theory of insular dwarfism — also known as the island rule — is today widely accepted.

The Buffalo Creek Reservation was a tract of land surrounding Buffalo Creek in the central portion of Erie County, New York.Holland Land Company map - circa. 1821[tpl]cite book|author=Buffalo Historical Society|title=Publications, Volume 24|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fY4MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110|accessdate=13 July 2012|year=1920|publisher=Buffalo Historical Society|pages=109–116[/tpl] It contained approximately [tpl]convert|49920|acre|km2[/tpl] of land and was set aside for the Native Americans of the region. The Seneca Nation owned the land, however, in 1838 the Treaty of Buffalo Creek dictated that the people of the Seneca Nation leave the tract (and all others in Western New York) and head for Wisconsin and Oklahoma within five years; after the land sale that required the treaty fell through, a new treaty was passed in 1842, and the Buffalo Creek reservation was the only reservation to be dissolved; the Cattaraugus, Oil Springs, Allegany and Tonawanda reservations would remain intact.
The modern Buffalo Creek Reservation consists only of nine-acre plot of land, which was part of the original reservation, upon which the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino is located. Until the Senecas repurchased the land for the casino, it was owned by Carl Paladino, who continues to own much of the surrounding land.Carl Paladino: The accidental candidate | Crain's New York Business

The song reached #3 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks in 1998harris|chart=all}}  Artist Chart History - Days of the New Billboard.com. Retrieved August 27, 2008. and is a concert staple. "Shelf in the Room" is also the first track on the band's Definitive Collection released in 2008.
While perhaps not as popular as other singles from the album, "Shelf In The Room" is regarded for its engaging acoustic guitar melody and serves as the opening track. The song utilizes the basic instrumentation heard throughout the album but also features a vocal distortion during the chorus. Lyrically, the song often refers to a key and tends to vaguely describe emotional stability and isolation. The shelf is considered a means of security with the chorus line, "The shelf in the room has been so true/I can hide in the shelf in the room." It is also described as "holding me, and letting me stay." These themes are illustrated through the song's music video.

It was released in 1997 and remains arguably the band's most popular and well known song. The song reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and retained the spot for a then-record sixteen weeks.

"Touch, Peel and Stand" is known for its raw, acoustic feel and maintains considerable radio play to this day. Despite the fact that Travis Meeks writes all songs by Days of the New, and considers it his own personal project, he has praised Matt Taul's cymbal-heavy percussion in the song.

One or more SIC codes can be attributed to a business. SIC codes identify what a business does. Over time there have been several different SIC systems used in the UK. These taxonomies have been adapted to cope with the changes in UK industry. The 1980 system was far more detailed in manufacturing, while the 2007 
system is much stronger in the IT sector. Many companies still use the 2003 codes which were the 1992 system updated slightly. However, the very latest version is the 2007 SIC system[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uksiccodes.com |title=Business Data & Data Enhancing/Appending |publisher=Uksiccodes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/sic2007.shtml |title=SIC codes 2007 - Principal Business Activities |publisher=Companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09[/tpl]

[[Pay in lieu of notice]]

CATEGORIES: United Kingdom labour law, Law in the United Kingdom, Human resource management

In employment law, payment in lieu of notice or PILON is a payment made to an employee by the employer, for a notice period that they have been told by the employer they do not have to work. Even an employee dismissed for gross misconduct is entitled to be paid their notice period and any statutory leave they have accumulated.https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights/taking-holiday-before-leaving-a-job
'In lieu of' means 'in place of', or 'instead of'.https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_lieu
If a notice period -for example, one month- is required for an employer to terminate a contract, a 'payment in lieu of notice' is immediate compensation at an amount equal to that an employee would have earned as salary or wages if they worked through the whole notice period -for example, one month's salary. A payment in lieu will include payment for holiday entitlements, if the employee has them.
PILON can either be set out in the contract as an option for the employer or it may simply be paid to cover any potential damages for breach of contract.
If there is a pay in lieu of notice clause in the employee's contract, the amount the employee will get will normally be set out there. If not, it is up to the employee to agree to an amount. Sometimes the employee may be willing to accept a small amount if it is in his interests to leave early. The amount to be paid will normally cover all salaries that would have been earned during the notice period.
This will normally cover basic pay and may include other things like commission and compensation for the loss of benefits, like personal use of a company car, phone, or medical insurance. The employer might instead decide to give the use of the benefits for the notice period. If the employee doesn't think the amount the employer is offering covers what he would have earned, he can still consider making a breach of contract claim.[tpl]cite web|title=Nidirect government services|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/notice-and-notice-pay|publisher=Crown|accessdate=25 July 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 1947 births, British journalists, Living people, People from Sheffield, English music journalists, British sportswriters, English biographers, Melody Maker writers, The Times people, The Sunday Times people, The Guardian journalists

Richard Williams (born 1947 in Sheffield) is a British music and sports journalist. 
As a writer, then deputy editor, of the weekly rock magazine Melody Maker, he became an influential commentator on the rise of new forms of rock music at the end of the 1960s. Williams and MM, as it was known, helped to promote and contextualise styles such as progressive rock and folk rock.  In particular, Williams wrote several key articles around 1970 which first drew UK audiences' attention to the importance of a then-obscure (and disintegrating) band, The Velvet Underground. Melody Maker was then a magazine which still covered jazz and Williams wrote about the more progressive developments in this field also.
The magazine's serious approach to rock music and culture, under the editorship of Ray Coleman, secured MM a huge circulation by the close of the 1960s and the start of the 1970s. It left New Musical Express, a more pop-oriented weekly, in its wake as MM caught the mood of a new generation of rock followers at a time when the music had transcended its Top 40 roots to become a powerful symbol of social and cultural change. Williams was the most vocal and influential supporter of Bob Marley during the early seventies. He wrote several key features at the Melody Maker which resulted in Marley's first important cover stories.
Williams moved on to new challenges in the early 1970s. Beginning in May 1970, he contributed to The Times, becoming one of the first people to write seriously about any form of popular culture in a newspaper historically associated with the old British establishment, and he continued to write for that paper until October 1989, by which time it had been taken over by Rupert Murdoch and moved to Wapping. He also wrote regularly for Radio Times. His career detoured when he left journalism to join Island Records A&R department in 1973, becoming department head. For two years, he signed and developed artists including Pete Wingfield, Stone Delight, Bryn Haworth and John Cale.  The first presenter of BBC TV's rock show The Old Grey Whistle Test (launched in 1971) while still a member of the MM team, and shortly thereafter its producer, he later became editor of the new London listings guide Time Out and returned to MM as editor from 1978 to 1980.Old Grey Whistle Test DVD Vol 3; Bob Harris speaking before Track 3 
After a period as features editor at The Sunday Times he became editor of the Independent on Sunday's Sunday Review. His music journalism has been gathered in the volume Long Distance Call: Writings on Music and biographies of Bob Dylan (A Man Called Alias), Miles Davis (The Man in the Green Shirt), and Phil Spector (Out of His Head) are among his list of other publications.
Williams remains an active journalist and is the Chief Sports Writer of the UK daily newspaper The Guardian, covering a full array of sports from football to Formula One, cricket to golf. He has written several books on Formula One including The Death of Ayrton Senna, Racers (an analysis of the main participants of the 1996 F1 season), Enzo Ferrari: A Life, and The Last Road Race (a study of the changing balance in Formula One between British and Italian teams, using the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix as the backdrop).

CATEGORIES: Odontaspididae, Fish of the Atlantic Ocean, Fish of the Pacific Ocean, Animals described in 1955

The bigeye sand tiger (Odontaspis noronhai) is an extremely rare species of mackerel shark in the family Odontaspididae, with a possible worldwide distribution. A large, bulky species reaching at least [tpl]convert|3.6|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, the bigeye sand tiger has a long bulbous snout, large orange eyes without nictitating membranes, and a capacious mouth with the narrow teeth prominently exposed. It can be distinguished from the similar smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox) by its teeth, which have only one lateral cusplet on each side, and by its uniformly dark brown color.
Inhabiting continental margins and oceanic waters at depths of [tpl]convert|60|-|1000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], the bigeye sand tiger may make vertical and horizontal migratory movements. It feeds on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.

Like its predecessor, the song reached #1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks in 1998harris|chart=all}}  Artist Chart History - Days of the New Billboard.com. Retrieved August 27, 2008. and is a concert staple. "The Down Town" is also the third track on the band's Definitive Collection released in 2008.
The song is arguably the second most popular single from the band's debut album and certainly one of their most well known songs overall. It is also one of the album's upbeat tracks while bearing an aggressive chorus. Lyrically, "The Down Town" ambiguiously details a town of drug users who are afraid of change and suppressive of the narrator. The phrase "to bring me down" is rebelliously shouted throughout the chorus. A mention of pointless and rejected concern over another person's well being is also addressed during the bridge. Given this theme of negativity, the "Down Town" song title may be intended as a double entendre or pun.

[[Demographic dividend]]

CATEGORIES: Demography, Demographic economics, Demographics, Ageing

Demographic dividend refers to a period – usually 20 to 30 years – when fertility rates fall due to significant reductions in child and infant mortality rates. This fall is often accompanied by an extension in average life expectancy that increases the portion of the population that is in the working age-group. This cuts spending on dependents and spurs economic growth.  As women and families realize that fewer children will die during infancy or childhood, they will begin to have fewer children to reach their desired number of offspring,further reducing the proportion of non-productive dependents.
However, this drop in fertility rates is not immediate. The lag between produces a generational population bulge that surges through society. For a period of time this “bulge” is a burden on society and increases the dependency ratio. Eventually this group begins to enter the productive labor force. With fertility rates continuing to fall and older generations having shorter life expectancies, the dependency ratio declines dramatically. This demographic shift initiates the demographic dividend. With fewer younger dependents, due to declining fertility and child mortality rates, and fewer older dependents, due to the older generations having shorter life expectancies, and the largest segment of the population of productive working age, the dependency ratio declines dramatically leading to the demographic dividend. Combined with effective public policies this time period of the demographic dividend can help facilitate more rapid economic growth and puts less strain on families. This is also a time period when many women enter the labor force for the first time.http://www.economist.com/node/21533364 In many countries this time period has led to increasingly smaller families, rising income, and rising life expectancy rates.http://www.economist.com/node/21533364 However, dramatic social changes can also occur during this time, such as increasing divorce rates, postponement of marriage, and single-person households.http://www.economist.com/node/21533364

The Waddells Mill Pond Site is an archaeological site located seven miles northwest of Marianna, Florida. On December 15, 1972, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. 
This was the site of an important late prehistoric mound and village complex. Archaeological excavations at the site during the 1960s and 1970s revealed two mounds and the remains of a circular fortification. The site is believed to have been abandoned prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the region in 1674.

[[Primitive recursive arithmetic]]
CATEGORIES: Constructivism (mathematics), Formal theories of arithmetic

Primitive recursive arithmetic, or PRA, is a quantifier-free formalization of the natural numbers. It was first proposed by SkolemThoralf Skolem (1923) "The foundations of elementary arithmetic" in Jean van Heijenoort, translator and ed. (1967) From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931. Harvard Univ. Press: 302-33. as a formalization of his finitist conception of the foundations of arithmetic, and it is widely agreed that all reasoning of PRA is finitist. Many also believe that all of finitism is captured by PRA,Tait, W.W. (1981), "Finitism", Journal of Philosophy 78:524-46. but others believe finitism can be extended to forms of recursion beyond primitive recursion, up to ε0,Georg Kreisel (1958) "Ordinal Logics and the Characterization of Informal Notions of Proof," Proc. Internat. Cong. Mathematicians: 289-99. which is the proof-theoretic ordinal of Peano arithmetic.  PRA's proof theoretic ordinal is ωω, where ω is the smallest transfinite ordinal.  PRA is sometimes called Skolem arithmetic.
The language of PRA can express arithmetic propositions involving natural numbers and any primitive recursive function, including the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. PRA cannot explicitly quantify over the domain of natural numbers. PRA is often taken as the basic metamathematical formal system for proof theory, in particular for consistency proofs such as Gentzen's consistency proof of first-order arithmetic.

[[Co-Redemptrix]]
CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic Mariology, Marian dogmas, Catholic terms, Titles of Mary

Co-Redemptrix is an almost entirely Roman Catholic title of Mary, the mother of Jesus and theological concept, which refers to Mary's role in the redemption of man. It has always been controversial and has never formed part of the dogma of the Church.  The term "Co-redemptrix" refers to a subordinate but essential participation by the Blessed Virgin Mary in redemption, notably that she gave free consent to give life to the Redeemer, to share his life, to suffer with him under the cross, to offer his sacrifice to God the Father for the sake of the redemption of mankind. Related to this belief is the concept of Mediatrix which is a separate conceptMark Miravalle, 1993 "With Jesus": the story of Mary Co-redemptrix ISBN 1-57918-241-0 page 11 but regularly included by faithful who use the title of co-redemptrix.
The concept was especially commonly held in the late Middle Ages, when it was especially promoted by many in the Franciscan Order, and often resisted by the Dominicans.  By the early 16th century the hopes of the concept becoming Catholic doctrine had receded, and have never seriously revived.  In more recent times, the title has received some support from the Catholic Magisterium“Therefore, one can say, she is, the Blessed Virgin redeemed with Christ the human race.” Pope Benedict XV, Apostolic Letter Inter soldalica, AAS 1918, 181. There has not been a retraction so far, but nor any equivalent statements since. though it is not included in the concluding chapter of the dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium of the Second Vatican Council, which chapter many theologians hold to be a comprehensive summary of Roman Catholic Mariology.  Some, in particular the adherents of the Amsterdam visions, have petitioned for a dogmatic definition, along with Mediatrix,News Report on the Mediatrix Petition to the Pope but recent high-level comments in the Church have not encouraged these hopes.

Henri Emile Anatole Menier (July 14, 1853 - September 6, 1913) was a French businessman and adventurer and a member of the Menier family of chocolatiers. Born in Paris, he was the son of Emile-Justin Menier and grandson to Antoine Brutus Menier who founded the Menier Chocolate company. On his father's death in 1881, Henri Menier became mayor of Noisiel, an office he held for 32 years until his death in 1913. The beneficiary of a substantial fortune, and having a large annual income from the family business, Henri Menier spent a great deal of his time and money pursuing various leisure interests, notably yachting and auto racing. As the eldest son, Henri Menier was the titular head of the company but the day-to-day management would mostly be left to his very capable brother Gaston.
A member of the governing council of the Yacht Club de France, Menier studied naval architecture and yacht design. He owned several large sailing and steam powered yachts and journeyed to numerous European ports and with his a group of friends including René Waldeck-Rousseau, sailed north to Iceland and Norway. Menier undertook a three-year-long voyage through the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas, the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. He also sailed across the Atlantic Ocean several times to visit a large island property he owned in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada.
When automobiles made their debut, Henri Menier was one of the few who could afford them. He became a racing enthusiast and helped found the Automobile Club de France which would organize the 1906 French Grand Prix, the world's first Grand Prix motor racing event, at the Circuit de la Sarthe, in Le Mans. Menier took part in the 1902 Gordon Bennett Cup Paris to Innsbruck auto race and won the silver medal in the touring car category.
Avid hunters of deer on horseback, Henri Menier and his brothers acquired more than 13,000 acres (53 km²) of forested land in the Picardy region as well as in the Val-d'Oise département where Henri owned a château in the town of  Vauréal. In April 1913 Henri Menier also bought the Château de Chenonceau in France's Loire Valley which today is still owned by family members and is a major tourist attraction.

Joseph Crocker Sibley (February 18, 1850 – May 18, 1926) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Pennsylvania.
Joseph C. Sibley was born in Friendship, New York.  In 1859 he moved with his parents to Boston, New York.  He attended the county schools and the local academies at Springville and Friendship.  He taught school and studied medicine.  He was engaged in the oil-refining business in Franklin, Pennsylvania as co-founder (with his brother-inlaw Charles Miller) of the Galena Oil Company, specializing in high-quality railroad lubricant. Sibley actually landed that contract on an ill-fated trip to Chicago for a meeting with the major railroab barons of the day—he won the contract, but woke up the next day to find himself in the middle of the Great Chicago Fire. Galena was soon to be one of the early acquisitions for John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Company. With his money, Sibley established himself in agricultural circles, particularly as a breeder of fine horses. His wealth also enabled him to launch a political career. He was mayor of Franklin, Pennsylvania, in 1879.thumb|400px|River Ridge Farm in 2009.
Sibley was elected as a Democrat to the Fifty-third Congress.  He was unsuccessful candidate of the Democratic and Populist Parties for reelection in 1894 and for election in 1896.  He was elected as a Democrat to the Fifty-sixth Congress.  He was elected as a Republican to the Fifty-seventh, Fifty-eighth, and Fifty-ninth Congresses.  He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Manufactures during the Fifty-eighth and Fifty-ninth Congresses.  He declined renomination in 1906.  He was nominated for Congress in 1910, but declined to make the campaign because of ill health.  He served as chairman of the Republican State convention in 1902. He resumed his former manufacturing and agricultural pursuits, and died at his home, “River Ridge Farm,”near Franklin, Pennsylvania, in 1926. Interment in Franklin Cemetery.

[[Ancien Régime]]

CATEGORIES: Ancien Régime in France, Early Modern period, French monarchy

The Ancien Régime ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɑ̃.sjɛ̃ ʁeˈʒim[/tpl], Old or Former Regime) was the monarchic, aristocratic, social and political system established in the Kingdom of France from approximately the 15th century until the later 18th century ("early modern France") under the late Valois and Bourbon dynasties. The administrative and social structures of the Ancien Régime were the result of years of state-building, legislative acts (like the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts), internal conflicts and civil wars, but they remained a confusing patchwork of local privilege and historic differences until the French Revolution ended the system.
Much of the medieval political centralization of France had been lost in the Hundred Years' War, and the Valois Dynasty's attempts at re-establishing control over the scattered political centres of the country were hindered by the Wars of Religion. Much of the reigns of Henry IV, Louis XIII and the early years of Louis XIV were focused on administrative centralisation. Despite, however, the notion of "absolute monarchy" (typified by the king's right to issue lettres de cachet) and the efforts by the kings to create a centralized state, Ancien Régime France remained a country of systemic irregularities: administrative (including taxation), legal, judicial, and ecclesiastic divisions and prerogatives frequently overlapped, while the French nobility struggled to maintain their own rights in the matters of local government and justice, and powerful internal conflicts (like the Fronde) protested against this centralization.
The need for centralization in this period was directly linked to the question of royal finances and the ability to wage war. The internal conflicts and dynastic crises of the 16th and 17th centuries (the Wars of Religion, the conflict with the Habsburgs) and the territorial expansion of France in the 17th century demanded great sums which needed to be raised through taxes, such as the taille and the gabelle and by contributions of men and service from the nobility.
One key to this centralization was the replacing of personal "clientele" systems organized around the king and other nobles by institutional systems around the state.[tpl]harvnb|Major|1994|pp=xx–xxi[/tpl] The creation of the Intendants—representatives of royal power in the provinces—did much to undermine local control by regional nobles. The same was true of the greater reliance shown by the royal court on the "noblesse de robe" as judges and royal counselors. The creation of regional parlements had initially the same goal of facilitating the introduction of royal power into newly assimilated territories, but as the parlements gained in self-assurance, they began to be sources of disunity.

[[Independent National Party (Luxembourg)]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct political parties in Luxembourg, Conservative parties in Luxembourg, Political parties established in 1918

The Independent National Party ([tpl]lang-lb|Onofhängeg Nationalpartei[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fr|Parti national indépendant[/tpl], [tpl]lang-de|Unabhängige Nationalpartei[/tpl]), abbreviated as PNI, was a populist political party in Luxembourg in the interwar period.
The party was founded in 1918 by disgruntled members of the Party of the Right.Thewes (2003), p. 91  The most prominent of the founders was Pierre Prüm, who was appointed the party's leader.  The constitutional amendments of 1919 introduced universal suffrage and proportional representation, strengthening the new populists' chance of winning both votes and seats.  In the first election after the reforms, the party won three seats (out of 48) in the Chamber of Deputies, finishing a distant fourth; the dominant Party of the Right won 27 seats, allowing it to form the only stand-alone government in Luxembourgian history.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chd.lu/fr/chambre/periodes/default.jsp |title=Périodes parlementaires |accessdate=2006-08-16 |publisher=Chamber of Deputies |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060814074052/http://www.chd.lu/fr/chambre/periodes/default.jsp  |archivedate = 2006-08-14[/tpl]
In the election of 1922, the PNI increased its share to four seats, but fell back to three in the 1925 election.  More importantly, the Party of the Right fell below the 50% threshold, allowing the other parties to form a broad-based coalition against the conservatives.  The coalition relied upon almost all minor parties giving their support to pass measures of confidence, but included members of only three party lists: the Independent National Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Independent Left.Thewes (2003), p. 89  The head of the coalition was the leader of the PNI, Prüm, even though the party was only the joint-fourth largest party in the Chamber of Deputies.
In 1926, the government attempted to reward the support offered by the Socialist Party by improving minimum working conditions.  However, this was opposed by the Radical Socialists, a party that was born from the Liberal League and maintained its predecessor's support for business and the middle classes.  In opposition, the Radical Socialists withdrew their support from the coalition, leaving the government short of a majority.  To avoid a humiliating motion of no confidence, Prüm offered his resignation on 22 June,Thewes (2003), p. 90 and left politics to become a judge.  At the next election, without Prüm, the PNI's share of the vote was slashed, and the party won only one seat.  In the 1931 election, the party lost that solitary seat, and was dissolved.
Many of the Independent National Party's members, including Prüm, would later become associated with the Volksdeutsche Bewegung: a collaborationist Nazi party that governed during the German occupation.

[[List of whale vocalizations]]
CATEGORIES: Cetacean-related lists, Whale sounds

Whale vocalizations are the sounds made by whales to communicate. The word "song" is used in particular to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales (notably the humpback) in a way that is reminiscent of human singing.
Humans produce sound by expelling air through the larynx. The vocal cords within the larynx open and close as necessary to separate the stream of air into discrete pockets of air. These pockets are shaped by the throat, tongue, and lips into the desired sound.
Cetacean sound production differs markedly from this mechanism. The precise mechanism differs in the two major suborders of cetaceans: the Odontoceti (toothed whales—including dolphins) and the Mysticeti (baleen whales—including the largest whales, such as the blue whale).

The Catafalque of Philip IV of Spain was a large  temporary catafalque built on the death of Philip IV of Spain in 1665  in the nave of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, Italy.
Designed by architect Carlo Rainaldi and executed by many anonymous Roman artists and carpenters, the catafalque was an immense painted wooden construction, nearly reaching the flat ceiling of the basilica. A portrait of Philip was attached to the front of the catafalque; on other sides there were other festoons mixed with skulls. An outsized crown topped the monument. Octagonal in shape, its four levels were covered in glowing candles. The windows of the basilica were covered and drapes hung from the nave's columns, with the intention of creating a rather eerie effect, although this is not immediately apparent from the accompanying engraving. However, a contemporary report notes that during the hours of darkness the whole church seemed like "a serene night time sky in which shone many bright stars." Clemente Tosi, Relatione delle sontuose esequie fatte dall’Illustriss. e Reverendiss. Capitolo, e Canonici della Sacrosanto Basilica di S.Maria Maggiore in Roma alla gloriosa memoria di Filippo Quarto Re delle Spagne ..., Rome, 1666,
However, Philip IV died in Spain, so unlike traditional catafalques, the monument housed no cadaver. This was a common occurrence in seventeenth-century Rome, where the deaths of various Catholic kings and queens were 'celebrated' with such temporary monuments.
Philip had died on 17 September 1665. The catafalque took a few months to create for it was not until 11 December of the same year that there was an official ceremony related to the catafalque's construction. A procession was held, ending at Santa Maria Maggiore, where a noted Jesuit, Ignazio Bompiani, gave an oration, accompanied by suitable music.
Santa Maria Maggiore was occasionally used as the site for events relating to the Spanish crown. Both Philip IV and his father, Philip III of Spain, had been benefactors to the church, hence the desire of the basilica’s clerics to sponsor such a monument

Once inside, the patron had access to coffee, the company of others, various discussions, pamphlets, bulletins, newspapers, and the latest news and gossip. Reporters called "runners" went around to the coffeehouses announcing the latest news, perhaps not too unlike what we might hear on the TV or the radio today.Pelzer, J. and L. The English Coffee Houses.  December 1, 2003
This environment attracted an eclectic group of people who met and mingled with each other at these coffeehouses. In a society that placed such a high importance on class and economic status, the coffeehouses were unique because the patrons were people from all levels of society.Boulton, William B. The Amusements of Old London.  London: Ballantyne, Hanson & Co., 1901. Anyone who had a penny could come inside. Students from the universities also frequented the coffeehouses, sometimes even spending more time at the shops than at school.Ellis, Aytoun. The Penny Universities; A History of the Coffee-houses.  London, Secker & Warburg, 1956.
Since that time, various coffee shops all over the world have used the name "Penny University".
The original sense of a coffee house probably grew out of a common experience: that one came out of a coffeehouse feeling more intelligent or enlightened than when entering (as  Montesquieu observed in The Persian Letters). As, indeed, wide-ranging conversations ensued therein, from the commercial (leading to the founding of, in London, Lloyd's of London, and in New York, the New York Stock Exchange) to the political, and the purely intellectual; the idea that one could acquire an education for the price of a cup of coffee, that is, a penny, took hold of the poetic imagination.

[[Lesley M. M. Blume]]

CATEGORIES: American children's writers, Year of birth missing (living people), Living people

Lesley M. M. Blume is an award-winning journalist, author, and cultural observer based in New York City.
The daughter of a classical pianist and a journalist, she followed her father’s footsteps into the newsroom, beginning her career at The Jordan Times in Amman and Cronkite Productions in New York City. She later became an off-air reporter and researcher for ABC News Nightline with Ted Koppel in Washington, D.C., where she helped cover the historic presidential election in 2000, the 9/11 attacks, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a myriad of other events and topics.
Now writing full-time, Ms. Blume contributes regularly to Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal and Departures magazine; her work has appeared in many additional publications, including Vogue, The Paris Review Daily, Slate, and The Daily Beast, among others.  Ms. Blume also co-created and served as founding editor of The Window, Barneys New York’s online fashion and culture magazine.
She is currently working on her first major biography, detailing Ernest Hemingway’s early years in Paris and the real-life story behind his iconic debut novel, The Sun Also Rises. The book will be released in 2016 by Eamon Dolan Books/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, to commemorate the          90th anniversary of the publication of The Sun Also Rises.
In 2010, Chronicle Books released Let’s Bring Back, Ms. Blume’s cultural encyclopedia celebrating hundreds of forgotten-yet-delightful objects, pastimes, fashions, delectables, and personalities from bygone eras. It was deemed “whimsical … comical … and delightful” by The New Yorker and many other publications. Following the success of this initial volume, Chronicle released a top-selling series of topic-specific new editions of Let’s Bring Back – including Let’s Bring Back: The Cocktail Edition (fall 2012) and Let’s Bring Back: The Lost Language Edition (spring 2013), as well as a line of ancillary products.  She also co-created a line of Let’s Bring Back-inspired jewelry in collaboration with renowned design house Lulu Frost.
In addition, Ms. Blume is the author of It Happened Here (Thornwillow Press, 2011), a book detailing the raucous social history of New York City’s St. Regis Hotel. The book is the first volume of Thornwillow’s new “Libretto series,” which will showcase the work of literary lions past and present, including Peter Matthiessen and Lewis Lapham. Ms. Blume has also collaborated on a variety of book projects with acclaimed photographers, including Vogue contributors Claiborne Swanson Frank (American Beauty, 2011) and Stephan Wurth (Ghost Town, 2011).
For the amusement of children, Ms. Blume has authored three critically acclaimed novels, all published by Knopf. Her debut novel, Cornelia and the Audacious Escapades of the Somerset Sisters, has sold over 300,000 copies.  Upon the release of her third children’s novel, Tennyson, reviewers compared her to writers Flannery O’Connor, Eudora Welty, and Truman Capote (“Brilliant, unusual writing.”—The Chicago Tribune). Ms. Blume’s first collection of short stories for children, Modern Fairies, Dwarves, Goblins, and Other Nasties, was released in 2010; her second collection – The Wondrous Journals of Wendell Wellington Wiggins – debuted in fall 2012.  Knopf will release her next children’s novel in spring 2015.
Vogue recently picked Ms. Blume as a founding member of the Vogue 100, an organization of “influential decision makers and opinion leaders known for their distinctive taste in fashion and culture, who personify the rising influence of women over the past several decades.” Her individualistic personal style has been showcased in many publications, including Vanity Fair; Elle; O, The Oprah Magazine; Women’s Wear Daily; Style.com; and the websites of American Vogue and Vogue Italia.
Ms. Blume studied history at Williams College, Oxford University, and Cambridge University, where she was a Herchel Smith scholar.  
She lives in Greenwich Village with her family.

It is set in Israel and follows the formula set by Die Hard rather closely.  Additionally, the last act of the film also borrows heavily from the U.S. blockbuster, Speed, released just two years earlier.
Dutton Hatfield, played by Jeff Speakman, is working for the American embassy. He finds himself inside a biochemical weapon laboratory when terrorists headed by Colonel Baron (played by TimeCop villain Ron Silver) take over the place. Baron is looking for a sample of a deadly virus that is being developed inside the facility.

[[Cordance]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroimaging

Cordance is a QEEG method, developed in Los Angeles in the 1990s,[tpl]cite web|last=Leuchter|first=Andrew and Cook,Ian|title=Method and Apparatus for determining...|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5309923|work=Expired US Patent|publisher=US Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=24 March 2013[/tpl]
[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S0925-4927(99)00006-2[/tpl] 
which combines complementary information from absolute (the amount of power in a frequency band at a given electrode) and relative power (the percentage of power contained in a frequency band relative to the total spectrum) of EEG spectra.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.eurpsy.2008.03.001[/tpl]
Cordance is a measure of regional brain activity.  It is computed using quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) measures of brain wave patterns in an algorithm developed at the UCLA Laboratory of Brain, Behavior, and Pharmacology by Drs. Andrew Leuchter and Ian Cook.
The cordance algorithm includes steps of (a) reattribution of EEG power,[tpl]cite web|last=Cordance|title=Cordance Montage Figure 600x600|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CordanceMontage600x600.png|publisher=Wikimedia Commons|accessdate=24 March 2013[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|last=Cordance|title=Cordance Montage Figure 3000x3000|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CordanceMontage3000x3000.png|publisher=Wikimedia Commons|accessdate=24 March 2013[/tpl] (b) spatial normalization of absolute and relative power, and (c) combination of the transformed absolute and transformed relative power to yield the cordance values themselves.
In comparison with other QEEG measures, such as absolute power or relative power, cordance appears to have a superior correlation [tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S0925-4927(99)00006-2[/tpl] with regional brain perfusion, one of the other standard measures of regional brain activity.  Because cordance is derived from EEG signals, assessments of brain function with cordance do not require the use of radioactive tracer molecules, as is the case with some other functional neuroimaging methods (PET or SPECT scanning).
Cordance has been applied to studying brain activity in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.  A major area of study has been major depressive disorder, in efforts to develop biomarkers that could help guide treatment.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S0893-133X(02)00294-4[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.jpsychires.2004.12.002[/tpl] [tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.06.006[/tpl] [tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.pscychresns.2009.04.011[/tpl] [tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1600-0447.2010.01560.x[/tpl]  This line of work was begun in the mid 1990s at UCLA and is now the subject of replication studies at other medical centers.[tpl]cite doi|10.1017/S0033291709991619[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Newcastle United F.C. managers, Scottish football managers, Year of death missing, Year of birth missing

Frank Watt was the first unofficial manager of Newcastle United Football Club. A former referee, Watt was appointed secretary in December 1895 and held the position until 1935. He did not control the team's selection, so technically he was not the manager. Newcastle’s first official manager was Andy Cunningham in 1930. Before this the club was run by a committee, overseen by the club secretary. The modern manager role was unheard of. Watt was also a member of the committee that owned the club at the time. He was very influential, referred to as "The Guv'nor". He was a portly figure with a handlebar moustache. 
A Scotsman, Watt's first involvement in football came with the 3rd E.R.V. club in Edinburgh, the precursor of the former league side St Bernard's, where he combined his playing role with that of club secretary. He was later appointed secretary of the Edinburgh (later East of Scotland) Football Association before leaving for Tyneside.St.Bernard's Part 1[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]
During his time at Newcastle, the club won the old First Division four times, in 1905, 1907, 1909 and 1927. They won the FA Cup three times, in 1910, 1924 and (with Andy Cunningham as official manager) 1932 and were finalists on 4 occasions, in 1905, 1906, 1908 and 1911.
Watt had great ambitions for Newcastle. Upon arrival he declared "We’re going to be the best team in the country." The Edwardian Newcastle side dominated the league with a side assembled entirely by Watt, who also signed players such as Hughie Gallacher, Colin Veitch and Stan Seymour throughout his 37 years at the club, players who are still considered legends today. However he initially turned down Stan Seymour, explaining that the future Mr. Newcastle was “too small to play football”.

CATEGORIES: Military engineering vehicles, Armoured fighting vehicles of Serbia, VTI - Military Technical Institute Belgrade

VIU-55 Munja (en: Lightning) is a combat engineering vehicle produced by Serbia. VTI has done the conceptual design of the Munja general-purpose engineer vehicle and the Čačak-based Overhaul Depot has built the vehicle. The main idea was converting the T-55 tank, using its main structure and subsystems and adding new components, equipment and devices to create a vehicle for entirely different purposes. Good terrain negotiating ability and ballistic protection of T-55 tank were retained, while engineer equipment and armament were refitted. It is the first armoured vehicle for the engineer corps outfitted with special purpose engineer equipment and respectable armament, belonging to the most modern designs of this kind. It is designed to negotiate natural and man-made obstacles, blocking, fortifying and repair of roads and for safe transport of engineer teams and equipment in combat conditions. VTI designers have thoughtfully arranged accommodation for 8 members of the crew (2 permanent members – driver and deputy commander, also gunner of the 30 mm automatic grenade launcher and 7.62 mm machine gun, and a 6-member troop – commander and section of five pioneers). Space is also provided for sets of engineer equipment, for mounting of commander’s and gunner’s cupola and associated equipment. 
Space needed to accommodate personnel and sets of special equipment was obtained by removing tank turret, cutting away section of hull roof plate and by refitting of superstructure
consisting of armour plates and sheet metal that provides adequate ballistic protection of on-board crew and equipment. Armour plates are up to 25 mm thick and mounted so as to provide ballistic protection from 12.7 mm (.5in) bullets. Horizontal roof plate of superstructure is made of several sections to provide necessary hatches. Openings are provided for fitting of commander’s and gunner’s cupolas, two access and evacuation hatches for engineer section, holes for radio set antenna, rotating periscope, driver’s cover, refueling port and two lookout ports (for observation and for firing personal weapons). To perform engineering tasks, a tankgrade blade it fitted at the front, equipped with electric motor, pump and hydraulics. Blade assembly is an autonomous unit that can be quickly and easily attached to the hull. Vehicle firepower consists of one 30 mm automatic grenade launcher and one machine gun (M84, .3in/7.62 mm calibre). Vehicle concept permits fitting of weapons group station consisting of a 30 mm gun, 7.62 mm machine gun, antitank wire guided rockets and 30 mm automatic grenade launcher with appropriate optoelectronic fire control system. To protect the crew from nuclear and chemical agents a modified nuclear-chemical protection unit is built-in, consisting of anti radiation fan. This is automatically activated in case of nuclear shock wave. Protection from shaped charges consists of very effective skirts.
For masking protection, Munja was designed for protection in all ranges of electromagnetic spectrum (visual, close IR, radar and thermal parts of the spectrum). For masking and jamming of guided projectiles, the vehicle is equipped with smoke canisters' launcher and control panel identical to those mounted on M-84 tanks. Smoke charge launchers are mounted in front section of tracks covering plates. Munja integrates all equipment needed for specific engineering combat missions (crossing of artificial obstacles, making of barriers, road making and fortifying). Owing to modern positioning system, Munja can be tracked on virtual map while newly developed software enables the use of advanced computer technologies in the execution of engineering works. 
In parallel with development of Munja, engineer units were supplied with combat sets of specialist pioneer equipment which also ranks among the best in that category. To prevent fuel explosions and resulting fires in the event of penetration of ballistic protection, a fuel explosion and fire prevention system has been fitted. It is autonomous, provided with UV and IR sensors with detection and activation time measured as thousands of a second. Mobility of Munja engineer vehicle is at the level of T-55 tank but it could be further improved by retrofit of higher power engine and modern transmission, in particular of the MPG-780 modular power pack featuring the engine developing 580 kW (780 HP). Power pack is replaceable in field conditions. General purpose engineer vehicle Munja can be well used in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The existing model represents the base for development of a family of tracked armoured combat vehicles; in particular of armoured personnel carrier possessing considerably higher level of all-round ballistic protection compared to current conventional APC-s and IFV-s.

National Air Transport was a large United States airline. It was the first airline to operate cross country flights.http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-biz-united-airlines-national-air-transport,0,5246830.photo In 1930 it was bought by Boeing. The Air Mail Act of 1934 prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella, so Boeing split into three smaller companies, one of which is United Airlines, and it is this that included what had previously been National Air Transport.

Donkey rides are a traditional feature of seaside resorts in England. Children are allowed to ride donkeys on a sandy beach for a fee in summer months while on holiday, normally led in groups at walking pace. Typically the donkeys used have their names on their harnesses so they could be identified by children and parents alike.
In Bridlington donkey rides have been available since 1895.
The tradition started in Victorian times, but is now much less popular. It is probable that the donkeys offered to ride on were originally working draught animals in the cockle industries around the coast.

CATEGORIES: Boston Red Sox, People from Boston, Massachusetts, American people of Irish descent, Saloonkeepers

Michael T. "Nuf Ced" McGreevy was the leader of the most vocal fans of the Boston Americans (now the Boston Red Sox), today known as the "Royal Rooters". McGreevy owned the Third Base Saloon, which got its name because, like third base, it was the last stop before home. His saloon was Boston's original sports bar - it was decorated in a baseball theme, with pictures of the players, and a scoreboard on the outside wall. His nickname "Nuf Ced" was given to him because that was what he usually shouted to end barroom disputes, usually about the Boston Americans and the Boston Braves.
McGreevy amassed a rich collection of photographs, clippings, and other baseball memorabilia. When Prohibition forced McGreevy to close Third Base, he donated his collection to the Boston Public Library. Author Glenn Stout (A Red Sox Century) helped popularize the collection when he worked at the library.
The theme song of the "Royal Rooters" was "Tessie" from the Broadway musical "The Silver Slipper". McGreevy was immortalized in a 2004 remake of the song by the Irish American punk band Dropkick Murphys. It subsequently was part of the soundtrack of the movie Fever Pitch concerning fans of the 2004 season of the Red Sox.
In 2008, Dropkick Murphys bassist Ken Casey re-opened Third Base, although it is no longer known as such.  Now the tavern is known as McGreevy's and can be converted to open-air.  There is also a sign on the front of the bar that says "1200 Steps to Fenway Park."  It is on Boylston Street and is right across the street from the Hynes Convention Center located in the Back Bay of Boston.

[[Economy]]

CATEGORIES: Economic systems, Economics, Economies

An economy or economic system consists of the production, distribution or trade, and  consumption of limited goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. The economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency.
In the past, economic activity was theorized to be bounded by natural resources, labor, and capital. This view ignores the value of technology (automation, accelerator of process, reduction of cost functions), and innovation (new products, services, processes, new markets, expands markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions), especially that which produces intellectual property.
A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure and legal systems, as well as its geography, natural resource endowment, and ecology, as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions.
A market-based economy is where goods and services are produced without obstruction or interference, and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants (economic agents) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency and at some free market or market clearing price. Capital and labor can move freely to any area of emerging shortage, signaled by rising price, and thus dynamically and automatically relieve any such threat. Market based economies require transparency on information, such as true prices, to work, and may include various kinds of immaterial production, such as affective labor that describes work carried out that is intended to produce or modify emotional experiences in people, but does not have a tangible, physical product as a result.
A command-based economy is where a central political agent commands what is produced and how it is sold and distributed. Shortages are common problems with a command-based economy, as there is no mechanism to manage the information (prices) about the systems natural supply and demand dynamics.

Insiders say the controversy was part of his attempt to amass a power base at his rivals' expense.  In 2002, Druyun, an Air Force procurement czar looking to move to the private sector, was possibly the most sought-after executive-to-be in the aerospace industry. With her understanding of the Pentagon procurement process and her contacts, Boeing, and most of its rivals, tried hard to land her. James F. Albaugh, a front-runner in the Boeing CEO race and head of Boeing's Integrated Defense Systems, talked with her at least once under the assumption that she had recused herself from contract negotiations with Boeing, but he came up dry. It was only when Sears went back for one last try that Boeing had a deal, according to e-mail released as part of the criminal investigation of Sears and Druyun. That coup gave Sears a huge advantage over both Albaugh and Mulally. It also had the potential to expand his power base by making Druyun an ally. Sears previously declined to comment through an attorney and could not be reached for this story.[/tpl]

Svensky Monastery (Russian: Свенский монастырь) is a Russian Orthodox monastery located at the confluence of the Desna and Svin Rivers, three miles from Bryansk, Russia. The monastery was originally known as Svinsky, after the Svin River, but the spelling was subsequently changed to Svensky, because "svinsky" also means "of the swine" in Russian.  
Church legends attribute the monastery's foundation to Prince Roman of Bryansk, who was reportedly buried there. As the legend has it, the monastery was founded to mark the place where a miraculous icon of the Theotokos appeared to Roman, the second son of St. Mikhail of Chernigov, and cured him of blindness. A tree where it was found, was chopped down to be used for icon painting. 
The miraculous icon represents the Theotokos Panachrantos with SS. Anthony and Theodosius. It is popularly attributed to the most celebrated icon-painter of Kievan Rus, St. Alypius from the Kiev Pechersk Monastery. Nikodim Kondakov supposed that the icon was modeled on a mosaic from the central conch of the Assumption Cathedral in the Pechersk Monastery.
In the 16th century, the monastery was repeatedly sacked by the Crimean Tatars. After one such raid, Ivan the Terrible donated funds sufficient to build a cathedral of five domes, a refectory church, and a belltower. The cathedral doors of rare craftsmanship were endowed by Prince Ivan Mstislavsky. The church of SS. Anthony and Theodosius was started on 19 May 1566; its vaults suffered a collapse a year later but were restored.
After Russia gained the Left-bank Ukraine by the Treaty of Andrusovo, the liveliest fair in the region was held annually underneath the walls of the Svensky Monastery, then run by ethnic Ukrainians, such as John Maksymovych, the future Archbishop of Chernigov. Its ties with the Kiev Pechersk Lavra were so close that in 1682 the Svensky Monastery was transformed into a branch of the lavra, its name changed from Svensky to New Pechersk monastery.
During this period of Ukrainian domination, Cossack Baroque was liberally applied to its buildings. The Presentation Church, rising in three towers above the main entrance to the abbey, was erected in the late 1680s in the simplified Ukrainian Baroque style. The main cathedral was rebuilt in the Baroque style in 1715. The ancient clocktower was built up to the height of 42 meters. The Saviour Church over the fair gates was constructed in five levels, ringed by a gallery, in 1742. The walls of the monastery were erected between 1749 and 1769. thumb|285px|The monastery in the 19th century.
On 30 July 1749 work started on the new cathedral, which was to be modeled on the New Cathedral of the Donskoi Monastery in Moscow. It is believed that its design was commissioned from Ivan Fyodorovich Michurin, who had supervised construction of St Andrew's Church of Kiev. The cathedral of the Svensky Monastery was reminiscent of another structure ascribed to Michurin — St. Clement's Church in Zamoskvorechye. A seven-tier Baroque iconostasis from the old cathedral was carefully preserved and assembled in the new structure before it was consecrated in 1758.
There was no new construction in the monastery after that. In the 19th century, the cloister declined, especially after the fair had been moved to Bryansk in 1864. A garden of cedars, chestnuts, and cherry-trees was planted to mark its historical location. The Bolsheviks closed the monastery in 1926. Its valuables were expropriated, while the miraculous icon of the Theotokos was given to the Tretyakov Gallery. Michurin's cathedral was blown up; the Church of SS. Anthony and Theodosius (the oldest in the complex) reduced to rubble; the house where Peter the Great stayed before the Battle of Poltava torn down. It was not until the late 1980s that conservation works on the remaining structures started. The monks were readmitted into the monastery in 1992.

[[Island growth]]
CATEGORIES: Thin film deposition

Island growth is a physical model of deposited film growth and chemical vapor deposition. 
Consider a situation where atoms are being deposited onto a flat surface at a very slow rate.  The first atom deposited undergoes a random walk on the surface.  Eventually a second atom is deposited and can be expected to eventually meet the first atom, given enough time.  Once the two atoms meet they may bond to form a particle with a higher mass and a lower random walk velocity.  Because the bonded particles are now more stable and less mobile than before, they are called an "island".  Subsequent atoms deposited on the substrate eventually meet and bond with the island, further increasing its size and stability.  Eventually the island can grow to fill the entire substrate with a single large grain.
If atoms are being deposited at a faster rate, there will be many atoms present on the substrate before any large stable islands form.  As these atoms meet, they will bond to their local neighbors before having the chance to migrate to a distant island.  In this way a large number of separate islands are formed and can grow independently.  Eventually the separate islands will grow to become separate grains in the final film.
The island growth model is used to explain how fast deposition techniques (such as sputter deposition) can produce films with many randomly oriented grains, whereas slow deposition techniques (such as MBE) tend to produce larger grains with more uniform structure.

[[Coupling (piping)]]

CATEGORIES: Piping, Plumbing

A coupling (or coupler) (used in piping or plumbing) is a very short length of pipe or tube, with a socket at one or both ends that allows two pipes or tubes to be joined, welded (steel), brazed or soldered (copper, brass etc.) together.
Alternatively it is a short length of pipe with two female National pipe threads (NPT) (in North American terms, a coupler is a double female while a nipple is double male) or two male or female British standard pipe threads.
If the two ends of a coupling are different (e.g. one BSP threaded and one NPT threaded), then it is usually referred to as an adapter. Another variation is one plain socket and one threaded socket. Yet another variation would be 3/4" NPT to 1/2" NPT.
When the two ends use the same connection method but are of a different size, the terms reducing coupling or reducer are used.

The Preseli transmitting station (also spelt Presely) is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility, situated close to the village of Crymych, in Pembrokeshire, Wales ([tpl]gbmapping|SN172306[/tpl]). It is owned and operated by Arqiva.
It has a [tpl]convert|235.4|m|ft|0[/tpl] high guyed steel lattice mast. It was constructed in 1962 by the IBA to transmit ITV 405-line television with transmissions commencing on Band III channel 8 from antennas at [tpl]convert|1835|ft|m|0|disp=flip|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level. The triangle of antenna arrays aimed beams of signal towards Pembrokeshire, another lobe was directed towards western Carmarthenshire and a northward beam covered south western Ceredigion. The northward beam from the site also fed the transmitter at Arfon in North Wales.
The Welsh region ITV programming was initially provided by Teledu Cymru which was taken over by TWW in 1964, and eventually HTV Wales who took over from 1968.
In 1971, three protesters from Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg were jailed for "conspiring to trespass" after gaining access to the site compound and climbing the lower section of the mast. This was part of a series of protests in Wales aiming to get a dedicated Welsh-language TV channel established. The campaign was eventually considered to have been mostly successful with the establishment of S4C (Sianel 4 Cymru) eleven years later.
The site was uprated in 1973http://txlib.mb21.co.uk/main.php?g2_itemId=2209&g2_imageViewsIndex=3 to transmit UHF 625-line PAL analogue television channels, starting with BBC1, BBC2 and HTV Wales, with S4C being added in late 1982. The VHF channel 8 transmissions were discontinued in January 1985 as 405-line TV in the UK was phased out. Channel 5 started analogue TV transmissions in 1997. Six digital TV multiplexes were added in 1998 and the site kept this configuration until 2009 when all analogue television signals were permanently switched-off.
The mast also carries Classic FM on 100.5 MHz and Real Radio on 105.7 MHz, and transmits national digital radio multiplexes for the BBC and Digital One multiplexes.

[[Stray Dog Café]]
CATEGORIES: Bakery cafés, Restaurants in Russia, Restaurants established in 1911

The Stray Dog ([tpl]lang-ru|Бродя́чая соба́ка[/tpl]) (aka Stray Dog Cellar, Stray Dog Cabaret and the Society for Intimate Theatre) was located at Ploshchad Isskustv, Square of the Arts up to Summer Gardens, St. Petersburg, Russia.
The Stray Dog Café was a meeting place for famous writers and poets during the early 20th century.  The Acmeist poets (Nikolay Gumilyov, Mandelstam, Mikhail Kuzmin, etc.) gathered there to discuss theories of literature, give poetry readings, and perform theatre.  They considered themselves "'stray dogs' shunted aside by proper aristocratic society", which led to the name. The cafe was in disrepair for many years and reopened in 2001.Frommer's review
Run by proprietor Boris Pronin, out of the cellar of the Dashkov mansion. It opened New Year's Eve, 1911 and was shut down by the authorities in 1915.Ljudmila Shtern & Joseph Brodsky 2004. Brodsky: a personal memoir. Baskerville Publishers, Inc. s. 279. ISBN 978-1-880909-70-6 Its closing was linked to the start of World War I. A key locale for the followers of the emerging acmeist and futurist literary movements, the Stray Dog clientele rejected the symbolist school of thought.
The previous salon for St. Petersburg poets had been the Tower. This was the apartment of the symbolist poet Vyacheslav Ivanov, who was also responsible for influencing Meyerhold's use of theatre. Many of these poets later became patrons of the Stray Dog.
Poets/performers at the Stray Dog Café included Anna Akhmatova, her husband Nikolay Gumilyov, Velimir Khlebnikov, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Marina Tsvetaeva, Boris Pasternak, Sergei Esenin, Mikhail Kuzmin, Osip Mandelstam, and Alexander Blok.

Who Are You, Polly Maggoo? ([tpl]lang-fr|Qui êtes vous, Polly Maggoo?[/tpl]) is a 1966 French film directed by William Klein.
It is a satirical art house movie spoofing the fashion world and its excesses. It stars Dorothy McGowan as supermodel Polly Maggoo being followed by a French television crew. It also stars Grayson Hall as Miss Maxwell, a fashion magazine editor modeled after Diana Vreeland, and Philippe Noiret as the TV reporter and director. Also appearing in the film are Jean Rochefort, Sami Frey and Alice Sapritch.
McGowan, the Brooklyn-born star and one-time Vogue cover girl in 1962, was one of William Klein's favorite models. After the release of the film, which was McGowan's first and only film role, she disappeared from public view and apparently neither acted nor modeled again, according to Klein.

He created the well-known economic theory regarding skill complementarities called Kremer's O-Ring Theory of Economic Development.
Kremer proposed one of the most convincing explanations for the phenomenon of the World System population hyperbolic growth observed prior to the early 1970s, as well as the economic mechanisms of the demographic transition.

Moose Mountain (elev. [tpl]convert|2437|m|ft|0[/tpl]) is a mountain located [tpl]convert|19|km|mi|0[/tpl] west of Bragg Creek, Alberta in Kananaskis Country. 
The peak is a popular hiking objective for many within this area. This is due to the relatively easy maintained trail that makes its way to the summit and its close proximately to the major urban area of Calgary. It is not uncommon for a dozen or more people to reach the summit on weekends within the summer months.  
Resembling a resting moose on the horizon, the peak was named Moose Mountain in 1949. A Forestry Service fire lookout exists upon the summit, the third building to have occupied the site for this purpose since the first was built in 1929.
Some scenes in the movie Brokeback Mountain were shot on and around Moose Mountain.[tpl]fact|date=April 2011[/tpl]
Members of the public who summit are requested to respect the privacy of the fire lookout staff. As many as 8000 visitors, local and international, are recorded each season. The lookout staff are responsible for over 5000 square kilometres of forest. The lookout staff detects, maps and reports forest fires to a central location, initiating fire suppression. In consideration of the quantity of visitors and the importance of attentiveness of the staff, it is critical that they not be distracted from their duties.
Members of the public are requested to be conscious of inclement weather, and act accordingly. It is NOT recommended to be above the tree line during pending or active lightning storms. Precaution must be taken in view of the active helicopter landing pad, located on the west side of the summit. (Submitted by a former Moose Mountain Lookout Employee)

William Klein (born April 19, 1928) is an American-born French photographer and filmmaker noted for his ironic approach[tpl]cite web |publisher= Masters of Photography|url= http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/klein/klein_articles1.html|title= William Klein|work=Photography of the 20th Century|accessdate= 2010-01-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher= Masters of Photography|url= http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/klein/klein_articles2.html|title= Text by John Heilpern|work=William Klein: Photographs|accessdate= 2010-01-06[/tpl] to both media and his extensive use of unusual photographic techniques in the context of photojournalism and fashion photography. He was ranked 25th on Professional Photographer's list of 100 most influential photographers.[tpl]cite web |publisher= Professional Photographer Magazine|url= http://www.professionalphotographer.co.uk/magazine/photographic-inspiration/100-most-influential-photographers-of-all-time|title= Professional Photographer Magazine|work=Top 100 Most influential photographers Century|accessdate= 2012-01-28[/tpl]
Trained as a painter, Klein studied under Fernand Léger and found early success with exhibitions of his work. However, he soon moved on to photography and achieved widespread fame as a fashion photographer for Vogue and for his photo essays on various cities. Despite having no training as a photographer, Klein won the Prix Nadar in 1957 for New York, a book of photographs taken during a brief return to his hometown in 1954. Klein's work was considered revolutionary for its "ambivalent and ironic approach to the world of fashion", its "uncompromising rejection of the then prevailing rules of photography" and for his extensive use of wide-angle and telephoto lenses, natural lighting and motion blur. Klein tends to be cited in photography books along with Robert Frank as among the fathers of street photography, one of those mixed compliments that classifies a man who is hard to classify.[tpl]cite news | first=Katherine | last=Knorr | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=William Klein's Street Life | date=1996-10-26 | publisher= | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/26/style/26iht-klein.t.html | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2011-01-14 | language = [/tpl] The world of fashion would become the subject for Klein's first feature film, Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?, which, like his other two fiction features, Mr. Freedom and The Model Couple, is a satire.
Klein has directed numerous short and feature-length documentaries and has produced over 250 television commercials.[tpl]cite web |publisher= Masters of Photography|url= http://www.masters-of-photography.com/K/klein/klein_articles4.html|title= Klein, William|work=Photography Encyclopedia|accessdate= 2010-01-06[/tpl]
Though American by birth, Klein has lived and worked in France since his late teens. His work has sometimes been openly critical of American society and foreign policy; the film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum once wrote that Klein's 1968 satire Mr. Freedom was "conceivably the most anti-American movie ever made."[tpl]cite web |publisher= Chicago Reader|url= http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/mr-freedom/Film?oid=1051221|title= Mr. Freedom|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate= 2010-01-06[/tpl] On French TV show Des mots de minuit, William Klein defended the openly far-right and antisemitic comedian and political activist Dieudonné.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xb1epk_patrick-timsit-compare-dieudonne-a_news

Salamanca (Otomi: Xidoo "Place of Tepetate") is a city in the Mexican state of Guanajuato.
Founded January 1, 1603 as 'Villa de Salamanca' by the Viceroy Gaspar de Zuniga and Acevedo, fifth Earl of Monterrey, who was originally from Salamanca (Spain). The town was founded in the lands of Bajio, after cattle ranchers and poor farmers, a few Spaniards, and small groups of Otomi Indians who formerly occupied a village named Xidoo, already lived in the area.
In recent years, many refineries have opened, and Salamanca has grown rapidly to become an important site for manufacturing and service industry in the region. Also, the University of Guanajuato has made many scientific contributions to develop agricultural and industrial technologies, giving a boost to the local and regional industries.
The city reported a 2010 census population of 260,759. The fourth-largest city in the state (behind León, Irapuato, and Celaya), it is also the largest of four places called "Salamanca" in Mexico.

As presented by Hao Wang (1954, 1957), his basic machine B is an extremely simple computational model equivalent to the Turing machine. It is "the first formulation of a Turing-machine theory in terms of computer-like models" (Minsky (1967) p. 200). With only 4 sequential instructions it is very similar to, but even simpler than, the 7 sequential instructions of the Post–Turing machine.  In the same paper, Wang introduced a variety of equivalent machines, including what he called the W-machine, which is the B-machine with an "erase" instruction added to the instruction set.

Volleyball is one of the sports that is played at the Summer Olympic Games in two disciplines: the traditional six-per-side indoor game, and the newer game of beach volleyball.  Indoor volleyball was added to the Olympic programme in 1957 at the 53rd session of the International Olympic Committee jsnshahanananajajjs
(IOC) in Sofia, Bulgaria, and the first competitions were held at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fivb.ch/TheGame/ChronologicalHighlights.htm|title=Chronological Highlights|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Volleyball|accessdate=9 July 2010[/tpl] The Soviet Union won a medal in both the men's and women's competition at the first five Olympics that included volleyball, including the men's gold medal in Tokyo.  The Japanese women's team won the gold at the inaugural Olympic volleyball competition, and the silver at the following two Games. The Montreal Games of 1976 saw the Polish men win the nation's only gold medal in the sport, after the women had won bronze in 1964 and 1968.  At the 1980 Moscow Olympics, the hosts won gold in both competitions.  The Bulgarian team won their only two volleyball medals in Moscow, a silver and a bronze in the men's and women's tournament, respectively.

The Patiala gharana is one of the most prominent gharanas of vocal Hindustani classical music. It was initially sponsored by the Maharaja  of Patiala, Punjab, which was famous for ghazal, thumri, and khyal.
The Patiala Gharana was founded by Ustad Fateh Ali Khan and Ustad Ali Baksh Khan.[tpl]cite web|title=Patiala Gharana|url=http://www.hindustaniclassical.com/patialagharana.asp[/tpl]
This school of music has had a number of famous musicians, many of whom came to be patronised by the royal family of Patiala after the disintegration of the Mughal Empire at Delhi in the 18th century.
The Patiala gharana tends to favor pentatonic ragas for their ornamentation and execution of intricate taans. Ektaal and Teentaal are the most common taals chosen by members of this gharana. Besides khyal, thumri singing is emphasized.
This gharana has been criticized by purists, who say it overuses ornaments and graces without considering the basic nature and mood of the raga and neglects principles of khyal architecture, as exemplified by Bade Ghulam Ali Khan's quick ascent through the octave in his rendering of Darbari.[tpl]Cite book | author=Bagchee, Sandeep | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Nād: Understanding Rāga Music | year=1998 | publisher=BPI (India) PVT Ltd | location= | isbn=81-86982-07-8 | page=182[/tpl]
Gayaki Styles of Patiala Gharana has been popular for its flavor, aesthetic and delicate style. The musicians of this Gharana pursue the tradition with complete dedication and execute in harmony with the discipline and tradition of their Gharana. This style is known for its crisp, artistic and short bandishes.
The special feature of Patiala Gharana is its rendering of taanas. These are very rhythmic, vakra (complicated) and Firat Taanas. The taanas sung by the artists are very imaginative and creative and are not bounded by the rhythmic cycle. Because of this aspect there is a great scope for creativity in swar, tala, bol-banav, sargam, taiyyari, bhav, incredible performance and originality in the renderings.
This style is very melodious and sweet. While singing khayal the khatka and murki is utilized in a very artistic and unique manner. The presentation of the khayal is embellished with bol-banav, bol-tana, sargam, meend and keeping to the laya and rhythmic circle. The purity of the raga is strictly maintained throughout the khayal performance.
As Patiala Gharana belongs to Punjab, the taanas of clear Aakar are presented not through the throat but through chest. After the khayal, the performance is concluded with Thumri of Punjab Ang. Because of unique taanas, gamak, gayaki of tarana style and sapat taanas this gharana can be easily differentiated from others.

Equestrian sports are among those contested at the Summer Olympic Games. Equine events began at the Olympics in 1900, when competitions in polo (considered by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be a separate sport from the other equestrian events), vaulting, four-in-hand driving, mail coach driving, mixed hacks and hunters and three types of jumping (high jump, long jump and show-jumping) were held.[tpl]cite web|author=Kubatko, Justin|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/EQU/|title=Equestrianism|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=October 21, 2009|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Olympic Equestrian: The Sports and the Stories from Stockholm to Sydney|author=Bryant, Jennifer O.|date=2000|publisher=The Blood-Horse, Inc|location=Canada|isbn=1-58150-044-0|pages=24–25[/tpl] Most of these events were later discontinued, although equestrian events have continued through the 2008 Summer Olympics, and now include team and individual dressage, three-day eventing and show-jumping.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/sports/equestrian/index.shtml|title=Equestrian|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|accessdate=October 21, 2009[/tpl] Competitors in the modern pentathlon event also have to complete an equestrian show-jumping course, but this is not part of the equestrian events.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2008.nbcolympics.com/modernpentathlon/insidethissport/index.html|title=Modern Pentathlon: Inside this Sport|publisher=NBC Universal|work=NBC Beijing 2008|accessdate=October 29, 2009[/tpl]

In two instances, the equestrian portion of the Olympics has been held in a different location from the rest of the games. The first was during the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when, due to Australian quarantine laws, the equestrian portion was held in Stockholm, Sweden. At the next IOC meeting, it was decided to hold a special Equestrian Olympic Games several months before the actual Olympics, complete with its own opening and closing ceremonies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/equestrian/1956/|title=1956 Stockholm Equestrian Games|author=Kubatko, Justin|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=November 11, 2009[/tpl] This meant that Switzerland, which had officially boycotted the 1956 Games because of the Soviet Union's recent invasion of Hungary, still brought home a medal because of its participation in the equestrian portion several months earlier.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/07/f-olympics-history-1956.html|title=Three countries boycott the Games in Melbourne|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=November 18, 2009|date=August 7, 2009|work=CBC Sports[/tpl] The second instance was during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing. This decision was made when, in 2005, international veterinary groups refused to certify the main Olympic city as free of equine diseases. This would have resulted in horses leaving Beijing after the games and having to go through lengthy quarantine processes before being allowed to re-enter their home countries.

The Lytle Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel that carries Interstate 71 (I-71) under the historic Lytle Park in Cincinnati, in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is a six-lane tunnel with three tubes. There is a two-lane southbound tube, a three lane-northbound tube, and a one-lane southbound tube that separates from the highway and serves as an exit ramp to the downtown area. The tunnel is ventilated by two grates in the northbound tube and the southbound exiting tube. It was completed in 1970.{{cite web|url=http://home.no.net/lotsberg/data/USA/li000.html|title=Road Tunnels in United States During the construction of the Lytle Tunnel, many historic buildings were razed for the project. The old Lytle Park was similar to a town square, with many Greek Revival buildings surrounding the park. On the park's east side is the Taft Museum of Art. A few of the original buildings remain, including the Literary Club of Cincinnati, the Anna Louise Inn, Guilford School building, and the Phelps Apartments.

[[Seasonal industry]]

CATEGORIES: Business economics

A seasonal industry is activity within an economic sector in which the majority of operations take place during only part of the year, generally in the context of a single country or region. In some cases, as with agriculture, this limitation may relate to climate or other forces of nature. In others, the seasonality may relate to annual variations in human activity (for example, tourism, restaurants, some forms of manufacturing).
Seasonal industries often feature large swings in labor force size, and in many cases, precipitate mass migrations of workers. 
In those countries that provide them, unemployment benefits may be affected by a worker's seasonal status. That is, in certain cases, a seasonal worker may not be considered "unemployed" during the off-season for the sake of benefits or aggregated statistics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coworkforce.com/uib/regulation/default.asp?section=seasonal|title=Colorado Workforce Regulations (example)|accessdate=2006-08-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060515190615/http://www.coworkforce.com/uib/regulation/default.asp?section=seasonal  |archivedate = 2006-05-15[/tpl] despite being functionally inactive.

WEAS-FM is a mainstream urban radio station licensed to Springfield, Georgia, but serving the Savannah Area. The station is owned by Cumulus Media. 
WEAS(FM) began operation in 1968 as an easy listening station to counter the country music format of the sister AM station (which had formerly been WJIV, with an R&B format, until 1960, and later as WEAS with the country format); the station's format was freeform progressive rock in the early part of the next decade. By the mid 1970s, the FM station switched to a similar urban format as today, as did the sister AM station, prior to it being sold and changed to a sports information station.  The AM and FM stations were previously owned by E.D. "Dee" Rivers, Jr, son of a former governor of Georgia.
WEAS-FM was previously licensed to Savannah, but moved to Springfield in order to allow WTYB to move to Tybee Island, in the Savannah metropolitan area. The station has historically targeted the African-American population in the Savannah area.
WEAS-FM was automated in its first few years, but changed to a live DJ when the format was changed from Easy Listening to R&B.

[[Deerskin trade]]
CATEGORIES: Fur trade, Cherokee tribe, History of the Thirteen Colonies, Pre-statehood history of South Carolina, Deer hunting

The deerskin trade between Colonial America and the Native Americans was one of the most important trading relationships between Europeans and Native Americans, especially in the southeast. It was a form of the fur trade, but less known, since deer skins were not as valuable as furs from the north (such as beaver). Colonial deerskin exports were an important source of raw material for the European markets. The Cherokee mainly traded their deer-skins to the French and Spanish, and the Shawnee traded deer skins with the English colonies to the north and east.
In the early 18th century, after King William's War, the beaver fur trade declined dramatically while the deerskin trade boomed. This was in part due to a shift in changing fashions in London, where a new kind of hat made from leather was becoming popular. This new hat required deerskin and colonial South Carolina increased the scale of its deerskin exports dramatically. Trade in other kinds of fur fell sharply. The end of a diversified fur trade altered the relationship between European colonists and Native Americans, in many cases caused an increase in tension and conflict. For example, it was an important factor in the events leading up to the Yamasee War.[tpl]cite book|last=Ramsey|first=William L.|title=The Yamasee War: A Study of Culture, Economy, and Conflict in the Colonial South|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E-IiOoGJHoYC&pg=PA61|accessdate=13 July 2012|year=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-3972-2|pages=61–74[/tpl]
By 1750, deer were becoming harder to find in Cherokee territory. So large was the scale of the trade that in time deer became nearly extinct in the southeast. It also radically altered the social make-up of the Cherokee because the men were increasingly absent from towns (for long periods to hunt deer). Concurrently, Cherokee society was undergoing a growing dependence on European trade goods. These events contributed to growing tensions and conflict between the Indian tribes themselves, as well as with the Europeans.[tpl]cite book|last=Davis|first=Donald Edward|title=Where There Are Mountains: An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|year=2000[/tpl]
Deerskin was used to produce buckskin, as well as a chamois-like leather, used for the making of gloves, bookbinding, and many other things.

[[Olfactory glands]]

CATEGORIES: Olfactory system

Bowman's glands (a.k.a. olfactory glands, glands of Bowman) are situated in the olfactory mucosa, beneath the olfactory epithelium, in the lamina propria, a connective tissue also containing fibroblasts, blood vessels, and bundles of fine axons from the olfactory neurons.
The structure of the Bowman's glands consists of an acinus in the lamina propria and a secretory duct going out through the olfactory epithelium.
Electron microscopy studies show that Bowman's glands contain cells with large secretory vesicles. Bowman's glands might secrete proteins such as lysozyme, amylase and IgA similarly to serous glands. The exact composition of the secretions from Bowman's glands is unclear, but there is evidence that Bowman's glands do not produce odorant binding protein.

[[University Woods]]

CATEGORIES: Parks in the Bronx

University Woods is a small woodland park in the University Heights neighborhood in the borough of the Bronx, overlooking the Harlem River crested between Sedgwick and Cedar Avenues in New York City. After having been named "the city's worst park" by the New Yorkers for Parks in the years 2003–2006, a restoration project was begun in 2008 by the Friends of the Woods organization, with a $500,000 grant from Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
University Woods, formerly British Fort #8, has a two-tiered pathway and the original stone walls used by the British troops during the American Revolutionary War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=244|title=University Woods - Historical Sign|accessdate=2009-07-26|publisher=New York City Department of Parks and Recreation[/tpl]  The main stairs, now pending restoration, are a popular passageway between Cedar Avenue and Sedgwick Avenue and lead further up to the Hall of Fame terrace and Bronx Community College. 
Friends of the Woods is an organization founded by Brandy Cochrane in 2006 to rehabilitate and maintain the park. Formerly a real estate professional she was drawn to the park while assessing housing in the vicinity. Even though Cochrane had been a  resident in the neighborhood for over four years, she was stunned to discover this idyllic hideaway just blocks from her home. Since that time, she has been a public supporter of not only the preservation of rural areas in her neighborhood, but of the value of community cohesiveness, inclusiveness, and assertive actions that can be taken to improve the quality of life in urban areas. 
Friends of The Woods received $500,000 from the city of New York and has set about to restore the infrastructure of University Woods. They have partnered with the Parks Department, The Harlem River Ecology Center, the New York State Horticultural Center, and many other ecologically conscious groups to make further improvements to this once abandoned woodland.  DJ Kool Herc, who grew up near the park, attended a block party held in 2008 in celebration of the park.

The site has shell works, consisting of lines of shell deposits along the shore, and black dirt middens inland from the shells. There may also be features underwater in the adjacent black mangrove forest, dating to when the sea level was lower. The shell works are dominated by lightning whelk, with some horse conchs. Oyster, clam, conch and lightning whelk shells are also found in the middens. The shell works and middens are attributed to the Caloosahatchee culture IIA-IV period, about 500-1500. In 1992, the NRHP Registration Sheet described the Mark Pardo Shellworks as "one of the best preserved archaeological sites in the region." Since then, however, feral hogs have seriously damaged the site.[tpl]cite book|last=Division of Recreation and Parks|title=Cayo Costa State Park Unit Management Plan|year=2005|publisher=State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection|location=Tallahassee, Florida|pages=24-25|url=http://www.dep.state.fl.us/parks/planning/parkplans/CayoCostaStatePark.pdf|accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl]

[[Baby-led weaning]]

CATEGORIES: Infant feeding

Baby-led weaning (often also referred to as BLW) is a method of adding complementary foods to a baby's diet of formula or breastmilk. A method of food progression, BLW facilitates the development of age appropriate oral motor control while maintain eating as a positive, interactive experience. Baby-led weaning allows babies to control their solid food consumption by "self-feeding" from the very beginning of their experiences with food. The term weaning should not be taken to imply giving up formula or breastmilk, but simply the introduction of foods other than formula or breastmilk.
Oral Motor Skill Development
From infancy, the only oral motor pattern appreciated is suck-swallow-breathe. This reflexive way of eating allows infants to feed from birth (from a breast or bottle) while protecting their airway and meeting their nutritional needs (Case-Smith & Humphry, in Case-Smith, 2005). The oral motor patterns required for eating and swallowing solids include tongue lateralization, tongue elevation, and munching/chewing, and unlike the suck-swallow-breathe sequence, coordination of these oral motor patterns is learned, not reflexive (Morris & Dunn Klein, 2000). When an infant is offered a spoon of puree, the practiced or familiar oral motor pattern is sucking. As purees are thicker than formula or breastmilk, puree is sucked off of a presented spoon and moved in the mouth in a similar fashion as liquid. Infants frequently cough and gag, as they are unable to manage the food in their mouth. The coughing and choking can be uncomfortable for some infants (Rappaport, personal communication 2013). This is generally looked at as a part of the process of introducing solid foods and parents are often encouraged to push past this. Conversely, current research supports that early negative experiences with eating leads to poor food acceptance in later years (Courtland, Harris, & Emmett,2009). Through playful exploration, BLW provides an opportunity for infants to practice new oral motor patterns. Through this method, infants gradually develop the oral motor patterns required for mature bolus manipulation, chewing, and swallowing, as well as allow the infant to be in charge of what goes in their mouth, how it goes in, and when. (Case-Smith, 2005, Rapley & Murkett, 2008).
BLW
Infants are offered a range of foods to provide a balanced diet from around 6 months.  They often begin by picking up and licking or sucking on the piece food, before progressing to eating.  Babies are typically able to begin self-feeding at around 6 months old, although some are ready and will reach for food as early as 5 months and some will wait until 7 or 8 months.  The intention of this process is that it is tailored to suit the individual baby and their personal development.  The 6-month-old guideline provided by the World Health Organization is based on research indicating that the internal digestive system matures when the infant is 4–6 months old.
Initial self-feeding attempts often result in very little food ingested as the baby explores textures and tastes through play, but the baby will soon start to swallow and digest what is offered. Formula or breastfeeding is continued in conjunction with weaning and milk is always offered before solids in the first 12 months. Although breastfeeding is the nutritional ideal precursor to baby led weaning (as the baby has been exposed to different flavours Mennella JA, Jagnow CP, and Beauchamp GK, 2011, Prenatal and postnatal flavor learning by human infants. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11389286 via its mother's breast milk and the jaw action used during breastfeeding helps the baby learn to chew), it is also entirely possible to introduce a formula-fed baby to solids using the BLW method.  Formula-fed babies can successfully wean using BLW.Susan A. Sullivan, Leann L. Birch 1994 http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/93/2/271.abstract for the baby to get used to flavours and develop the ability to chew.
Providing an infant with table foods initiates the development of strong oral motor control for chewing and swallowing, including tongue lateralization and eventual bolus formation. When an infant mouths a food texture, the tongue lateralization reflex forces them to move their tongue to the side to lick and taste the food. Through continued practice, infants learn to volitionally lateralize their tongue—the first step in the development of a munching/chewing pattern (Case-Smith, 2005, Morris & Dunn Klein, 2000).

The car was originally made by the Oakleigh Motor Company of West Dulwich, London and was usually fitted with a single seater body although a few two seaters were made. Power came from a single cylinder Stag engine and drive was to the rear wheels by chain. There was only a single forward speed and no reverse so a gearbox was not used. Production stopped on the outbreak of war.
The car was revived in 1923 by LAD Productions of Farnham, Surrey in 1923 and the original was joined by a 350 cc twin cylinder engined model but the launch of the Austin 7 took away the market for such cars and the company closed in 1926.

[[Earth Water]]
CATEGORIES: Beverage companies of Canada

Earth Water International is a bottled water company, started in Canada, which donates all of their net profits from the sale of Earth Water to the United Nations’ UNHCR.  The money raised goes to funding projects related to acquisition, transport, storage, and distribution of fresh clean water, focusing on both emergency provision and developing sustainable water sources for people living in poverty.
Earth Water was started by a young Kori Chilibek, fresh out of University.  His vision, if people are going to consume bottled water, why not use those monies to help provide clean drinking water for those who don't have access to it.
In 2006, Earth Water's donations went to the Darfur region with additional projects planned for Brazil, Thailand, India and New Orleans in the near future.
Earth Water is available in 500 ml (16oz) as well as 1 ltr (33oz) bottles.
In 2007, Earth Water International began testing both a Biodegradable bottle as well as other alternative packaging options in different markets around the world.
Earth Water International has also attempted to stay away from selling mass quantity packaging for rock bottom pricing, believing that packaged water should be consumed not as a convenience at home, but rather when on the move during a busy lifestyle.
In June 2007, Earth Water also began printing all of their marketing material on FSC paper, which avoids the use of old growth forests for pulp and paper production.
Earth Water is available in Europe, Canada and the United States.  A complete list of countries and stores are available on their website.
Earth Water has recently gained considerable attention from the food industry for their effective engagement of supporters in a campaign called "Join US".  The message revolves around their company's mantra "If you had the chance, would you change the world?"
The foundation of the "Join US" movement, revolves around the consumer directly asking retailers to cary the Earth Water brand.  The media has reported that both consumers and retailers have found this process to be extremely effective in helping to both raise the profile of Earth Water, but equally raise money for the less fortunate.

VEB Plasticart was a toy manufacturer established in 1958 in Zschopau, East Germany. VEB was a Communist-era designation, meaning Volkseigener Betrieb - "company owned by the people". The company was called KVZ (for "Kunststoff-Verarbeitung Zschopau") from 1958–1969, MPKAB (for "VEB Modell -und Plastspielwaren Kombinat Annaberg-Buchholz") from 1969–1973, VEB Plasticart Zschopau from 1973–1989 and Mastermodell GmbH from 1989-1991. After a two-years break the company was sold in 1993 by the German Treuhand (an organization which privatized state owned enterprises of the GDR) to Manfred Wader. It is today called Plasticart. In 1993 the company had only 37 workers left. A new factory was constructed in Elterlein, Saxony, and now the company counts over 70 workers. They do no longer make kits, but playthings for toddlers.
The old VEB Plasticart produced 40 different kits and a few games (e.g. the mancala game "Badari") made of plastic. Most kits were static models and used scale 1/100 for airliners, 1/50 and later 1/72 for smaller aircraft. They also produced a model of the Soviet spaceship Vostok (scaled 1/25) and the Energia rocket with the Soviet space shuttle Buran (1/288). Many of them are today valued collector items.
After 1991, Revell took on some of the kits.

[[North Carolina Highway 42]]
CATEGORIES: State highways in North Carolina

NC 42 is a winding country state highway that bypasses many of the larger cities in the eastern/central part of North Carolina. Despite its long length (223.3 miles), it is not noted for being convenient for long-distance travel; US 64 often provides a shorter, faster alternative routing for a large part of NC 42's length. Because it is well connected to many other major Interstate and US routes, NC 42 is a local connector for smaller communities along its route.

thumb|300px|right|Butler Library The Nicholas Murray Butler Library, commonly known simply as Butler Library, is the largest single library in the Columbia University Library System, which contains over 11 million books, and is one of the largest buildings on the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University.
Proposed as "South Hall" by the University's former President Nicholas Murray Butler as expansion plans for Low Memorial Library stalled, the new library was funded by Edward Harkness, a Columbia alumnus who was also donor of Yale's residential college system, and designed by his favorite architect, James Gamble Rogers. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946.
The library's design is neo-classical in style. Its facade features an arcade of columns in the Ionic order above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the Core Curriculum of Columbia College. 
Butler Library remains at least partially open 24 hours a day during the academic year. Several books and screenplays have been written within its walls, including Nobel Prize-winning novelist Orhan Pamuk's The Black Book and the script for the film Capote. It also plays a role in Paul Auster's 2009 novel Invisible, where the novel's main protagonist, Adam Walker, takes a job as a "page" in the library's stacks. This section of the novel is set in 1967 when the stacks were closed to library users.http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/img/assets/5295/SelfGuided.pdf The page's task was to retrieve requested books from the stacks and re-shelve returned books.
Along the front and sides of the library are inscribed the names of Homer, Herodotus, Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Tacitus, Saint Augustine, Aquinas, Dante, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Milton, Voltaire, and Goethe.

CATEGORIES: Companies established in 1989, Model manufacturers

Eduard Model Accessories is a Czech manufacturer of plastic models and finescale model accessories.
Formed in 1989 in the city of Most, Eduard began in a rented cellar as a manufacturer of photoetched brass model components. Following the success of their early products, the company branched off into plastic models in 1993. As of 2006, Eduard's product line contained some 30 plastic kits and more than 800 individual photoetch detail sets. To the plastic modeller community at large, Eduard has become a household word in the field of photoetched parts, and their products are available worldwide.
Eduard aircraft kits range from World War I to the present-day. Some notable ones include: most of the famous World War I fighters in 1:48 and 1:72 scales, P-40, P-39 and Fw 190 fighters, the Dassault Mirage III, and most recently, a Bf 110C/D, all in 1:48. Their older kits are of good quality, but the newer releases such as the Spitfire IXs and MiG-21s in their "Profipack" releases (including a brassin set, photoetched detail set and painting masks, along with other goodies) are acquiring a reputation as good as or better than the newer Tamiya and Hasegawa kits.

Stop Making Sense is a live 1984 album by Talking Heads, the soundtrack to the film of the same name. The original release of the album features only nine of the songs from the movie, many of them heavily edited. The album spent more than two years (118 weeks) on the Billboard 200 chart. In 1999, a 16-track re-release coincided with the concert's 15th anniversary.
Byrne's intention was not to make a traditional soundtrack album, but to have it be a separate experience. Limited pressings of the original LP version featured a full color picture book wrapped around the album jacket. Regular versions had many of the pictures and captions on the album's inner sleeve. In 1999 - to correspond with the theatrical re-release of the movie - the album was extended and remastered, restoring all of the songs from the movie with only very minor edits. The newly included tracks feature Frantz's original drumming from the concert recordings. 
In 2003, the album was ranked number 345 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2012 Slant Magazine listed the album at #61 on its list of "Best Albums of the 1980s".http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/best-albums-of-the-1980s/308/page_4

Litespeed is a U.S. bicycle manufacturer founded by members of the Lynskey family in 1986 in Ooltewah, Tennessee. The company has its roots in a family-owned custom machine shop known as Southeast Machine that specialized in exotic metals. Its interest in bicycles began while one of the members of the founding family took up cycling while recovering from a running injury; this led eventually to manufacturing its first bicycle in 1986.
Litespeed makes titanium and carbon fiber-framed road racing bicycles and mountain bikes.  Litespeed is owned by the American Bicycle Group, parent company of bicycle manufacturer Quintana Roo as well as component fabricator Real Design (ABG also owned Merlin (bicycles) from 2000-2011).
In the 1999 Tour de France, Lance Armstrong rode a titanium Litespeed Blade painted and labeled as a Trek during time trials. Several professionals have ridden Litespeeds painted as other brands.  European brands such as Eddy Merckx and Bianchi have contracted Litespeed to construct titanium frames in their own lines.
Litespeed sponsored the DFL-Cyclingnews-Litespeed and Calyon/Litespeed Pro Cycling road teams and the Maxxis mountain bike team. The ITU Triathlon World Cup champion Vanessa Fernandes (Portugal) also raced on a Litespeed.
Litespeed has been a contractor and consultant to NASA for projects that require titanium-intensive subassemblies including the Mars Curiosity Rover.

The Ninja ZX-RR is a race bike from Kawasaki, which raced in the MotoGP world championship. The bike made its debut towards the end of the 2002 MotoGP season with riders Australia's Andrew Pitt and Japan's Akira Yanagawa.
In 2004 Shinya Nakano joined the team and managed to get ZX-RR's first podium with a third place at the Japanese Grand Prix. In 2005, Olivier Jacque scored a second place at the Chinese Grand Prix. The next year Nakano finished second at the Dutch TT. In 2007, Randy de Puniet scored a second place at the Japanese Grand Prix. In 2008 John Hopkins and Anthony West rode the machine.
The ZX-RR struggled in 2008, with the best results being two fifth-place finishes from John Hopkins in Portugal and Anthony West in Brno. Hopkins and West blamed both a lack of feeling in the front end and rear traction on corner exit. Previous ZX-RRs have been difficult to ride, but beyond the limited statements by the riders it is unclear what the problems with the 2008 bike were.
At the end of the 2008 season, Kawasaki announced its retirement from the MotoGP world championship.

[[BS 5930]]

CATEGORIES: Construction standards, British Standards

BS 5930:1999, "the code of practice for site investigations", is a UK code of practice published  in October 1999 by the British Standards Institution.
It supersedes BS 5930:1981 which itself supersedes CP2001: 1957 "Site investigations".
The stated purpose of the document is to "...deal(s) with the investigation of sites for the purposes of assessing their suitability for the construction of civil engineering and building works and of acquiring knowledge of the characteristics of a site that affect the design and construction of such work...".
The document gives guidance on legal, environmental and technical matters relating to site investigation and includes a section on the description and classification of soils and rocks.
BS5930:1999 was amended in December 2007 to avoid conflict with the newly introduced Eurocode 7 "Geotechnical Design" and the code is to be retained as a normative reference.
Section 1 Preliminary Considerations Pages 3–6BS 5930:1999
Seven factors to be cognizant of at this stage are: suitability of the site for the proposed works, economic and adequacy of design, optimum method of construction with reference to potential issues due to ground and groundwater. The effect of changes to the ground and environment due to the works, and, therefore the effect on the works from these changes. Consideration of suitability on a selection of sites. And finally, the existing works and their implications. 
If a site has been used in the past, this is a major factor in the investigation, mining, quarrying, landfill or waste disposal, industrial usages, archaeological or ecological factors may all have a bearing on the intended works. The cost of an SI is low relative to the project cost and when conducted thoroughly can be a significant saving later.
Investigations should evaluate the nature of the ground and groundwater. The size and nature of the works will have a bearing on the investigations as will its former use as a site or contamination of ground or groundwater. It will be considered in 3 stages. First a desk study to collate the information above as far as possible. Where a site is contaminated it is appropriate at this stage to plan site safety procedures for any further investigations. Planning the details of further investigations is appropriate too. Existing records, local authorities, industry, libraries, present or past OS maps and aerial photography or even anecdotal information are to be used. A site reconnaissance should also be conducted at this stage and includes a thorough visual inspection of any exposed cuttings and note taken of level of vegetation. The surroundings should also be noted. Second, a more detailed investigation is undertaken and finally a construction review – these shall be discussed later.
Section 2 Ground investigations Pages 7–23
This is a natural follow on from the desk study, the objectives are similar – acquiring sufficient information for design, assessing the hazards. Depending on the works the investigations will differ i.e. defects of existing works, slope failure or new works.
Soil profile and groundwater condition should be established. Temporary or permanent changes should be investigated this involves changes in stresses and strains, moisture content, strength and compressibility. Certain areas will have old mines and underground cavities which need investigation. 
The ground investigation should be given enough time to be conducted before works are designed, this may involve in predicting ground condition at various times of the year. Due to the potential flexibility and size of an investigation, adequate supervision, equipment, testing, personnel, and audits should be provided in a safe manner.  
The extent of the GI can depend on many variables such as, character of site, availability of equipment and personnel and costs of methods. It should cover all ground affected by stresses and strains to an appropriate depth and breadth. Excavations, boreholes probing and geophysical surveying are used to investigate the ground. Intrusive investigations should be sited, spaced and backfilled with care. The GI should give sufficient information to make good decisions on design, construction material selection. 
The condition and accessibility on site may effect the equipment used. As the determination of groundwater conditions is important – the use of piezometers are at times used. Ground conditions from rock and gravel through to silts and clays will determine the equipments and approach used in the ground investigations as will made up, contaminated ground and under water ground. Geotechnical specialists are used in the investigation and interpretation of results.
Section 3 Field investigation Pages 24–45
This section is more specific with regard to how the ground is investigated using methods such as excavating or drilling. Frequency of sampling and testing can be decided with the following in mind, the determination of the character and structure of all the strata and ground water conditions, the determination of the properties of the strata and the use of special techniques should ‘normal’ techniques not give satisfactory results. Shallow trial pits go to a maximum depth of 4–5 metres, comprehensive records should include the location and orientation of the pit and the face logged. Samples should be taken as soon as the pit is opened and closed as soon as possible properly – there are however advantages to leaving them open for a time. Samples are taken from deep trial pits and shafts at certain sites if necessary and if below the water table can become a more complicated process. Boring augers are in common use. There are two types of rotary drilling, open hole drilling and core drilling. The selection of the type and method used can depend on ground conditions and time and cost constraints. Recovered cores should be maintained as near as possible to its natural state until it is stored. In most cases it is inevitably disturbed. Another method is wash boring which is most applicable to sands, silts, and clays. However, these are not representative of the character and consistency of the penetrated strata. 
Ground water conditions are determined from water level in boreholes and the use of standpipe, hydraulic, electrical and pneumatic piezometers. Water samples should be representative and stored in appropriate containers. Backfilling should be well compacted to obviate the flow of groundwater to any aquifer below and/or settlement. The use of cement based grout can be used - bentonite is also used to decrease shrinkage. 
Sampling quality can be classified to determine depending on their disturbance and other factors such as, wet or dry ground. Samplers should conform to the standard. Sampling takes different forms i.e. – continuous sampling, the sand and window sampler and block sampling. Due to the cost of sample acquisition, samples should be treated with great care. Good methods of handling and labelling should be established.
Section 4 Field Tests Pages 46–98
These are used when laboratory testing is not enough to determine the required properties of the ground. Laboratory samples are at times not considered to be representative and of insufficient quality, stress, pore pressure, and degree of saturation. Discontinuities in the ground can also warrant filed tests. Sample sizes depend on ground nature and test type. Boreholes are commonly used. The SPT is a simple and inexpensive test which can furnish a piling contractor with useful information. The van test is used to determine the shear strength of a soil - material with coarse silt or sand can mean unreliable results. 
Permeability is found by determining whether the relevant aquifer is confined on unconfined with cognizance of the normal fluctuations in the aquifer. Installation of the borehole itself may influence stresses. For a reliable test this should be followed by a pumping test. Packer tests are also used to measure the impermeability of grouted ground and permeability of dam foundations, strength and deformation data can also be taken. There are many types, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic, the latter being the most popular. A clean borehole with a properly seated packer is essential (cement mortar is sometime used). Geophysical logs from the boreholes used can be taken at the same time enhancing the value of the results. 
Pressuremeter tests are used to stress, stiffness and strength of the ground to be investigated. It can be used in most ground types. There are three main types – pre-bored, self bored and pushed in. Boring should do minimal damage to the ground as much as possible. an unload reload method of around three times is used to give an accurate value of stiffness. 
Probing from the surface is done using a steel rod. Mainly used at a preliminary stage, it is also useful to check surrounding ground but is unsuitable in soils with boulders and cobbles. Static probing is mostly conducted with the use of electric sensors. It is quick and cheap. Pumping allows the determination of groundwater conditions using pumping and observation wells. Data interpretation can be complicated and is classed in steady and non-steady states. Density testing is conducted using the average of three results to obtain a significant result. The use of the sand replacement and core cutter test are common and the use of water replacement, rubber balloon, and nuclear methods are also used.
In-situ testing data is important to design of works. Stress measurement in rocks and soils can be determined. Bearing tests are used to determine the shear strength and deformation characteristics of a soil. In-situ shear testing is done using a system similar to the laboratory shear box test. Large scale testing should be assessed on a case by case basis. Slope failure or settlement of a structure after field tests have been conducted are examples of phenomena which may be considered as back analysis, this be conducted successfully when accompanied by a full investigation to determine the ground and ground water conditions. 
Geophysical surveying can be useful in site investigation for determining layers of rock other geological features, locating aquifers, mineral deposits, voids – natural or man-made and engineering properties of the ground. Electrical resistivity and seismic methods amongst others are used. This is a specialized field. The geophysical adviser should be involved at all stages. Experience has shown care should be taken when writing the specification for this type of work amongst other factors.
Section 5: Laboratory tests on samples Pages 101-111
These tests are to be undertaken to describe and classify samples, investigate the fundamental behaviour of soils and rocks, obtain soil and rock parameters with reference to design requirements. Nature of ground and soil type, quality and how representative the sample is, method of analysis proposed, requirement of the design along with laboratory capabilities are all key factors in lab testing. Provision of good handling, labelling and storage should facilitate the nominated testing. Practical experience  and skill in testing are invaluable and lead to reliable predictions being made. Sample quality should be borne in mind when testing, and finally reporting unambiguous results is desirable.
Section 6: Description of soils and rocks Pages 112-140
Results of ground investigations may be needed even after samples have been disposed, leaving only descriptions of the soil to go on, for this reason good descriptions should be given. Designers also use past experience of materials of similar properties. Quality of samples should be reflected in the description. Soil characteristics are based on particle size grading of the coarser particles and plasticity of the finer particles. Main descriptions should be kept concise however they can be followed by further details if applicable such as, density, discontinuities, bedding, colour, composite soil types, principal soil type, stratum name, geological formation, age and type of deposit and classification.
Section 7: Field reports Pages 141-157
Field reports are filled in by the drillers, engineers, technicians, the field report should encourage the operator to record all the data necessary for the eventual interpretation necessary for the design or action necessary for new or remedial works. after a time, samples are destroyed and the only record maybe the field report, for this reason it should be composed and written in properly. Description of ground, ground water, boreholes and other factors should be recorded and commented on, recommendation with regard to safety and design maybe made also.

"Koval" Ковал), literally translates as “forge”, and was commonly used to describe a blacksmith (Blacksmith is direct translation of the name from the Ukrainian.) The suffix “-chuk” (or -chuck or -czyk) denoted either the son of, or an apprentice to the blacksmith. It is somewhat similar in commonality to English surname Smith. 
In East Slavic Languages, the correct pronunciation would be ko-vahl-CHOOK, but for those living in the West, for example Ukrainian Canadians, the pronunciation ko-WAL-chuk is more common.  The Polish form is Kowalczyk.

A trial pit is an excavation of ground in order to study or sample the composition and structure of the subsurface, usually dug during a site investigation, a soil survey or a geological survey.
Trial pits are dug before the construction. They are dug to determine the geology and the water table of that site. 
Trial pits are usually between 1 and 4 metres deep, and are dug either by hand or using a mechanical digger. 
Building and construction regulations clearly state that any trial pits that concede deeper than 1.2 metres should be secured against structural collapse, if they are to be entered by people.

Brigadier-General Raymond Brutinel CB CMG DSO (March 6, 1872 – September 21, 1964) was a geologist, journalist, soldier, entrepreneur and a pioneer in the field of mechanized warfare who commanded the Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade during World War I.
Raymond Brutinel was born in Alet-les-Bains, Aude, France. He immigrated to Western Canada in 1904 where he helped survey the route for the Grand Trunk Railway. He went on to edit Le Courrier de l'Ouest in Edmonton, Alberta, the first French-language newspaper west of Winnipeg, Manitoba.
A member of the Canadian Army in World War I, Brutinel initiated and commanded the Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade, the first fully mechanized unit of the British Army. His brigade played a significant part in halting the major German offensive of March 1918. From October 1916 until March 1918, Brutinel was Corps MG Officer of the Canadian Corps and, in addition to his decorations, he was 7 times Mentioned in Dispatches. He pioneered the virtues of mobility and concentration of firepower and developed the concept of indirect machine-gun fire.
In 1920 Brutinel returned to Europe, where he was a Creusot sales representative in the Balkans, but he retained many Canadian ties. Major-General Georges Vanier, Canadian ambassador to France and future Governor General of Canada, recorded the "considerable help" Brutinel provided in evacuating embassy staff from Paris in June 1940 in advance of the German occupation of France in World War II. In 1961 he became a member of the Canadian Institute of Mines and Metallurgy Fifty-Year Club.
Raymond Brutinel died in 1964 at Couloumé-Mondebat, Gers, France.

Samuel Bland Arnold (September 6, 1834 – September 21, 1906)Booth, p. 138 was involved in the plot to kidnap President Abraham Lincoln in 1865.
He and the other conspirators, John Wilkes Booth, David Herold, Lewis Powell, Michael O'Laughlen and John Surratt, were to kidnap Lincoln and hold him to exchange for the Confederate prisoners in Washington D.C.. This was attempted twice, but failed as Lincoln was not where they thought he would be.
Arnold and O'Laughlen dropped out of the conspiracy when the prisoner-exchange program started.
After Booth's April 14, 1865 assassination of Lincoln, Arnold was arrested on suspicion of complicity. He was actually relieved when he was arrested. During the trial, one of the chief witnesses was Louis J. Weichmann, a boarder at Mary Surratt's (John Surratt's mother).
Arnold was sentenced to life in prison at Fort Jefferson, along with Samuel Mudd, Michael O'Laughlen, and Edmund Spangler. In 1869 Arnold, Mudd, and Spangler were released after being pardoned by President Andrew Johnson (O'Laughlen had died in prison in 1867).
After Samuel Arnold returned home, he lived quietly out of the public eye for more than thirty years. In 1898 he returned to Fort Jefferson and took photographs of his old prison, but the photographs do not survive. In 1902 Arnold wrote a series of newspaper articles for the Baltimore American describing his imprisonment at Fort Jefferson.
Arnold died four years later on September 21, 1906. He is buried at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland. The only conspirator who survived with him was John Surratt.

[[Jack Mary Ann]]
CATEGORIES: Welsh folklore, British legendary characters

Jack Mary Ann is a folk hero whose legendary exploits in the Wrexham area of Wales in the 1920s and 1930s are celebrated in a series of jokes and tales transmitted in local oral tradition. Jack was a coal miner. Jack's nickname comes from the common practice of distinguishing local men (in an area known for its poverty of surnames) by the use of the wife's Christian or given name. Jack may be considered an archetypal trickster figure and the tales involve his various intrigues with hostile authority figures such as landlords, bailiffs and employers. His legendary activities celebrate his fecklessness and irresponsibility. Jack's quick tongue does not generally save him from the consequences of his actions but provides an ironic commentary on his plight and on the values of more respectable citizens. The popularity of the Jack Mary Ann tales may suggest an undercurrent of local opposition to the respectable and supposedly dominant norms of non-conformist Christianity generally held to be an expression of Welsh identity in this period.

Polo is among those contested at the Summer Olympic Games, and was held five times between 1900 and 1936. Equine events began at the Olympics in 1900, when competitions in polo and other equestrian events (considered by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be separate sports) were held.[tpl]cite web|author=Kubatko, Justin|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/POL/|title=Polo|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=February 13, 2010|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Olympic Equestrian: The Sports and the Stories from Stockholm to Sydney|author=Bryant, Jennifer O.|year=2000|publisher=The Blood-Horse, Inc|location=Canada|isbn=1-58150-044-0|pages=24–25[/tpl] 
Among the contestants were 87 men from nine countries. The youngest participant was 21-year-old Roberto Cavanagh from Argentina, while the oldest was 52-year-old Justo San Miguel of Spain. The top country medal winner was Great Britain with six medals. No equestrian had more than two medals, but four riders, all from Great Britain, won two medals each. In 1900, at the first appearance of the sport, all medals went to "mixed teams", while in the second appearance at the 1908 Games, all medals went to British teams.[tpl]cite web|author=Kubatko, Justin|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/POL/mens-polo.html|title=Polo Men's Polo Medalists|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=February 13, 2010|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com[/tpl]

Doug Anderson (born August 31, 1973 in Anderson, Indiana) is a Christian vocalist.
Basketball fans who watched Doug Anderson play for Lapel High School in the late 1980s probably had no idea what his post high school ambition really was.  They probably assumed that the all-county, all-state player, wanted to become a college and NBA star. Little did they know that this standout athlete, who went on to play for Purdue University, actually dreamed of being a full-time Gospel singer.
Doug was a product of a singing family and that his first love, indeed, was music. No one knew this more than Doug, himself, who believed with all his heart that God would one day allow him to live his dream of becoming a full-time quartet member.
That dream became a reality when Doug joined a quartet known as Lighthouse. His membership with Lighthouse led to a meeting with Ernie Haase when Lighthouse sang with Doug's favorite quartet, the Cathedrals. "Ernie was singing with the Cathedrals," Doug recalls, "and we developed a pretty good friendship. We had a mutual love for quartet music and basketball. Knowing one day that the Cathedrals would retire, Ernie told me if he ever started a group, he would call me. A few years later he did."
A small town boy at heart, Doug is thankful his career as a member of Signature Sound still allows him to live in his hometown of Lapel, IN. He and his wife, Michele, who were high school sweethearts, married in August of 1998. Michele shares Doug's love for sports, often calling him with scores and play-by-play updates when Doug is unable to watch a game due to his travels.
The couple has two beautiful daughters, Isabel and Emma, who already show promise of having that same love for athletics as their parents. Both enjoy watching and playing a variety of sports with their parents. "Family time is so precious," Doug says with a smile. "We spend every possible moment together."
In 2011 Doug released his first ever solo album, DREAMING WIDE AWAKE, and he was also nominated for Artist of the Year at the Dove Awards.
In 2014, Doug released his second album, DRIVE

Miloš Šejn (born 10 August 1947 in Jablonec nad Nisou) is a Czech artist (transliteration of the family name: Shein, Schein, Sein, Sejn). 
Born 1947 in Jablonec nad Nisou, Czech Republic, graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy (Charles University) in Prague in 1975 (visual art - Doc. Zdenek Sýkora, art history and aesthetics - professor Petr Wittlich, Doc. Milos Jůzl ). In 1976 Doctor of Philosophy, 1991 appointed professor of painting. In the years 1990-2011 he directed the Intermedia Department at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, a visiting professor at the Academies in Aix-en-Provence, Carrara, Ljubljana, Reykjavík, Stuttgart, The Hague and Vienna.
Milos Sejn works in the fields of visual art, performance and study of visual perception, and conducts workshops, such as Bohemiae Rosa. His artistic concept was formed in his youth when he undertook many trips into the wilderness as a reflection of an inner need to get closer to the secret of nature and observe the miracles that happen in it. From the beginning of the 1960s he took pictures, drew, collected and described his observations of nature during these wanderings. Currently he teaches privately mixed media and the relationship of nature and art as intrinsic needs of the mind, and focuses on immediate creative possibilities, based upon relations between historical humanized landscapes and intact nature. He consciously works in the areas of expressive language among text, visual stroke, body movement, voice, and expansion into space.

Dennis M. DeTurck (born July 15, 1954) is an American mathematician known for his work in partial differential equations and Riemannian geometry, in particular contributions to the theory of the Ricci flow and the prescribed Ricci curvature problem.  He first used the DeTurck trick to give an alternative proof of the short time existence of the Ricci flow and has found other uses since then.  
He received a B.S. (1976) from Drexel University where he stood out as an extraordinarily brilliant mathematician.  DeTurck was known for readily solving homework problems and then taking the issue a step further—wherever his creative mind led him.  DeTurck also was an accomplished flute player and lead the flute sections in a variety of music ensembles.  As a result of his energy and drive, he finished the 5-year program at Drexel in 4 years.
He received an M.A. (1978) and Ph.D. (1980) in mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania.  His Ph.D. supervisor was Jerry Kazdan.[tpl]MathGenealogy|id=23121[/tpl]

Line of Delirium and Emperors of Illusions are two 1995 books of a space opera trilogy by Russian science fiction writer Sergey Lukyanenko (Shadows of Dreams is a short prequel to Line of Delirium and is usually included in the second book). The story is told in third person, usually from the viewpoint of Kay Dutch (aka Kay Altos) — a professional bodyguard living in a post-war galaxy. The names of races, planets, and several leaders are borrowed from the computer game Master of Orion, although everything else in the trilogy is original, even the physical descriptions of several races.
These harsh novels are unusual for Lukyanenko — although heroes may evoke sympathy sometimes, none of them could be called positive. Strained action intertwines with insights on psychology of people living and succeeding in a nightmare.

[[Critical ethnography]]
CATEGORIES: Ethnography, Anthropology, Critical theory

Critical ethnography applies a critical theory based approach to ethnography. It  focuses on the implicit values expressed within ethnographic studies and, therefore, on the unacknowledged biases that may result from such implicit values.Soyini Madison, D. (2005). Critical ethnography: method, ethics, and performance. Retrieved from http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/4957_Madison_I_Proof_Chapter_1.pdf It has been called critical theory in practice.Thomas, J. (1993). Doing critical ethnography. Newbury Park, CA: Sage.  In the spirit of critical theory, this approach seeks to determine symbolic mechanisms, to extract ideology from action, and to understand the cognition and behaviour of research subjects within historical, cultural, and social frameworks. 
Critical ethnography incorporates reflexive inquiry into its methodology. Researchers employing this approach position themselves as being intrinsically linked to those being studied and thus inseparable from their context.Simon, R. I., & Dippo, D. (1986). On critical ethnographic work. Anthropology & Education Quarterly, 17(4), 195-202. In addition to speaking on behalf of subjects, critical ethnographers will also attempt to recognize and articulate their own perspective as a means of acknowledging the biases that their own limitations, histories, and institutional standpoints bear on their work. Further, critical ethnography is inherently political as well as pedagogical in its approach. There is no attempt to be purely detached and scientifically objective in reporting and analysis. In contrast to conventional ethnography which describes what is, critical ethnography also asks what could be in order to disrupt tacit power relationships and perceived social inequalities.

Captain Richard Aveline Maybery MC and Bar (1895–19 December 1917) was a Welsh flying ace of the First World War.
Maybery was born in Brecon, Wales, in January 1895, the only son of Aveline Maybery, a solicitor, and his wife Lucy. He was educated locally and at Wellington College, Berkshire, before going on to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst.
After his graduation he joined the 21st (Empress of India's) Lancers. At the outbreak of war he served in the North West Frontier province until he was injured in a riding accident. Bored during his rehabilitation and unable to sit on a horse he became involved in observing for a unit of the Royal Flying Corps who were based nearby.
Later he travelled to Egypt where he trained to be a pilot, before he was posted to France with 56 Squadron, serving with aces James McCudden, Arthur Rhys Davids and Keith Muspratt.
Aggressive and headstrong, Maybery quickly accumulated a high victory tally, and he scored his 21st and final victory, on 19 December 1917, when he shot down an Albatros DV over Bourlon Wood. Maybery's SE5a was then either hit by anti aircraft fire or shot down by Vzfw. Artur Weber of Jasta 5 and crashed near the village of Haynecourt.'Above the Trenches'; Shores (1990) page 264
Maybery was buried at Flesquieres Hill British Cemetery, Nord, France.
His wartime tally consisted of 14 and 2 shared destroyed, and 5 'out of control'.
A marble plaque dedicated to the memory of Richard Aveline Maybery, can be found in Brecon Cathedral. The plaque includes the prayer:

"Zotung, Chin " is one of the ethnic groups in Chin State in Myanmar as known as Burma. Its located in the south in Chin State. Zotung Mingphuin is a very distinct ethnic people in Burma. It is very difficult to get historical records of this ethnic people as they didn't have a written languages many years ago. But it still can be traced back as far to the year 1300 AD as there are the names of the places and traditional songs which can reveal the times being composed and the stories of ancient people. These people are from a Tibeto-Burman group and are familiar with all other Chin groups even though they have their own written language which is intelligible to others. These people called themselves "Zo Mingphuin" from the early times while others called them "Zotung" from during and after British rule. From 1931, their language was recorded using the Roman alphabet. It was called "Zo Ccaaw" (Zo Literature). Most of these people are farmers and prefer hunting animals for their meals like other Chin groups. In early history, the Zotung Mingphuin believed in Khozi as god and they used to pray to Khozi for their health, wealth and sins through Khuarum services. But when the western missionaries entered Chinland, the Zo people converted to Christianity between the 1930s and the present...
Rezua has been a subtownship of Matupi since 2003. In the area of Rezua township, there are many villages: Rovaw village is very closed with Rezua. Lekan is Lotu tribe, one of chin.

In the stated philosophy, a sin occurs when a person knowingly commits an evil act, meaning that they must know both:
If a person is ignorant of one of these two facts, then the type of ignorance becomes important. If the person is intentionally or willfully ignorant, this is known as vincible ignorance, and the act is still considered a sin. If, however, the person is unintentionally ignorant of one of these two key facts, then they are considered invincibly ignorant, and have committed an invincible error.Elements of Moral Theology

Staff Sergeant Denise Michelle Rose (died 31 October 2004) of the Royal Military Police's Special Investigation Branch was the first British female soldier to die in military operations in the Iraq War. Her death was later ruled to have been a suicide. Although this is very questionable due to the lack of clear evidence and the fact witness's where nowhere to be found on the day of the ruling.
Rose was found dead from a gunshot wound at the Army base in the Shatt-al-Arab Hotel, Basra, on 31 October 2004.
Rose was originally from Liverpool, England. She joined the Royal Military Police in 1989, and trained as an SIB investigator in 1995, conducting investigations into serious incidents within the military in the UK and Cyprus. She deployed as a volunteer to Iraq on 27 September 2004, operating as part of a small team of specialist investigators to provide security for the people of Iraq and assist in the rebuilding of the country through the provision of a well trained police force.

[[Battle of Maclodio]]

CATEGORIES: 1427 in Italy, Battles involving the Duchy of Milan, Battles involving the Republic of Venice, Conflicts in 1427

The Battle of Maclodio was fought on 11 October 1427, resulting in a victory for the Venetians under Carmagnola over the Milanese under Carlo I Malatesta. The battle was fought at Maclodio (or Macalo) a small town near the River Oglio, fifteen kilometres (nine miles) south-west of Brescia. This battle, fought during the second campaign, was the only decisive victory for Venice in the Wars in Lombardy. This battle forced the Milanese into a treaty, conceding Brescia in 1428, though fighting of the wars in Lombardy was to resume later, continuing until the Treaty of Lodi in 1454.
The war began with a pact between Venice and Florence to oppose Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, and his territorial ambitions. The Venetian commander for the battle, Carmagnola, had recently been under the employ of Milan but defected to Venice when Filippo Maria gave him governorship of Genoa rather than further military duty in an attempt to lessen his power. The doge of Venice, Francesco Foscari, was seriously considering helping Florence in their conflict against Milan, and Carmagnola spurred this on, persuading the doge to name him general in a new war against Milan.
Carmagnola quickly took Brescia for Venice, then made sure he campaigned very slowly, doing very little for a long time, forcing Venice to pay incredible amounts in upkeep for the almost useless army. Eventually the public was starting to catch on to this, so Carmagnola decided he needed another big victory to keep in command. He finally moved into enemy territory and met the army of Filippo Maria, under Carlo Malatesta, at Maclodio. 
The town itself was virtually destroyed in the battle, and the result was a decisive victory for Venice. Carmagnola was heavily praised and rewarded, being given a palace at San Stae that used to be the property of the Malatesta family, a fief in Bresciano, and a letter of appreciation from the doge. Public opinion of Carmagnola quickly soured again, however, as he released all 8,000 prisoners captured and decided not to advance on the defenceless Cremona. He then retired his army for the winter against Venetian wishes.
A short truce was offered by Milan, eventually granted by Venice on 19 April 1428, on the condition that Milan cede Bergamo and the surrounding area to them. This was the largest permanent land holdings that Venice would have for the rest of its history.A History of Venice, First Vintage Books Edition, Vintage Books, 1989. The Wars in Lombardy resumed two years later.

The Serb uprising in Banat in 1594 was one of the three largest uprisings in Serbian history against the Ottoman Empire, and the largest before the establishment of the autonomous Serbian state in the so-called First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813), led by Karađorđe Petrović.
In the Banat region, which then formed part of the Ottoman Eyalet of Temeşvar, in the area around Vršac, a large uprising began against the Ottoman Empire. The leader of this uprising was Teodor Nestorović, the Bishop of Vršac. Other leaders were Sava Ban and voivode Velja Mironić.
For a short time, the Serb rebels captured several cities in Banat, including Vršac, Bečkerek, and Lipova, as well as Titel and Bečej in Bačka. The size of this uprising is illustrated by the verse from one Serbian national song: "Sva se butum zemlja pobunila, Šest stotina podiglo se sela, Svak na cara pušku podigao!" ("The whole land has rebelled, six hundred villages arose, everybody pointed his gun against the emperor"). 
The rebellion had the character of a holy war, the Serb rebels carrying flags with the image of Saint Sava. Sinan Pasha, who led the Ottoman army, ordered the green flag containing Islamic calligraphy brought from Damascus to counter the Serbian flag, and burned the mortal remains of Saint Sava in Belgrade.
Eventually, the uprising was crushed, and most of the Serbs from this region, fearing Ottoman retaliation, fled to Transylvania, leaving the Banat region deserted. The Ottoman authorities, who needed population in this fertile land, promised clemency to all who returned. The Serb population did come back, but the authorities' mercy did not apply to the leader of the rebellion, Bishop Teodor Nestorović, who was flayed as a punishment.

Isaac Davis (February 23, 1745 – April 19, 1775) was a gunsmith and a militia officer who commanded a company of Minutemen from Acton, Massachusetts, during the first battle of the American Revolutionary War. In the months leading up to the Revolution, Davis set unusually high standards for his company in terms of equipment, training, and preparedness.  His company was selected to lead the advance on the British Regulars during the Battle of Concord because his men were entirely outfitted with bayonets.Ryan, "The Concord Fight and a Fearless Isaac Davis."French, 188-189.  During the American advance on the British at the Old North Bridge, Davis was among the first killed and was the first American officer to die in the Revolution.
Davis is memorialized through the Isaac Davis Monument on the Acton Town Common.  He was also the inspiration behind "The Minute Man," the sculpture at the Old North Bridge by Daniel Chester French.  The sculpture, which French attempted to model after Isaac Davis, is now an iconic national symbol.

The Toledo Maumees were a baseball team originally formed in 1888. The team was based in Toledo, Ohio, and formed part of the Tri-State League for one season. Their home games were played at Speranza Park in Toledo.
In 1889, the Maumees moved to the International Association, where they were also known as the Toledo Black Pirates. Managed by former player Charlie Morton, the team finished in fourth place with a 54-51 record. Toledo first baseman Perry Werden won the batting title with a .394 average and also led the league in hits (167). 
In 1890 the team joined  the American Association. Again with Morton at the helm, the Maumees won 68 games, lost 64, and finished fourth in the nine-team league. Their top hitters were right fielder Ed Swartwood, who batted .327 with a slugging percentage of .444, and first sacker Werden, who hit a .295 average and a .456 of slugging. Egyptian Healy (22-21, 2.89) and Fred Smith (19-13, 3.27) led the pitching staff.
At the end of the season, the team folded. To date, they are in no relation to the Toledo Black Pirates of 1892, a club member of the original Western League which was based in the city. Led by manager Ed MacGregor, the Black Pirates went 28-29 to finish 4th among the teams that did not fold during the season (the league itself folded on July 11).

"Wild West Hero" is a song by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), and the closing track and third single from the album Out of the Blue. The song was written by lead singer Jeff Lynne. Melvyn Gale, normally the band's cellist, provided the Western-style piano for this track.
It entered the UK Top 40 at No. 31 in June 1978 but fell to number 36 the following week.  Thanks to a rush-release in 12" format on yellow vinyl, its fortunes were reversed a week later, and within six weeks it had risen to a peak position of number 6. Coincidentally this was also the highest UK position achieved by the group's previous single, "Mr. Blue Sky", and the next two, "Sweet Talkin' Woman" and "Shine a Little Love".

[[STS-61 (disambiguation)]]
NASA flew a number of Space Shuttle missions in the early and mid-1980s with designations derived from STS-61.
The ambiguity was the result of a NASA decision to change designation of missions starting in Fiscal Year 1984. Previously, missions were designated in the order they were flown (i.e., STS-9 indicated the ninth shuttle mission). The new designation was designed to accommodate a dramatically increased launch manifest, address the addition of a west coast launch site and to resolve confusion from manifested missions not being flown in order due to delays. The new designation used a three-part designator following the term "STS". The first number represents the fiscal year of the launch, the second represents the launch location (1=Florida, 2=California) and the alphanumeric code represents the order launched (i.e., A is first, B is second, etc.). Therefore, the first mission using this designation, which was the tenth shuttle mission was STS 41B. It launched in FY 1984, from Florida and was the first to launch in that year.
As a result of the Challenger accident (STS 51L), a decision was made to no longer fly DoD payloads and commercial payloads on the orbiter and cancel flights from California. Thus, the manifest was dramatically reduced and NASA returned to the old designation with STS 26 and the return to flight in 1988. We still have the old confusion with assigned mission not being flown in order...
STS-61 itself was flown in 1993.

CATEGORIES: Donatários of the Azores, 1636 births, 1720 deaths, Portuguese nobility, Prime Ministers of Portugal, 17th-century Portuguese people, Regents of Portugal, 18th-century Portuguese people

Dom Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor (1636 – August 15, 1720) was a Portuguese politician and prime minister.
Portuguese royal favourite who, as effective governor of Portugal from 1662 to 1667 during the reign of Afonso VI, was responsible for the successful prosecution of the war against Spain, which led, in 1668, to Spanish recognition of Portugal's new ruling dynasty.
Shortly after Afonso VI's coming-of-age in 1662, Castelo Melhor saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the mentally unstable king. He managed to convince the king that his mother, Luisa of Medina-Sidonia, was out to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother was sent to a convent.
The King appointed Castelo Melhor his secret notary (escrivão da puridade), a position in which the favourite was able to exercise the functions of first minister.
Castelo Melhor overcame the difficulties which had hitherto beset Portugal in the war against Spain, reorganizing the troops (now reinforced by an English contingent by virtue of the English king Charles II's marriage to Catherine of Braganza) and entrusting their command to competent generals. Consequently the Portuguese Restoration War entered a victorious phase for Portugal (1663–65) and Spain began peace negotiations.
Agreement proved difficult to attain and meanwhile the internal political situation in Portugal deteriorated. Castelo Melhor and his Francophile party were losing ground to the Anglophile party. The King was obliged to dismiss Castelo Melhor on September 9, 1667, in a palace coup organized by the king's wife Maria Francisca of Nemours and brother Pedro . Shortly afterwards, the king himself was also deprived of power.
Castelo Melhor went into exile in Paris and then London, but in 1685 he was permitted to return to Portugal and, two years after that, to court. On the accession of John V (1706), he was appointed a councillor of state and he continued to occupy a position of distinction until his death in 1720.
He was also the 12th captain-major of Santa Maria Island in the Azores from 1667 to 1720.

Foundations of Economic Analysis is a book by Paul A. Samuelson published in 1947 (Enlarged ed., 1983) by Harvard University Press. It sought to demonstrate a common mathematical structure underlying multiple branches of economics from two basic principles: maximizing behavior of agents (such as of utility by consumers and profits by firms) and stability of equilibrium as to economic systems (such as markets or economies). Among other contributions, it advanced the theory of index numbers and generalized welfare economics.  It is especially known for definitively stating and formalizing qualitative and quantitative versions of the "comparative statics" method for calculating how a change in any parameter (say, a change in tax rates) affects an economic system. One of its key insights about comparative statics, called the correspondence principle, states that stability of equilibrium implies testable predictions about how the equilibrium changes when parameters are changed.

On the whole, this is a very fresh and rugged landscape, and without a doubt, the best part of Cabañeros 
In the Town Hall website www.navasdeestena.org, the Touristical Association Montes de Toledo www.turismocabaneros.com/Emglish/index.html and the Cultural Association of the Mountains of Toledo www.montesdetoledo.org there are numerous hiking routes scattered around the area and also by car to visit the nearby villages and the whole of the National Park. Some of the sights that must not be missed include: the Ermita viewpoint and the recreational areas of El Acebo and the Los Reales Dam

[[Adelidae]]
CATEGORIES: Adelidae

The Adelidae or fairy longhorn moths are a family of monotrysian moths in the lepidopteran infraorder Heteroneura. Most species have at least partially metallic patterns coloration and are diurnal, sometimes swarming around the tips of branches with an undulating flight. Others are crepuscular and have a drab coloration. Fairy longhorn moths have a wingspan of 4-28 millimeters, and males often have especially long antennae, 1-3 times as long as the forewing.
They are widespread across the world and can be found over much of North America and Eurasia from April to June. About 50 species occur in Europe, of which most widely noted is the Green Longhorn (Adela reaumurella) which can sometimes reach great abundance;  due to climate changeKuchlein & Ellis (2004) its peak flying season is shifting towards spring. In general, they are more plentiful in the Northern Hemisphere, but the family occurs in the Neotropics, sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and Australia too.Edwards (2007), FE (2009)
Adelidae are usually closely restricted to particular hostplants http://internt.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/research-curation/projects/hostplants/list.dsml?searchPageURL=browse.dsml&Family=Adelidae&Genus=&Species=&Country=&sort=Family, in which the females insert their eggs or just lay among leaf litter, and the caterpillars make a case, completing their development on the ground. Fairy longhorn moths feed in sunshine on nectar from the flowers of herbaceous (woody) plants.

His pen name Chan Mou (meaning Mister Chan). The last name "Chan" is a common one, which not only to portrays his modesty, but also allows him to be set apart from the mainstream authors. Before his manhua career, he was a graphic designer in the commercial advertising industry.
In the first volume of The Ravages of Time, he described his lack of interest in the current mainstream comic book market. However his own passion toward their action and pictures had motivated him to create his own comic.(in Chinese) http://www.sac.idv.tw/epaper/20030322TEST02/#TS
As a child, Chan was into sci-fi, cartoons, and Ultraman. He majored in visual arts at university. After his graduation, he got a job working as a graphic designer in the advertising field. He had experience with print ads in TV and newspaper and been involved with the top management.
Unsatisfied with simply assigning jobs, he was eventually aroused him to create his first independent work, Unhuman, and entered it into a few competitions.
Most of the his works are related to history, mixed with fables and fairy tales. A reporter once asked Chan about history versus fable, he answered that the true history does not exist. He believes that history is artificial, written by whoever conquers the country. As such, gathering all the fables and novels with history books could even possibly exceed the credibility of history books.

Dugald Livingstone (25 February 1898 – 15 January 1981), commonly known as "Duggie", "Doug" or "Dug", was a Scottish football player and manager.
He played fullback for Parkhead, Ashfield, Celtic, Dumbarton Harp (loan), Everton,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.evertonfpf.org/players/dugald-livingstone/ |title=Dugald Livingstone |publisher=evertonfpf.org |date=6 July 2011[/tpl] Plymouth Argyle, Aberdeen and Tranmere Rovers during an illustrious playing career before hanging up his boots and going into management.Michael Joyce, Football League Players' Records 1888 to 1939, Nottingham, 2004, p. 159
During his managerial career, Livingstone took charge of the Republic of Ireland from 1951 to 1953, before managing Belgium,http://www.scottishkanaries.eu/Storys/Connections/Dugald%20Livingstone.htm guiding them to the 1954 FIFA World Cup and notably was in charge for the thrilling 4–4 draw with England in the group stages.
After success with Belgium he moved on to manage Newcastle United in 1954. Some supporters and staff were at first concerned that his tactics were in total contrast to those of his predecessor George Martin, but these doubts were laid to rest when he guided the team to FA Cup victory in 1955. The Newcastle board had the final say in which players would be playing during his spell at the club and they notably played Jackie Milburn for this final, against Livingstone's wishes. Milburn coincidentally scored in the match.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.toon1892.co.uk/detail_manager.php?id=7 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20111009052438/http://www.toon1892.co.uk/detail_manager.php?id=7 |archivedate=9 October 2010 |title=Doug Livingstone|work=Manager details|publisher= toon1892 |accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl]
It was largely believed that Livingstone was unhappy with the amount of influence the board had on first team issues (although he never stated this). He left Newcastle in 1956 and went on to manage Fulham between 1956 and 1958http://www.fulhamfc.com/history/managers/dugald-livingstone and then Chesterfield until 1962.http://www.cfchistory.com/managers-livingstone

[[Any Human Heart]]

CATEGORIES: Novels by William Boyd, Novels about writers, Fictional diaries, Hamish Hamilton books, 2002 novels

Any Human Heart: The Intimate Journals of Logan Mountstuart is a 2002 novel by William Boyd, a Scottish writer.  It is written as a lifelong series of journals kept by Mountstuart, a writer whose life (1906–1991) spanned the defining episodes of the 20th century, crossed several continents and included a convoluted sequence of relationships and literary endeavours. Boyd uses the diary form to explore how public events impinge on individual consciousness, so that Mountstuart’s journal alludes almost casually to the war, the death of a prime minister or the abdication of the king.  Boyd plays ironically on the theme of literary celebrity, introducing his protagonist to several real writers who are included as characters – a spat with Virginia Woolf in London, a possible sexual encounter with Evelyn Waugh at Oxford, a clumsy exchange with James Joyce in Paris, and a friendship with Ernest Hemingway that spans several years.
Boyd spent 30 months writing the novel. The journal style, with its gaps, false starts and contradictions, reinforces the theme of the changing self in the novel. Many plot points simply fade away. The novel received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation was made with the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010.

The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens is a 1953 collection of stories by science fiction and fantasy author L. Sprague de Camp, the fifth book in his Viagens Interplanetarias series. It was first published in hardcover by Twayne Publishers, and in paperback by Signet Books in 1971 with a cover by illustrator Bob Pepper.[tpl]cite book | last=Laughlin | first=Charlotte | coauthors=Daniel J.

The pieces were originally published between 1949 and 1951 in the magazines Astounding Science-Fiction, Startling Stories, Future Combined with Science Fiction, and Thrilling Wonder Stories. 
The book is a collection of most of de Camp's early "Viagens Interplanetarias" tales, all of which are set in a future in which interstellar travel between the Solar System and nearby stellar systems inhabited by alien races is common, and an Interplanetary Council regulates relations between the various civilizations. Terrans and the reptilian natives of the planet Osiris are the main spacefaring peoples. The tales take place in the period from the mid-21st-century to the mid-twenty-second. Individual stories are set on spaceships traveling between planets and individual planets such as Earth, Krishna, Ganesha and Osiris (it being assumed that Terrans will have carried their penchant for naming planets after gods to other star systems).
Notable features of the postulated future include an Earth governed by a World Federation in which Brazil has become the paramount great power, with Terran space travel monopolized by a Brazilian-dominated agency called the Viagens Interplanetarias ("Interplanetary Tours" in Portuguese). Interstellar travel is limited to sub-light speeds, as the author eschews such common science fiction gimmicks as hyperdrives.

Norman Smith (15 December 1897 – 1978) was a footballer and later manager. He was born in Newburn, Newcastle upon Tyne, England.
During his playing career he played for sides including Huddersfield Town & Sheffield Wednesday.
Stan Seymour appointed Smith as his assistant at Newcastle United in 1939 and he helped contribute to the club's success in the 1950s. The loyalty he had shown by staying at the club for twenty-two years was rewarded in 1961 when he was appointed the new manager of the club, following Charlie Mitten's sacking. While he only won twelve games out of thirty-five during his period in charge, this was enough to stave off relegation to the Third Division, which had looked a distinct possibility when Mitten was sacked, and he still had the respect of the fans for staying with the club for so long and showing a passion for the club. He stepped down as manager at the end of the season and was succeeded by Joe Harvey, though Smith remained at the club in various other capacities for several more years.
The club was in mourning sixteen years later in 1978, when Smith suddenly died. He was on his way home from Newcastle's stadium St James' Park after watching the team play.

[[Corner (route)]]
CATEGORIES: American football plays

A corner route is a pattern run by a receiver in American football, where the receiver runs up the field and then turns at approximately a 45-degree angle, heading away from the quarterback towards the sideline.[tpl]Cite book |title=Football skills & drills |first=Tom |last=Bass |page=96 |publisher=Human Kinetics |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7360-5456-0[/tpl] Usually, the pass is used when the defensive back is playing towards the inside shoulder of the receiver, thus creating a one on one vertical matchup. The corner route is less likely to be intercepted when compared to the slant route, because it is thrown away from the middle of the field. The pass is used frequently in the West Coast offensive scheme, where quick, accurate throwing is key.[tpl]Cite book |title=Football's West Coast offense |first1=Frank |last1=Henderson |first2=Mel |last2=Olson |publisher=Human Kinetics |year=1997 |page=55 |isbn=978-0-88011-662-6[/tpl] The pass may also be used closer to the goal line in what is called a "fade". The quarterback will lob the ball over a beaten defender to a wide receiver at the back corner of the end zone.

CATEGORIES: Deep Purple songs, 1972 songs, Songs written by Ritchie Blackmore, Songs written by Ian Gillan, Songs written by Roger Glover, Songs written by Jon Lord, Songs written by Ian Paice

"Lazy" is a song by Deep Purple from their 1972 album Machine Head. A live performance of the song can be found on the album Made in Japan, released later the same year. 
The song starts out as an instrumental, keyboardist Jon Lord plays an overdriven Hammond organ intro, followed by the main riff and with the solo swapping between him and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. Vocalist Ian Gillan comes in with the vocals later in the song. He also uses harmonica both on the studio version and live. At over 7 minutes long, it is the longest track on the album, and live versions were often extended past 10 minutes.
The live version on Made in Japan features a theme from Hugo Alfvén's "Swedish Rhapsody #1", played by Ritchie Blackmore as a part of his solo. Additionally, Jon Lord includes the riff from the C Jam Blues in the intro.
Ritchie Blackmore would sometimes include the main riff from "Lazy" in live performances of the song "Man on the Silver Mountain" by Rainbow. Gillan defined the song as rhythm and blues.
Later live performances after the band's reunion in 1984 tended to be much shorter, cutting out the intro and one of the verses. However, more recent performances with Steve Morse have gone back to  the original arrangement.
Readers of Guitar World voted "Lazy" the 74th greatest guitar solo of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guitar.about.com/library/bl100greatestg.htm |title=Guitar World 100 Greatest Guitar Solos |work=about.com |accessdate=2010-03-25[/tpl]

[[Genetic assimilation]]
CATEGORIES: Selection

Genetic assimilation is a process by which a phenotype originally produced in response to an environmental condition, such as exposure to a teratogen, later becomes genetically encoded via artificial selection or natural selection.  Despite superficial appearances, this does not require the inheritance of acquired characters, although epigenetic inheritance could potentially influence the result.  Genetic assimilation is merely a method of overcoming the barrier to selection imposed by genetic canalization of developmental pathways.
If there is no canalization of a developmental pathway, genetic variation of pathway components results in a continuous spectrum of phenotypes, often distributed in a bell curve.  In these cases artificial selection can be done in a straightforward way, by choosing offspring from one end of the curve and using them to breed the next generation.  However, when a pathway is strongly canalized, all of the individuals, except perhaps a few at the furthest extreme of the bell curve, physically look the same regardless of their genotype under normal environmental circumstances.  However, a given genetic make-up does not predetermine the same outcome under all possible circumstances; instead, it determines a norm of reaction that varies with the environment (phenotypic plasticity).  There may be a way to stress an organism so that canalization breaks down, and many aberrant individuals can be selected for further breeding; these are said to phenocopy the desired genetic trait.  With several generations of artificial selection in this manner, perhaps aided by mutagenesis, the genetic variation can be reduced to that of the furthest extreme of the original population, until canalization is overwhelmed even under normal environmental conditions.  At this point the environmentally induced abnormality has been duplicated genetically.
thumb|350 px|right The classic example of genetic assimilation was a 1953 experiment by C. H. Waddington, in which Drosophila embryos were exposed to ether, producing a bithorax-like phenotype[tpl]cite book |author=Gilbert, Scott F. |chapter=Induction and the Origins of Developmental Genetics |chapterurl=http://9e.devbio.com/article.php?id=27&search=Genetic%20assimilation |title=A Conceptual History of Modern Embryology |publisher=Plenum Press |location=NY |year= |isbn= |pages=181–206 [/tpl] (a homeotic change)  Flies which developed halteres with wing-like characteristics and were chosen for breeding for 20 generations, by which point the phenotype could be seen without ether treatment.

[[City (artwork)]]

CATEGORIES: 2000s works, Land art, Buildings and structures in Lincoln County, Nevada, Outdoor sculptures in Nevada, Visitor attractions in Lincoln County, Nevada

City is a piece of earth art located in Garden Valley, a desert valley in rural Lincoln County in the U.S. state of Nevada, near the border with Nye County.  The work was begun in 1972 by the artist Michael Heizer and is ongoing.  Like his previous Double Negative (1969), City is designed and executed on a massive scale.  Covering a space approximately one and a quarter miles long and more than a quarter of a mile wide (2 km by 0.4 km, roughly the scale of the National Mall), City is one of the largest sculptures ever created.  Using earth, rocks and concrete as building materials and assembled with heavy machinery, the work comprises five phases, each consisting of a number of structures referred to as complexes, with some of the structures reaching a height of eighty feet.  
City attempts to synthesize ancient monuments, Minimalism and industrial technology. The work derives inspiration from Mississippian mounds, Mesoamerican ball courts and Pre-Columbian sites like La Venta as well as Modernism.  Heizer also cites an interest in the ceremonial squares and associated civic monuments of cites.
In recent years the work has been threatened by the proposed Yucca Mountain Repository, a U.S. Department of Energy terminal storage facility for spent nuclear reactor and other radioactive waste.  The proposed route for the railroad that would ferry the waste from Caliente to the disposal site cuts across the same valley as City, and would come within its sightline.  Heizer feels this will threaten his sculpture, as the location was selected for its isolation, and prefers to see the tracks redirected through nearby Coal Valley and Murphy Gap.
The cost of City is being financed by several patrons, including the Dia Art Foundation and Lannan Foundation, with an estimated cost of well over twenty five million USD. The work is located on a large parcel of private land owned by the artist and is closed to the public until its completion.  Heizer is currently completing the work with a team of roughly a dozen and, as of 2005, anticipated completion before 2010. As of Spring 2013 City is not yet open to the public, but photos may be seen here

[[Sidney Freeman]]

Sidney Thomas Freeman (21 August 1888 – 6 June 1971) was an English cricketer, who played six first-class matches between 1919 and 1921, three each for Gloucestershire and HK Foster's XI.
''Excerpt from The Evening Star and Daily Herald, Thursday, June 24, 1920.
"Although everything was dwarfed by the brilliant innings of 144 by F. G. Robinson. great credit must be given to S. T. Freeman, a young amateur, who was making his first appearance for Gloucestershire. The importance of the occasion seemed to affect him not at all, and playing extremely confidently from the outset, he put together 45 of the best by sound cricket, his partnership with his captain releasing 158 runs in ninety-five minutes."''
All of Freeman's ten first-class wickets came in his two games for HK Foster's XI, both against Worcestershire in 1919. His best figures of 4-31 were achieved on his debut that July at Hereford, his first wicket being that of Arthur Jewell, the nephew of future Worcestershire captain Maurice Jewell. In another match against the same opponents in August he was caught and bowled for 58, a career best score, by John Coventry, another future Worcestershire captain; this was Coventry's first first-class wicket. A nice symmetry was achieved when Freeman in turn dismissed Coventry in the second innings.
Freeman's last game was against Glamorgan, playing in only their third first-class match; Gloucestershire won by the emphatic margin of an innings and 191 runs, but Freeman contributed only five runs (albeit not out) and a catch; he did not bowl a ball.
Freeman was born in Norton, Gloucester; he died in Whitbourne, Herefordshire at the age of 82.

In that capacity, Shane became a seminal figure in the revival of folk and other acoustic music as a popular art form  in the U.S. in the late 1950s through the mid-1960s.
The success of the Kingston Trio in its heyday had repercussions far beyond its voluminous album sales (including four albums simultaneously in the Top 10 in 1959), its host of imitators, and the relatively short-lived pop-folk boom it created. For the Kingston Trio's success took acoustic folk-based music out of the niche market it had occupied prior to the Trio's arrival and moved it into the mainstream of American popular music, opening the door for major record labels to record and market both more traditional folk musicians and singer-songwriters as well.Bruce Eder, "The Kingston Trio,"''AllMusic Guide.

[[Citizen Steely Dan]]
CATEGORIES: 1993 compilation albums, Steely Dan compilation albums

Citizen Steely Dan is a four-CD boxed set musical album by Steely Dan, released in 1993. The set is a collection of all of Steely Dan's albums (up to 1993) in chronological order, and also contains a non-album single (FM (No Static at All)), a non-album B-side ("Bodhisattva (Live)"), a rare compilation track ("Here at the Western World"), recorded during the sessions for The Royal Scam but released only on the 1978 Greatest Hits (it had never, of course, been a 'hit');  and a previously unreleased demo of "Everyone's Gone to the Movies" (a song from their 1975 album Katy Lied).
The set is not, however, a complete compilation of every track released by Steely Dan up to 1993.  Missing are both sides of the band's 1972 debut single ("Dallas" b/w "Sail the Waterway"), neither of which has ever been re-issued on CD. This is due to the band's dislike of the songs and refusal to allow them to be reissued.
Until 1998, this was the only place to find the remastered versions of the Steely Dan albums. However, because the albums were split up irregularly amongst the discs (in some cases with the track order changed), the remastered studio albums were issued in 1998, albeit without bonus tracks.
The first pressing features "Rikki Don't Lose That Number" using the single edit of the song. This version omits the percussive opening for the song. The second pressing of the boxed set features the version from the album although it was reissued without any information noting the change. 
Glen Meadows mastered the CD set from the digital masters archived by Donald Fagan, Gary Katz and Roger Nichols in 1982. These digital tapes were prepared because the original analog tapes were in very poor shape and Nichols. The earliest CD mastering for all the Steely Dan albums in 1985 used these tapes but MCA inexplicably used deteriorating analog masters for all later CD pressings until the 1998 remasters. This information was discovered by Roger Nichols in 1991 when he was asked his opinion of the Mobile Fidelity Gold reissues of "Aja" and "Gaucho". Nichols discovered that the " 'Gaucho' CD was even a different speed, about a quarter tone sharper" when compared to the original CD that he was involved in.http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/18crime.htm
The 1993 boxed set remaster was the first time since the originally issued CDs that the albums used the correct source tape.

Its people were ancestors of the modern Berber people.Gabriel Camps, L'origin des berbères Berbers occupied the area for thousands of years before the beginning of human records in Ancient Egypt. Climate changes affected the locations of the settlements.
More narrowly, Libya could also refer to the country immediately west of Egypt, viz. Marmarica (Libya Inferior) and Cyrenaica (Libya Superior). The Libyan Sea or Mare Libycum was the part of the Mediterranean south of Crete, between Cyrene and Alexandria.

Stracchino also known as crescenza is a type of Italian cow’s-milk cheese, typical of Lombardy, Piedmont, and Veneto. It is eaten very young, has no rind and a very soft, creamy texture and normally a mild and delicate flavour. It is normally square in form.  
The name of the cheese derives from the Italian word "stracca", meaning "tired". It is said that the milk from tired cows coming down in the autumn from the alpine pastures, is richer in fats and more acidic. These qualities were discovered, according to legend, in the milk of cows who were moved seasonally, up and down the Alps to different pastures. The milk of such cows gives the cheese its characteristic flavors.
Stracchino is usually eaten on its own, but in Recco on the Ligurian riviera east of Genoa it is used as the filling for focaccia col formaggio, and in Romagna (portion of the Emilia Romagna region) and elsewhere (north portion of Marche region, Umbria and east portion of Tuscany) in piadina.

Sylvanus Freelove Bowser (8 August 1854[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]3 October 1938) was an American inventor who is widely credited with inventing the automobile fuel pump. Bowser Avenue in his hometown of Fort Wayne, Indiana is named after him.[tpl]cite web | url=http://jordan.fortwayne.com/ns/projects/south/se1.php | title=Then - Bowser Avenue in the 1920s was the center of the universe to many | last=Zuber | first=Connie Haas | publisher=The News-Sentinel | date=2000-10-25 | accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Bowser, marketed his patented kerosene pump starting in 1885. The introduction of automobiles, mainly powered by gasoline, led him to develop it into the "Self-Measuring Gasoline Storage Pump", launched in 1905.
Bowser's invention operated with a manual suction pump, which dispensed the gasoline into the car through a flexible hose. The 50-gallon metal storage tank, housed in a wooden cabinet, could be set up at the curbside in front of a store.
Under the banner of his company, S. F. Bowser & Company, this activity expanded to the measurement and handling of many commercial liquids. Bowser opened branches around the world, and bowser became a generic term for fuel dispensers, then fuel tankers (especially on airfields), then finally for any kind of self-propelled liquid tanker with the ability to dispense direct to consumers.
In New Zealand and Australia it is still a generic term for consumer fuel pumps, while in the United Kingdom it refers to wheeled water tankers (either automotive or towed) used to supply fresh water to areas where normal supplies have been interrupted.
The Bowser company was acquired in 1969 by Keene Corporation; the vacuum oil purification side of the business was divested by Keene in 1978, subsequently trading under the name Enervac.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.enervac.com/index2.html | title=Enervac Corporation | accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl]  Keene filed for bankruptcy in 1993 due to a large number of asbestos-related lawsuits.

[[George Manross]]
CATEGORIES: Living people, Year of birth missing (living people), University of Southern California alumni

George Gary Manross, Ph.D., is a behavioral scientist with more than 25 years experience in marketing and communications management, marketing consulting, political consulting, and in applied research (marketing research, policy research, and political research). He is the Chairman and CEO of the Strategy Research Institute located in Fullerton, California.  A leader in designing and conducting public opinion surveys, Dr. Manross is an influential figure in California politics.  He is somewhat controversial in his field, implementing innovative methods.  Despite the criticism, Dr. Manross' results are often astonishingly accurate.
Prior to founding SRI, Dr. Manross held executive-level positions with two Fortune 500 companies, as well as with the largest state trade association in America, the California Association of Realtors, and the largest public relations agency in the world, Hill & Knowlton, Inc. He began his career as Business Editor for a metropolitan daily newspaper.
Dr. Manross has taught at UCLA and at USC, and was Associate Professor of Communications in the California State University system, where he held a joint appointment in Advertising and Public Relations. He was the head of the Advertising Sequence when he left academe; during this period, he taught courses in applied research, integrated marketing communications (IMC), management, advertising, and public relations at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
Dr. Manross' publishing record includes numerous refereed academic journals, including the top-ranked paper internationally in the Human Communications Technology Group of the International Communication Association (ICA), which was subsequently published as a chapter in Communication Yearbook 10.
His research is routinely cited in both the scholarly and popular press and in classic textbooks, such as Diffusion of Innovations (Everett M. Rogers, 1995, 4th ed., Free Press, N.Y.). Dr. Manross is senior author of a paper with Dr. Rogers that will soon be submitted to the Harvard Business Review. He also authored a book entitled: The Impact of Theory-driven Public Opinion Research in Strategic Planning for Winning Campaigns, Carlton Press, NY.
His academic credentials include a Ph.D. in Communication Research from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California, in addition to two MA degrees (one in communication management and one in communication theory), and a BA degree in Public Relations from the University of Southern California
Dr. Manross recently conducted influential polls for the 2006 November election cycle in the State of California.  For example, his findings that predicted an overwhelming victory for Chuck Reed was scoffed at by the media until Reed defeated his opponent, Cindy Chavez, by 19 points to become the mayor of San Jose;  and, a $1.7 billion sales tax measure dedicated to public transportation and public transit in Fresno County, which was driven by the "findings" from two SRI voter surveys, received 77.7% voter support.

The libretto is by Irish poet Paul Muldoon based on a treatment co-written with the composer. The story of the Venetian Moor is recast and updated to 1968 by combining elements of the original Venetian story, William Shakespeare's Othello, Giuseppe Verdi's opera Otello, and new, original characters and situations. The opera's unifying concept is the idea of the borderlines between emotional, metaphysical and moral states. The commission itself is notable for two reasons: first, it stipulated that there be no strings (other than the customary string basses associated with symphonic band) in the pit, second, it was financed by a consortium of over one hundred college bands from across the United States, all members of the College Band Directors National Association.

Cyathea kermadecensis is a species of tree fern endemic to Raoul Island in the Kermadec Islands, where it is locally common in damp, and sometimes drier, forest and scrub. The trunk of this plant is erect, slender, and up to 20 m tall. It is often covered with scars of old stipe-bases. Fronds are tripinnate and up to 4 m in length. The rachis and stipe are both brown in colouration and bear basal scales that are brown, glossy, and often twisted. Sori are borne on either side of the pinnule midvein. They are covered by hood-like indusia.
Braggins and Large (2004) note that C. kermadecensis is similar to Cyathea cunninghamii.
C. kermadecensis should be cultivated in good humus and provided shade as well as shelter from the wind. Nevertheless, it is a hardy species that will survive full sun and slight frost.
The specific epithet kermadecensis refers to the Kermadec Islands. C. kermadecensis is one of two tree fern species endemic to the islands, the other being Cyathea milnei.

Ruth apRoberts (died March 26, 2006) was a Canadian scholar of Victorian and religious literature. Her work focused on 19th-century British literature as it intersected with philosophical issues and spiritual traditions.
Born as Ruth Heyer in 1919 in Vancouver, British Columbia, she received her bachelor's degree from the University of British Columbia and her master's degree from UC Berkeley. After raising her four children, she received her PhD in English from UCLA. She was the widow of Robert apRoberts, a scholar of Welsh descent who taught medieval literature at California State University in Northridge.
At the University of California in Riverside, Ruth apRoberts held the positions of Graduate Advisor and Chair of the English Department. She taught courses in Victorian literature, the Aesthetic Movement, and the Bible as literature. She held a Guggenheim Fellowship (1978–79).
She was awarded the UCR Distinguished Teaching Award in 1977, and the Distinguished Emeritus Award in 1995.
She was the author of four books: The Moral Trollope (1971), which explored the aesthetic and ethical dimensions of the novels of Anthony Trollope; Arnold and God (1983) which probed the anti-literal understandings of religion that permeate all of Matthew Arnold's poetry and social criticism; The Ancient Dialect (1988) which analyzed the writing of Thomas Carlyle in relation to the study of comparative religions; and The Biblical Web (1994) which provided a purely literary analysis of the Christian Bible and the Hebrew Torah, focusing on the resonances and influence of their language.
At the time of her death, Katherine Klux Kinney, chair of the Department of English at UC Riverside had this to say: "Ruth apRoberts helped shape the intellectual culture of our department. As a scholar of the highest reputation and accomplishment, she led by example.

[[London Underground 1920 Stock]]

CATEGORIES: London Underground electric multiple units

The 1920 Tube Stock consisted of forty cars built by Cammell Laird in Nottingham, England. These cars were the first new tube cars to be built with air operated doors. The batch consisted of twenty trailer and twenty control trailer cars, which were formed into six-car trains by the addition of twenty French motor cars built in 1906 and modified for air-door operation. They initially ran on the Piccadilly tube, but in 1930 were considered to be drab, compared to new stock being delivered at the time. The motor cars were therefore replaced by Standard Stock units, built in 1927, and the 1920 cars were refurbished. They were transferred to the Bakerloo line in 1932, and continued to operate until 1938.
A second planned refurbishment so that they could be used on the Northern City Line shuttle service between Moorgate and Finsbury Park stations was interrupted by the Second World War, and after hostilities ceased, 35 of the cars were scrapped. The remaining five were formed into an instruction train, and were moved around the system to act as a mobile classroom until they were scrapped in 1968.

[[Selection cutting]]
CATEGORIES: Forest management

Selection cutting is the silvicultural practice of harvesting trees in a way that moves a forest stand towards an uneven-aged or all-aged condition, or 'structure'. Using stocking models derived from the study of old growth forests, '"Selection cutting"', also known as 'selection system', or 'selection silviculture', manages the establishment, continued growth and final harvest of multiple age classes (usually three) of trees within a stand. This type of silviculture is generally considered to be more difficult to implement and maintain than even-aged silviculture, due to the difficulty of managing multiple age classes in a shared space, but there are significant ecological benefits associated with it. Uneven-aged forests generally exhibit higher levels of vertical structure (key for many species of birds and mammals), have higher levels of carbon sequestration, and produce a more constant flow or market and non-market forest resources than even-aged forests.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] This method of silviculture also protects forest soils from the adverse effects of many types of even-aged silviculture, including nutrient loss, erosion and soil compaction and the rapid loss of organic material from a forested system. Selection silviculture is especially adept at regenerating tolerant species of trees (those able to function under conditions of low solar energy), but can also be modified to suit the regeneration and growth of intolerant and mid-tolerant species.

[[European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition]]

CATEGORIES: Epidemiological study projects, Nutrition, Cancer organizations

The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study is a Europe-wide prospective cohort study of the relationships between diet and cancer, as well as other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. With over half a million participants, it is the largest study of diet and disease to be undertaken. 
EPIC is coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, and funded by the "Europe Against Cancer" programme of the European Commission as well as multiple nation-specific grants and charities. 
521,457 healthy adults, mostly aged 35–70 years, were enrolled in 23 centres in ten European countries: Denmark (11%), France (14%), Germany (10%), Greece (5%), Italy (9%), The Netherlands (8%), Norway (7%), Spain (8%), Sweden (10%) and the United Kingdom (17%). One UK centre (Oxford) recruited 27,000 vegetarians and vegans; this subgroup forms the largest study of this dietary group. Recruitment to the study took place between 1993 and 1999, and follow up is planned for at least ten years, with repeat interview/questionnaires every three to five years. The main prospective data collected are standardised dietary questionnaires (self-administered or interview-based), seven-day food diaries, blood samples and anthropometric measurements, such as body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio. Additionally, the GenAir case-control study is studying the relationship of passive smoking and air pollution with cancers and respiratory diseases.
Up to 2004, there were over 26,000 new cases of cancer recorded among participants, with the most common being cancers of the breast, colorectum, prostate and lung. Current analyses are focusing particularly on stomach, colorectal, breast, prostate and lung cancers. The different dietary patterns in the different countries should enable reliable associations to be made between particular diets and cancers. The analysis of stored blood samples should also allow dissection of genetic factors involved in cancers, as well as the effects of hormones and hormone-like factors.

[[Tyrant (Australian band)]]

CATEGORIES: Tasmanian musical groups, Australian heavy metal musical groups, Musical quintets

TYRANT (Tyrant Australia) are a hard rock/heavy metal band from Tasmania, Australia.
The band originally formed in the early 1980s as an AOR band called, Slyder – by 2 brothers, Andrew and Robert Zarins. In 1983, childhood friend Neil Wilson joined as singer and the band changed their name to Tyrant enlisting Grant Wallace as second guitarist and began playing a harder-edged style of blues-influenced rock in the style of AC/DC, Rose Tattoo and The Angels. Tyrant were also influenced by countless Overseas metal acts including, Motorhead, Saxon, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Accept.
In 1984, Tyrant released a four-track EP titled Never Too Loud, which topped the metal charts on the local radio stations and gained them a massive following in Tasmania. A successful tour of Tasmania followed, including a show at the Hobart City Hall in front of 2000 people. Tyrant moved to Sydney, becoming one of the leading hard rock bands in the city. Amazingly, Tyrant 'headlined' the inaugural "Metal Crusade" show in 1985, the lineup being: Tyrant, Bengal Tigers, Shy Thunder, Statez and Vice before 1800 metalheads. Despite 'rave' reviews in both RAM and Juke magazines at the time, a strong fantical fan base, a record deal never eventuated with Tyrant splitting up in late 1986 due to different musical interests among the band members.
In 1987, brothers Andy and Roberet Zarins re-formed Slyder, which split up again in 1990 after releasing one single titled "Dreams".
Meanwhile, Neil Wilson and fellow Tyrant member, guitarist Grant Wallace formed a band called in 1987 called, The Law and played for a couple of years in Sydney, until both Wilson and Wallace formed a band called, "Sonic Temple" which was a concept band for UK rockers, The Cult.
In 1998 Tyrant reformed again with the original line-up, Neil 'Steel' Wilson, Grant Wallace, Andrew Zarins and  Robert Zarins – returning to a packed house on 11 November 2000 at the Iron Duke Hotel in Sydney. Tyrant delivered many shows over the next couple of years, recording two full-length albums Freaks of Nature (2000) and Thunder Down Under (2003) before playing their 'last show' together with childhood heroes, Rose Tattoo. The band now middle aged, moved onto married life with the exception of Wilson.
Vocalist Neil Wilson returned to Tasmania in 2004, forming a NEW line-up of Tyrant which released a live CD in 2005 titled, Live Bootleg. The new CD exposed a band that was far more ferocious, than the previous incarnation with the sound shifting its style musically speaking, with Tyrant moving away from their AC/DC, Rose Tattoo roots to a more modern and heavier metal sound with the new lineup consisting of vocalist, Neil Wilson, Brett Collidge on guitars, Simon Wilson guitars, Jason Smith bass guitar, and Nathan Sproule on drums. While only being a 'bootleg' recording, the new Tyrant was far more together musically with a fearsome beast displayed over the recording.
In August 2008 Tyrant singer, Neil Wilson was returning home from a recording session for the bands' "25th Anniversary" project that was underway, when Wilson was involved in a 'head on' car accident, luckily escaping with relative minor injuries.
Recording of the "Anniversary" CD re-commenced in early 2009 with 2 new songs, albeit in 'demo' form titled, "Running From The Law" and "Defenders Of The Faith" uploaded to the bands' My Space page (TyrantAustralia) – the first new studio recordings by Tyrant since 2003.
The "Save The Devil" (demo edition) was released March 2011 containing 10 songs of attitude fuelled, obnoxious hard rock metal that sees the Tasmanian metal act deliver possibly their finest effort to date. Full of barn storming anthems, a cool cover and a ballad - "Save The Devil" was recorded at Izaneer studios, in Tasmania - and was the fifth self-financed CD by TYRANT being engineered, mixed and produced by Brett Collidge. A number of videos have been up loaded to YouTube including a new song, 'Lay Down The Law' off the latest CD.
On 19 August 2011 saw the inception of a new "All Star" TYRANT at the Brisbane Hotel in Hobart. The new line up features members from Raise the Flag, Rogue Sharks, Hammerhead and Roadkill. 
The new 'SPECIAL EDITION' of the "Save The Devil" CD is to be issued 1 June 2012 - which is remixed and mastered, being produced by Michael Shelley in Hobart at the Green Room studios and includes different artwork and contains 8 songs! TYRANT return to the stage playing in Hobart on 18 May 2012 - supporting US metal legend, TIM RIPPER OWENS on his first Australian solo tour!

CATEGORIES: 1915 songs, Songs with lyrics by Bert Kalmar, Songs with music by Jean Schwartz, Songs written by Edgar Leslie

Hello, Hawaii, How Are You? is a song written in 1915, by Jean Schwartz, Bert Kalmar and Edgar Leslie.
The song refers to one of Marconi's then-new radio-oriented inventions, the Wireless Telephone, which became publicly available that year. It was initially very expensive to use, and this song underscores the caller's desperation to talk to his or her sweetheart in Hawaii, from his or her home in New York City.
The song was recorded in 1915 by Billy Murray, backed with an instrumental version by Pietro Deiro on Side B; and later that year by Broadway star Nora Bayes.
This was Murray's version of the chorus. It was easily adaptable for a woman to sing with just a couple of word changes:
Captain Jinks, one night on Broadway,
Read the news about the wireless telephone.
Pretty soon his thoughts began to stray,
over seven thousand miles away.
He went through a whole month's pay just to phone and say:

"Sour Milk Sea" is a song written by George Harrison in early 1968 during the Beatles' stay in Rishikesh, India. It was given to Jackie Lomax to record and released as the latter's debut single on the then-new Apple Records label, in August 1968. "Sour Milk Sea" was among Apple's first batch of releases, another of which was the Beatles' "Hey Jude" single. The recording of "Sour Milk Sea" is notable for being the first of many extracurricular musical projects produced by Harrison, and a rarity among non-Beatles songs in that it features three members of the band. Along with Harrison, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney, the backing musicians on the track were Eric Clapton and session pianist Nicky Hopkins.
The single enjoyed only minor success internationally, becoming a top 30 hit in Canada. "Sour Milk Sea" was later included on Lomax's Apple solo album, Is This What You Want?, released in March 1969.

[[Newbold, Derbyshire]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in Derbyshire, Towns and villages of the Peak District

Newbold is a village north of Chesterfield, a market town in the English county of Derbyshire. In 2001 it had a population of just under 8,000.2001 Census statistics for Newbold accessed 24 December 2007
It is mainly residential in nature. There are 2 secondary schools, St. Mary's Roman Catholic High School on Newbold Road, which is usually rated in the top ten to twenty state schools in the country each year by The Times schools league tables, and Newbold Community School on Highfield Lane. The school has recently been rebuilt with aid of government funding because the school was previously split across 2 locations known as Upper Site and Lower Site and both buildings were ageing and badly in need of replacement. 
Saint John's Church of England parish church was built in 1857 John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales 1870-72 and its churchyard contains the grave of John Lauder (d.1882), the father of Sir Harry Lauder who paid his last visit to the grave on July 17, 1948.Wallace, William, with Lauder-Frost, Gregory, Harry Lauder in the Limelight, Lewes, East Sussex, 1988, p.18, and 40n, ISBN 0-86332-312-XDerbyshire Times Next door to the church is 'The Eagle Club'. Also on St John's Road there are 2 veterinary practices and a police house.
A path to the left of the Nag's Head pub leads past a late-Saxon chapel, which belonged to the local Roman Catholic Eyre family, and contains 12 coffins in a crypt. Eyre's chapel stands geographically on the highest point of Newbold Village. It was used as the local Roman Catholic church for many years until the present church, on the corner of Littlemoor and Dukes Drive was built in the mid-1960s.  Due to persistent vandalism, the chapel windows were bricked up in the 1970s and access restricted.  More recently, some restoration of the chapel has taken place. There is said to be an underground tunnel linking Eyre's chapel to the Crooked Spire. 
Nearby is the Barnett Observatory on Hastings Close which is a member of the Federation of Astronomical Societies.
The name of Hastings Close is linked to the Battle of Hastings and the name of Dukes Drive is linked to the large local landholdings which used to be held by the Duke of Devonshire, and this road was built on land sold by the Duke for residential housing in the 1930s.
In the early 1960s the road leading off Littlemoor, by the side of the Goldminers public house, was named Windermere Road. It used to be called Bargh's Lane and had a row of old stone cottages. Bargh's Lane led to open farmland until the building of the council estates. There is now a private dentist's practice on the corner of Windermere and Littlemoor, which is situated next-door to a pharmacy (Dent's Chemists), the doctor's (Newbold Surgery) and Newbold Library. 
There is a collection of shops, pubs to the north and a new indoor and outdoor Tennis Academy to the south near Chesterfield FC's original football ground at Saltergate. Towards the end of Newbold Road there is Holme Brook Reservoir and Country Park, designated a site of Importance for Nature and Conservation. It is host to a variety of plants, insects and animals with a large woodland plantation. It is also home to the increasingly rare Skylark. It has popular walking and cycling routes, some of which lead to Linacre Reservoir.

"Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now" is the twenty-third single by 1960s British girl singer Sandie Shaw, and her final single of that decade, marking the end of a string of singles which had made her the most successful British female singer of that era. 
Though the song failed to enter the UK chart, it would later influence 1980s singer Morrissey, a big fan of Shaw, to write a song for his band The Smiths entitled "Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now", which became one of their biggest hits. Shaw's song was in the typical pop style that people were accustomed to hearing from her, which was a direct contrast to the album she released around the same time entitled Reviewing the Situation. That album was full of much more alternative material, to which Shaw felt she was more suited at the time.

Awaz were one of the pioneer bands of the local pop music scene and were highly skilled and talented musicians, producers and composers.

Patrick "Pat" Burns (1921 - June 8, 1996) was a radio talk show host and newspaper reporter. He was born in Montreal, Quebec, but began his radio career in England with the BBC as a sports reporter covering the world hockey championships in London in 1949.  After working for a time as a news/sports reporter for the Vancouver Province, he worked as the News/Sports Director for CKLG in Vancouver, BC from 1955 to 1963. On May 13, 1963 the "Burns Hot Line" made its debut on CJOR in Vancouver, BC which earned him recognition as one of Canadian radio's most fascinating and dynamic radio personalities.
In 1965, Pat hosted a series of programs from Selma, Alabama, where Martin Luther King was helping to change the United States forever. He was fired a short while after those historic broadcasts. His dismissal was widely protested but the decision stood, and Pat returned briefly to newspaper reporting before joining CKGM in Montreal later in the decade. The "Burns Hot Line" returned to the air for a while between 1969 and 1976 after which he did news and commentary.
The "Hot Line" returned to CJOR in Vancouver in 1980. Burns once worked at CKO, the Canadian news radio network.
In 1996 Pat Burns was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame following his death earlier that year in Vancouver, British Columbia.

CATEGORIES: Master's degrees

[tpl]Redirect|MSt|other uses|MST (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]MST[/tpl]
The Master of Studies (rendered M.St. or MSt) is a postgraduate degree at the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, The Australian National University and University of Dublin which typically requires both classroom study and the completion of a thesis. It is a lesser degree than the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) or  Engineering Doctorate (EngD) and is comparable to the Master of Arts, Master of Science and Master of Philosophy at other universities. An M.St. is generally considered equivalent to the French diplôme d'études approfondies (or DEA) or the Spanish Diploma de Estudios Avanzados (also DEA). In some instances the degree may be awarded to graduate students after completing several years of original research, but before the defence of a dissertation, or as a substitute for a Ph.D. thesis that is a marginal fail. In some cases it can serve as a provisional enrolment for the Ph.D. 
The M.St. and the M.Phil. are to be distinguished at Oxbridge and Dublin from the Master of Arts (MA) in that the latter requires no postgraduate study and is awarded to Bachelor of Arts after a defined time-period has passed from when undergraduate study began. An Oxford MA, for example, is awarded to Bachelors of Arts during or after the twenty-first term from matriculation and requires no postgraduate study.

[[Aspidochirotida]]

CATEGORIES: Aspidochirotida, Holothuroidea

Aspidochirotida is an order of sea cucumbers. They are distinguished from other sea cucumbers by the presence of flattened, often leaf-like tentacles, but without the other large appendages found in the related order Elasipodida. They do not have introvert or retractor muscles.An illustrated key to the sea cucumbers of the South Atlantic Bight Retrieved 2012-02-12. The tube feet often form a clearly demarcated sole. They have 15-30 shield-shaped retractile tentacles surrounding their mouths. The body wall is thick and leathery and contains ossicles, including some table-shaped ones. They have respiratory trees for gas exchange. The mesentery of the posterior loop of their gut is attached to the right ventral interradius. The muscles that run longitudinally down the body are arranged into five double bands. They can shoot out sticky white threads known as cuvierian tubes from their cloacas in order to distract or entangle predators. They are usually found in exposed shallow-water environments.Order Aspidochirotida Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2012-02-10.

Bringing in over 310,000 visitors a year, the Clay County Fair is one of the largest county fairs in the United States. 2011 set attendance records of 328,000.Record-breaking year for Clay County Fair. Beginning in 1918, the fair has grown considerably over the past near century. 
In its first year the Clay County Fair brought in 30,000 guests. In 1936 the fair completed the construction of its second grandstand, able to seat over 7,500 people, which it still uses today. During the 1930s the fair continued construction of agricultural buildings for livestock. The Clay County Fair has firmly planted itself as the largest Midwest county fair. 
The fair also hosts a carnival of over 80 rides and attractions. There are also many businesses that have booths all over the fair. It consists of over 35 square city blocks of space,Google Map (Aerial View of Fairgrounds). and continues to fill up the space tighter and tighter every year. 
Some familiar people/groups who have visited and/or performed at the Clay County Fair are: Former President George W. Bush, Sen. John Kerry, former Vice President Al Gore, Bob Hope, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Johnny Cash, Tim McGraw, Kenny Rogers, Lee Ann Womack, Martina McBride, REO Speedwagon, The Righteous Brothers, Plus One, Clay Aiken, ZZ Top, LeAnn Rimes, Brad Paisley, Lee Greenwood, Bill Cosby, Red Skelton, Jim Nabors, Lonestar, Grand Funk Railroad, Garth Brooks, Survivor, Trisha Yearwood, Heart and Foreigner. On September 15, 2007 Aly and AJ played there for the first time in Iowa.
With the completion of the Clay County Regional Events Center inside the fairground walls, new opportunities have opened. Some of these are indoor concerts. With seating up to 3,400 people, the events center has hosted  The Barnum and Bailey Circus, and the Lipizzan Stallions. It also has a large ballroom/dining room capable of seating up to 400 people, just creating even more opportunities to flourish and grow.
The Fair has just completed another project in 2007. The Race Track was modified into a 3/8 track. The previous track was a large, flat, half-mile oval that was generally used for horse racing. In order to host high-quality auto racing events, the fair deemed it necessary to construct a completely new racetrack. It was converted to a 3/8 mile clay track, with increased corner banking to adjust for the higher speeds of auto racing. Additionally, a state-of-the-art lighting system was installed to make the races more visible for both drivers and fans.
In 2008, the racing schedule featured the International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) hosting two classes of racing; Modifieds and Stock Cars. Those races also included Hobby Stocks and 360 Modifieds. July 4, the WorldDirt Racing League (WDRL) also hosted a Late Model Series and 360 Sprints on the track. The season rounded out with an appearance by the World of Outlaws during the 2008 Clay County Fair and another race with IMCA Modifieds and Stock Cars, with Hobby Stocks and 360 Modifieds.

CATEGORIES: Mountains of Israel, Sacred mountains

Har Karkom ("Mountain of Saffron", also called Jabal Ideid) is a mountain in the southwest Negev desert in Israel, half way between Petra and Kadesh Barnea. On the basis that the Israelites travelled across the Sinai peninsula towards Petra in a fairly straight line, a number of scholars have contemplated the possibility of Har Karkom being the Biblical Mount Sinai. Following this theory, Emmanuel Anati excavated at the mountain, and discovered that it was a major paleolithic cult centre, with the surrounding plateau covered with shrines, altars, stone circles, stone pillars, and over 40,000 rock engravings.
Although, on the basis of his findings, Anati advocates the identification of Har Karkom with Mount Sinai,Emmanuel Anati, The riddle of Mount Sinai : archaeological discoveries at Har Karkom (2001)Mount Sinai has been found: some Archaeological discoveries at Har Karkom the peak of religious activity at the site may date to 2350-2000 BC, and the mountain appears to have been abandoned perhaps between 1950-1000 BC; the exodus is sometimes dated between 1600-1200 BC.  However, no archaeological evidence has been supported by scholars to maintain a date of 1600-1200 BC. Anati instead places the Exodus, based on other archaeological evidence at around 2300 BC.Mount Sinai has been found: some Archaeological discoveries at Har Karkom

Morrison R. Waite High School is a public high school located in east Toledo, Ohio that opened in 1914.  It is part of the Toledo Public Schools. It is named after Morrison R. Waite, a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who is famous for overseeing the Alabama Claims case.  Waite replaced the original Central High School when Toledo Public Schools decided it couldn't afford to have 3 high schools for the 1914-15 school year.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | title = Little Hope For A 'Raise' In Schools| publisher = Toledo News-Bee | date = February 24, 1914 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_A1YAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZUUNAAAAIBAJ&dq=waite%20high%20school%20toledo&pg=1021%2C4310838| accessdate = February 9, 2011[/tpl]  (Scott High School had opened in 1913.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | title = Monetta To Teach Scott Hi Athletes| publisher = Toledo News-Bee | date = September 2, 1913 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Jd9XAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2EQNAAAAIBAJ&dq=scott%20high%20toledo&pg=5302%2C4665086| accessdate = February 9, 2011[/tpl])
The Waite Indians are members of the Toledo City League and their school colors are purple and gold. However, the Indian nickname is not for Native Americans.  When the school was first opened, the Toledo Fire Department had an annual competition that involved running and pulling the fire truck. The team from the East Side was called the Indians. Someone thought it would be a good idea to name the school's athletic teams after the Fire Department team.  The Indians have a rivalry with fellow East Toledo City League rival Clay. They had a football rivalry from 1914 thru 1963 with Scott High School that was played every Thanksgiving morning and generated much interest across the Midwest.  That game is now played on the final Friday of October and, with the closings of Libbey and DeVilbiss High Schools, has become once again the top rivalry for both high schools.[tpl]cite web | last = Hackenberg| first = Dave| title = Scott-Waite game kicked off great tradition of high school feasts| publisher = Toledo Blade | date = November 27, 2003 | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/article/20031127/COLUMNIST08/111270131| accessdate = February 7, 2011[/tpl]  Waite has named their football stadium after their successful coach, Jack Mollenkopf, who also coached football at Purdue. 
Waite was a national high school football power in the 1920s, traveling as far as California. In 1927, they played away games on successive Fridays in Portland, Oregon and Portland, Maine. Travel was by train.  They were crowned National High School Champions in 1924 and again in 1932.  In 1924 they went 10-0 under Coach Joe Collins to win the title. In 1932, under Coach Don McCallister and Assistant Frank Pauly, they defeated Miami High School 13-7 in Miami to finish 12-0 and win the honor.

Friedrich Heiler (January 30, 1892 - April 18, 1967) was a German theologian and historian of religion. 
Heiler came from a Roman Catholic family. 1918 he became Privatdozent in University of Munich, from where he 1920 moved to theological faculty of the University of Marburg, where he became professor 1922.
Dissatisfied with tridentine Roman Catholicism of his time he became Lutheran through the Evangelical Catholic influence of liberal Nathan Söderblom after meeting him in Sweden 1919 and receiving Holy Communion in Lutheran church. Soon he became directly involved with Lutheran High Church movement in Germany and 1929 became chairman of Hochkirchliche Vereinigung Augsburgischen Bekenntnisses. Heiler never completely abandoned his Roman Catholic faith, but developed further the idea of "Evangelical Catholicity" based on Augsburg Confession from his own liberal Catholic point of view. He, for example, did not approve the traditional Lutheran doctrine of forensic justification. Heiler favored Franciscan spirituality and he influenced the foundation of Lutheran Franciscan Third Order (Evangelische Franziskaner-Tertiaren) 1927 within Hochkirchliche Vereinigung. Later the issue of the absence of Apostolic succession in Evangelical Church in Germany caused the foundation of Hochkirchliche St.-Johannes-Bruderschaft. Heiler became the Apostolischer Vorsteher of the St.-Johannes-Bruderschaft, arranging to receive the episcopal consecration from a bishop of the Gallican Church, Petrus Gaston Vigué (from the succession line of Joseph René Vilatte).
As a historian of religion, after studying Asian religions, Heiler developed a Modernist view and favored the idea that the "one holy church" includes also non-Christian faiths. He also had a long literary feud with Sadhu Sundar Singh, but nevertheless defended him in time. Lastly he placed a high value in the role of women in the church, even in favour of ordination of women.
Despite of Heiler's liberalism, his high church theology was also widely known among other, usually very conservative Lutheran high church theologians outside of Germany, because of at that time generally a rare ecumenical attempt, Heiler's Roman Catholic background and because of his interest on Liturgical Movement. After the ecumenical approach of Second Vatican Council of Roman Catholic Church, Heiler as an ecumenical theologian has been of less interest in academical theology.

Sorghum bicolor, commonly called sorghum and also known as durra, jowari, or milo, is a grass species cultivated for its grain, which is used for food, both for animals and humans, and for ethanol production. Sorghum originated in northern Africa, and is now cultivated widely in tropical and subtropical regions. S. bicolor is typically an annual, but some cultivars are perennial. It grows in clumps that may reach over 4 m high. The grain is small, ranging from 3 to 4 mm in diameter. Sweet sorghums are sorghum cultivars that are primarily grown for foliage, syrup production, and ethanol; they are taller than those grown for grain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/doc/gbase/data/pf000319.htm|title=Grassland Index: Sorghum bicolor (L.)

[[I've Got Rings On My Fingers]]

CATEGORIES: 1909 songs, Songs written by R. P. Weston

I've Got Rings On My Fingers is a popular song written in 1909, words by Weston and Barnes, and music by Maurice Scott. It concerns an Irishman named Jim O'Shea, a castaway who finds himself on an island somewhere in the East Indies, whereupon he is made Chief Panjandrum by the natives because they like his red hair and his Irish smile. He then sends a letter to his girlfriend, Rose McGee, imploring her to come join him.
The song was a hit for Ada Jones and Blanche Ring. The verses explain the situation. The chorus is best remembered:
The first two lines of the chorus refer to the nursery rhyme:
A version of that rhyme was published in 1784, according to the Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (edited by Peter and Iona Opie, 1951, 1973).
Joan Morris and William Bolcom recorded the song as part of their 1974 debut album, After the Ball; this may be the only modern recording.
Decades later, Ray Stevens referenced the expression in his comic song, "Ahab the Arab", in which Ahab's girlfriend Fatima wore "rings on her fingers and bells on her toes and a bone in her nose, ho ho."

Bruce Gary (7 April 1951 – 22 August 2006) was best known as the drummer for the music group The Knack.  He was nominated for two Grammy Awards as a stage performer, producer, and recording artist.
Born in Burbank, California, the young Gary was a bundle of energy and for that reason his parents allowed him to set up the drum kit that his cousin had offered him after getting bored with it.  Gary left home at 15 and was drawn to the musical scene of Topanga Canyon, California.  He made friends with guitarist Randy California. In the 60's and early 70's he played with bluesman Albert Collins. By the time he was twenty-four he was touring and recording with former Cream bassist Jack Bruce and guitarist Mick Taylor, who had just left the Rolling Stones.  This stellar lineup also included jazz pianist Carla Bley. Gary also worked with Dr John in the 70's.
In 1978 he found himself in a band with singer Doug Fieger, guitarist Berton Averre, and bassist Prescott Niles.  Fieger and Averre brought in a tune they'd written about Sharona Alperin, a teenage girl Fieger was obsessed with.  Despite his initial reservations about the song, Gary came up with a beat to match "My Sharona"'s stuttering style. He later said he approached the song like a surf stomp. As he explained, drummers in surf bands often play songs using no cymbals, just kick drum, snare drum, and toms.  He also borrowed from the drum part to "Going to a Go Go" by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles.  The final ingredient, he said, was the drum rudiment called a flam, in which one drumstick strikes the drum just before the other does; the flam registers as a single beat, but with a particularly full sound. Gary's immediately recognisable kick-and-snare-drum intro helped propel the power-pop anthem to the top of the US charts.
The Knack's debut album "Get the Knack" sold 6 million copies.
After the breakup of The Knack in the early 1980s, Gary became an in-demand drummer for studio work and live performance with some of the premier musicians of the era including Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Stephen Stills, Rod Stewart, Sheryl Crow, Bette Midler, Yoko Ono,  Harry Nilsson, and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger.  He also worked with blues masters Albert King and John Lee Hooker.
In addition to his work as a drummer, he achieved recognition for his work as a producer  - recording new albums with The Ventures and co-producing (with Alan Douglas) a series of seminal archival recordings of Jimi Hendrix including the Blues compilation.
He died at the age of 55 at the Tarzana Regional Medical Center in Tarzana, California of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Jebel al-Madhbah ([tpl]lang-ar|جبل المذبح[/tpl], [tpl]transl|ar|Jabal al-Madhbaḥ[/tpl]) is a mountain at Petra, in present-day Jordan, which a number of scholars have proposed as the Biblical Mount Sinai,Peake's commentary on the Bible beginning with Ditlef Nielsen in 1927.Ditlef Nielsen, The Site of the Biblical Mount Sinai – A Claim for Petra (1927) The top 8 metres of the original peak was carved away to form the obelisks, destroying evidence of whatever earlier structures had been located there, except for hints that shiny blue slate once covered the summit;[tpl]cite book | last = Phillips | first = Graham | authorlink = Graham Phillips (author) | title = The Templars and the Ark of the Covenant: The Discovery of the Treasure of Solomon | publisher = Bear & Company | date = April 2005 | url = http://www.grahamphillips.net/Ark/Ark_Intro.htm | isbn = 1-59143-039-9 [/tpl] the biblical description of Sinai mentions sapphire paving,[tpl]bibleverse||Exodus|24:10|[/tpl] which at that time referred to shiny blue paving, rather than paving made from what is now called sapphire.Cheyne and Black, Encyclopedia Biblica, Hoshen
The name Jebel al-Madbah means mountain of the altar, and is well deserved since its summit is covered in a number of different altars, including some that are circular, and others that are square, carved into the rock. One possible reason for Madbah being considered sacred is the fact that there have been many reports and sightings of plasma phenomena at al-Madhbah over the centuries, possibly equating with the dramatic biblical descriptions of devouring fire on the summit of Sinai.[tpl]bibleverse||Exodus|24:17|[/tpl] The sacred nature of the mountain is not limited to the summit; the Treasury building, which is thought to have a ritual purpose, is carved into the mountain's base, facing the Siq; the loud trumpeting sound caused by wind funnelling down the siq is referred to by local Bedouins as the trumpet of God, matching the biblical description of a loud trumpet at Sinai.[tpl]bibleverse||Exodus|19:16|[/tpl]
The mountain is over a thousand metres high, but a rock staircase winds its way from the top down to the valley below; the valley in which Petra resides is known as the Wadi Musa, meaning valley of Moses. At the entrance to the Siq is the Ain Musa, meaning spring of Moses; the 13th-century Arab chronicler Numairi stated was Ain Musa was Meribah, the location where Moses had brought water from the ground, by striking it with his rod.

The Ice Runway [tpl]airport codes||NZIR[/tpl] is the principal runway for the US Antarctic Program during the summer Antarctic field season due to its proximity to McMurdo Station. The other two runways in the area are the snow runway at Williams Field (ICAO: NZWD) and the white ice runway at Pegasus Field (ICAO: NZPG}.
This runway is capable of handling wheeled aircraft, that have included to date:  Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Lockheed P-3 Orion.  In the summer season of 2009/2010 the RNZAF trialled a modified Boeing 757 operationally. The intention is to use the Boeing 757 for passenger transport thereby freeing up capacity for C17 cargo space. http://www.airforce.mil.nz/operations/media-releases/media-release.htm@guid=%7B743a1ebd-84d8-47a9-970e-e950ea91c749%7D.htm. 
The annual sea-ice runway for wheeled aircraft is constructed at the start of each season and is used until early December when the sea ice begins to break up.Blue-ice and snow runways, National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs. April 9, 1993. Subsequently flight operations are moved back to Williams Field. Pilots landing C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft on the sea ice runway report that the surface is stable, not unlike landing on concrete. However, the similarity with land bases ends when the jet aircraft rolls to a stop. The nearly 450,000 pound weight of the plane, including cargo and passengers, causes it to sink into the ice, albeit only a matter of inches. A laser light is trained on the aircraft to measure the settlement rate. The $200 million aircraft is moved to a new location on the six-foot-thick ice as a safety measure if the 10-inch red line is reached, according to the News Tribune in Tacoma, Washington.[tpl]fact|date=June 2009[/tpl]

In the early 1920s, stimulated by the economic opportunities of the Roaring Twenties and later, Prohibition, organized crime figures such as Arnold Rothstein were controlling a wide range of criminal enterprises. According to crime writer Leo Katcher, Rothstein "transformed organized crime from a thuggish activity by hoodlums into a big business, run like a corporation, with himself at the top."Katcher, Leo (1959/1994). The Big Bankroll. The Life and Times of Arnold Rothstein, New York: Da Capo Press Rothstein was allegedly responsible for fixing the 1919 World Series.Pietrusza, David (2003). Rothstein: The Life, Times, and Murder of the Criminal Genius Who Fixed the 1919 World Series. New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers. ISBN 0-7867-1250-3 The largely Jewish-American gang known as Murder Inc., as well as mobsters such as Meyer Lansky, would gain significant influence within the Italian American Mafia. For decades after, Jewish-American mobsters would continue to work closely and at times compete with Italian-American organized crime.

The Concord Resort Hotel (pronounced KAHN-cord) was a resort in the Borscht Belt part of the Catskills, known for its large resort industry in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s.  Located in Kiamesha Lake, New York, the Concord was the largest resort in the region until its closing in 1998.  There were over 1,500 guest rooms and a dining room that sat 3,000; the resort encompassed some [tpl]convert|2000|acre|km2[/tpl].
According to the Concord Resort & Golf Club Website, the hotel is now
 
 "...home of the World Famous "Monster" Golf Course rated by Golf Digest as one of America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses" which "features full service pro shop, driving range, overnight accommodations, meeting rooms, restaurant and bar, large catering and banquet facilities, individual and corporate memberships, golf school, and a PGA professional staff for all golf instruction programs."Concord Resort & Golf Club Website

There are currently 42 guest rooms and the website indicates that more rooms will be built as well as amenities not related to the golf course (i.e. swimming pool, tennis courts, etc.)  The "Monster Golf Academy" is under the direction of PGA Professional Todd Barker. The former hotel portion, though, was completely demolished in 2008 and the site remains vacant.
The Concord was used several times a year by the New York State Association of Fire Chiefs for live fire training. Because of its size, relative isolation and heavy type 1 concrete construction, it was ideal for firefighter training.
In 2010, financial disputes between the owners led to a legal settlement, splitting property between the parties.

[[Æthelfrith of Mercia]]
CATEGORIES: Anglo-Saxon ealdormen, Year of birth uncertain, Year of death unknown

Æthelfrith (c. 883 – c. 904/915) was an ealdorman of southern Mercia, who flourished in the last two decades of the ninth century and the first decade of the tenth century. His father is unknown. He was married to Æthelgyth, daughter of Æthelwulf; Æthelwulf is unidentified, but a possible candidate is King Ælfred the Great's brother-in-law, the ealdorman of the Gaini who died in 901. Æthelfrith was father to four ealdormen: Æthelstan Half-King (East Anglia), Ælfstan (Mercia), Æthelwald (Kent), and Eadric (Hampshire).Hart, Cyril ‘Æthelstan (fl. 932-956)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004
"In 903 it happened to Æthelfrith, dux, that all his deeds of title perished in the destruction of a fire. Therefore impelled by such a necessity, the aforementioned dux asked King Edward, also Æthelred and Æthelflæd, who then held rulership and power over the Mercian people under the aforementioned king, also all the members of the witan, that they should permit him and give authorisation for the rewriting of replacement charters for him." Among the charters reissued was one "concerning that land of ten hides, namely at Islington, which Coenwulf, the celebrated king of the Mercians, gave to his faithful comes, Beornnoth, to be free for himself and for his heirs in perpetuity after him"http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/367a.html. It would appear therefore that Æthelfrith, or possibly his, wife, could trace his family roots to the old Mercian aristocracy.
Another charter reissued in 903 was that in which Æthelwulf had granted Risborough to his daughter Æthelgyth http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/367.html. Risborough  was later the property of Ælfgifu the wife of King Eadwig, leading to suggestions that Ælfgifu might be Æthelfrith's granddaughter, however given that an ealdorman Æthelfrith begins witnessing charters early as 883 this would require that there were two successive ealdorman of the same name,Barlow, Lundie W. "The Antecedents of Earl Godwine of Wessex" in New England Historical and Genealogical Register, 1957 for which there is no evidence.

Seven of the tracks are from five of the band's albums from 1973 to 1980; it also includes the non-album single "FM (No Static at All)" (from the soundtrack to the 1978 film FM). Of the album tracks, there are two songs from both Aja and Gaucho, and one track apiece from Countdown to Ecstasy, Katy Lied and The Royal Scam. 
In 1991, the compilation was reissued with four extra tracks - "Here at the Western World" (previously only available on the band's 1978 Greatest Hits compilation), two Donald Fagen solo songs, and a live version of "Bodhisattva" (originally released as the B-side to the 1980 single "Hey Nineteen"). In addition, the reissue swapped the original "FM" with an alternate version with a saxophone solo replacing the guitar in the song's coda, a version that essentially incorporates the original single's B-side, "FM (Reprise)". Most Steely Dan compilations CDs since then feature this version of FM, however, Gold (Expanded Edition) is the only place to find this version on vinyl, as it was the last Steely Dan compilation released on the format.

The Shocknife is notable for the electrical shock it delivers when used in a knife strike. The electrical shock stimulates the nerve fibers in the same way a real knife cut would but without causing injury. This is intended to simulate the pain that would be inflicted by a real cut and to induce similar responses, such as the fight or flight response.  The Shocknife is in use by law enforcement agencies and military training programs worldwide.[tpl]cite journal | last = Michalowski| first = Kevin| title = Shocknife Adds Fear to Training Scenarios| journal = Tactical Gear Magazine| volume = 11| issue = 4| page = 30 | publisher = FW Media Inc.| date = 2007-12-01[/tpl]

"I Dreamed a Dream" is a song from the musical Les Misérables.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4443|title=Les Misérables at IBDB.com|accessdate=29 April 2009[/tpl] It is a solo that is sung by the character Fantine during the first act. The music is by Claude-Michel Schönberg, with orchestrations by John Cameron. The English lyrics are by Herbert Kretzmer, based on the original French libretto by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel from the original French production.
The song is a lament, sung by the anguished, dying Fantine, who has just been fired from her job at the factory and thrown onto the streets. She thinks back to happier days and wonders at all that has gone wrong in her life. Typically played in the key of E flat major,[tpl]cite book|last=Biamonte|first=Nicole|title=Pop-Culture Pedagogy in the Music Classroom: Teaching Tools from American Idol to YouTube|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cdF5Ud9H9IgC&pg=PA85|date=28 October 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4616-7056-8|page=85[/tpl] it has also become a jazz standard.
In the 1985 musical, the song occurs after Fantine has been fired, and before "Lovely Ladies". In the original French production and the 2012 film adaptation, these two musical numbers are swapped around, to place dramatic emphasis on Fantine's depressing descent into prostitution.

[[Pulsar (video game)]]
CATEGORIES: 1981 video games, Sega arcade games, Gremlin Industries games

Pulsar is a 1981 arcade game created by Sega/Gremlin.http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9150 In it, the player controls a tank in a top-down view maze to fetch keys used to unlock the next level.
Pulsar runs on the Z80 microprocessor. The game was designed and programmed by Larry Clague and Mike Hendricks.
2009 "Pulsar" and ""Pulsar Domination" is a team based multi-player space combat game being developed by 3DMUVE LLC.  Targeted release is sometime 2014.
Pulsar is a modern team based space combat game.
There will be at least 4 different game types:
1.  Death Match
2.  Team Death Match
3.  Demolition (Base Hunt)
4.  Domination
Pulsar is a very unique game focused on team play.  Unlike many team based games that pit two teams against each other, Pulsar will support from 1-4 teams competing at the same time, and up to 60 online human players plus AI creating huge worlds of intense fighting and combat.  Leverage new team based tactics to balance the perfect fighting force to reign dominant in the world of Pulsar.
Demolition and Domination are two of the game types that make Pulsar really special.  We’re not just creating large worlds of players to fight.  In Pulsar we’re creating new game types optimized for team tactics and strategy.  When team members learn how to compliment each others playing styles by leveraging different upgrades to offer the best balance for the team, games will take on new dimension. 
Demolition (Base Hunt)
Demolition is a team-based game to destroy the opponents’ base.  Demolition is a fast paced game of search and destroy.  Once you find a base you must destroy it, but each base will be protected by heavily fortified capital ships with targeting systems that will immediately lock on and open fire.  Each capital ship emanates a powerful force field energy beam that surrounds and protects the base. You must destroy all capital ships to expose the base before you’re able to destroy it.  Not only will you contend with the threat of the capital ships, but competing teams will decide how many players to leave behind to further help guard their base.  Fierce dogfights and constant action will brings continuous hours of fun and enjoyment each and every time you play.
When starting Demolition all possible upgrades are available and each player is given a limited amount of credits to equip a ship to their liking.  If you prefer lighter, faster with quick fire weapons you can do that.  If you prefer slower ships with a lot of fire power you can do that.  With hundreds of combinations across different hulls, armor, shields, engines, weapons and more you’ll be able to create the perfect vehicle.  Match your skills with other teammates and balance your tactics for the best offence or defense and get ready to shine as the best player or best team, with high scores, rankings, ladders, competitions and more.
As players rack up kills, and minimize deaths they earn additional credits, which can be used for more upgrades.  Then as your team continues to win battles they too will earn credits that can be divvied up across the members, or used to further fortify the capital ships.  Matchmaking will be used to try and keep players and teams evenly balanced.
Domination
In Domination the objective is to destroy the competing teams bases and take control of the system. However, it's not just about combat, we've added a touch of strategy through the use of team resources and their management. Bases in Pulsar are extremely powerful, protected, and reinforced structures, and teams will need to reach a science level of 10 before they'll acquire the right weapons necessary to take out an enemy base.
To reach each science level takes time, and teams will need to acquire resources to power the science station. The more resources, the faster your team can level up. It'll be up to the team to figure out how to best balance your resources between defense, upgrades and science. More resources towards better weapons might mean your opponents reach a higher science level before you. Use your resources wisely because too few spent on upgrades can leave you vulnerable to attack, but spend too much and you'll fall behind in your science leaving you at a greater disadvantage. With each new science level also comes new upgrades, so don't waste time, get to mining.  Not to fear, if you hate the thought of having to mine, you can send out AI to do it for you, but each AI ship will cost you some resources, so each team can choose how they want to proceed.
As the game progresses players are trying to gather resources for the team while also trying to slow down the other teams. Fierce dogfights will ensue while teams race to slow other teams down. Further attacks on enemy bases can deplete their resources slowing down their quest towards the next science level. Be careful, as team’s level up they acquire improved weapons, armor and ships. Strategically placed turrets and fighters can be used to defend a base. Some ships will be optimized for speedier mining while others are optimized for improved combat or reconnaissance missions. Leverage your team wisely to outwit and outgun your opponents and reign victorious.
Other Game Types:
Death Match is a game of kills.  First one to reach the designated number wins, or the one with the highest kills wins when the timer expires.
Team Death Match is just like Death Match, only teams are working together to obtain the most kills.

The poet begins by stating he should not stand in the way of true love.  Love cannot be true if it changes for any reason.  Love is supposed to be constant, through any difficulties.  In the sixth line, a nautical reference is made, alluding that love is much like the north star to sailors.  Love should also not fade with time; instead, true love lasts forever.

[[Voere VEC-91]]
CATEGORIES: Bolt-action rifles, Caseless firearms

The Voere VEC-91 was made by Voere and was the first commercial sporting rifle to combine caseless ammunition and electronic firing. Depending upon its chambering, it fired a 5.56 (0.223"), 5.7 mm or 6 mm projectile at speeds of up to 930 metres per second (3,051 feet per second). When chambered for 5.7 mm it had a 5 round magazine, and it had a 4 round magazine when chambered in 6 mm. Two 15 volt dry cell batteries, located in the pistol grip, allowed it to fire approximately 5,000 rounds without replacing the batteries. Voere also made a pistol version. The rifle was first exported to the United States in 1993, but the weapon was not a commercial success and production ended shortly thereafter.
The weapon was capable of great accuracy due to several factors inherent to the design, and several factors due to its implementation. First, the trigger activated a button, requiring little pressure. Second, the electronic ignition meant that there was no latency due to lock time. With respect to the implementation, the rifle came with a match grade premium barrel. Lastly, all ammunition came from one source, with the result that all rounds were identical within manufacturing tolerances.

[[Morphology (folkloristics)]]
CATEGORIES: Folklore, Literary criticism, Literary theory, Morphology

Morphology, broadly, is the study of form or structure.  Folkloristic morphology, then, is the study of the structure of folklore and fairy tales. 
Folkloristic morphology owes its existence to two seminal researchers and theorists: Russian scholar Vladimir Propp and Finnish folklorist Antti Aarne.
Antti Aarne's theories, enlarged and expanded by American folklorist Stith Thompson in 1961 and by Hans-Jörg Uther in 2004, look at motifs rather than actions – for example, "a soldier makes a deal with the devil" or "a soldier marries the youngest of three sisters."  More than 2500 folk and fairy tales have been cataloged under this taxonomy; the AaTh or Aarne-Thompson number is as well-known to folklorists as Francis James Child's identification of ballads are to scholars of folk songs.
Vladimir Propp was a Russian structuralist scholar.  He criticized Aarne's work for ignoring what motifs did in a tale, and analysed the basic plot, or action, components of Russian folk tales to identify their simplest irreducible narrative elements. His Morphology of the Folk Tale was published in Russian in 1928 and influenced Claude Lévi-Strauss and Roland Barthes, though it received little attention from Western scholars until it was translated into English in the 1950s.  
In the Afanasyev's collection of Russian fairy tales, Propp found a limited number of plot elements or "functions" that constructed all. These elements occurred in a standard, consistent sequence. He derived thirty-one generic functions, such as "a difficult task is proposed" or "donor tests the hero" or "a magical agent is directly transferred."

[[Dis (Divine Comedy)]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional populated places, Hell, Divine Comedy, Demons in Divine Comedy

In Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy, the City of Dis (in Italian, la città ch'ha nome Dite, "the city whose name is Dis")Inferno 8.68. Citations from The Divine Comedy, unless otherwise noted, are those of H. Wayne Storey, entry on "Dis," in The Dante Encyclopedia (Routledge, 2010), pp. 306–307. encompasses the sixth through the ninth circles of Hell.Inferno 9.106 to 34.81. The most serious sins are punished here, in lower Hell. Dis is extremely hot, and contains areas more closely resembling the common modern conception of Hell than the upper levels.
The walls of Dis are guarded by fallen angels and the Erinyes (Furies). Dante emphasizes the character of the place as a city by describing its architectural features: towers, gates, walls, ramparts, bridges, and moats. It is thus an antithesis to the heavenly city, as for instance described by St. Augustine in his City of God.Storey, The Dante Encyclopedia, p. 306. Among these structures are mosques, "the worship places of the most dangerous enemies of medieval Christendom."Peter Bondanella, The Inferno: Dante Alighieri, note to the translation of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (Fine Creative Media, 2003), pp. 206–207. In Dante's schematics of Hell, some Muslims and Jews are placed among the heretics. The presence of mosques probably also recalls the reality of Jerusalem in Dante's own time, where gilded domes dominated the skyline.Anthony K. Cassell, "The Tomb, the Tower and the Pit: Dante's Satan," in Dante: Dante and Interpretation (Routledge, 2003), p. 204.
Punished within Dis are those whose lives were marked by active (rather than passive) sins: heretics, murderers, suicides, blasphemers, usurpers, sodomites, panderers, seducers, flatterers, Simoniacs, sorcerers, barrators, hypocrites, thieves, false counsellors, schismatics, falsifiers and traitors. Sinners unable to control their passions offend God less than these, whose lives were driven by malizia ("malice, wicked intent"):
 
 Of every malice (malizia) gaining the hatred of Heaven, injustice is the goal; and every such goal injures someone either with force or fraud.VV. 22–24, as cited by Storey, The Dante Encyclopedia, p. 307.

There is perhaps a distinction between malizia as the characteristic of circles seven and eight, and the matta bestialitade, "inhuman wickedness," of circle nine, which punishes those who threaten "the most basic civic, familial, and religious foundations of happiness."Storey, The Dante Encyclopedia, p. 307.
In ancient Roman mythology, Dis Pater ("Father Dis") is the ruler of the underworld and is named as such in the sixth book of Virgil's "Aeneid", one of the principal influences on Dante in his depiction of Hell (the god was also known as Pluto, a name not used by Virgil in the Aeneid). The hero Aeneas enters the "desolate halls and vacant realm of Dis"Domos Ditis uacuas et inania regna (Aeneid 6.269). with his guide, the Sibyl, who correspond in The Divine Comedy to "Dante" as the speaker of the poem and his guide, Virgil.

[[Shallow trench isolation]]

CATEGORIES: Semiconductor device fabrication, Semiconductor structures

Shallow trench isolation (STI), also known as Box Isolation Technique, is an integrated circuit feature which prevents electrical current leakage between adjacent semiconductor device components. STI is generally used on CMOS process technology nodes of 250 nanometers and smaller. Older CMOS technologies and non-MOS technologies commonly use isolation based on LOCOS.Quirk, Michael & Julian Serda (2001). Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology: Instructor's Manual, p. 25.
STI is created early during the semiconductor device fabrication process, before transistors are formed. The key steps of the STI process involve etching a pattern of trenches in the silicon, depositing one or more dielectric materials (such as silicon dioxide) to fill the trenches, and removing the excess dielectric using a technique such as chemical-mechanical planarization.http://smtbook.com/features.htm
Certain semiconductor fabrication technologies also include deep trench isolation, a related feature often found in analog integrated circuits.
The effect of the trench edge has given rise to what has recently been termed the "reverse narrow channel effect"J-W. Jung et al., Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., 39, 2136-2140 (2000). or "inverse narrow width effect".A. Chatterjee et al., IEDM 1996. Basically, due to the electric field enhancement at the edge, it is easier to form a conducting channel (by inversion) at a lower voltage. The threshold voltage is effectively reduced for a narrower transistor width.J. Pretet et al., Solid-State Electronics, 46, 1699-1707 (2002).Y-H. Lee et al., Microelectronics Reliability, 41, 689-696 (2001). The main concern for electronic devices is the resulting subthreshold leakage current, which is substantially larger after the threshold voltage reduction.

[[Arcuate line of rectus sheath]]

CATEGORIES: Abdomen

The arcuate line of the abdomen, [tpl]lang|la|linea semicircularis[/tpl] or Douglas' line is a horizontal line that demarcates the lower limit of the posterior layer of the rectus sheath. It is also where the inferior epigastric vessels perforate the rectus abdominis.
Superior to the arcuate line, the internal oblique aponeurosis splits to envelop the rectus abdominis muscle. Inferior to the arcuate line, the internal oblique and transversus abdominis aponeuroses merge and pass superficial (i.e. anteriorly) to the rectus muscle.
The arcuate line occurs about 1/3 of the distance from the umbilicus to the pubic crest, but this varies from person to person.  Above the arcuate line, the rectus abdominis is surrounded by an anterior layer of the rectus sheath and a posterior layer.  The anterior layer is derived from the external oblique aponeurosis and the anterior lamina of the internal oblique aponeurosis.  The posterior layer is made up of the posterior lamina of the internal oblique aponeurosis and the tranverse abdominal aponeurosis.  Inferior to the arcuate line, all three muscle aponeuroses make up the rectus sheath, that is now only anterior to the rectus abdominis and not posterior to it at all.
Therefore, inferior to the arcuate line, the rectus abdominis rests directly on the transversalis fascia.
If one dissects the anterolateral abdominal wall, the arcuate line may be difficult to see, since all the aponeuroses are translucent.

Another name for the protein is caterpiller-like receptor 1.1 (CLR1.1).
This gene encodes a pyrin-like protein which contains a pyrin domain, a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif. This protein interacts with pyrin domain (PYD) of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). Proteins which contain the caspase recruitment domain, CARD, have been shown to be involved in inflammation and immune response. This protein may function as an activator of NF-κB signaling.

[[Eunoe]]
CATEGORIES: Divine Comedy

Eunoe is a feature of Dante's Commedia created by Dante as the fifth river of the dead (taking into consideration that Cocytus was described as a lake rather than a river). Penitents reaching the Garden of Eden at the top of Mount Purgatory are first washed in the waters of the river Lethe in order to forget the memories of their mortal sins. They then pass through Eunoe to have the memories of their good deeds in life strengthened. 
Upon completing his or her sentence in Purgatory, a soul is washed in the rivers Lethe and Eunoe (in that order) by Matelda. It is unclear who Matelda was in real life, but, nonetheless, her function is to cause the penitent to forget his or her sins (now that these sins have been purgated) and then sip from the waters of Eunoe so that the soul may enter heaven full of the strength of his or her life's good deeds.
Dante makes particular reference to the dolce ber or "sweet drink/draught" of Eunoe at the end of Purgatorio when he explains that he wished he had greater space to write of the water that "never would have sated me." (trans. C.S. Singleton)
The word "eunoe" is one of Dante's many neologisms presumably derived from Greek "eu-," meaning "good" and "noe," meaning "mind."

The Electoral district of Geelong is an electoral district of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. It is based around inner metropolitan Geelong and includes the suburbs of Bell Park, Drumcondra, East Geelong, Geelong, Geelong West, Newtown and South Geelong and parts of Highton, and North Geelong. Incomes vary strongly across the seat, and it is often aligned with the governing Party, due to similar demographics to the state at large.
It has been held since 1999 by Ian Trezise for the ALP, who won that election by 16 votes after recounts. The Victorian Parliament was hung at that election, and the results for the seat of Geelong, which took several days to arrive at, had a significant impact on the events which brought the Bracks government to power. At the 2002 election, the seat's margin grew to 8.1%. However, neither major party considers it safe, as it has been won by the governing party for every election between 1985 and 2006, but was narrowly held by Labor in the 2010 election.

CATEGORIES: American punk rock groups

Tuff Darts was an American punk rock band. They were one of the first bands to establish an audience at CBGB. They reached their greatest fame in the mid-late 1970s with such songs as "Slash", "(Your Love Is Like) Nuclear Waste" and their biggest hit single, "All For The Love of Rock and Roll."  The band appeared at popular New York City clubs like Max's Kansas City and CBGB and featured Robert Gordon (musician) (vocals), Jeff Salen (guitar), Bobby Butani (guitar), John DeSalvo (bass), and Jim Morrison (drums). This was the original band that was on the "Live at CBGB's" compilation record. After parting ways with Gordon, the band found new lead singer Tommy Frenzy. In 1978 the group released Tuff Darts!, on Sire Records, produced by Bob Clearmountain and Tony Bongiovi, shortly before disbanding.  
Tuff Darts reunited in 2002 to play a gig upon the release of Tuff Darts! on compact disc (CD).  They subsequently played several additional shows and recorded one more album, 2007's You Can't Keep A Good Band Down. It was released only in Japan.
In 2009 Spectra Records released two albums worldwide, Here Comes Trouble and You Can't Keep a Good Band Down. Tuff Darts!, You Can't Keep a Good Band Down and Here Comes Trouble are now available as downloads on iTunes and other sites.
Jeff Salen, founder and lead guitarist of the band, died of a heart attack on January 26, 2008 at age 55.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=89628|title=Punk Pioneer TUFF JEFF SALEN Dead Of Heart Attack At 55|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=2008-01-30|accessdate=2008-02-21[/tpl]

[[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]]

CATEGORIES: Russian inventions, Soviet inventions, Spacecraft propulsion, Electric motors, Spaceflight articles needing attention

An electrically powered spacecraft propulsion system uses electrical energy to change the velocity of a spacecraft. Most of these kinds of spacecraft propulsion systems work by electrically expelling propellant (reaction mass) at high speed, but electrodynamic tethers work by interacting with a planet's magnetic field.Michel Van Pelt Space Tethers and Space Elevators Springer, 2009 ISBN 0387765565, page 24
Electric thrusters typically use much less propellant than chemical rockets because they have a higher exhaust speed (operate at a higher specific impulse) compared with chemical rockets.Choueiri, Edgar Y. (2009) New dawn of electric rocket Scientific American 300, 58–65 [tpl]doi|10.1038/scientificamerican0209-58[/tpl] Due to limited electric power the thrust is much weaker compared to chemical rockets, but electric propulsion can provide a small thrust for a long time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=34201&fbodylongid=1535 |title=Electric versus Chemical Propulsion |work=Electric Spacecraft Propulsion |publisher=ESA |accessdate=17 February 2007  [/tpl] Electric propulsion can achieve high speeds over long periods and thus can work better than chemical rockets for deep space missions.
Electric propulsion is now a mature and widely used technology on spacecraft. Russian satellites have used electric propulsion for decades.http://fluid.ippt.gov.pl/sbarral/hall.html As of 2013, over 200 spacecraft operated around the world use electric propulsion for stationkeeping, orbit raising, or primary propulsion.W. Andrew Hoskins et al. "30 Years of Electric Propulsion Flight Experience at Aerojet Rocketdyne", Paper IEPC-2013-439, 33rd International Electric Propulsion Conference, Washington DC, October 2013. http://www.iepc2013.org/get?id=439 Modern types of electrically powered spacecraft propulsion have Delta-v to 100 km/s and could provide thrust for flights to outer planets of the Solar System (with nuclear power), but are unsuitable for flight to extrasolar stars.Choueiri, Edgar Y. (2009). New dawn of electric rocket Also, an electro-rocket an with external power source (transmissible through laser on the solar panels) has a theoretical possibility for interstellar flight.Laser-Powered Interstellar Probe G Landis - APS Bulletin, 1991Geoffrey A. Landis. Laser-powered Interstellar Probe on the Geoffrey A. Landis: Science. papers available on the web Electric propulsion is not usually suitable for launches from the Earth's surface, because the thrust is too weak.

[[List of films made in Poland in the Interwar Period]]
CATEGORIES: Cinema of Poland, Polish films, Lists of Polish films, Jewish cinema

Poland existed as a state for the first time in over a hundred years with the proclamation of the Second Polish Republic in 1918. This state lasted until Poland was invaded and partitioned by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in the fall of 1939. During this brief period of independence a small Polish film industry developed; though it was not well remembered as contemporary German, or postwar Polish counterpart, the cinema of the interwar period does give a glimpse of a neglected corner of the world on the verge of catastophe. This is especially true of the many Jewish themed films.

[[Eosipterus]]

[tpl]Italictitle[/tpl]

Eosipterus is an extinct genus of pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Liaoning, China. 
The genus was named in 1997 by Ji Shu'an and Ji Qiang. The type species is Eosipterus yangi. The genus name is derived from Greek eos, "dawn" and Greek pteron, "wing" with a Latin ending; and a grammar error: normally the combination would have resulted in "eopterus". The "dawn" element refers to its age but also to China being "in the east". The specific name honours paleontologist Yang Daihuan.
The genus is based on holotype GMV2117, found near Jinggangshan in western Liaoning Province, in the Yixian Formation. It was the first pterosaur discovered in that region. It consists of a partial crushed skeleton of a subadult individual on a slab, lacking skull and neck. Most vertebrae have been severely damaged and even their number cannot be determined. The authors state that eighteen detached belly ribs are present in the matrix.
The wings are robust and elongated. The wing finger has the standard four phalanges, a difference from the possibly related Beipiaopterus which has lost the fourth phalanx. Total wingspan was about 1,2 metres. The pelvis is not well preserved. The femur has a length of six centimetres; the tibia of 96 millimetres. The fibula is strongly reduced. The foot claws are slightly curved; the fifth toe has been reduced to a single claw.
The authors placed Eosipterus in a general Pterodactyloidea incertae sedis; in 1999 a placement within Pterodactylidae was suggested and even a synonymy with Pterodactylus within a hypothesis that the lower Yixian Formation dated from the late Jurassic. A cladistic study in 2006 found that it was a member of the Ctenochasmatidae — David Unwin thought it more precisely belonged to the Ctenochasmatinae — but a later study showed that it was basal to the Germanodactylidae.

Ronnie Whelan, Sr. (born November 17, 1936, Dublin; died July 16, 1993) was an Irish international footballer chiefly associated with St. Patricks Athletic FC. His son, Ronnie Whelan, Jr., would later exceed his father's fame and become one of the most decorated players in English football history.
Whelan, a forward, reputedly owed his advancement at junior level to the good offices of Paddy Moore's wife, who brought the youngster's potential to her husband's attention, in his capacity as manager of renowned Dublin junior schoolboy club Stella Maris. Whelan subsequently graduated from Stella Maris as a talented young player to, Home Farm, where his precocious prowess earned him a brief but ultimately fruitless trial period at Chelsea F.C.
Upon his return to Ireland, Whelan placed his talents at the disposal of St. Patricks Athletic, a club still riding the initial surge of momentum which had elevated it from junior football in 1950 to instant League of Ireland champion status in the 1951-52 season. Whelan contributed an aggregate of 89 league goals to St. Pat's scoring ledger in a ten-year tenure at Richmond Park which encompassed FAI Cup victories in 1959 and 1961 (the latter of which remains, as of 2008, St. Pat's most recent success in the competition.) Whelan attained full international status in 1963, winning the first of two Republic of Ireland caps against Austria in a European Nations Cup qualifier. 
He was awarded a benefit game in May 1963.http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1963/0511/Pg004.html#Ar00415:0ABDE20BCDFC0BCDE20E1DFC0E0DE20FCDFC0FCDE20FFDFC0FFDE210ADFC06DDAC0A4DC6
Whelan scored the winner in the 2-1 defeat of an English League XI in October 1963.http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1963/1003/Pg003.html#Ar00300:0B67010FA71B
He guested for Shamrock Rovers in a benefit game in May 1965.http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1965/0522/Pg004.html#Ar00410:06F6520C568A0C86520E268A0BB6C20F16D80EB6F213570706583E07085307183E0998530AB8CE0C28E30C48CE0E38E30EC9031209180549FC089A110626C30A96D8063A460A1A57
The toll exacted upon Whelan's ability and availability by an accumulation of injuries contributed to his departure from St. Pat's in November 1966, whereupon he commenced a seven-year association with Drogheda United. Whelan steered Drogheda to an inaugural appearance in the 1971 FAI Cup final, where the Co. Louth club succumbed to Limerick City after a replay. It would be a further thirty-four years before Drogheda captured the blue riband event of Irish football, but Gavin Whelan's opening goal against Cork City in the 2005 decider brought his family's footballing narrative full-circle; the midfielder is Ronnie Snr.'s grandson.
Whelan signed for Córas Iompair Éireann who were then in the League of Ireland "B" division, in January 1974 and also played for Aer Lingus at Leinster Senior League level for some considerable time thereafter. 
Whelan died in July 1993 at the age of 56 from stomach cancer. By this stage, his sons Ronnie Whelan Jnr. (a 53-cap Republic of Ireland international and the winner of countless trophies and plaudits with Liverpool F.C.) and Paul Whelan (at Shamrock Rovers) were both enjoying professional careers, and his grandson Gavin Whelan has also gone on to be a professional footballer.
At the end of the 2012 League of Ireland season Whelan is joint thirty third in the all-time League of Ireland goalscoring list with 109 league goals http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iertops.html

[[Blue Mountain Project]]
CATEGORIES: 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations

The Blue Mountain Project (BMP) is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization incorporated in the United States and registered in Jamaica. They provide sustainable economic development through education and empowerment. A partnership has been established between the BMP and the community of Hagley Gap and most of the work is done through volunteers. Volunteers come to the Blue Mountain Project from the community and from outside Jamaica.
BMP's current priority is to bring potable water to the people of the Hagley Gap area. Other projects include operating two health clinics (one in Hagley Gap and one in Penlyne Castle), an annual Summer Fun Camp and Back2School Extravaganza to help prepare students for the coming school year, literacy programs to enable more people gain better employment, and working with women's groups, a farmer's cooperative and other groups to find them means to improve their economic base.
  The people of Hagley Gap are rebounding from the winds and flooding of Hurricane Sandy with great self-reliance and neighborly helpfulness. Even though the electricity is still out, the families of the flooded houses along with their neighbors have managed to dry out their homes and are living in them. Herculean efforts with hoes and spades cleared most of the roads. Schools are back in session and the stores have restocked their food supplies.
One great problem remains – the road to the Hagley Gap Clinic was ripped away by Negro River flood waters for about 100 feet. The accompanying photo shows what is left of this road. The pictured house used to have a fence. It was fronted by a rocky road and massive boulders. All this is gone, washed away by the flooded river.
This road is vital for access for the families in Big Yard, the soccer field, the Community Center and the BMP clinic.
BMP will work with the people of the Gap to rebuild this road using your generous Hurricane Sandy donations. Please keep donating so that we can fully rebuild the road.
Blue Mountain Project is a grassroots nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that has been helping rural Jamaican communities since 2004. By living and working directly with the communities we serve, we are able to identify key areas of needed development and facilitate sustainable solutions. Our priority program areas were determined in consultation with the community and by our belief in a holistic approach. BMP's priority program areas are the provision of clean water and quality health care, improving literacy, and economic development. Working with volunteers and community members, we make the most of every donation to effect lasting, productive change.
Incorporated in the United States and registered in Jamaica, BMP is governed by an international Board of Directors that is guided by the needs, ideas, and wishes of the Hagley Gap community. BMP is staffed by a small team of international employees and full-time volunteers. Our strategic plan guides our work and is aligned with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.

[[Large-footed Finch]]
CATEGORIES: Emberizidae, Monotypic bird genera

The  Large-footed Finch, (Pezopetes capitalis), is a  passerine bird  which is endemic to the highlands of  Costa Rica and  western Panama. Despite its name, it is not a true  finch, but rather a member of the large Emberizidae family, which also includes buntings, American sparrows,  juncos and towhees.  It is the only member of the genus Pezopetes.
This is a common bird in the undergrowth of mountain forests, second growth, bamboo clumps, and scrubby pastures from  2150 m altitude to the scrubby páramo at 3350 m. It is readily seen in favoured sites such as Cerro de la Muerte.
The nest, built by the female, is a large loose cup of plant material placed less than 2 m up in bamboo or a dense shrub. The typical clutch is one or two brown-marked white or blue-white eggs, which are incubated by the female alone for 12–14 days to hatching.
The Large-footed Finch is a large, robust terrestrial species, [tpl]convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long and weighing [tpl]convert|56|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl]. It has a slender bill, a modestly sized tail and very large and powerful feet and legs. This species is one of the heaviest in its diverse family.CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), ISBN 978-0-8493-4258-5. The adult has a slate grey head, becoming black on the throat, forehead and crown sides. The upper parts are dark olive and the wings and tail are black with olive fringes. The underparts are bright olive with a brown tint to the flanks and lower belly.   Young birds have a streaked dark olive head, blackish scaling to the upperparts, and buff-olive underparts .
The Large-footed Finch has a thin seet call, and the male’s song, given from the ground or a low perch, consists of a mix or whistles, warbles, chatter and mimicry.
The Large-footed Finch feeds on insects, spiders, and seeds, extracted from the leaf litter with powerful double scratches that can send debris flying up to 30 cm. It will also pick  berries from low bushes. It is normally seen in pairs.

[[Philippine Basketball Association All-Star Weekend]]
CATEGORIES: Philippine Basketball Association All-Star Weekend

The Philippine Basketball Association All-Star Weekend is the annual gathering of the best players of the Philippine Basketball Association playing for various events such as the 3-point shootout, skills competition such as Obstacle and Trick-shot challenges, Rookies vs. Sophomores  Blitz Game, Slam Dunk competition, Shooting stars, Legends 3-point challenge and culminated by the All-Star Game.  It is patterned after the All-Star Weekend of the National Basketball Association.
The annual All-Star Game was instituted in 1989 and has already evolved into different types of competition such as the Rookies, Sophomores & Juniors (RSJ) vs. Veterans (presently adopted), North vs. South match-up, Commissioners All-Stars vs. Governors All-Stars, etc.  The manner by which players to the All-Star Game were selected has also been changed as the same was again patterned before the NBA type of selection.  Originally, the two coaches tapped to lead the two All-Star teams were the ones who selected their players but over the years the starting five are now selected through fan voting and the reserves would now be the ones chosen by the coaches.  For the 2005-2006 season, fans from the host city or province were given the choice to select the sixth man of each team.  After each game, an All-Star Most Valuable Player (MVP) was chosen by writers covering the annual event.
Vergel Meneses had clearly stamped his mark on this mid-year festivities as he remains to be the only four-time All-Star MVP awardee bagging the award in 1995, 1998, 2000 and 2003.  In its entire history, four players have been named multiple winners of the All-Star MVP award namely, Meneses, Benjie Paras (1994 and 1999), Asi Taulava (2004 and 2006), and Jayjay Helterbrand (2005 and 2007).
Alvin Patrimonio and Asi Taulava currently holds the record number of All-Star Game appearances with 12 each.

Berkeley Divinity School, founded in 1854, is an official seminary of the Episcopal Church, based in New Haven, Connecticut.  The seminary was originally founded as a middle-way between the Anglo-Catholic leaning General Theological Seminary in New York, and the Evangelical-leaning Virginia Theological Seminary.  Although the school began in Middletown, Connecticut, it moved to New Haven in 1928 to take advantage of the resources of Yale University.  In 1971 a formal agreement between Yale and Berkeley cemented their bond.  Today, all students of Berkeley Divinity School are also students of Yale Divinity School.  Approximately one third of Yale Divinity School's students, however, are members of Berkeley.  Thus, Berkeley operates as a denominational seminary within an ecumenical divinity school.  Students graduating from Berkeley Divinity School at Yale earn both a Masters of Divinity degree from Yale and potentially a Diploma in Anglican Studies from Berkeley certifying that they have received education specific to the Holy Orders of The Episcopal Church.  The current Dean is Joseph Britton.

CATEGORIES: Administrative divisions of ancient China, Former prefectures of China, Prefectures of Later Tang, Prefectures of the Liao dynasty

Youzhou or You Prefecture (also known as You Province) is a place name for an ancient zhou or prefecture in northern China.  A prefecture as a political subdivision in Chinese history was at various times either the size of a province or sub-provincial unit known as commandery.  The size of Youzhou's jurisdiction varied in history.  Youzhou is cited in some ancient sources as one of the nine or twelve original provinces of China during early Chinese antiquity (22nd Century BC).  But Youzhou was used in actual administration from 106 BC to the 10th Century AD.  
Youzhou was created in 106 BC as a province-sized prefecture during the Western Han Dynasty to administer a large swath of the dynasty's northern frontier that stretched from modern-day Shanxi Province in the west and Shandong Province in the south, through northeastern Hebei Province, southern Liaoning Province and southern Inner Mongolia to Korea.  The prefectural capital was the City of Ji in modern Beijing. This prefecture continued to be centered in northern Hebei through the Three Kingdoms and Western Jin Dynasty.  In the Sixteen Kingdoms period, several of the kingdoms that ruled northern China used Youzhou to name commandery-sized prefectures in their domain. When north China was unified under a single sovereign during the Northern Dynasties, Youzhou became a commandery-sized prefecture based in Beijing.  During the Sui Dynasty, prefecture as a level of administration was not used and Youzhou was renamed Zhuojun or the Zhuo Commandery.  Youzhou was revived during the Tang Dynasty as a smaller, commandery prefecture and became synonymous with the city that was Beijing during that era.  In the Five Dynasties period, Youzhou was one of Sixteen Prefectures ceded to the Khitans of Manchuria.  Thereafter, the name was no longer used.

CATEGORIES: 1986 births, Living people, Essendon Football Club players, Burnie Dockers Football Club players, Australian rules footballers from Tasmania, Tassie Mariners players, Tasmanian Devils Football Club players

Andrew Lee (born 1 July 1986) is an Australian rules footballer who played with the Essendon Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He was drafted from the Burnie Dockers, via the Tassie Mariners U18s and the Tasmanian Devils, with selection 30 in the 2004 Draft.
Lee was captain of the Tassie Mariners U18 side in 2003 and 2004, and was ranked in the top 5 for the agility test at draft camp, which was an impressive effort for a taller, more solidly-built player.
Lee's debut year at Essendon was marred by a serious case of osteitis pubis. He was the only senior-listed player at Essendon to fail to play a senior game in 2005. The faith the club invested in him was evident in the granting of the prized number 32 jumper, previously worn by club champions Barry Davis and Tim Watson.  He made his debut in 2006 and played five games, but his 2008 season was affected by a shoulder injury he sustained playing in the Victorian Football League (VFL).Lucas injury tracking well (21 April 2008)
Lee was delisted by the club at the end of the 2008 season, after only playing 5 games for the club.Bombers complete list cuts (22 October 2008)

[[Sudbury Theatre Centre]]

CATEGORIES: Theatres in Ontario, Theatre companies in Ontario, Culture of Greater Sudbury, 1971 establishments in Canada, Visitor attractions in Greater Sudbury

The Sudbury Theatre Centre is a professional theatre company, located in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.
Following an Ontario government report in 1967 which recommended the creation of a theatre company in Sudbury, local arts patrons Sonja Dunn, Carolyn Fouriezos, Bill Hart, Bob Remnant and Peg Roberts raised funds to bring the Gryphon Theatre Company of Barrie to Sudbury for a production of Neil Simon's Come Blow Your Horn. That production was staged at Laurentian University's Fraser Auditorium in May 1970.
Following that production, the Sudbury Theatre Centre was officially incorporated on September 14, 1971. Over the next number of years, the STC staged plays and children's theatre workshops at Fraser Auditorium, Cambrian College and the Inco Club.  Its success was largely due to the dedication of long standing artistic director Tony Lloyd who made it his mission to build a theatre for the people of Sudbury.
In 1980, the city of Sudbury donated a parcel of municipal land on Shaughnessy Street near Civic Square to the STC for the construction of their own permanent 289-seat theatre. Construction began in July 1981, and the new facility was officially opened at the launch of the company's 1982 theatre season.
The company's current artistic director is David Savoy.

[[Black pepper crab]]

CATEGORIES: Singaporean cuisine, Crab dishes

Black pepper crab is one of the two most popular ways that crab is served in Singapore. It is made with hard-shell crabs, and fried with black pepper. Unlike the other popular chilli crab dish, it is less heavy due to the absence of a sauce. The black pepper crab is liked by many locals and foreign tourists over the chilli crab because of its drier and fragrant pepperish nature. It is becoming very popular to mix the pepper crab with a fresh jackfruit sauce. It is however not in the list of Singapore's National Dishes.http://www.yoursingapore.com/content/traveller/en/browse/dining/signature-dishes.html
The creation of Singapore's black pepper crab is attributed to Long Beach Seafood Restaurant in 1959.http://www.longbeachseafood.com.sg/about.php However, for many Singaporeans, Eng Seng Restaurant is widely recognised as the place for the best black pepper crabs, with notorious long queues, booking required and the dishes selling out by 8pm.http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/eng_seng_restaurant/http://ieatishootipost.sg/2008/09/eng-seng-restaurant-reserve-your-black.html

[[Music Man StingRay 5]]
CATEGORIES: Music Man electric bass guitars

Introduced in 1987, the StingRay 5 (SR5) was the first all-new Music Man bass designed and built in San Luis Obispo by the Ernie Ball team. The five-string's styling is based on the classic look of the Silhouette guitar. Advanced active electronics combine the best of the four-string StingRay along with innovations from Music Man designers, such as a ceramic humbucking pickup with a hum-cancelling "phantom" coil for noise reduction and three-way pickup selector for series and parallel combinations. The tuners are placed in a 4+1 configuration and the six-bolt on maple neck has a rosewood or maple fingerboard with 22 high-profile wide frets. The StingRay 5 is also available with an optional piezo bridge pickup, and as a lined or unlined fretless with a pao ferro fingerboard. 
In 2005, the StingRay 5 was updated with two humbuckers or a bridge humbucker paired with a neck single coil pickup and a five-way pickup switching system. The single humbucker model continues to be in production as well. 
In 2006, Music Man released a Limited Edition StingRay 5 featuring a five-bolt neck plate, no pickguard, string-through body, and an ebony fingerboard.
The same year, MusicMan started using compensated nuts on all their bass and guitar models except the Classic series, after having used them for the Music Man Bongo since 2003.
In February 2008, Ernie Ball switched back to alnico pickups for their Sting Ray 5s, after having used ceramic pickups for this model since 1991. The alnico pickups, which are also found in their four-string counterparts, give the instrument a sound more like a StingRay 4.

[[Victorius of Aquitaine]]
CATEGORIES: Late Antique Latin-language writers, 5th-century writers

Victorius of Aquitaine, a countryman of Prosper of Aquitaine and also working in Rome, produced in 457 an Easter Cycle, which was based on the consular list provided by Prosper's Chronicle. This dependency caused scholars to think that Prosper had been working on his own Easter Annals for quite some time. In fact, Victorius published his work only two years after the final publication of Prosper's Chronicle.
Victorius finished his Cursus Paschalis in 457. From that date onward he left blank the column giving the names of the consuls, but his table continued until the year AD 559 or Anno Passionis 532 (in the year of the Passion Jesus 532 — Victorius placed the Passion in AD 28), hence the name Cursus Paschalis annorum DXXXII (Easter Table up to the year 532). This first version was later continued by other authors, who filled in the names of the consuls as the years passed.
The Victorian system of the Cursus Paschalis was made official by a synod in Gaul in 541 and was still in use for historical work in England by 743, when an East Anglian king-list was created, which was double-dated with Victorian and Dionysian (A.D.) eras. Also, it was used for a letter to Charlemagne in 773, and probably, in its continued form, a source for both Bede (who found here that Aetius was consul for the third time in 446) and the Historia Brittonum.
Victorius also wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in Roman numerals) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were "a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144".Maher & Makowski 2001, p.383

Guy Ipoua (born 14 January 1976 in Douala) is an Cameroonian footballer who has played for Oryx Douala and a string of British and Continental clubs. His elder brother Samuel Ipoua represented Cameroon at the 1998 World Cup.
Ipoua was born in Cameroon and moved to Strasbourg, France at the age of four. His early football career is unclear but he joined AS Nancy in 1992, and had a spell at Torino where his brother was also on loan from Inter Milan, for six months. He was also on the books of Atlético Madrid, at the time the reigning La Liga champions and cup holders. He has also played for Sevilla, Alicante, Écija Balompié and Novelda.
In the summer of 1998, he spent 3 weeks on trial at Crystal Palace, but failed to secure a contract. He spent a season at Bristol Rovers where he scored 3 goals in 24 league games, before being released the following summer. A trial at Torquay United followed trial in July 1999, but he again failed to secure a contract. He subsequently went for trials at a number of clubs in England and Scotland, including Wycombe Wanderers and St. Johnstone.
He eventually signed for Scunthorpe United in August 1999, scoring on his debut against Bournemouth, and again against Cardiff City two days later. This earned him a contract with the club, and he enjoyed almost two successful seasons with Scunthorpe, notably scoring seven times in the space of a week. He was sold to Gillingham for just £25,000, a low fee because he could have left for free a couple months later under the Bosman ruling. He was mainly used as a substitute for Gillingham up to the end of the season.
After rejecting a possible move to the United States with FC Dallas, he joined Scottish side Livingston in July 2003, having missed a substantial amount of pre-season training. However he was to make just one appearance for the club, as a substitute.
In July 2004, Ipoua signed for Doncaster Rovers, but again failed to establish himself in the first team. He joined Mansfield Town on loan in October 2004 and Lincoln City on loan in February 2005 before being released at the end of the season.
In August 2005 he joined Hereford United and scored a goal in each of his first three league games. His season was disrupted by injury and in the latter stages he was used as only as a substitute. However he shone in Hereford's successful play-off campaign, scoring an extra-time winner in the semi-final against Morecambe. In the final itself he was brought on in the second half with Hereford 2–1 down, and soon made an impact. He skillfully controlled a flick on by Andy Ferrell, played the ball out to Simon Travis and then powerfully headed the return cross into the net to equalise. In the dying minutes of extra time he also did well to run the clock down by keeping the ball in the corner while fending off the attentions of several opposing players and earning Hereford 3 consecutive corners. Unfortunately, Guy was one of several Hereford players released shortly after the final.
In August 2006 he signed for Forest Green Rovers after impressing on trial in pre season for the Gloucestershire club. Ipoua made his Forest Green debut on 26 August 2006 in a 1–0 defeat against Gravesend & Northfleet.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/5266448.stm |title=Forest Green 0–1 Gravesend |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 August 2012[/tpl] After making just seven appearances, five of these from the bench, Ipoua was released in September 2006 and signed for Oryx Douala in his native Cameroon.http://doncasterrovers.in-doncaster.com/2008/08/old-rovers-players-what-there-doing-now/

The Dorn method is a form of manual, holistic alternative therapy used to correct claimed misalignments in the spinal column and other joints. In its theoretical approach, it is somewhat related to chiropractic and osteopathy, although it is different in its practical application. It was developed in the 1970s by the German lay-healer Dieter Dorn.
Early students of Dorn, like Helmuth Koch (who coined the name Dornmethode), Hildegard Steinhauser, Harald Fleig and others, started to teach the method in the 1990s, enabling its use to spread through Germany, Austria and Switzerland. According to its founder's wish, the Dorn method should become a kind of folk medicine, free from trademark or copyright so that anyone may access it.

The London School of Jewish Studies was founded as Jew's College in 1855, a rabbinical seminary in London.  
The organisation was re-focussed and renamed to its present name in 1999, with an emphasis on providing a broader range of adult educational courses and training to the wider Jewish community.  The rabbinical training programme was suspended, and much of the historical holdings of the library were sold off.Hebraica Libraries Group Report: London School of Jewish Studies, via Cambridge University Library, accessed 11 October 2013  LSJS has had growing success in its new role, and since 2012 once again offers rabbinical training, in partnership with the programme set up by the London Sephardi community.
Many leading figures in British Jewry have been associated with the School, including Michael Friedländer, Principal from 1865 to 1907;  Isidore Epstein, Principal 1948–1961; Louis Jacobs, Moral Tutor 1959–1961; and in recent years Jonathan Sacks, Principal 1984–1990.
In the modern era it has retained the support of the Orthodox Chief Rabbi, Lord Sacks, who stated that: "LSJS is part of a treasured tradition more valuable than jewels and more enduring than any precious metal. That is why my deepest commitment to any institution in Anglo-Jewry is to LSJS".

[[Southwestern water vole]]
CATEGORIES: Voles and lemmings, Mammals of Metropolitan France, Mammals of Europe, Animals described in 1908

The southwestern water vole or southern water vole (Arvicola sapidus) is a large amphibious vole found in most of France and south-westwards through Spain and Portugal.  Although historically considered to be a member of the same species as the Eurasian water vole, Musser and Carleton (2005) considered it distinct enough to warrant full species status.  It is listed on the IUCN Red List as vulnerable. It is threatened for many of the same reasons as the Northern water vole, and a campaign is currently underway to seek protection for the species, both at a national level and at European Union level.
The animal was traditionally one of the main ingredients in the Valencian dish called paella.

"Every Song is a Cry for Love" was the Irish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, which was written and sung by Brian Kennedy in English. He came 10th in the final, and his performance in the semi-final marked the 1000th Eurovision song of all time.[tpl]cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Kennedy (singer)|title=Hot off the press information|year=2006|url=http://www.briankennedy.co.uk/hotoffthepress.html|accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl] He wore a black suit and was backed by Calum MacColl on an acoustic guitar and singing and three specialist singers: Una Healy, Fran King and Paula Gilmer, who wore maroon dresses and black shirts and suits. The gentle ballad did not involve any dancing.[tpl]cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Kennedy (singer)|title=Every Song Is A Cry For Love|work=Eurovision Song Contest 2006|publisher=YouTube|date=2006-05-21|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-1AQkS5Nt4|accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl]
Kennedy was selected to represent Ireland at the discretion of national broadcaster RTÉ who then allowed the general public to choose the song during an edition of The Late Late Show in February,[tpl]cite web|last=Rodrigues|first=André|title="Every song is a cry for love" for Ireland|publisher=ESCToday|date=2006-02-17|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/5615|accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl] which involved Kennedy singing two other songs which were not submitted by himself. After Every Song Is A Cry For Love garnered 47% of the vote, it was selected. A fourth song had earlier been disqualified by RTÉ, whose panel of judges Brendan Graham, Paul Brady and Shay Healy had shortlisted for the final.[tpl]cite news|title=Brian Kennedy: He’ll be singing for both his redemption and Ireland’s|work=The Times|date=2005-11-20|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2091-1879939,00.html|accessdate=2006-08-29 | location=London[/tpl] It was marred by controversy, as his own song was included after the judging panel had called for additional songs, leading to claims that he had gained an unfair advantage.[tpl]cite news|title=Kennedy 'flattered' at Eurovision bid|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-02-18|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4727048.stm|accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl]

It was performed eighth in the semi-final, following Belgium's Kate Ryan with "Je t'adore" and preceding Cyprus' Annette Artani with "Why Angels Cry", the 1000th Eurovision song ever according to the European Broadcasting Union, after Ireland was forced to qualify due to its failure to make the final the previous year, and came 9th with 79 points, thus becoming one of ten songs to qualify from the semi-final. BBC commentary during the semi-final set Kennedy's task up as "saving Ireland's Eurovision soul" (a reference to his country's dominant performance of the early 1990s before it fell away later that decade). Indeed, after Ireland was announced as a qualifier, television footage clearly showed Kennedy mouthing "thank God" in the green room backstage.
The song was performed 21st in the final, following Croatia's Severina with "Moja štikla" and preceding Sweden's Carola with "Invincible". At the close of voting, it had received 93 points, placing 10th in a field of 24, thus giving Ireland an automatic berth in the final at the next edition of the Contest.
The song was succeeded as Irish representative by Dervish with "They Can't Stop the Spring".

The Berlin Wall (also known as [tpl]nihongo|Berlin no Kabe|ベルリンの壁[/tpl]) is a platform arcade game released by Kaneko in 1991. The player takes control of a boy who must use his hammer to break the blocks that form part of the platform levels that form each stage. These holes act as traps for the many patrolling monsters and once one has fallen into a hole, the player may then use the hammer on the monster to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below - causing it to change into fruit or power-ups, which can then be collected.
This game bears a number of similarities to Space Panic, generally considered as the first platform video game.

"Wildflowers" is a song written by Dolly Parton, which was included on Parton's 1987 album Trio with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt.  In the song, Parton talks about being restless and wanting to branch out, using wildflowers as a metaphor,  concluding that "wildflowers don't care where they grow".  The original recording featured an autoharp, acoustic guitar (played by Harris) and fiddle, and was arranged to sound like an old fashioned country waltz.  It was the fourth single released from the Trio album, and reached the U.S. country singles top ten in July 1988.
In 2008, the recording was played at a reception by the Texas State Democratic Party, honoring former First Lady Ladybird Johnson. Johnson's love of wild flowers was well known, and she had long championed the planting of them along the U.S. highways.

Dr. John Redman (February 22, 1722 – March 19, 1808) was the first president of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia and the medical preceptor of Benjamin Rush.
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after finishing his preparatory education in William Tennent's Log College, he began studying physics with John Kearsley, then one of the most eminent physicians of Philadelphia. He began practicing in Bermuda, and continued for several years.
Redman then moved to Europe to further study medicine. He lived one year in Edinburgh, attended lectures and dissections, and visited the hospitals in Paris. He matriculated 6 October 1747 at the University of Leyden Album Studiosorum Academiae Lugduno Batavae MDLXXV-MDCCCLXXV, kol. 1019.Index to English speaking students who have graduated at Leyden university / by Edward Peacock, F.S.A. - London : For the Index society, by Longmans, Green & co. 1883, p. 81, 1019. and graduated at the same University 15 July 1748.Bronnen tot de geschiedenis der Leidsche Universiteit, vijfde deel, 10 Febr. 1725-8 Febr. 1765 : Catalogus promotorum ex die 13.

After working for a time at Guy’s Hospital, he returned to America and again settled in Philadelphia, where he soon gained great celebrity. Many of Philadelphia's leading doctors studied under him, including John Morgan, Benjamin Rush, and Caspar Wistar. In 1784 he was elected an elder of the Second Presbyterian Church.
He was a man of small stature, of good sense and learning, and much respected in his day.
He became independently wealthy, and retired from business many years before his death. He used to visit his old friends and acquaintances after he became infirm from age, on a fat pony mare. Dr. James Rush says, "I remember him well hitching her to the turnbuckle of the mansion shutter, so that she always stood on the foot-pavement, where he visited my father, which he made it a point to do once or twice a year. In the rough cutting of his likeness, which was given to me by a member of his family, the hat, wig, nose, mouth, chin, eye, dress, person, expression, and character are admirably true. The mare is not so well done. The doctor retired from practice about 1785, and was known to the public as an antiquated-looking old gentleman. He was usually habited in a broad-skirted dark coat, with long pocket-flaps, buttoned across his under dress, and wearing, in strict conformity to the cut of the coat, a pair of Baron Steuben’s military-shaped boots, coming above the knees." Mr. Watson says, for riding-habit, "his hat flapped before and cocked up smartly behind, covering a full-bottomed powdered wig, in the front of which might be seen an eagle-pointed nose, separating a pair of piercing black eyes, his lips exhibiting, but only now and then, a quick motion, as though at the moment he was endeavoring to extract the essence of a small quid. As thus described in habit and in person, he was to be seen almost daily, in fair weather, mounted on a short, fat, black, switch-tailed mare, and riding for his amusement and exercise, in a brisk racking canter, about the streets and suburbs of the city."
He died of apoplexy, March 19, 1808, in the same house in which he lived for more than half a century, on Second Street, about one-third of a square from Arch, on the west side, next to Dr. Ustick's Baptist Church. He was predeceased by his youngest daughter, in 1806, and his wife.

Alfasound was a radio jingle production company based in Manchester from late 1970s to mid-1990s founded by Alan Fawkes and ex-Piccadilly Radio DJ Steve England.
Alfasound was responsible for some of the most memorable radio jingles in the 80s and 90s, including Piccadilly, the very first jingle set for 96.4 Sound Wave in Swansea. It produced over 10 jingle packages for Radio Trent in Nottingham from 1980 until the station was taken over by GWR Group (now GCap) and re-branded as 96 Trent FM.
Alfasound also served smaller clents too with equal service and talent, such as short term stations. In April 1994 a modest package was recorded for Victory FM who became the full-time broadcasters to Greater Portsmouth 1999, with more jingles from Manchester.  
Alfasound also sold collectors tapes and CDs to jingle fans which have become sought after items. Through the late 1980s Alfasound also became UK distributors for Jam Creative Productions.
Alfasound (also known as Alfa in the 1990s) closed in 1997. Steve England went onto form his own production company and still makes radio jingles today.

Such filters are commonly employed in the treatment of waste water. These reactors are gaining in popularity versus more established aerobic waste-water treatment systems because they produce a less solid residueAF Reactor Paper Francisco, O., Garrido, J.

[[Flu-flu arrow]]

CATEGORIES: Archery

A flu-flu arrow is a type of arrow specifically designed to travel a short distance. Such arrows are particularly useful when shooting at aerial targets or for certain types of recreational archery where the arrow must not travel too far. One of the main uses of these arrows is that they do not get lost as easily if they miss the target.
A flu-flu is a design of fletching, normally made by using long sections of feathers, in most cases six or more sections are used, rather than the traditional three. Alternatively, two long feathers can be spiraled around the end of the arrow shaft.  In either case, the excessive fletching serves to generate more drag and slow the arrow down rapidly after a short distance (about 30m). Recreational flu-flus usually have rubber points to add weight and keep the flight slower.

[[Rover P3]]
CATEGORIES: Rover vehicles, 1940s automobiles, Sedans, Rear-wheel-drive vehicles, Vehicles introduced in 1948

The Rover P3 is a car that was produced by the Rover company in 1948 and 1949. 
For the post-war market Rover had a new engine that had been in preparation since the late 1930s with overhead inlet and side exhaust valves. It was made in two versions for the car, the "60" had a four-cylinder unit of 1595 cc and the "75" had a six-cylinder version of 2103 cc. The gearbox and traditional Rover freewheel were kept unchanged from the previous model.
To go with the engine a new car was prepared. Although the body was similar in styling to the Rover 12 and 16, many of the body panels were in fact new but the wings and bonnet from the 12 were carried over. The car was 0.5 inch (12 mm) wider outside than the 16 but by making better use of space this translated to 2.5 inches (60 mm) inside. It was 4.5 inches (115 mm) shorter in the wheelbase. Also new, and a first for a Rover, was independent front suspension but the brakes remained a hydraulic/mechanical hybrid system. Rather than having a complete chassis, the new frame, which was a box section, was stopped short of the rear axle and the rear semi-elliptic springs were attached to the body. This allowed the rear axle travel to be increased and an improved ride resulted.
Two body styles were available, a six light saloon and four light "Sports Saloon".
The cars were expensive at £1080 for the "60" and £1106 for the "75", and with early post-war production problems and material shortages it was never intended that the cars would be produced in large numbers. Eventually, 1274 of the "60" and 7837 of the "75" models were made before the car was replaced by the all-new P4 of 1949.
The engine and gearbox from the car were also used as the basis for those in the original Land Rover Series. About six "75" models were produced with triple SU carburettors - a throw back to Rover's pre-war 'Speed' performance models; one survivor has an over-bored 2,400 cc engine; the basis of the Marauder 100 engine.

Like its predecessor, the X1, the X8 system included core memory, 27-bit word length with 15-bit addressing, and drum memory as secondary storage (not as primary storage).  The X8 included an independent peripheral processor called CHARON (Centraal Hulporgaan Autonome Regeling Overdracht Nevenapparatuur, or Central Coprocessor Autonomous Regulation Transfer Peripherals) which handled I/O.  Other features included up to 48 input/output channels designed for low speed devices such as paper tape, plotters and printers. Unlike the X1, the arithmetic unit of the X8 included floating point arithmetic, with a 40-bit mantissa and 11-bit exponent.
The system is most notable as the target processor for Edsger Dijkstra's implementation of the THE multiprogramming system.

Bazas Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Bazas) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and a national monument of France, located in Bazas, Gironde.
Bazas was the seat of the Bishop of Bazas until the French Revolution (after which it was not restored but was instead, by the Concordat of 1801, divided between the dioceses of Bordeaux, Agen and Aire) and its main attraction is still the cathedral dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, so named because the blood of John the Baptist was venerated here.  The cathedral dominates the town and stands at the east end of a wide, open space called the parvis.
The cathedral dates mainly from the 13th-14th centuries, and was built on the model of the great Gothic cathedrals of northern France.  The west front is unique with its three noticeable levels: the first includes the three Gothic portals retaining part of their original 13th century sculpture; the second includes the rose window from 1537; and the third is a Neoclassical gable from 1723.  The belfry on the north is part 11th century up to the openings. 
The interior consists of a long, narrow nave, with no transept, and was entirely rebuilt from 1583-1635 after the Huguenots badly damaged it in 1561 during the Wars of Religion.
The cathedral is part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.

Belfort Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-Christophe de Belfort) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Belfort, and has been a national monument of France since 1930.
The building that is now the cathedral was built as a church between 1727 and 1750 by the businessman Henri Schuller (or Shuler) (whose son was later a canon here) to plans by Jacques Philippe Mareschal, king's engineer at Strasbourg. It was built of red sandstone excavated from the quarry at Offremont, three kilometres from Belfort.
Although the church opened for worship in 1750, the north tower was not completed until 1845.
It contains an organ by the organ-builder Joseph Valtrin, installed in 1752 and now classed as an historic monument in its own right.
On 3 November 1979 the Diocese of Belfort-Montbéliard was created from part of the territory of the Archdiocese of Besançon. The seat of the bishop was established at Belfort, and St. Christopher's church was elevated to the status of cathedral.

The nave was destroyed by a hurricane in 1678, and the reconstruction in Gothic style took place between 1680 and 1700 under the architect Arnoult-Séraphin Poictevin (d. 1720). The Lady Chapel by the architect Jules Potier de la Morandière was added in about 1860.
To celebrate the church's elevation to a cathedral in 1697, Louis XIV presented the organ loft in 1704. The new see thereupon took the dedication to Saint Louis.

Cambrai Cathedral (Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Grâce de Cambrai) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and a national monument of France, located in Cambrai. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Cambrai.
It was built between 1696 and 1703, on the site of a former 11th century building, as the church of the Abbey of St-Sulpice. During the French Revolution the old cathedral of Cambrai was destroyed, but the abbey church survived because it was used as a Temple of Reason. When the ecclesiastical status of Cambrai was restored in 1802, albeit as a diocese rather than as an archdiocese, which it had previously been, the bishop's seat was established in the surviving abbey church, which became the cathedral of Cambrai. Cambrai was again constituted an archbishopric in 1841.
The cathedral was severely damaged by fire in 1859, but at length restored, with advice from Viollet-le-Duc, and consecrated on 12 May 1894.
The cathedral was also badly damaged in World War I and, not so seriously, in World War II.
It contains the tomb, by David d'Anger, of François Fénelon, who was archbishop from 1696 to 1715. The Cathedral is a minor pilgrimage site because of the noted Italo-Byzantine painting called "Our Lady of Cambrai" or the Cambrai Madonna (c. 1340) in a side chapel. The cathedral now takes its dedication name from this: "Notre-Dame de Grâce" or "Virgin of Tenderness", from the Eleusa icon type it exemplifies.  In the same chapel is a memorial erected by Hilaire Belloc to commemorate his son who was killed nearby in the last days of World War I.

It was formerly the cathedral of Carcassonne until 1801, when it was replaced by the present Carcassonne Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-Michel de Carcassonne).
The original church is thought to have been constructed in the 6th century during the reign of Theodoric the Great, the ruler of the Visigoths. On 12 June in 1096, Pope Urban II visited the town and blessed the stones used to build the cathedral of Saint Nazaire and Saint Celse; construction was completed in the first half of the twelfth century.[tpl]cite web| title=St Nazarius’ Basilica 11th – 20th Century | author=carcassonne.org| publisher= carcassonne.org | url=http://www.carcassonne.org/carcassonne_en.nsf/vuetitre/DocPatrimoineBasiliqueStNazaire5[/tpl] It was built on the site of a Carolingian cathedral, of which no traces remain. The crypt too, despite its ancient appearance, dates from the new construction. The church was enlarged between 1269 and 1330 in the Gothic style, largely at the expense of the Bishop of Carcassonne, Pierre de Rochefort.
The exterior was largely renewed by Viollet-le-Duc, while the interior has largely remained the Gothic original.

The origins of the name are associated with trade. One explanation goes that the name was derived from a word meaning "warehouse." Merchants from Vilnius and Riga would meet and exchange the goods somewhere in the area. Lithuanians called their storage places podėlis and Latvians – pondėlis. The other explanation claims that the name comes from panedėlis – Monday, the day of the week when the market was open.
The town is first mentioned in 1591. The manor belonged to the Rajecki family, who sold it to the Kościałkowskis in 1767. The new owners, Stumbrai, demolished the manor. Only a park is left, planted according to Italian traditions. Ignacy Kościałkowski built a brick church in 1801. Antanas Strazdas, a famous poet, worked for short period in the church.

[[Meaux Cathedral]]

CATEGORIES: Cathedrals in France, Churches in Seine-et-Marne, Basilica churches in France

Meaux Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-Étienne de Meaux) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and a national monument of France, in the town of Meaux, in the department of Seine-et-Marne, east of Paris. It is the seat of the Bishop of Meaux. The construction of the cathedral is not finished.
Construction of the cathedral began between 1175 - 1180, when a structure in Romanesque style was started. Defects in the original design and construction had to be corrected in the 13th century, in which the architect Gautier de Vainfroy was much involved. He had to remove the previous cathedral almost totally and start a new structure in Gothic style.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/E/France/IleDeFrance/MeauxCathedral.htm|title=St. Etienne Cathedral, Meaux|publisher=Wondermondo[/tpl]  In the later 13th century work was often interrupted due to lack of funds, a problem removed by the generosity of Charles IV in the early 14th century.  Further progress was interrupted by the Hundred Years' War and occupation by the English.
The archives of the diocese were destroyed in 1793 – 1794, thus deleting much knowledge about the early history of the church.
The composer Pierre Moulu worked at the cathedral in the early 16th century.
The design of the cathedral, because of its construction period, encompasses several periods of Gothic art.  The cathedral rises to a height of 48 meters; inside, the vaults at the choir rise to 33 meters.  The interior ornamentation is noted for its smoothness, and the space for its overall luminosity.  The cathedral contains a famous organ, built in the 17th century.

[[Cattle judging]]

CATEGORIES: Agricultural shows, Cattle

Cattle judging is the process of judging a series of cattle and pronouncing a first, second and third place animal based on each animal's individual traits compared to that of the others. Most cattle judging occurs in show rings at agricultural shows.
Judgments on cattle are ultimately based on which cow is worth the most profit. When judging cattle, the judge wants to act as if he or she were buying the cow, and wanted to find the most valuable cow?
There are many fine points to cattle judging. In a beef cow, for example, it is desirable to have a large animal with muscle development. In a dairy cow, however, the judge would look for characteristics that would help to produce the best possible milk. When judging cattle, there is an overjudge, who looks at all of the cattle and puts them in order of ‘best’ cow to ‘worst’ cow.

The car started the season in the hands of Kimi Räikkönen and Juan Pablo Montoya, but after a few races it soon became clear that it was not as competitive as its predecessor, the MP4-20, despite an apparent improvement in reliability. McLaren did not win a race all season, for the first time since 1996. Their best results were second place finishes for Kimi Räikkönen in Australia and Italy, for Juan Pablo Montoya in Monaco, and for Pedro de la Rosa in Hungary.

Thirunyanasambanthan Thevar s/o Veerasamy Thevar, also known as T. Sambanthan Thevar, was the fifth President of Malaysian Indian Congress and one of the Founding Fathers of Malaysia along with Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tan Cheng Lock. He was the MIC President from 1955 to 1973, when he was ousted by party members.
Sambanthan Thevar was one of the leading Indian leaders who played a prominent role in the independence movement in Malaya. As president of the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) during this important period of transition, he worked closely with Alliance Party leader Tunku Abdul Rahman and they developed a close personal bond.
He is credited with three important developments in Malaysian political history: the consolidation of the Malayan (now Malaysian) Indian Congress, its transformation into a mass-based party, and its integral role as a partner in the current ruling alliance.
The entry of the MIC into the multi-communal Alliance in 1955 contributed greatly to enhancing the coalition’s image as the main representative of the three main communities in Malaya.
The finest hour was achieved on August 31, 1957 when Independence was achieved under the Merdeka Agreement, to which Sambanthan was a signatory.

The Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden or Jardim Botânico is located at the Jardim Botânico district in the "Zona Sul" (South Zone) of Rio de Janeiro. 
The Botanical Garden shows the diversity of Brazilian and foreign flora. There are around 6,500 species (some endangered) distributed throughout an area of 54 hectares, and there are numerous greenhouses. The Garden also houses monuments of historical, artistic and archaeological significance. There is an important research center, which includes the most complete library in the country specializing in botany with over 32,000 volumes.
It was founded in 1808 by King John VI of Portugal. Originally intended for the acclimatisation of spices like nutmeg, pepper and cinnamon imported from the West Indies, the Garden was opened to the  public in 1822, and is now open during daylight hours every day except December 25 and the 1st of January.
The 140-hectare park lies at the foot of the Corcovado Mountain, far below the right arm of the statue of Christ the Redeemer and contains more than 6,000 different species of tropical and subtropical plants and trees, including 900 varieties of palm trees. A 750 m line of 134 palms forms the Avenue of Royal Palms leading from the entrance into the gardens. These palms all descended from a single tree, the Palma Mater, long since destroyed by lightning. Only about 40% of the park is cultivated, the remainder being Atlantic Forest rising up the slopes of Corcovado. The park is protected by the Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional and was designated as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in 1992.
The Botanical Garden has an important research institute, which develops a wide range of botanical studies in Brazil. The institute has taxonomists who specialize in the identification and conservation of the neotropical flora.
The gardens house collections that include bromeliads, orchids, carnivorous plants, and cacti. These include Brazil’s largest botanical library and collections of dried fruits, rare Brazilian plants, and many photographs. The painted cast-iron Fountain of the Muses was made in Derby, UK, and until 1895 was sited at Henrique Lage's villa at Largo da Lapa, as part of the landscaping by the English painter John Tydall.Michelin Travel Guide Rio de Janeiro 2009:177; Illustration. 
The park contains 140 species of birds, many of which have become accustomed to humans and are consequently much easier to observe than in the wild. These include the Channel-billed Toucan, Dusky-legged Guan and Slaty-breasted Rail. Howler monkeys and Tufted-eared Marmosets are also frequently seen in the  Botanical Gardens.
Features of interest include an old gunpowder factory, the Victoria Lilies in the Lago Frei Leandro pond, the Japanese Garden, and many sculptures and fountains.

Blunsdon railway station is a heritage railway station serving the village of Blunsdon, north of Swindon in Wiltshire, England.
It was one of the last to be opened by the Midland and South Western Junction Railway in 1895 on a railway that had opened in 1883. It was little more than a single-platform halt, and milk was the main traffic. It also had a single siding, used for such traffic as fertiliser and other agricultural requirements.
It was also one of the first stations on the route to be closed. Passenger traffic went in 1924, though regular trains had stopped calling in 1922, leaving one solitary passenger train service stopping at Blunsdon on a Sunday. Goods traffic ceased in 1937.
The site became the headquarters of the Swindon and Cricklade Railway in the late 1970s because it offered the best road access to the trackbed between Swindon and Cricklade. By that time, almost every trace of the original station had gone, and the present structures are all new.
Blunsdon station is actually within the boundaries of Purton, and the Purton area probably produced most of its original business. Unsubstantiated tradition says the station was named Blunsdon to avoid confusion with the Great Western station already existing in Purton village. Blunsdon St Andrew village is more than two miles away.
Blunsdon station offers a variety of services including the Swindon and Cricklade railway shop, canteen/buffet, toilets and car parking space.

Tlaxcala (Nahuatl Tlaxcallān "place of maize tortillas") was a pre-Columbian city and state in central Mexico.
Ancient Tlaxcala was a republic ruled by a council of between 50 and 200 chief political officials (teuctli sg., teteuctin pl.) (Fargher et al. 2010). These officials gained their positions through service to the state, usually in warfare, and as a result came from both the noble (pilli) and commoner (macehualli) classes. Following the Spanish Conquest, Tlaxcala was divided into four fiefdoms (señoríos) by the Spanish corregidor Gómez de Santillán in 1545 (26 years after the Conquest). These fiefdoms were Ocotelolco, Quiahuiztlan, Tepeticpac, and Tizatlan. At this time, four great houses or lineages emerged and claimed hereditary rights to each fiefdom and created fictitious genealogies extending back into the pre-Columbian era to justify their claims (Gibson 1952).

[[Shyok River]]

CATEGORIES: International rivers of Asia, Tributaries of the Indus River

The Shyok River (literally "the river of death" in Yarkandi) flows through northern Ladakh in India and the Northern Areas of Pakistan (Ghangche District), spanning some [tpl]convert|550|km|abbr=on[/tpl].
The Shyok River, a tributary of the Indus River, originates from the Rimo Glacier, one of the tongues of Siachen Glacier. The river widens at the confluence with the Nubra River. The alignment of the Shyok river is very unusual, originating from the Rimo glacier, it flows in a southeasterly direction and, joining the Pangong range, it takes a northwestern turn, flowing parallel to its previous path. The Shyok flows in a wide valley, suddenly entering a narrow gorge after Chalunka, continuing through Turtuk and Tyakshi before crossing into Pakistan. The Shyok joins the Indus at Keris, to the east of the town of Skardu.Aerial view of river junction[tpl]cite book |title= Pakistan and the Karakoram Highway |series= Lonely Planet Regional Guides |last=Bennett-Jones |first= Owen |coauthors=Brown, Lindsay; Mock, John |date=1 September 2004|publisher= Lonely Planet Publications|isbn= 978-0-86442-709-0|edition=6th Revised| page=306  |url= http://books.google.fi/books?id=Bu4yHImhtIYC&pg=PA306 |accessdate=2009-08-26[/tpl]
The Nubra river, originating from the Siachen glacier, also behaves like the Shyok. Before Tirit the SE flowing river Nubra takes a NW turn on meeting the river Shyok. The similarity in the courses of these two important rivers probably indicates a series of paleo fault lines trending NW-SE in delimiting the upper courses of the rivers. The importance of the Indus and the Shyok rivers is in the deposition of the thick Quaternary sediments—a treasure trove for geology researchers.

In the social aspects of television, several studies have found that educational television has many advantages. The Media Awareness Network, explains in its article, The Good Things about Television, that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely.

The Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), often mistranslated as the Malayan Races Liberation Army or MRLA, was a guerrilla army based in the Malayan peninsula and Singapore. It originally fought the Japanese during the second world war as the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA),  from 1948-1960 it fought British and Commonwealth forces for an independent Malaya. In 1968 the MNLA resurged operating from Southern Thailand it fought against the Malaysian government in various areas of the Malayan jungle mainly in the North. In 1989 the Malayan Communist Party signed a peace treaty with the Malaysian state and the MNLA and the Party settled in villages in southern Thailand. 
Malayan Races Liberation Army is a translation from the Chinese 马来亚民族解放军 where 民族 means "nationality" in the ethnic sense.

CATEGORIES: Political history of the United States, United States historical documents, Works by James Madison

Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 was James Madison's record of the daily debates held by delegates at the Philadelphia Convention, which resulted in the drafting of the current United States Constitution. Madison's journal describing what delegates said remains valuable to historians, as it is one of historians' few sources of information on the proceedings in Independence Hall during the summer of 1787 (which despite the summer heat, had its windows shut so that those outside could not hear what was being said; delegates were forbidden to leak the proceedings to the public).   
Madison, a delegate from Virginia and future President of the United States, who due to his role in creating the Virginia Plan became known as the "Father of the Constitution", purposely sat up front, stating in the preface to his notes that "in pursuance of the task I had assumed I chose a seat in front of the presiding member, with the other members on my right & left hands. In this favorable position for hearing all that passed, I noted in terms legible & in abbreviations & marks intelligible to myself what was read from the Chair or spoken by the members; and losing not a moment unnecessarily between the adjournment & reassembling of the Convention I was enabled to write out my daily notes..." 
Madison also avoided any long absences from the meetings, so as not to miss what was said: "It happened, also that I was not absent a single day, nor more than a cassual fraction of an hour in any day, so that I could not have lost a single speech, unless a very short one." http://teachingamericanhistory.org/convention/debates/preface.html

Psyri or Psiri or Psyrri or Psirri ([tpl]lang-el|Ψυρρή ή Ψυρή[/tpl],Probably derived from Ψυρής "inhabitant of Psara." [tpl]IPA-el|psiˈri|pron[/tpl]) is a gentrified neighbourhood in Athens, Greece, today known for its restaurants, bars, live music tavernas, and small number of hotels.
Until the early 1990s, Psyri had a dangerous reputation, but it has now become one of the most fashionable and trendy choices in the centre of Athens for accommodation, entertainment and food hospitality.
The central square of Psyri is called "Heroes square" (πλατεία Ηρώων - plateia Iroon), because the streets leading to it carry names of heroes (Karaiskakis, Miaoulis). In the era of the 'old Athens' (namely, during the last quarter of the 19th century), the nickname "plateia of Heroes" was a derisive reference to koutsavakides (κουτσαβάκηδες), who used it as their hangout.
Lord Byron was accommodated in the neighbourhood during his stay in Athens and here is where he wrote the poem "Maid of Athens".  The most famous Greek inhabitant of Psiri was Alexandros Papadiamantis who lived in the area for more than two decades.

[[St Luke's railway station]]
CATEGORIES: Disused railway stations in Sefton, Former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway stations, Railway stations opened in 1883, Railway stations closed in 1968, Buildings and structures in Southport

St Luke's railway station was a railway station in Southport, Merseyside. It opened by the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway on 2 July 1883 as Barton Street, serving the route from Southport Chapel Street to Wigan. It was then renamed three months later as Southport St Luke's Road.
On 1 March 1902, the station was renamed again as Southport St Luke's, and in June of that year it began serving the Preston line, absorbing the adjacent Southport Ash Street railway station. The two platforms were almost at right angles to each other, both separated by a road named Hart Street. They did, however, share the same ticket office, located on the street at St Luke's Road.
On 22 March 1904 the Preston line was electrified all the way up to Crossens, and enabled a regular service to stop at St Luke's. In May 1914, the station was finally named St Luke's.
Trains to Preston (including the Crossens electric shuttle) ended when the line was closed on 7 September 1964, a victim of the Beeching Axe.  However the station did not close as some trains bound for Wigan still used part of the route.  The direct line to Wigan then closed on 14 June 1965 with trains being diverted via Meols Cop and a section of the old branch line to Altcar to allow the closure of the busy level crossing at Blowick.  The end of St Luke's station came when the Preston platform, still serving a number of trains, finally closed on 9 September 1968.
Today, the site of the Wigan platforms have been built over with a modern housing development, but the tracks widen at a point where the Preston platform used to stand and can be clearly seen by passing trains.

[[Unique Party]]
CATEGORIES: Political parties in Sweden, Organizations established in 2006

The Unique Party ([tpl]lang-sv|Unika partiet[/tpl]) was a minor Swedish political party founded by model and Big Brother participant Linda Rosing.
The party was announced late July and officially founded following a press conference in Stockholm on August 3, 2006, a little more than a month before the upcoming election. Following Rosing's initiative and joining as board members were Christian Björklund and Pierre Almquist, former members of the Pirate Party, which also was started the same year. Cecila Beckroth, former treasurer of the pirate party, also served briefly on the board before leaving.
The party was widely regarded as populist due to Rosing's background, but has nonetheless gained support from some established politicians.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl]
The party received only 222 votes in the general election at September 17, 2006, which is less than 0,01% of the votes.
Linda Rosing has since the 2006 election stepped down as the top name of the party and is now only a board member.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl] She says it is possible that she will run as the top name in next election, but at the moment she wants to focus on her career as a singer and model. The Unique Party's next goal is to get seats in the European Parliament after the 2009 European Parliament election.

Taroom [tpl]IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|r|uː|m[/tpl] is a town on the Dawson River in Queensland. Australia in the Shire of Banana.  The town is located on the Leichhardt Highway, [tpl]convert|380|km|mi[/tpl] north west of the state capital, Brisbane, [tpl]convert|261|km|mi[/tpl] from Rockhampton and [tpl]convert|302|km|mi[/tpl] from Toowoomba. At the 2006 census, Taroom had a population of 629.[tpl]Census 2006 AUS|id=UCL353400|name=Taroom (L) (Urban Centre/Locality) |accessdate=25 June 2011|quick=on[/tpl]
Prussian explorer Ludwig Leichhardt passed through the district in 1844, carving his initials and date on a coolibah tree that now stands in the centre of town. Leichhardt's carving is no longer visible following an alleged attempt to remove bark growing over the initials that removed the initials as well. Reporting the rich soils in the area, settlers began taking up land in 1845 and by 1850 a town had been established at a popular camping spot near the Dawson River.
Originally named Bonners Knob the town was officially renamed Taroom, possibly after the nearby Taroom cattle station, on completion of the first post office in 1856. The name Taroom is said to be an aboriginal word for native fruit trees in the area. Situated [tpl]convert|40|km|mi[/tpl] west of Taroom is Hornet Bank Station which was the site of the 1857 Hornet Bank massacre, the genocidal reprisals for which led to the Yeeman Indigenous language group and people being wiped out.
Taroom is a major centre for the Queensland beef industry.  Other industries includes prime hard wheat and forestry.
Taroom has a rare windmill of an unusual design located on the banks of the Dawson River. The windmill was produced by the Steel Wings Company, in North Sydney between 1907 and 1911, one of only six models ever erected. The windmills comprise a steel frame and fan which turns to the wind between a bearing at the bottom and a swivel at the top, all supported by guy-wires. Along with another example in Jerilderie in the Riverina, the fully restored windmills are the only two known working examples in the world designed so their fan is contained and spins within the fully pivoting frame. 
Isla Gorge National Park, Precipice National Park and Expedition National Park are all nearby.

[[DZI (company)]]

CATEGORIES: Insurance companies, Companies of Bulgaria

DZI [tpl]IPA-bg|ˈdɛˈzɛˈi|[/tpl], an acronym for State Insurance Institute ([tpl]lang-bg|Държавен застрахователен институт[/tpl], ''Darzhaven zastrahovatelen institut'') is a Bulgarian company primarily engaged in various forms of insurance. 
On 27 June 1946 Bulgaria passed a law providing for nationalization of insurance companies and for a state monopoly on insurance business. Based on this law, all assets and liabilities of the existing public and cooperative insurance companies, mutual insurance funds, insurance departments of banks etc. are transferred to the State Insurance Institute (DZI). All valid insurances and portfolios, debts, as well as reinsurance contracts preserved their validity and were transferred by rights to DZI. By this act, effectively, were merged the active insurance companies into a bigger one. The state insurance control also ended its activity because the functions of the insurance control were transferred to DZI too.
DZI was created by this law as an autonomous company, juridical entity with headquarters in Sofia and with a complex structure, functioning in this way until 1952 when the establishment of branches and gradual decentralization of the Institutes activity began.
DZI functioned as the only insurance company in Bulgaria until 1961 when a government decree established the Bulgarian foreign insurance and reinsurance company “Bulstrad” founded on the then existing department within the DZI. The main shareholder in “Bulstrad” was the Finance Ministry and one of the principal shareholders was DZI itself. “Bulstrad”  dealt with all insurance contracts related to obligations outside of the territory of the country – marine, aviation, tourist etc., while DZI kept its monopoly over insurance business inside the country.
Apart the monopoly on insurance, after 1946 the State gradually raised the relative share of compulsory (by law) insurance. The Law for Property insurance was voted in 1958 and the modifications of 1969 enlarged considerably the range of compulsory property insurance.
The juridical monopoly on insurance has been kept strictly until 1989, when started real competition in insurance. Should be noticed, that although some of the names coincided, the newly created insurance companies were by no means successors of those existing before 1946.
The rise of the new situation in the business was a challenge for DZI, which successfully transformed itself to market conditions and kept its pre-eminent position thanks to excellent performance and the offering of insurance products of the highest standard. Together with its business development, the Company has collaborated actively for the establishment of an appropriate insurance legislation and was among the co-founders of the Bulgarian insurers association in 1992.
In October 1998 DZI was transformed into a public company with 100% state ownership. On 7 December 1999 in the “State Gazette”, issue 107 was published the decision of the Privatization Agency to open a procedure for privatization of the “State Insurance Institute – DZI” Plc. which ended with the sale of the company on 27 August 2002 to Emil Kyulev’s “Contract Sofia” Ltd.
On 10 October 2002 at the shareholders’ General Meeting was taken the decision to rename the “State Insurance Institute – DZI” Plc. to “DZI” Plc.
On 21 December 2006, Eurobank EFG acquired over 90% of DZI's banking division, which was merged into Postbank in the third quarter of 2007.
On 3 August 2007 KBC received all needed approval’s documents from regulations authorities and successfully finalized the acquisition of DZI with total amount of the acquired shares reaching 80,457%. 
DZI is headquartered in a six-storey landmark building in the centre of Sofia built 1914-1926 by architect G. Fingov.http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:9JDdwUh3YKQJ:www.monitor.bg/bussiness/article%3Fsid%3D%26aid%3D79918%26cid%3D40%26eid%3D704+%D0%94%D0%97%D0%98+%D1%81%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0+1926&hl=bg&gl=bg&ct=clnk&cd=1

[[Ephesia Grammata]]
CATEGORIES: Magic words, Greek religion inscriptions, Ephesus

Ephesia Grammata, Εφέσια Γράμματα, ("Ephesian words") are Ancient Greek magical formulas attested from the 5th or 4th century BC. According to Pausanias the Lexicographer (Eust. ad Od. 20, 247, p. 1864), their name derives from their being inscribed on the cult image of Artemis in Ephesus. Clement of Alexandria considers them an invention of the Daktyloi.
Similar to the mantras of Buddhism and Hinduism, they were "meaningless words" (ἄσημα ὀνόματα) potent to protect those who could speak them correctly, their power residing in their sound, so that they were ineffective if mispronounced.
Plutarch (Quaest. Conv. 706D) reports that the Magi instructed victims of demonic possession to recite the Ephesia Grammata. 
In the 4th century comedy Lyropoios by Anaxilas, one character carries Ephesia Grammata inscribed on his belt.Apud Athenaeus, Deipnosophistes 12:548c.
The best known Ephesia Grammata are a group of six words: 
A version of this formula seems to be attested by a damaged inscription from Himera, Sicily, which must date to before the Carthaginian destruction of the city in 409 BC.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jordan|first=David|year=2000|title=Ephesia Grammata at Himera|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=130|pages=104–107|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/2000/130pdf/130104.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-12-13[/tpl] The next earliest epigraphic evidence for the formula comes from the 4th century BC, and it continues to re-appear on magical papyri throughout the Hellenistic period. The words sometimes occur in significantly different variants, for example on the lead tablet of Phalasarna, Crete:
There were various attempts by ancient authors to make sense of the words. [tpl]lang|und|Damnameneus[/tpl] was interpreted as the name of a Dactyl.
Androcydes proposed an interpretation as philosophical symbols (Clement, Stromata 5, 8, 45, 2):
[tpl]lang|und|aski[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc|ἄσκιον[/tpl] "shadowless") as "darkness", [tpl]lang|und|kataski[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc|κατάσκιον[/tpl] "shadowy") as "brightness" (brightness being necessary in order to cast shadows), [tpl]lang|und|lix[/tpl] (Hsch.: [tpl]lang|grc|"λίξ: πλάγιος, καὶ λίθος πλατύς"[/tpl]) as an ancient term for "Earth", and [tpl]lang|und|tetrax[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc|τετραξός[/tpl] "fourfold") as the year (the four seasons), [tpl]lang|und|Damnameneus[/tpl] as "Sun" and [tpl]lang|und|aisia[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc|αἴσιος[/tpl] "right, fitting, auspicious") as Logos.

[[Caribbean Regiment]]
CATEGORIES: Caribbean Sea operations of World War II, Military of the Caribbean, Military units and formations of the British Empire in World War II, British colonial regiments

The Caribbean Regiment (also known as the Carib Regiment) was formed in World War II. The regiment which went overseas in July 1944 and saw service in the Middle East and Italy.
There had been resistance from the War Office to the formation of a West Indian regiment but those who made their own way to the UK were able to enlist in the British Army. Nearly 10,000 West Indians travelled and enlisted in the army in Britain.
Following discussion between the Colonial Office and the War Office, however, the Caribbean Regiment was formed of 1,200 volunteers in April 1944. The recruits were drawn from all over the British West Indies, mostly members of local Volunteer Defence Forces. A few officers and Non-commissioned Officers were also drafted in from British Army units.
A detachment of 104 officers and men from the Atlantic island of Bermuda, made up of volunteers (conscription had been introduced to Bermuda shortly after the declaration of war, but those who were drafted to the Caribbean Regiment volunteered to do so) from the Bermuda Militia Artillery and Bermuda Militia Infantry, arrived on two ships, on the 13th and the 23rd April, 1944, to form the training cadre of the new regiment at Fort Eustis, a US Army base near Williamsburg, Virginia. Under the command of Lt. Colonel H. Wilkin, OBE, MC, they prepared for the arrival of detachments from the West Indian islands, each under its own officers. Newly recruited men were tested in Virginia for fitness.
Some of the Caribbean soldiers had already trained for deployment to the Pacific. The Bermudians had previously trained for the war in Europe. The new regiment trained in Trinidad and Virginia, U.S. (where the regiment was the first to celebrate the King's birthday in the U.S. since the American Revolution).
The Regiment left the USA for Oran, in North Africa, in June, 1944. Oran was handed over to Free French Forces before their arrival, and the Regiment was instead sent to Italy in July 1944, where it was employed in general duties behind the front line. In October it escorted 4000 German prisoners of war from Italy to Egypt, where it was used in mine clearance work around the Suez Canal area. 
The regiment never saw front line action. This was due partly to inadequate training (with only a single battalion, it had not trained as part of a larger brigade - the smallest unit the British Army normally fielded on its own) and partly because of the anticipated political impact in the British West Indies if heavy casualties had been incurred.
In 1946 it returned to the West Indies and was disbanded.

SS ''Sackett's Harbor'' was a T2 tanker that was built in August 1943. She served in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II. The ship was a namesake of Sackets Harbor, New York.
Sacketts Harbor survived the war basically unscathed but on 1 March 1946 she was sailing between Yokosuka and Balboa when she broke in half about 800 miles southwest of Adak, Alaska.  The bow of the ship was sunk but the stern continued to float.  The stern section was able to get to Adak under her own power.  The only reported fatalities were two cats.
The ship was later towed to Anchorage, Alaska where she served as Anchorage's first major power source.  The ship's electric drive supplied about 55% of Anchorage's electricity requirements from 1946 to 1955.  In 1955, she was replaced by the Eklutna Hydroelectric Plant.  The ship was given a new bow around 1957 and was rechristened as the SS ''Angelo Petri''.  She was fitted with stainless steel tanks and hauled wine for the Associated Vintners from Stockton, California through the Panama Canal to the East Coast.
She was renamed Californian in 1970, and then Sea Chemist in 1975 when she was sold to Antilles Navegacion S.A., of Panama. She was sold for scrapping in early 1978 and was broken up at Vinaroz.

The March 2006 Consistory, held on 24 March, was the first consistory where Pope Benedict XVI created new cardinals.
The announcement was made on 22 February that fifteen new cardinals would be created that year. 12 of them are under 80 years old, which is the age limit for participating in a conclave. This means that Benedict XVI has decided to continue with the tradition of having 120 cardinals, which was previously the practice, but had been discontinued by John Paul II.
During the consistory, fifteen red cardinals' hats were taken in a ceremony in St. Peter's Square. After the liturgical prayers and Pope's address, the candidates kneeled before the Pope's biretta and took their cardinal titles. This was followed by prayers of thanksgiving, intercession, the Lord's Prayer, and other prayers.
Three of the cardinals belong to the Roman Curia, and nine others lead bishoprics. The fifteen new cardinals come from eleven different countries.
One of the cardinals who took part in the consistory, Father Albert Vanhoye, is not a bishop. Benedict XVI has followed tradition by naming a foremost theologian in the consistory. The Pope can choose whether or not to ordain the candidate as bishop. The two others are emeritus bishops.

[[Mirror Fusion Test Facility]]

CATEGORIES: Fusion reactors

The Mirror Fusion Test Facility, or MFTF, was an experimental magnetic confinement fusion device built using the magnetic mirror, or so-called "yin-yang" design. It was designed and built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), one of the primary research centers for mirror fusion devices.   It cost 372 million dollars to construct, making it at the time, the most expensive project in the lab's history.  It opened on February 21, 1986 and was promptly shut down.  The reason given was to balance the United States federal budget.Booth, William. "Fusion's $372-Million Mothball." Science York City 9 Oct. 1987, Volume 238 ed.: 152-55. Print.
Following on from the earlier Baseball II device, the facility was originally a similar system in which the confinement area was located between two horseshoe-shaped "mirrors". During construction, however, the success of the Tandem Mirror Experiment ("TMX") led to a redesign to insert a solenoid area between two such magnets, dramatically improving confinement time from a few milliseconds to over one second.The Tandem Mirror Fusion Test Facility 
Most of the fusion power would be produced in the long solenoid, the yin-yang magnets serving only to dam up the ends in order to maintain good plasma confinement in the solenoid. Limited to break-even energy balance, the magnetic mirror endcaps actually consume power, but much less than that produced in a solenoid of sufficient length. The new version, officially MFTF-B, started construction in 1977 and was completed in 1986, on the very day the project was canceled by the Reagan administration Department of Energy. No experiments were performed. Rollbacks in fusion research funding dramatically reduced funding levels across the entire field.
Parts of the MFTF have since been re-used on newer fusion experiments, one such re-use winning a recycling award.Re-using MFTF parts

The education system of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has been improved consistently since the mid-1900s. The role played by a good education system has been significant in the development of Jordan from a predominantly agrarian to an industrialized nation.
Nature journal reported Jordan having the highest number of researchers in research and development per million people among all the 57 countries members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In Jordan there are 2,000 researchers per million people, while the average among the members of the OIC is 500 researchers per million people.http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7115/full/444026a.html
In 2003 the share of budget dedicated to education was 6.4 percent of total government expenditure; education spending as a percentage of GDP was 13.5 percent in the same year. At 8.9 percent, Jordan has the third lowest illiteracy rate in the Arab world. The primary gross enrollment ratio has increased from 71 percent in 1994 to 98.2 percent in 2006. Transition rate to secondary school, during the same period, has increased from 63 percent to 97 percent and transition rates to higher education have varied between 79 to 85 percent of secondary school graduates. Along with these high enrollment and transition rates, Jordan has achieved a 90 percent parity in literacy and full parity in primary and secondary enrollment.
Jordan is ranked 95 out of 187 in the Human Development Index.[tpl]cite web |url= http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/JOR.html|title=UNDP[/tpl] Despite strained resources, the Ministry of Education developed highly advanced national curriculum and many other nations in the region have developed their education system using Jordan as a model.  Jordan ranks number one in the Arab World in education.  The Jordanian Ministry of Education is now making it mandatory for students to be computer literate and able to apply their studies in computers to their regular studies, most especially the scientific and mathematical courses. Its educational system is of international standards and its secondary education program is accepted in world-class universities.

[[Easycare]]
CATEGORIES: Sheep breeds, Sheep breeds originating in the United Kingdom

Easycare is a breed of sheep developed in the 1960s in the United Kingdom for meat.  It was derived from the Nelson Welsh Mountain (a Welsh Mountain and Cheviot cross) which were crossed twice to the Wiltshire Horn, which is a wool-shedding breed. The progeny were selected for the following characteristics: wool shedding; no horns; and easy care traits. Most animals in the wild thicken up their coats in winter and then moult when spring comes, but many modern sheep breeds were selectively bred for thick coats which are retained for shearing.  With the decline in the worldwide wool markets, a thick coat is now less desirable especially where the cost of shearing is higher than the value of the wool produced.  In this respect, the Easycare breed is an interesting reversal of centuries of practice in sheep breed development as the sheep naturally shed their coats in spring, a process called rooing. Like lots of other sheep, easycare sheep can not live without the necessary grooming that is shearing every now and then.

[[Gromov's compactness theorem (topology)]]
CATEGORIES: Symplectic topology, Compactness theorems

In the mathematical field of symplectic topology, Gromov's compactness theorem states that a sequence of pseudoholomorphic curves in an almost complex manifold with a uniform energy bound must have a subsequence which limits to a pseudoholomorphic curve which may have nodes or (a finite tree of) "bubbles".  A bubble is a holomorphic sphere which has a transverse intersection with the rest of the curve.  If the complex structures on the curves in the sequence do not vary, only bubbles may occur (equivalently, the curves that pinch to cause the degeneration of the limiting curve must be contractible).  If the complex structures is allowed to vary, nodes can occur as well.  Usually, the area bound is achieved by considering a symplectic manifold with compatible almost-complex structure as the target and restricting the images of the curves to lie in a fixed homology class.  This theorem underlies the compactness results for flow lines in Floer homology.

Frederick Alexcee (1853 – 1940s) was a Tsimshian carver and painter from the community of Lax Kw'alaams (Port Simpson, a.k.a. Fort Simpson), British Columbia, Canada.
Alexcee (his last name has also been spelled Alexie, Alexee, etc.) was born in Lax Kw'alaams, then known as Fort Simpson, in 1853.  His father was an Iroquois laborer from eastern Canada who was in the employee of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Simpson.  His mother was Tsimshian from the Giluts'aaw tribe, one of the "Nine Tribes" from the lower Skeena River area based at Lax Kw'alaams.  In the matrilineal system of the Tsimshian, Alexcee followed his mother as a Giluts'aaw and as a member of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan or phratry).  His Tsimshian name was 'Wiiksmwan, meaning Great Deer Woman.
Alexcee was trained as a halaayt carver, the term halaayt referring to shamanic practices which were the prerogative of chiefs.  He produced naxnox (spirit) paraphernalia and items for use in "secret society" ceremonies.  All of these were practices which late-19th-century missionaries in Lax Kw'alaams were endeavoring to eradicate.  Alexcee also carved for the Indian curio trade and produced paintings and drawings depicting traditional life in Port Simpson.
He carved human figures to adorn a baptismal font in Port Simpson's Methodist church.
He died some time in the 1940s.
Works of his can be found at the University of British Columbia's Museum of Anthropology, the Museum of Northern British Columbia in Prince Rupert, the New Westminster Museum and Archives and the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria.

The album's title track, about an old crush with whom the singer used to see a band, has the refrain, "Do you remember? Do you recall?"

San Miguel de Asile was a Spanish Franciscan mission built in the early 17th century in the Florida Panhandle, near the present-day town of Lamont, Florida. It was part of Spain's effort to colonize the region, and convert the Timucua and Apalachee people to Christianity. The mission served a local chiefdom of the Timucua people known as the Yustaga. It lasted until the first decade of the 18th century, when it was destroyed, possibly by Creek Indians and the English.
The site where the mission stood was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1974.
The archaeological site was first discovered and investigated by B. Calvin Jones between 1968 and 1972. Jones concluded that the site was that of San Miguel de Asile. More recent archaeological work and research by Alissa Slade casts doubt on Jones's theory. Slade's research indicates the site was not San Miguel de Asile, a Timucuan mission, but rather an Apalachee mission, possibly San Lorenzo de Ivitachuco.Slade, Alissa Marie (2006).

Fallen Monument Park (formerly called the Park of the Fallen Heroes) is a park outside the Krymsky Val building in Moscow shared by the modern art division of Tretyakov Gallery and Central House of Artists. It is located between the Park Kultury and the Oktyabrskaya underground stations.
The origins of this expatriate English name are unknown; in Russian, the park is either simply named Sculpture Park of the Central House of Artists ([tpl]lang-ru|Парк скульптуры ЦДХ[/tpl]) or referred to by its legal title, Muzeon Park of Arts (Russian: Парк Искусств, Park Iskustv).
Muzeon Park was established by the City of Moscow in 1992 and currently displays over 700 sculptures. It is split into themed sections, i.e. the Oriental Garden, Pushkin Square, Portrait Row, although the best known part — the fallen monuments themselves — appeared here before 1992. In October 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, smaller socialist realism statues of Soviet leaders and unidentifiable workers and peasants were removed from their pedestals, hauled to the park and left in their fallen form. They were rectified later, although missing original pedestals. In 1990s these statues shaped the park outline, but as more and more modern sculpture was added and as the young trees grew up, they became a less obvious minority. 
In 1995, Muzeon added a World War II section - these sculptures, of the same socialist realism vintage, were never displayed in open air before. In 1998 the park acquired 300 sculptures of victims of communist rule made by Evgeny Chubarov, installed as a single group. The park also holds temporary summer shows of modern artists.

Alain Mafart (born in 1951) is a French military officer best known for his part in the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior.
Mafart was a DGSE agent and deputy commander of the French Navy Training Centre in Corsica. He supported the sabotage team that travelled to New Zealand and bombed and sank the Rainbow Warrior, drowning photographer Fernando Pereira.
He was apprehended by New Zealand police, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on 22 November 1985. Following heavy political pressure from France and her allies and a United Nations-sponsored mediation between New Zealand and France in July 1986, Mafart was deported to the island of Hao in French Polynesia to serve three years. In return, France apologised to New Zealand and paid New Zealand $6.5 million.
However, on 14 December 1987, Mafart was returned to Paris after complaining of stomach pains. After treatment he was not returned to the island and in 1988 enrolled on a two-year course at the École de Guerre (War College) in Paris.
Mafart was promoted to colonel in December 1993. According to Le Monde, Mafart was then serving near Paris on a base housing several command staffs, including that of military intelligence. 
His commanding officer during the Rainbow Warrior affair became an aide to Defence Minister Francois Léotard.
He wrote a book "Carnets secrets d'un nageur de combat: Du Rainbow Warrior aux glaces de l'Arctique" (Secret notebooks of a naval frogman: Rainbow Warrior to the ices of the Arctic) that concerned his role in the bombing.

San Juan De Aspalaga (also known as Pine Tuft Site) was a Spanish Franciscan mission built in the early 17th century in the Florida Panhandle, near the present-day town of Wacissa, Florida. It was part of Spain's effort to colonize the region, and convert the Timucuan and Apalachee Indians to Christianity. The mission lasted until the first decade of the 18th century, when it was destroyed, possibly by Creek Indians and the English.
The site where the mission stood was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 7, 1973.

Dominique Prieur (born 1949) is a French military officer who was convicted of manslaughter over her part in the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior.BBC NEWS | World | Asia-Pacific | French expat recalls NZ bombing
Prieur was a controller in the intelligence-gathering and evaluation wing of the DGSE, acting as Christine Cabon's controller. She was a specialist in European peace movements. Prieur entered New Zealand on a Swiss passport issued to her alias of "Sophie Turenge", posing as the wife of Alain Mafart. She took part in the operation that bombed and sank the Rainbow Warrior, killing the photographer Fernando Pereira.
After her arrest by New Zealand police, along with her colleague Mafart, she pleaded guilty to charges of the manslaughter of Pereira and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on 22 November 1985. After serious political pressure from France and her allies,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10656635 |title=At the end of the Rainbow - National - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13[/tpl] the New Zealand government agreed to a United Nations arbitration ruling in July 1986 that saw her transferred to French custody on the island of Hao in French Polynesia. 
On 6 May 1988 she was returned to France because she was pregnant (her husband was allowed to join her on Hao). Like Mafart, she never returned to Hao. She has since been promoted to the rank of Commandant. Although a UN Arbitration panel found that France had breached its obligation to New Zealand several times by removing the agents from Hao, and failing to return them, it rejected an appeal by New Zealand to have Mafart and Prieur returned because the term they should have spent there had already lapsed.
Prieur published a book "Agent secrète" (Secret Agent) concerning her role in the bombing.
In 2009, Prieur was hired as the director of human resources for the Paris Fire Brigade, a unit of the French Army.Staff (4 January 2009) "Fresh Start for Saboteur" Sunday Mail (South Australia) p. 29

[[Peterborough Transcript]]
CATEGORIES: Newspapers published in New Hampshire

The Peterborough Transcript was a weekly newspaper published in Peterborough, New Hampshire for 157 years. It was founded in 1849, and remained the only local weekly newspaper for more than a century. It was owned by the Cummings family from 1900 until September 2006, when it was bought by the competing Monadnock Ledger, and became part of the Monadnock Ledger-Transcript. 
In a story announcing the merger, then-publisher Joe Cummings described the paper's history:
"John Miller and Kendall Scott founded the Transcript in 1849. Originally named the Contoocook Transcript, this newspaper was the fourth newspaper in Peterborough, the previous three having failed. In its first issue, the publishers stated, 'In commencing this enterprise, we frankly tell you that we have our doubts and fears in regard to its ultimate success.'
"In 1900, George Cummings sold his soapstone quarry in Francestown to purchase the Transcript. It has been in the Cummings family ever since. Four generations have served as its publishers. After George, Paul Cummings Sr. served in that post, followed by his son Paul Jr., who took over the reins in 1946. Joe, Paul’s son, presently serves as publisher." 403 Forbidden

[[Stade Lamine Guèye]]

CATEGORIES: Football venues in Senegal

Stade Lamine Guèye is a multi-use stadium in Kaolack, Senegal.  [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl] it was used mostly for football matches and served as a home ground of ASC Saloum. The stadium holds 8,000 people.
Stade Lamine Guèye was built in 1986 by the French-owned construction company We Built This City - named after the popular American rock song by the same name popularized by Starship.  The stadium was constructed in a little under 12 months, despite a significantly moister than normal dry season (December to April)  that year.  We Built This City had been promised a significant financial incentive to finish construction on time, and even the additional rain did not stop them from reaching the goal set by the council of Kaolack.
Stade Lamine Guèye played host to arguably the most famous football match in the history of Western Africa.  With ASC Saloum leading their opponent 2-1 in the Senegal Ligue 2 championship in 1994, the crowd and players from ASC Saloum were distracted by an unannounced visit by the President of Senegal.  The ASC Saloum goalkeeper gave up a breakaway goal with just seconds left in stoppage time, and the match ended in a tie.  That was the last time ASC Saloum advanced beyond the first round of the Senegal Ligue 2 competition.
Stade Lamine Guèye hosted West Africa's visit by the late Pope John Paul II in 1992.  While the seating capacity of the stadium is 8,000 permanent seats, the Pope helped make arrangements for "general admission" opportunities to be made available to the people of Senegal, allowing an additional 12,000 people in for standing room only on the grass floor of the stadium.  The Pope spoke in support of his tenth encyclical.  Mass was also preached, with the Pope offering the mass in honor of brothers and sisters of other religions in the world.
The stadium also hosted an audition for a television program that is a combination of American Idol and America's Got Talent in 2007, during which 34,540 people made their way across the audition stage, dancing, singing, and juggling.  It was the largest such audition in the history of the television program, and drew performers from as far away as Chad.  The program, titled, "Senegal's Entertainment Xpolsion (S.E.X.)" offers a recording contract and opportunity to move on to perform on a similar program in France.

[[Barrel die]]
CATEGORIES: Dice

A barrel die is an uncommon type of die used most often by players of role playing games and wargames.  It is similar to rolling logs.
Its shape is roughly cylindrical with between three and twenty flattened triangular facets, each numbered. Each triangular face alternates in alignment about 180 degrees. The two ends of the cylindroid are formed by half as many triangular facets as there are numbered faces, and are arranged so that it is impossible for the die to stop on one of its 'ends'.
There are many versions, as the barrel shape allows easier construction of odd-sided dice.  They have triangular, rectangular, or ovoid faces and rounded or pointed ends to ensure the die lands on a face.  A more-common 4-sided barrel die, having rectangular faces much like a dreidel, is used in the traditional games daldøs and dayakattai. This 4-sided barrel die is easier to roll than the normal tetrahedral d4 used in many role-playing games.
A barrel die is rolled longitudinally so that one of the numbered faces comes to rest on top.
The cricket game Owzthat uses barrel dice which were essentially short lengths of hexagonal bar (i.e. with 6 rectangular faces).  The dice were rolled, rather than thrown, and there were no special precautions to prevent the dice landing or stopping end-on.[tpl]fact|date=January 2014[/tpl]

[[Greater Vision]]

Greater Vision is a Southern Gospel trio founded in 1990 by Gerald Wolfe, Mark Trammell, and Chris Allman, and often accompanied by pianist Stan Whitmire (though he was never an official member of the group). Over the last several years, this trio has consistently been named Southern Gospel's favorite trio of the year in the Singing News Fan Awards. With numerous top-10 and #1 Southern Gospel hit songs, and several songs named "Song of the Year" in the Singing News Fan Awards, this trio has established a solid presence in the Southern Gospel industry.
In an industry where lineup changes are constant, and lack of personnel stability are prevalent, Greater Vision has seen few lineup changes over the twenty-year span.  In 1993, Mark Trammell departed for Gold City and was replaced by Dixie Melody Boys baritone Rodney Griffin.  Chris Allman left in 1995 to pursue other avenues of ministry and was replaced by Jason Waldroup.  This lineup of Wolfe, Griffin, and Waldroup stayed intact for 13 years. In 2008, Jason Waldroup decided to leave to pursue a seminary education. In May, Jacob Kitson was announced as the new tenor, beginning in August.  In 2010, Kitson formed the Statement of Faith Trio with his brother Joe and friend Jon Epley. Chris Allman returned after an almost fifteen-year absence, thus coming back full circle to the almost original blend and sound that helped pave the way.

It occupies the building of the largest and oldest former Ottoman mosque in the city, Büyük camii ("Grand Mosque"), built around 1474 under Mehmed II. The museum was established as a separate entity in 1893 as the National Museum directed by Czech Václav Dobruský with its headquarters in the former mosque that previously housed the National Library between 1880 and 1893. 
The museum was officially opened and inaugurated in 1905, as by then all archaeological exhibits previously kept all over the city were moved there, in the presence of Knyaz Ferdinand of Bulgaria and Minister of Enlightenment Ivan Shishmanov.
Several additional halls and administrative buildings of the museum were constructed in the following years, which continues to use the historic stone building of the old mosque despite the often unfavourable conditions, notably the humidity in the summer. The museum has five exhibition halls: Central Hall, Prehistory, Middle Ages, Treasure, and a special temporary exhibition. It is managed by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

Wilhelm Bogner (7 February 1909 – 27 July 1977), better known as Willy Bogner, Sr., was a German Nordic skier who competed in the 1930s. He won a pair of medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships with a silver in the 4 x 10 km event in 1934 and a bronze in the nordic combined in 1935. Bogner, Sr. also finished 6th in the 4 x 10 km event and 12th in the Nordic combined at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where he also took the Olympic Oath.
During his career, Bogner, Sr. was an eleven-time German and five-time nordic skiing champion. This allowed him to establish his clothing line in 1932, including outfitting the German national ski team at the 1936 Winter Olympics.
Following his stay as a POW during World War II, Bogner, Sr. returned to his business in 1947. Two of his innovations were the first stretch ski pants in 1948 which were modeled by the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, and Ingrid Bergman, and the tip-top hat in 1955. The American women's ski team even used his clothing line when they complained that their own American-made clothes were improperly fitted on them at the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo. In 1933, he participated together with Matthias Wörndle and Gustav "Gustl" Müller at the first Trofeo Mezzalama event, where they placed third.Storia della Valle D'Aosta [tpl]It icon[/tpl]
His son, Willy Bogner, Jr. (born 1942), was a successful alpine skier in the late 1950s and 1960s who competed for the Germans at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley and the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck. Bogner, Jr. would later go into filmmaking in 1967, then follow into Bogner, Sr.'s footsteps and start his own ski collection in 1971.
Bogner, Sr. died in 1977. Bogner, Jr. took over the line and has continued its growth worldwide.

[[Travancore Titanium Products]]
CATEGORIES: Titanium, Companies based in Thiruvananthapuram, Chemical companies of India

Travancore Titanium Products Ltd (TTP), is the leading manufacturer of anatase grade titanium dioxide in India. The company was incorporated in 1946 at Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, India on the initiative of Sir C.P.Ramaswamy Iyer. 
The main product is pigment grade titanium dioxide which is extracted from ilmenite, which is abundantly available as placer deposits on beaches near Kollam, 65 km north of Thiruvananthapuram. Ilmenite, a mixture of titanium dioxide and iron in the form of ferric/ferrous oxide, is treated with Sulphuric Acid to get Titanium dioxide and ferrous sulphate. 
The company was promoted by His Highness Chithira Tirunal Balaramavarma Maharaja, the then ruler of the State of Travancore (now Kerala State in India) with the technical collaboration of British Titan Products, (now Tioxide Group). Though the company was registered in 1946, actual production was started only in 1952 with a small capacity of 5 t.p.a.  Later subsequent expansions were made in 1962 and 1973 and now TTP can produce about 20000 tonnes of titanium dioxide per annum. 
In 1960 Government of Kerala took over the management of the Company. Now the administrative control is vested with the Department of Industries, Government of Kerala. 
The company also possesses a modern sulphuric acid plant which was commissioned in 1996, for utilizing the tail gas recycling DCDA (Double Catalysis Double Absorption) technology. An alkali scrubbing system is incorporated in the plant, and this in turn helps to keep sulphur dioxide emissions from the factory well within permissible limits.
For about  50 years, TTP was one of the profit making Public Sector Undertaking of Government of Kerala.  Every year company declares a dividend of around 20 per cent.  TTP is contributing crores of rupees to the State exchqeuer by way of Sales Tax, other duties and levies. Welfare amenities, salary and perquisites, working environment etc. are comparatively satisfactory.  TTP has a good library with around 25000 books in stock. During the 70s, TItanium Football team  was one of the most acclaimed Football Clubs in Kerala, winning so many covetable tropies. Players like  Sankarankutty, Abdul Hameed, Najumuddin, Thomas Sebastian were members of Titanium Football team.  In 1980 Titanium Volleyball Team was formed with national and international players like Cyril C. Velloor, K Udayakumar,Abdul Razak,N.C.Chacko,P.S.Mohammed Ali, Sebastian George etc. Subsequently Danikutty David, Binu Jose, Tomy and others joined the team .Volleyball team won the Federation Cup in 1993.    
TTP has a strength of around 1300 employees now.

[[Ramke]]
CATEGORIES: 1830s births, 1891 deaths, People from Goalpara district

Rev Ramke W. Momin was born into the Garo tribe of northeastern India, sometime in the 1830s. The Garo were renowned, at that time, for drunkenness, violence and murder. Sometimes they would conduct headhunting raids, at other times they would demand protection money, so that those being extorted would be safe. The Garos did have a reputation for keeping their word. In religious matters, the Garos were animists, focusing on placating the spirits to appease their wrath and satisfy their demands. They believed in a supreme God, but felt that He was detached from men and was not to be much concerned with, either for good or ill. Ramke himself was a devotional person and, while he was an animist, he was very earnest in catching little animals or birds and sacrificing them to the spirits.
In 1847, the British, who were extending their rule in India, invited boys from the Garo tribe to come down to Goalpara in the valley and receive an education. Ramke's uncle, Omed, went down to school at this time, but Ramke was detained at home, since he had recently broken his arm. Later he joined them and was found to be a good scholar. In Goalpara he learned about Hinduism and its teaching about reincarnation. This idea dismayed him. As an animist, he had placated the spirits, but believed that, whether in this life or the next, people were people, not animals or plants.
As he considered ultimate things, he thought not only of wrath and punishment, but of love and about the great God above everything else. He prayed to God for blessing and for peace of mind. After praying thus for three days in a row, he received a visitation from Heaven, declaring that his prayer was heard.
When he tried to tell others about his vision, he received ridicule from everyone except the Hindu “holy men,” or sadhus. They instructed him further in Hindu theology, including Vishnu, a savior figure. Ramke was very attracted to Vishnu, especially in his incarnation as Ram. So, Ramke began to worship Ram.
Later, Ramke came across a Christian tract that systematically discredited Hinduism. He was convinced by the tract, but thrown into despair because his worship of Ram was taken from him. In The Garo Jungle Book, it is said, “The tracts of those days were pointed, uncompromising attacks on the falseness of the prevailing faiths.” Omed, who lived at Gauhati, came across the same tract, but had a more positive reaction. Omed had a Christian associate and invited Ramke to come to Gauhati and together they studied Christianity. Then, as a policeman, Ramke was sent to another assignment, where he fell into discouragement spiritually. But then he read a book about Christian heroism, which helped him.
Among the Garos, the women chose their husbands. A girl named Suban proposed to Ramke and he accepted. After the wedding, he told her he was thinking about becoming a Christian, which she considered a frightening prospect. Nevertheless, after a while Ramke returned to Omed; they studied Christianity more and were baptized, contrary to the wishes of their wives.
They begged for a missionary to be sent to their people, but when none was available, they eventually offered themselves. They were accepted and a salary was given to them. Ramke preached a little, but primarily focused on starting a school in Damra. After preaching for a while, Omed was driven away. He built a hut at the foot of the Rajasimla Pass, where travelers could rest on their way to and from the market. Eventually the witness of these two men and other Christians, including Western missionaries, won over many other Garos to Christianity.
Ramke felt there was a need for another Christian village where new converts could learn more about the faith, without opposition from their neighbors. Thus developed the village of Nisangram.
He was ordained as pastor and served as headmaster of the Normal School, both at Goalpara and at Tura. He assisted in the translation of the Scriptures into Garo and a Bengali-Garo dictionary.
“As preacher and evangelist to his own people he traveled widely and baptized many. ‘On his list were over two thousand two hundred names of those who had found of their Saviour,’ in part, at least, through these personal efforts.” (from “The Garo Jungle Book”, William Carey) He passed to his rest on January 25, 1891.

[[Julian Kestrel]]
CATEGORIES: Novel series, Fictional amateur detectives, Fictional characters introduced in 1994, Fictional English people, Characters in American novels of the 20th century

Julian Kestrel is a fictional character in a four book mystery series by Kate Ross. The books in the series include Cut to the Quick (1994), A Broken Vessel (1995), Whom the Gods Love (1996), and The Devil in Music (1998). The Lullaby Cheat (1997), a short story featuring Kestrel, is included in the mystery anthology Crime Through Time, edited by Miriam Grace Monfredo and Sharan Newman. The novels and short story in the series are set in the English Regency era in Great Britain. Kestrel is a trend-setting dandy, similar in influence to Beau Brummel, who takes up detection as a response to boredom with the emptiness of society. Over the course of the series, we learn that Kestrel is the son of a talented actress, who died giving birth to him, and the younger son of a Yorkshire squire who was disowned by his well-to-do family after his marriage. He was later mentored by a French nobleman who helped him learn the ways of society and the appropriate way to dress.
Kestrel's partner in detection is his valet Thomas Stokes, known as Dipper.  Dipper got his nickname from his first career as a pickpocket.  Kestrel hired Dipper as his valet after he caught Dipper stealing his watch. Other memorable characters in the series include Dr. Duncan MacGregor, a gruff Scottish-born physician who assisted Kestrel in some of his cases; Dipper's sister Sally Stokes, a saucy street prostitute who helps Kestrel and Dipper solve the mysterious death of a "fallen woman" in A Broken Vessel and becomes Kestrel's lover; and Philippa Fontclair, a charming young girl whom Kestrel meets in Cut to the Quick and corresponds with in later novels. The novels are heavily influenced by other fictional British detectives, such as Lord Peter Wimsey and Sherlock Holmes.
Kate Ross died of cancer before she was able to complete more books in the series. However, fans speculated that she might have ultimately intended for Kestrel to marry a grown-up Philippa Fontclair. In Cut to the Quick, the plain but clever and witty 11-year-old Philippa asks Kestrel if he might marry her one day because "I will have money and I am a Fontclair." Kestrel advises the young girl that she should look for a husband who's more interested in her for herself than for her pocketbook and pedigree. He said it's best to be "the one radiant Circe in a season of dreary Helens" and to enchant others with her wit than to be pretty. Philippa then vows to marry Kestrel when she grows up.

Megestrol acetate (INN, USAN, BAN, JAN; sold mainly under the brand names Megace and Megace ES), also known as 17α-acetoxy-6-dehydro-6-methylprogesterone, and sometimes abbreviated as MGA or MA, is a steroidal progestin and progesterone derivative (specifically, a 17-hydroxylated progesterone) with predominantly progestational and antigonadotropic effects.[tpl]cite book | author = F..

The film industry in Florida is one of the largest in the United States: in 2006, Florida ranked third in the U.S. for film production (after California and New York) based on revenue generated.2006 Florida Film Commission Data However, more recent 2009-2010 data no longer show Florida among the top four states.Film Works L.A.; Note that California, #1 is not included in the chart
Production activity has been generally concentrated in two regions, South and Central Florida (Orlando and Tampa).  The South Florida region is famous for large projects like Jerry Bruckheimer's Bad Boys film series and Neal Moritz' 2 Fast 2 Furious. The Central Florida area has recently been featured in The Punisher starring John Travolta and Adam Sandler's The Waterboy.
The State of Florida has a long film history thanks to its year-round sunshine and moderate climate.  Film classics were filmed throughout the state, such as Moon Over Miami (1941) and Esther Williams' Easy to Love (1953).

Norethisterone (or norethindrone) (or 19-nor-17α-ethynyltestosterone) is a molecule used in some combined oral contraceptive pills, progestogen only pills and is also available as a stand-alone drug. It is a progestogen and can be used to treat premenstrual syndrome, painful periods, abnormal heavy bleeding, irregular periods, menopausal syndrome (in combination with oestrogen), or to postpone a period. It is also commonly used to help prevent uterine hemorrhage in complicated non-surgical or pre-surgical gynecologic cases.  Norethindrone was the first orally highly active progestin to be synthesized.  It was synthesized for the first time by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Djerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City in 1951.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Djerassi | first1 = C. | authorlink1 = Carl Djerassi | last2 = Miramontes | first2 = L. | authorlink2 = Luis E.

[[Emblicanin]]

CATEGORIES: Phenol antioxidants, Hydrolysable tannins

Emblicanins are a type of polyphenolic antioxidant found in Amla aka Indian gooseberry. Amla is known as Emblica Officinalis in botanical terms. Emblicanin is different from most other antioxidants as it is a pro-oxidation free cascading antioxidant.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]
Many antioxidants intrinsically have a pro-oxidant action, especially in the presence of transition metals like iron and copper. Through a series of reactions with oxygen species known as Fenton reaction, iron causes generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radical with subsequent biomolecule damage. It means that the antioxidants which are meant to scavenge free radicals themselves create free radicals.
While most antioxidants go directly from an active to an inactive role, Emblicanin utilizes a multilevel cascade of antioxidant compounds resulting in a prolongation of its antioxidant capabilities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]
Emblicanin A (one of the key compounds in Emblicanin) aggressively seeks and attacks free radicals. After it neutralizes a free radical, emblicanin A is transformed into emblicanin B, another antioxidant. Emblicanin B in turn also attacks free radicals and is transformed into Emblicanin oligomers. This makes emblicanins one of the best free radical scavenging antioxidant.International Conference on Newer Developments in Drug Discovery From Natural Products and Traditional Medicines-An Overview.

[[Kalasatama metro station]]
CATEGORIES: Helsinki Metro stations, Railway stations opened in 2007, 2007 establishments in Finland

Kalasatama (Finnish) or Fiskehamnen (Swedish) is a station on the Helsinki Metro, in the capital city of Finland. The station was opened on 1 January 2007, and it serves the eastern part of the central Helsinki district of Sörnäinen. The area is now mainly composed of offices, but new residential and commercial developments will be constructed in the area after the port facilities there moved to the new Port of Vuosaari in 2008.
Unlike most other stations on the Helsinki Metro, Kalasatama was built on existing metro track, which made construction more difficult. However, normal metro traffic was not greatly affected by the construction work. Because the new platforms were built on either side of the existing metro track, Kalasatama station is one of only two stations on the Helsinki Metro to have separate platforms for both directions of travel (the other one is Itäkeskus metro station).
It is the only station on the Helsinki Metro system to have exclusively side platforms, rather than having been designed around an island platform.  It is located 1.1 kilometres from Sörnäinen metro station, and 1.8 kilometres from Kulosaari metro station.

[tpl]Cleanup|date=March 2012[/tpl]Ville Johannes Tiisanoja (born December 24, 1975 in Vantaa, Finland) is a 192-cm (6' 4") tall Finnish shot putter who weighs 119 kg (260 lbs) and competes for Kenttäurheilijat-58 in Vantaa. His personal best in the men's shot put currently stands at 21.09 m, which he put on July 28, 2002 in the Elite Games in Kuortane, Finland. He is coached by his father Kalle Tiisanoja. Tiisanoja is a construction foreman by trade.
Although Tiisanoja does not hold any Finnish records for men's shot put, he does hold the record for 17-year-olds from 1992 (19.79 m) and the indoor shot put record for 14-year-olds from 1989 (13.30 m). In addition, Tiisanoja holds several records for discus, javelin throw and hammer throw. Tiisanoja competed in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, where he did not make it to the final round and ended up placing 19th thanks to his put of 19.50 in the qualifiers.
Even though Tiisanoja regularly puts over 20 m, his best placing in the European Championships was a 4th place in the 2005 Indoor Championships in Madrid and 8th place in 3 World Championships. That said, he has, however, won 3 Finnish Championships, one (2006) which he has been stripped of. Tiisanoja was the 15th member to be inducted into the 20 meter club after he successfully putted the shot 20.06 m in a competition on July 31, 1999 in Espoo, Finland.

Centered in the city of Basel, it came to notice in 2005 when Swiss art dealer Frieda Nussberger-Tchacos, the owner of the Codex Tchacos, which contains the Gospel of Judas, informed the press that the manuscript would be donated to Maecenas for conservation and publication. The foundation reached a commercial agreement with National Geographic, and sold the copyright of the Coptic text to the magazine. Roberty was previously best known as Nussberger-Tchacos' lawyer.
The creation of a foundation to contain the Gospel of Judas was proposed earlier on by the various people who owned it between 2000–2005. Papers online at Michel van Rijn's site indicate that such shell foundations were part of the process of marketing the text by the art dealers.michelvanrijn.nl. Retrieved March 5, 2007.

[[Thomas Gray (1788–1848)]]
CATEGORIES: 1788 births, 1848 deaths, British railway pioneers, British people in rail transport

Thomas Gray (1788–1848) was a British railway advocate.
Thomas Gray spent most of his adult life promoting the idea of a passenger railway system for the UK and Europe."Land Steam-Conveyance. OBSERVATIONS ON A GENERAL IRON-RAIL WAY;" originally published in Mechanic's Mag. No. 7, Oct. 11, 1823, and reprinted on pp. 142-5 of The European magazine, and London review, Volume 86, by Philological Society (Great Britain) (London 1824). He wrote "Observations on a General Iron Railway" which was first published in 1820, followed by further, and expanded, editions up to 1825. Copies of the book are in the British Library and many more in UK and US libraries in differing editions. There is at least one US library that still (2005) offered it on loan to the general public.
He was a contemporary of William James, the Stephensons and Isambard Kingdom Brunel, all considered by many to be "Fathers of the Railways".
It is very likely, as indicated by the sequence of events after his first edition, that Gray's first published proposals directly and significantly influenced the writings and actions of William James and the Stephensons, among many others, when they began to design and build the earliest passenger railway system in Britain.  Much as today, commercial interests over-rode "the good of the community", that underpinned Gray's advocacy of a General (National) Passenger Railway, to be funded jointly by Government and Capital(ists).
Thomas Gray, to this day, has been given little credit for the enormous contribution made by his work to the initiation and growth of passenger railway systems, throughout the world."Not Quite a Man for a Straight-Jacket", in Vol. XVI (July 28) of Dicken's All THE YEAR ROUND., pp. 62-5, (London 1866).
The Belgians, second only to Britain in terms of their industrial expansion in the 19th century, saw the sense of Gray's proposals and built an integrated transport system from scratch on the basis of his publication. They, at least, recognised his contribution, eventually, naming the Rue Gray in Brussels after him. It passes under a railway bridge.
This information has been collated and verified from primary sources by K L Newman B.A.(Hons) during her research for this forgotten hero's biography which is due to be published in 2011. Much of the initial research took place in the Exeter, Devon and Leeds, Yorkshire, UK Archives. For copyright and commercial reasons, full references will not be cited here until after publication.

Cecil Brabazon Ponsonby (26 December 1889 - 11 May 1945) was an English cricketer: a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper who played 74 times for Worcestershire between 1911 and 1928, captaining the county in 1927; he also made a single appearance each for MCC and HK Foster's XI.
Son of Hon. Arthur Cornwallis Ponsonby (1856—1918; 4th son of Walter Ponsonby, 7th Earl of Bessborough) and Kathleen Eva Sillery (d. 1944). Born in Gravesend, Kent, Ponsonby was educated at Eton and Oxford University, but did not get into the team in either case.Obituaries in 1945. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1946. He made his first-class debut against Leicestershire in July 1911, and immediately made an impact: batting at number eleven, he scored a vital 31 not out in the first innings to help add 61 for the last wicket and set Worcestershire up for a three-wicket victory. He also took four catches in the match, his first career dismissal being that of Cecil Wood.
Ponsonby played only once more that summer, but the following year he made the only first-class fifty of his career, scoring exactly 50 not out for Worcestershire against Surrey, this time batting at seven. However, this was something of a false dawn where his batting was concerned: he did not play again for the county until 1920 (though he batted at five for MCC against Oxford University in 1914), and his Worcestershire batting average never again broke into double figures for a season.
In 1920 Ponsonby returned to first-class cricket, and in his first game, against Sussex, even went in first wicket down in the second innings. He made a duck, and not long afterwards he had returned to what was to become his accustomed place near or at the bottom of the order. His wicket-keeping was more of a success, though it took him until mid-June 1921 to record his first stumping, that of Edward Solbé of Kent.
With one exception, Ponsonby played only a handful of matches in his remaining seven season in the game, doing little with either bat or gloves. That exception was 1927, when he played 26 times and acted as captain, replacing Maurice Jewell. Ponsonby made 34 dismissals (30 caught, four stumped) that year, by some distance his greatest tally for a single summer. He also recorded his highest season's run total, although this was a mere 208 at an average of only 6.30.
He was to play only one more first-class match, against Nottinghamshire in late August 1928. This was a chastening year for Worcestershire: in 30 County Championship matches they won not a single game, and against a Nottinghamshire side containing Larwood, Voce and Staples they were thrashed by an innings and 21 runs. Ponsonby made a pair, but he did manage one final dismissal when he caught Notts' opener George Gunn off the bowling of Charles Tarbox.
Ponsonby died in St John's Wood, London at the age of 55.
Three of Ponsonby's great-uncles played first-class cricket. John, 5th Earl of Bessborough, played five games in the 1830s; Frederick, the 6th Earl, played more than 70 games between 1834 and 1856, and was a founder of both Surrey and I Zingari; while Spencer appeared over 60 times between 1841 and 1862.

Vuosaari Harbour (Vuosaaren satama in Finnish; Nordsjö hamn in Swedish) is a seaport facility in Helsinki, Finland, opened in November 2008. 
The harbour, located in the suburb of Vuosaari in East Helsinki, handles goods traffic for the Greater Helsinki region, while passenger services remain in Helsinki city centre. Vuosaari Harbour has assumed the operations of two container harbours, West Harbour in the city centre and Sörnäinen Harbour, and will eventually also replace the oil harbour in Laajasalo. In addition, the railway depot in Pasila currently used by goods transport will be moved northwards. These processes release land for commercial and residential redevelopment.
The harbour has a total land area of 150 hectares, including 90 hectares of land reclaimed by filling the sea. There is also a 75-hectare business park next to the harbour. The harbour project also included the extension of Ring III to the new seaport and a new railway line to be used for transporting goods in and out of the harbour.
The Vuosaari harbour was built on the site of the former Vuosaari shipyard.

Morris H. Childs (born Moishe Chilovsky, 1902–1991) was an American political activist and American Communist Party functionary who became a Soviet espionage agent (1929) and then a double agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1952) until leaving both services by 1982. Beginning in 1958, Childs acted as a secret courier on behalf of the American party, briefing Soviet officials on political affairs in the American party and carrying funds to support the American Communist movement from Moscow to New York City, reporting details all the while to his FBI handlers. Over the course of two decades of activity in this role, Childs played a major part in the transfer of more than $28 million in Soviet subsidies to the American movement. For his activity as a courier on behalf of the Soviet government, Childs was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1975. His work as a spy for the American intelligence community was recognized in 1987 when Childs (together with his brother Jack) was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan.

[[Pavel Kravař]]

Pavel Kravař (c. 1391 - 23 July 1433), or Paul Crawar, Paul Craw,  was a Hussite emissary from Bohemia who was burned at the stake for heresy at St Andrews in Scotland on 23 July 1433. He was the first of a succession of religious reformers who were martyred in the town during the course of the subsequent Protestant Reformation. (The others being: Patrick Hamilton in 1528, Henry Forrest in 1533, George Wishart in 1546, and Walter Myln in 1558).
Pavel Kravař was probably a native of Kravaře, Opava District, Silesia, now part of the Czech Republic. After studying medicine at the University of Montpellier, he graduated as Master of Arts from the University of Paris in 1415. The following year, he entered the Faculty of Arts at the University of Prague, then a hotbed of Hussite activity. Around 1421, with the University now in decline, Pavel Kravař left Prague to become a physician in the service of the Polish King, Władisław II Jagiełło (Jogaila). He probably returned to the Bohemian capital in 1432 prior to undertaking his ill-fated mission to Scotland.
His journey to St Andrews, at the time the ecclesiastical centre of Scotland and the location of its only university, was most likely made in a vain attempt to gain allies, hopefully amongst Lollard sympathisers, for the Hussite cause at the Council of Basel, at which reconciliation was sought between the Hussites and the Catholic Church. Pavel Kravař’s activities in St Andrews evidently met with the displeasure of the authorities there, particularly Henry Wardlaw, Bishop of St Andrews, who accused him of spreading the heretical ideas of Jan Hus and John Wyclif. At his trial he defended himself with skill and courage, but was nevertheless condemned and died, according to John Knox, with a brass ball stuffed in his mouth to prevent him addressing the people.
Pavel Kravař’s execution is believed to have taken place at the centre of the market square in St Andrews, close to the former location of the Mercat Cross which is now marked with a cross of red stones set into the cobbled surface of the roadway.

Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) scheduling is a non-preemptive discipline, similar to Shortest Job Next (SJN), in which the priority of each job is dependent on its estimated run time, and also the amount of time it has spent waiting. Jobs gain higher priority the longer they wait, which prevents indefinite postponement (process starvation). In fact, the jobs that have spent a long time waiting compete against those estimated to have short run times.
Developed by Brinch Hansen to correct certain weaknesses in SJN including the difficulty in estimating run time.

Despite the name, the neighbourhood has not been a traditional village since the years before Malaysia gained independence in 1958, when government quarters were built. More recently these quarters have been demolished to make way for redevelopment.
Situated just at the edge of Johor Baru city center, the old neighbourhood had the feel of a rural kampong with low density single-storey houses, mature trees, a prominent mosque, community center and kindergarten. However, the houses had become dilapidated. When the state government decided to move its administrative offices to Kota Seri Iskandar, it also took steps to redevelop the land with more modern and higher density housing. In the latter part of 2009, the government quarters were demolished and work on the new houses began.

[[Mittelafrika]]
CATEGORIES: Regions of Africa, Former German colonies, German words and phrases

[tpl]Onesource|article|date=March 2008[/tpl][tpl]italic title[/tpl]
Mittelafrika (German  for Central Africa) is the name created for a geostrategic region in central and east Africa. Much like Mitteleuropa, it articulated Germany's foreign policy aim, prior to World War I, of bringing the region under German domination. The difference being that Mittelafrika would presumably be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states.
German strategic thinking was that if the region between the colonies of German East Africa (Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania minus the island of Zanzibar), German South-West Africa (Namibia minus Walvis Bay), and Cameroon could be annexed, a contiguous entity could be created covering the breadth of the African continent from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Given the richness in natural resources of the Belgian Congo alone, this region would accrue considerable wealth to the colonising power through the exploitation of natural resources, as well as contributing to another German aim of economic self-sufficiency.
The concept dates back to the 1890s, when then Chancellor of Germany, Leo von Caprivi, gained the Caprivi Strip in the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty. This addition to German South-West Africa attached the colony to the Zambezi River. British and German imperialists competed over the region which now comprises Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. Cecil Rhodes, on behalf of the British, successfully colonised the latter region (named Rhodesia, after Rhodes). Germany also discussed with Britain for them to press their ally, Portugal, to cede the colonies of Angola and Mozambique to them. The British however, had preferential trade agreements with Portugal, who was a trusted ally, and though plans for an eventual partition of the Portuguese colonies were drawn, Britain would thus see its colonial position in Africa severely weakened in case they were applied, since the Germans could then effectivelly threaten their Cairo to Cape lines of communication. These plans were arguably made only to be used only as a last resort to appease Germany in case she threatened to disrupt the balance of power in Europe. However since German foreign policy interests were in subsequent years mainly directed at gaining mastery in Europe itself, and not in Africa, they were eventually shelved. Indeed, as it is likely that German concepts of a "Mittelafrika" were designed to put pressure on Britain to tolerate growing German dominance in the European continent, and not the other way around, colonial concessions would never placate the German Empire, as surely British politicians came to realise at the time.
Germany's aspirations in Mittelafrika were incorporated into Germany's aims in World War I insofar as Germany expected to be able to gain the Belgian Congo if it were to defeat Belgium in Europe. The full realisation of Mittelafrika depended on a German victory in World War I in the European theatre, where Britain would be forced to negotiate and cede its colonies in Rhodesia to Germany when faced with a German-dominated Europe across the English Channel. In the course of the actual war, German aspirations in Mittelafrika were never matched by events in the African theatre. The German colonies were at very different levels of defence and troop strength when the war began in Europe, and were not in a position to fight a war due to a lack of material.

The Dreamer is a 1985 thinly disguised autobiographical graphic novel by Will Eisner about his early years as a cartoonist for comic books in the 1930s, with a particular focus on his years as part of Eisner & Iger studios.
The book delves into the early years of the comic book industry and how the idealistic Eisner and his more pragmatic partner organized a business to supply material for publishers.
The incidents Eisner adapts for the story include how Jack Kirby frightened off a mobster who was attempting to intimidate his employer.  A major plot point is how Eisner's principles and ideals sometimes complicated his business affairs such as the adaptation of the account of when he refused to perjure himself in court in a copyright infringement lawsuit over Wonder Man and thus cost his business a major account (In reality, Eisner did testify on the stand that Wonder Man was an original creation Quattro, Ken. "DC vs. Victor Fox: The Testimony of Will Eisner", The Comics Detective, July 1, 2010. WebCitation archive.) .
Eventually, Eisner decides to leave this successful life behind when he accepts the opportunity to produce a comic book for a newspaper syndicate, which resulted in the creation of The Spirit.
A later edition of the book contains a reference guide to the characters and their real world analogues.

The Mariana Fruit Dove (Ptilinopus roseicapilla), also known locally as Mwee’mwe in the Carolinian language, Totot on Guam or Paluman Totut in Northern Mariana Islands, is a small, up to 24 cm long, green fruit dove native and endemic to Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands in the Pacific. It has a red forehead, greyish head, back and breast, and yellow belly patch and undertail coverts.
The female lays a single white egg. The chick and egg are tended to by both parents. Its diet consists mainly of fruits.
Culturally, the Mariana Fruit Dove is a very important symbol of the region. This species is the official bird of the Northern Marianas Islands.http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault2.php?urlpinaid=18620. In 2005, the Mariana Fruit Dove was originally chosen as the official mascot of the 2006 Micronesian Games in Saipan.http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault2.php?urlpinaid=18620 However, the official website for the games shows a tropicbird as the official symbol instead of the Mariana Fruit Dove.http://cnmi.net/microgames/
The species faces extinction due to habitat loss throughout its range. A larger threat to the Mariana Fruit Dove has been the accidental introduction of the Brown tree snake to Guam during World War II. The snakes decimated the native bird populations of the island, which were unaccustomed to predators. They are extinct on Guam since 1984 and the Mariana Fruit Dove is highly endangered on other islands in its range. The spread of the snakes to other Northern Marianas Islands could be devastating. Several zoos have started captive breeding programs. The St. Louis Zoo, in St. Louis, Missouri, has one of the most successful captive breeding programs. The program began in 1993.http://www.stlzoo.org/animals/abouttheanimals/birds/pigeonsdoves/marianasfruitdo01.htm
Due to ongoing habitat loss, limited range, small population size and invasive alien species, the Mariana Fruit Dove is evaluated as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Jules François Felix Fleury-Husson (17 September 1820, Laon, Aisne – 6 December 1889, Sèvres), who wrote under the name Champfleury, was a French art critic and novelist, a prominent supporter of the Realist movement in painting and fiction.
In 1843 Fleury-Husson moved to Paris. He met Charles Baudelaire and the next year started writing art criticism under the pen-name "Champfleury" for the journal L'Artiste.  He was one of the first to promote the work of Gustave Courbet, in an article appearing in an issue of Le Pamphlet in 1848.
In 1850, during a time when the Spanish school was still largely ignored, he advocated the work of El Greco.  He wrote about the Le Nain brothersChampfleury, Nouvelles réchérches sur la vie et l'oeuvre des frères Le Nain, 1862. and Maurice Quentin de La Tour.  He also had a brief affair in 1851 with Eveline Hańska, the widow of his friend Honoré de Balzac.Robb, Graham. Balzac: A Biography. New York: W. W. Norton &x Company, 1994. ISBN 0-393-03679-0. p. 414.
He edited the periodical Le réalisme in 1856 and 1857. 
His novels, of which the best-known is Les bourgeois de Molinchart (1854), were among the earliest Realist works.
In 1869 his book Les Chats, a series of essays about cats including portrayals of cats by prominent artists of the time, was published by Librairie de la Société Botanique de France, edited by J. Rothschild.
From 1872 until his death in 1889 he was Chief of Collections at the Sèvres porcelain factory.
The character of Marcel in Henri Murger's Scènes de la vie de bohème, and thus the corresponding character Marcello in Puccini's opera based on it, was partially based on Champfleury. Champfleury was a friend of Murger and they had roomed together for a time.

Opéra féerie (plural, opéras féeries) is a French genre of opera or opéra-ballet based on fairy tales, often with elements of magic in their stories. Popular in the 18th century, from the time of Jean-Philippe Rameau onwards, the form reached its culmination with works such as La belle au bois dormant by Michele Carafa and Cendrillon by Nicolas Isouard at the beginning of the 19th century.
The distantly related English genre of "fairy opera" includes Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]  Earlier in the 19th century, James Planché had popularised the "fairy comedy".  [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

[[Port Leon, Florida]]
CATEGORIES: Former populated places in Florida, Former populated places in Wakulla County, Florida

Port Leon, Florida was a river port town located in what is now Wakulla County, Florida, which existed for only about six years in the first half of the 19th century. Port Leon is classified as an "extinct city" by the State Library and Archives of Florida and only remnants can be found today.
Port Leon, established in 1837, in large measure by former inhabitants of Magnolia, was located about [tpl]convert|3|mi|km[/tpl] south of St. Marks on the east bank of the St. Marks River. It, like neighboring St. Marks and Magnolia, was an important port for the cotton plantations of the Red Hills Region of Florida and Georgia.
The Tallahassee Railroad reached Port Leon in 1839.[ref]
Florida Dept. of Transportation: Rail history[/ref] By then freight wagons and the railroad were bringing some 30,000 to 40,000 bales of cotton a year into the area ports. A bridge across the St. Marks River tied the port to the railroad and the docks for loading on ships, bound for the east coast of the United States.
Port Leon received a post office in 1840,Gallagher, John S. (1997) Florida Post Offices, p. 187 Lake Grove, Oregon: The Depot and was incorporated in 1841. In the same year Port Leon, along with the other communities in the area, endured a severe yellow fever epidemic. On March 11, 1843, it was chosen as the seat of newly created Wakulla County. On September 13, 1843, a strong hurricane with a 10-foot (3 m) storm surge hit the area and destroyed Port Leon as well as heavily damaging nearby Magnolia and St. Marks. Port Leon was abandoned and many of its residents moved inland to the new town of Newport.Historical markers of Florida - Port Leon - accessed February 9, 2008
Port Leon had several hundred citizens at its peak with 8 to 10 businesses, some wharves, warehouses, a hotel, two taverns, a newspaper and an annual fair. One of the successful citizens was Daniel Ladd who had married into the Hamlin family from Maine that established the town of Magnolia.

[[Homer Hoyt]]
CATEGORIES: 1895 births, 1984 deaths, American economists

Homer Hoyt (1895–1984) was a land economist, a real estate appraiser, and a real estate consultant. In his long and accomplished life, he conducted path-breaking research on land economics, developed an influential approach to the analysis of neighborhoods and housing markets, refined local area economic analysis, and was a major figure in the development of suburban shopping centers in the decades after World War II. His sector model of land use remains one of his most well-known contributions to urban scholarship.
Hoyt attended the University of Kansas from which he graduated at the age of 18 with a Phi Beta Kappa key. He also earned a J.D. in 1918 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1933, both from the University of Chicago. Between 1918 and 1933, he taught economics, business law, and accounting at various colleges. His dissertation, One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago, led to numerous opportunities to work as a real estate consultant. In 1934, he joined the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as Principal Housing Economist and later taught as a visiting professor at MIT and Columbia University before opening a consulting firm in 1946. He maintained an active practice consulting on real estate development (with a specialization in suburban shopping malls) and economic analysis. Hoyt also invested in real estate, out of which came the money to establish the Homer Hoyt Institute.
Hoyt made significant contributions in five areas. First, he developed a novel approach to the historical analysis of land values that utilized primary data and mapping techniques.
Second, he applied this methodology during his time at the FHA to assessing the viability of neighborhoods and designing strategies for intervention. His approach combined multiple factors (e.g., condition of dwelling, transportation access, proportion of non-whites) using overlay mapping. The approach enabled the FHA to assess the risk a neighborhood posed for mortgage lenders. The methodology was used by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) to produce Residential Security Area maps for use by lenders. At the time, mixed race neighborhoods were considered unstable and the corresponding attitude towards lending came to be known as red-lining because of the color used on the maps to designate a high-risk neighborhood. Out of this work emerged the sector theory that replaced Ernest Burgess's concentric zone theory of urban morphology.
Third, Hoyt refined the method of economic base analysis that enabled municipal and state governments to assess potential population growth based on the mix of basic and non-basic employment within their economies. Fourth, Hoyt's ability to analyze profitable locations for shopping centers and to estimate their likely revenues made him the country's premier consultant on these matters. Lastly, Hoyt wrote frequently on urban development from a comparative perspective, producing some of the earliest writings in this vein.
Hoyt was not only a consultant but an active contributor to the profession of real estate appraising and to land economics and real estate analysis. The textbook, Principles of Real Estate co-authored with Arthur Weimer, went through seven editions and he published in a variety of professional and academic journals. His legacy continues with the Homer Hoyt Institute that supports real estate research, provides advanced studies for Weimer School fellows, and works to support careers in real estate.

The Franklin Silver Cornet Band, formed in 1856, is one of the oldest volunteer community bands in the United States.http://www.thederrick.com/stories/08092006-3102.shtml The band plays concerts throughout the summer months in Franklin, Pennsylvania as well as an indoor concert in Franklin's Barrow-Civic Theatre the day after Thanksgiving.
The Franklin Silver Cornet Band is the only non-military band to appear at both the Centennial and Bicentennial celebrations in Philadelphia. The band has made a number of other out-of-town appearances over the years, including performances at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, Hersheypark, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, and the Henry Ford Museum.http://www.franklinsilvercornetband.com/gpage8.html 
The band incorporated in the summer of 1873 with seventeen members, including a carriage maker, a dentist, a well worker, and several Civil War veterans. John E. Butler, one of the veterans, had traveled on an orphan train to Princeton, Indiana, where he was a drummer boy with the 17th Indiana Brigade.Greene,Musical Service, xLibris, 2006. 
The first known director of the band was William Bell, who had been a cornet player in his native England. Later directors of the band included Charles Brassington, who led the band from the 1880s until 1918, Charles Ackley, who had led the "house" band at Cedar Point amusement park, and Edwin W. Frye, who served the longest in that capacity, retiring from active bandmastering in 2000.
The band faced occasional difficulties. Hanna's Hall, where the band's rooms were located, burned down in 1886. The band itself briefly disbanded in 1919 but was aided in revival by the remnants of the Rocky Grove Band. In the 1950s, the band was sometimes no larger than a dozen men, and in the 1960s, it entered a joint venture with the American Legion Band of Oil City.
The book Musical Service: The Life and Times of the Franklin Silver Cornet Band retells the band's history.

The Voulet–Chanoine Mission or Central African Mission ([tpl]lang-fr|mission Afrique Centrale[/tpl]) was a French military expedition sent out from Senegal in 1898 to conquer the Chad Basin and unify all French territories in West Africa.  This expedition operated jointly with two other expeditions, the Foureau-Lamy and Gentil missions, which advanced from Algeria and Middle Congo respectively.
With the death of the Muslim warlord Rabih az-Zubayr, the greatest ruler in the region, and the creation of the Military Territory of Chad in 1900, the Voulet–Chanoine Mission had accomplished all its goals. However, this success followed numerous misadventures, including the refusal of the expedition commander and his second-in-command to follow orders from France, and their subsequent murder at the hands of their soldiers.  In the end, only one of the nine Europeans leading the mission, Paul Joalland, was to reach Chad.

Canon Félix Kir  (January 22, 1876 - April 26, 1968) was a French Catholic priest, resistance fighter and politician.
He was born at Alise-Sainte-Reine on the Côte-d'Or. He entered a small seminary at Plombières-lès-Dijon in 1891 and was ordained 1901. He then worked as a parish priest. During the occupation of France during World War II, he took an active part in the French Resistance, helping with the escape of 5,000 prisoners of war from a camp at Longvic. He was arrested and condemned to death, but he was released because of his status. He continued organising operations, and was seriously wounded, but escaped interrogation by the Gestapo. 
In 1945 he was made a knight of the Légion d'honneur and was elected mayor of Dijon and to the French National Assembly. He remained mayor of Dijon up to his death.
A local drink, then locally known as 'blanc-cassis,' consists of white burgundy wine, traditionally Aligoté, mixed with Crème de Cassis, a sweet, blackcurrant-flavored liqueur.  Kir habitually served this local drink to delegations and so the drink itself is now known internationally as Kir.Dale DeGroff, The Essential Cocktail: The Art of Mixing Perfect Drinks (Random House Digital, Inc., 2008)."Sherry-Lehamnn Reports on the Apéritif Hour," New York Magazine, Oct 23, 1972.

[[Square piano]]

CATEGORIES: Piano, Keyboard instruments

The square piano is a piano that has horizontal strings arranged diagonally across the rectangular case above the hammers and with the keyboard set in the long side, with the sounding board above a cavity in the short side. It is variously attributed to Silbermann and Frederici and was improved by Petzold and Babcock. The English and Viennese square pianos were built in many different designs, including within the action as well as general appearance, from roughly 1760. Because of the competitive industry and relative youth of the instrument design itself, experimentation ensued in the early years, creating a range of moderators (sound-altering effects) and other technical devices (knee levers; hand stops) not seen today. In London, the explosion of the trade is generally attributed to the maker Zumpe. The overwhelming popularity of his instruments was due to inexpensive construction and price. In the 1860s metal frames were developed for square pianos, meaning that higher string tensions and therefore greater volumes were possible; however the size increases meant that the upright piano design was more economical, and so the upright replaced the square as the most common home instrument. Built in quantity through the 1890s in the United States, Steinway's celebrated iron framed over strung squares were more than two and a half times the size of Zumpe's wood framed instruments that were successful a century before. Whilst many view square pianos as a 'proto-piano', due to the fact that they do not have the range, volume or delicacy of touch available on modern instruments, they have a sound and playability all their own, and should be treated as a different instrument to the modern piano altogether.

Patapsco Female Institute (PFI) is a former girls' boarding school, now a partially rebuilt historical site, located on Church Road in Ellicott City, Maryland, United States.  The grounds are home to popular outdoor theatrical performances by The Chesapeake Shakespeare Company

The granite faced school sized for 100 students was built on 12 acres of land in Ellicott's Mills for a cost of $27,000. The hillside building was close to the new B&O railroad terminal and turnpike roads. A waterworks, greenhouse, servant's quarters, and facilities for male teachers were built on the grounds. Classes consisted of Latin, mathematics, music, religion, and philosophy. A Normal school program was instituted with students providing labor to reduce tuition. Profit was gained from boarding fees and text book sales.[tpl]cite book|title=History of Higher Education of Women in the South Prior to 1860|author=Isabella Margaret Elizabeth Blandin|page=173[/tpl]
Between 1841 and 1855, the school was operated by Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps. Phelps, a slaveowner but a Union supporter nonetheless, accepted students from both the North and the South in order to encourage friendship between the two sections of the country. During her tenure, the school expanded from six teachers with forty one students to eight teachers and nine staff with seventy students. In 1852, the State removed funding for the school and a board of directors was established with Judge Thomas Beale Dorsey presiding. In 1856, Robert Archer became manager of the school, serving until 1879.[tpl]cite book|title=History of Higher Education of Women in the South Prior to 1860|author=Isabella Margaret Elizabeth Blandin|page=177[/tpl] During the Civil War, the 12th New Jersey Infantry Regiment camped near the Institute's grounds in 1862 while guarding the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad against the Confederacy's advance.[tpl]cite web|title=Patapsco Female Institute: Classes and Camps|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=4271|publisher=Historical Marker Database|accessdate=December 9, 2012|author=Tom Fuchs|year=2007[/tpl]
In 1891, it was purchased by a James E. Tyson. The last manager of the school was Sarah Randolph until 1896 when the board of directors sold the declining school. It was converted to a summer hotel called the Burg Alnwick Hotel. Fourteen years later, in 1905, it was purchased by a Miss Lilly Tyson and turned into a private home. In 1917, during the First World War, the building was called into service as a hospital. It was fitted with 50 beds to accommodate wounded veterans returning to the States. In later years, the building was used as a theater and again as a private residence. In 1938, the Howard County School board considered the site for a new school.[tpl]cite web|title=1938 Board Minutes|url=http://www.boarddocs.com/mabe/hcpssmd/archive.nsf/2e010f82a76b56d485256e7400431d45/ad3b7301c1689edb87257625005b63a1/$FILE/01-04-1938%20-%2012-23-1938.pdf|accessdate=24 May 2013[/tpl] In 1966, the County considered buying the eight acre property again as parkland from the University of Cincinnati using a news transfer tax for school and park projects.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|title=Miller favors buying building|date=19 February 1966[/tpl] Since 1966 the building has been under the care of the 'Friends of the Patapsco Institute'; it has been stabilized and partially restored, and the grounds fenced in to limit public access.

CATEGORIES: 1995 singles, Ash (band) songs, Songs written by Tim Wheeler, 1977 songs, Songs written by Rick McMurray

"Angel Interceptor" is a song by Ash, released as the third single from their album 1977 on 9 October 1995. It was released as a single CD, a 7" vinyl, and as a cassette. The song was written by Rick McMurray and Tim Wheeler and produced by Owen Morris.
This song is meant to be one of the reasons Ash believed they needed a fourth, female member. Originally, the track's high-pitched backing vocals were performed by drummer Rick McMurray, but the band were unsatisfied with them. The title of the song is a reference to fictional aircraft featured in the 1960s sci-fi series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.

CATEGORIES: American Revolutionary War sites, Protected areas of Carter County, Tennessee, History of the Cherokee, Pre-statehood history of Tennessee, National Historic Landmarks in Tennessee, Landforms of Tennessee, Elizabethton, Tennessee

The Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga River, usually shortened to Sycamore Shoals, is a rocky stretch of river rapids along the Watauga River in Elizabethton, Tennessee. Archeological excavations have found Native Americans lived near the shoals since prehistoric times, and Cherokees gathered there.  As Europeans began settling the Trans-Appalachian frontier, the shoals proved strategic militarily, as well as shaped the economies of Tennessee and Kentucky. Today, the shoals are protected as a National Historic Landmark and are maintained as part of Sycamore Shoals State Historic Park.Carroll Van West, Sycamore Shoals State Historic Park. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002.  Retrieved: 28 June 2009.Polly Rettig and Hugh Lawing (form preparation),  Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga — National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form.  11 February 1976.  Retrieved: 28 June 2009.  PDF file.    
Explorer James Robertson (later a founder of Nashville) identified the alluring flatlands at Sycamore Shoals, known as the Watauga Old Fields, in 1770, and led a group of colonists to the area shortly thereafter.  In 1772, the Watauga settlers established the Watauga Association, one of the first constitutional governments west of the Appalachian Mountains and the "germ-cell" of what would later become the state of Tennessee.  
In 1775, Richard Henderson and Daniel Boone negotiated the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals, in which Henderson's Transylvania Company purchased a large part of modern Kentucky and part of Tennessee from the Cherokee.  The following year, the Watauga settlers successfully thwarted one arm of a Cherokee invasion at Fort Watauga in a struggle that saw the creation of numerous legends surrounding figures such as Nancy Ward and John Sevier.  In 1780, at the height of the American Revolutionary War, the frontier militia known as the Overmountain Men mustered at Sycamore Shoals as it prepared to march across the mountains en route to victory over British loyalists at the Battle of Kings Mountain.

Mush — sometimes called coosh[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] — is a thick cornmeal pudding (or porridge) usually boiled in water or milk. It is often allowed to set, or gel into a semi solid, then cut into flat squares or rectangles, and pan fried. Usage is especially common in the eastern and southeastern United States. It is also customary for those in the Midwestern US to eat it with maple syrup or molasses. In Eastern Europe instead of boiling in milk, it is poured over the meal once served and cooled down. Corn meal mush is often consumed in Latin America and Africa.
It has been considered synonymous, perhaps erroneously, with other dishes:

[[Transportation forecasting]]

CATEGORIES: Transportation planning

Transportation forecasting is the process of estimating the number of vehicles or people that will use a specific transportation facility in the future. For instance, a forecast may estimate the number of vehicles on a planned road or bridge, the ridership on a railway line, the number of passengers visiting an airport, or the number of ships calling on a seaport. Traffic forecasting begins with the collection of data on current traffic. This traffic data is combined with other known data, such as population, employment, trip rates, travel costs, etc., to develop a traffic demand model for the current situation. Feeding it with predicted data for population, employment, etc. results in estimates of future traffic, typically estimated for each segment of the transportation infrastructure in question, e.g., for each roadway segment or railway station.
Traffic forecasts are used for several key purposes in transportation policy, planning, and engineering: to calculate the capacity of infrastructure, e.g., how many lanes a bridge should have; to estimate the financial and social viability of projects, e.g., using cost-benefit analysis and social impact assessment; and to calculate environmental impacts, e.g., air pollution and noise.

[[Shivaji's forts]]

CATEGORIES: Forts in Maharashtra, Shivaji

Shivaji, founder of Maratha empire in western India in 1664, was well known for his forts; he was in possession of around three hundred at the time of his death.  Many, like Panhala Fort and Rajgad existed before him but others, like Sindhudurg and Pratapgad, were built by him from scratch. Also, the fort of Raigad was built as the place of throne, i.e., the capital, of Maratha Empire by Hiroji Indalkar (Deshmukh) on the orders of Shivaji. This is the place where Shivaji was coronated and today also his Samadhi stands in front of the Jagadishwar temple. These forts were central to his empire and their remains are among the foremost sources of information about his rule. The French missionary Father Fryer witnessed the fortifications of Gingee, Madras, built by Shivaji after its conquest, and appreciated his technical know-how and knowledge.
Sindhudurg was built in order to control attacks by Portuguese and Siddhis on the coastal areas of the Maratha Empire. This fort is the witness of Shivaji's Navy which was later led by Kanhoji Angre in times of Shivaji's grandson Shahu I, and came to glory. Also Shivaji built the forts of Colaba and Underi to control the activities of the Siddhis in Arabian Sea. At the time of Underi's construction British opposed a lot and stood with their warships in the sea to obstacle the material being supplied for the construction of the fort. But for their surprise the material required for construction was being supplied with the help of small boats in night.
The hill fort Salher in Nashik district was at a distance of [tpl]convert|1200|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from the hill fort Jingi, near Chennai. Over such long distance, hill forts were supported by seaforts. The seafort, Kolaba Fort, near Mumbai, was at a distance of [tpl]convert|500|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from the seafort Sindhudurg. All of these forts were put under a havaldar with a strong garrison. Strict discipline was followed. These forts proved useful during Mughal-Maratha wars.
Along with Rana Kumbha of Mewar and Raja Bhoj of Shilahar, he stands as a grand figure in the art of fortification in Indian sub-continent. There are a number of legends about these forts. Even today thousands of youths visit these forts in his memory.
Notable features of Shivaji's forts include:

[[Small Solar System body]]
CATEGORIES: Minor planets

A small Solar System body (SSSB) is an object in the Solar System that is neither a planet, nor a dwarf planet, nor a satellite.[tpl]#tag:ref|The formally correct typography for common nouns such as "small Solar System bodies" and "trans-Neptunian objects" is sentence case,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] rather than title case as used by the IAU in this instance.|group="note"[/tpl] The term was first defined in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union.
This encompasses all comets and all minor planets other than those that are dwarf planets. Thus SSSBs are: the classical asteroids with the exception of the dwarf planet Ceres; the trojans; and the centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects with the exception of Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, Eris, and others that will turn out to be dwarf planets.

The Siq ([tpl]lang-ar|السيق[/tpl], transliterated al-Sīq, transcribed as-Sīq,Al is assimilated and pronounced as because s (of Sīq) is a sun letter. literally ‘the Shaft’) is the main entrance to the ancient city of Petra in southern Jordan.  The dim, narrow gorge (in some points no more than 3 m wide) winds its way approximately 1.2 km (about one mile) and ends at Petra's most elaborate ruin, Al Khazneh (the Treasury). 
A wide valley outside leading to the Siq is known as the Bab as-Sīq (Gateway to the Siq).
Unlike slot canyons like Antelope Canyon, which are directly shaped by water, the Siq is a natural geological fault split apart by tectonic forces; only later was it worn smooth by water.  The walls that enclose the Siq stand between 91–182 m (300–600 feet) in height.Fabio Bourbon, Petra: Jordan's Extraordinary Ancient City. New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 1999 (ISBN 0-7607-2022-3)
The entrance to the Siq contains a huge dam, reconstructed in 1963 and again in 1991, designed to bar the mouth of the Siq and reroute the waters of Wadi Musa.  The dam is a fairly true reconstruction of what the Nabataeans did to control Wadi Musa between the 1st century BC and the beginning of the 1st century AD.  The entrance also contains the remnants of a monumental arch, of which only the two abutments and some hewn stones of the arch itself have survived.  The arch collapsed in 1896 following an earthquake, but its appearance is known from the lithographs of Matthew Boulby and David Roberts.
The Siq was used as the grand caravan entrance into Petra.  Along both walls of the fissure are a number of votive niches containing baetyli, which suggest that the Siq was sacred to the Nabatean people.  In 1998, a group of statues were uncovered when digging was conducted to lower the road by more than six feet.  Although the upper part is greatly eroded, it is still possible to recognise the figures of two merchants, each leading two camels.  The figures are almost twice lifesize.
Along the Siq are some underground chambers, the function of which has not yet been clarified.  The possibility that they were tombs has been excluded, and archaeologists find it difficult to believe that they were dwellings.  The majority consensus is that they housed the guards that defended the main entrance to Petra.

[[Brother Against Brother (game)]]

CATEGORIES: American Civil War games, Miniatures games

Brother Against Brother is a popular set of rules for miniature wargaming, recreating small skirmishes primarily of the American Civil War, as well as the French and Indian War and similar time periods. First written by Ivor M. Janci in 1996 for the Civil War, the rules were republished a year later by H.G. Walls, who expanded them to include F&I conflicts, artillery, and other enhancements.
The rules are for company-level fights, with each player commanding at least a squadron or similar small group of 9-10 soldiers. Each miniature figure represents 1 combatant within the squad, led by a Sergeant or similar noncomissioned officer. Multiple squads (usually 4 or 5 in number) are commanded by a Company Officer such as a lieutenant or captain.
The 44-page rules cover infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Play is based upon initiative, and standard playing cards randomly determine which groups are activated when during each game turn. Each figurine may take one individual action per turn—fire, load (certain weapons require loading before firing), move, charge. Being outside of a Sergeant's command radius limits a soldier's actions; and soldiers can charge only if directly ordered to do so by a Company Officer. Taking casualties or charging requires a group to draw one of 19 Morale Cards, often causing skeedaddling (stragglers), out of ammunition conditions, or other consequences. Optional rules cover troop quality, special event cards, types of fire, and allow leaders to be "personalized."
Each game typically lasts 3-4 hours. One infantry/cavalry figurine represents 1-2 men. The ground scale is 1" = 5 yards. One Action Phase represents 1-3 minutes.

The film depicts the life of a couple—Vishwam (Madhu) and Sita (Sharada)—who have married against their parents' wishes and want to start a new life at a new place. The title is an allusion to the ancient Indian practice of a girl of marriageable age choosing a husband from among a list of suitors.
Swayamvaram marked several debuts—directorial of Gopalakrishnan, acting of the Malayalam star Bharath Gopi, and film producing of the Chitralekha Film Cooperative, an organisation cofounded by Gopoalakrishnan himself. The film features an original score by M. B. Sreenivasan, camerawork by Mankada Ravi Varma, and film editing by Ramesan. Writer-director K. P. Kumaran co-scripted the film with Gopalakrishnan. It took seven years for Gopalakrishnan to get the project rolling when his initial proposal for a loan to make a film was turned down by the Film Finance Corporation (FFC). The FFC later partially financed the film when Chitralekha provided the rest.
The film received widespread critical acclaim. It pioneered the new wave cinema movement in Malayalam cinema and became one of the first Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and outdoor locales. The film also became the first Indian film to use sound as a leitmotif. It was shown at various film festivals around the world, and won four National Film Awards at the 20th National Film Awards in 1973, including for Best Film, Best Director for Gopalakrishnan, and Best Actress for Sharada.

CATEGORIES: American jazz singers, 1908 births, 1972 deaths, People from Parsons, Kansas, People from Montgomery County, Kansas, 20th-century American musicians, American jazz banjoists, American jazz guitarists, Musicians from Kansas

Clarence Leonard Hayes was a jazz vocalist, banjoist and guitarist born November 14, 1908 in Caney, Kansas. He lived in Parsons, Kansas for a short time, and the town is the subject of his song "The Parsons, Kansas Blues": / Listen to it here. He worked always as a professional musician, turning up in San Francisco in 1926.  By 1927 he was a regular on the music scene there.  He performed regularly on radio in San Francisco until the 1950s when live music came to be replaced with recordings.
For two years beginning in 1938 he was a singer, banjoist and sometimes percussionist with Lu Watters's Yerba Buena Jazz band, the group that helped spark the Dixieland revival that continues to this day.  He went on to play with Bob Scobey's Frisco Jazz Band for many years; both he and Scobey were alumni of Watters's earlier band, as was trombonist Turk Murphy at whose San Francisco nightclub Hayes often played.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]  He recorded fairly widely and with many different groups.
Hayes's light baritone singing is relaxed, unmannered and marked by a perfect sense of rhythm which allowed him to attack phrases at just the perfect instant, and his renditions of classics from the twenties and of moralistic saloon songs such as "Ace in the Hole", "Wise Guy" and "Silver Dollar" are splendid. Hayes wrote only one hit tune, "Huggin' and Chalkin'", made famous by Hoagy Carmichael, though Hayes himself recorded it with Scobey's band.
Hayes's banjo playing was essentially rhythmic rather than melodic and is generally unobtrusive and very tasteful, two qualities often lacking in jazz banjoists.  He was unusual in playing a six-string banjo rather than the more common plectrum or tenor which have four strings.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
He died in San Francisco in March 1972.

Arras Cathedral (Cathédrale Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Vaast d'Arras) is the Roman Catholic cathedral of the city of Arras in France. It is the seat of the bishops of Arras.
The original cathedral of Arras, constructed between 1030 and 1396, was one of the most beautiful Gothic structures in northern France, until it was destroyed in the French Revolution. The cathedral was the resting place of Louis de Bourbon, Légitimé de France, illegitimate son of Louis XIV and Louise de La Vallière. 
In 1833 the church of the former St. Vaast's Abbey was rebuilt in classical style as a replacement cathedral.
The design was chosen by the former abbot of St. Vaast's, the Cardinal de Rohan, and is of remarkable simplicity.
Arras Cathedral was destroyed by shelling in April 1917, during the run-up to the Nivelle offensives of World War I.G.J. Meyer, A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918, at 532 (Delta 2007), and subsequently rebuilt in its previous form.

[[Opera semiseria]]

CATEGORIES: Opera genres, Italian opera terminology

Opera semiseria ('semi-serious opera') is an Italian genre of opera, popular in the early and middle 19th century.
Related to the opera buffa, opera semiseria contains elements of comedy but also of pathos, sometimes with a pastoral setting. It can usually be distinguished from tragic operas or melodramas by the presence of a basso buffo.  One of the better-known examples is Gaetano Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix. Another example is Gioacchino Rossini's La gazza ladra. Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula has all the characteristics of the genre except the presence of the required basso buffo and is regarded as both opera seria and opera semiseria.[tpl]cite book|last=Sadie(ed)|first=Stanley|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Vl 2|year=1980|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=1-56159-174-2|pages=453[/tpl]

[[Langres Cathedral]]
CATEGORIES: Cathédrale Saint-Mammès de Langres, Cathedrals in France, Churches in Haute-Marne

Langres Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-Mammès de Langres) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and a national monument of France, located in the town of Langres.  It was built in the twelfth century and is dedicated to the 3rd-century martyr Mammes of Caesarea. It is the seat of the Bishop of Langres.
Around 1140, bishop Geoffroy de La Roche-Vanneau (1139-1162), a companion of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, took the decision to rebuild the cathedral. At that time the cathedral of Saint-Étienne in Sens was already under construction. Building began with the choir. The three-level frontage was taken from the third church at Cluny. The choir's flying buttresses were hidden, but those of the nave can be seen from the outside. We know from a bull of Pope Alexander III, who had taken refuge at Sens from 1163 to 1165, that in 1170 building was well underway. It only lacked the first span of the nave and the great west front.
In 1190, following the sale of lands to the west, a last campaign was undertaken with a view to finishing the building work, and the cathedral was dedicated in 1196. It seems that at that date only the vaults of the nave were still to be built.
In  1209, the holy relic of the head of Saint Mammes was brought to the cathedral. In the thirteenth century the cloister was built (of which two arcades remain today) as well as the chapel of the Virgin in the apse (promoted by the canon of Vergy). In 1314, a fire destroyed the nave's roof. In the sixteenth century, from 1547 to 1551, the canon d'Amoncourt, vicar-general of Claude de Longwy who was then bishop of Langres, had the chapel of the Holy Cross built on the left-hand side of the nave. In 1562, lightning caused another fire. In 1746, the west side threatened to collapse, and the decision was taken to demolish it. It was rebuilt from 1761 to 1786 in the classical style, in accordance with the plans of  Claude-Louis D'Aviler dating from 1758. The works were managed by the architect Jean-Antoine Caristie. On 12 December 1790, the cathedral was closed, but reopened in 1791. In the nineteenth century, from 1852, the highest parts of the cathedral were renovated by the architect Alphonse Durand, who also built the sacristy from 1857 to 1862.

Stanley George Payne (born September 9, 1934 in Denton, Texas) is a historian of modern Spain and European Fascism at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He retired from full-time teaching in 2004 and is currently Professor Emeritus at its Department of History.Curriculum vitae and photo at Department of History, University of Wisconsin–Madison Payne is one of the most famous modern theorists of fascism.Roger Griffin. The Nature of Fascism. Routledge. 1993. p. 6 He is a specialist in Spanish fascism and he has also produced comparative analyses of Western European fascism. Payne is known for his typological description of fascism. He asserts that there were some specific ways in which National Socialism paralleled Russian communism to a much greater degree than Fascism was capable of doing.  Payne does not propound a theory of "red fascism" or the notion that communism and nazism have been essentially the same thing.  He states that Hitlerian National Socialism more nearly paralleled Russian communism than has any other noncommunist system.The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right. Routledge. 2002. p.67Stanley G. Payne. Fascism: Comparison and Definition. University of Wisconsin Press. 1983. ISBN 978-0-299-08064-8. p.102-104
In the 1960s, his books were published in Spanish by Éditions Ruedo ibérico (ERi), a publishing company set up by Spanish exiles in Paris, France, to publish works forbidden in Spain by the Spanish government at the time. His position regarding the Spanish Civil War has been that of shedding light on the conflict's origin and addressing its related myths. One of his more famous books is Spanish Civil War, The Soviet Union and Communism, which analyzes Joseph Stalin and the Soviet government's intervention in Spain.  He also wrote The Franco Regime, The Spanish Civil War and A History of Fascism 1914-1945.
Payne uses a lengthy itemized list of characteristics to identify fascism, including the creation of an authoritarian state; a regulated, state-integrated economic sector; fascist symbolism; anti-liberalism; anti-communism, and anti-conservatism.Payne, Stanley (1980). Fascism: Comparison and Definition. University of Wisconsin Press, p.7 He sees elimination of the autonomy or, in some cases, complete existence of large-scale capitalism as the common aim of all fascist movements.Payne, Stanley (1996).

CATEGORIES: Comic book publishing companies of the United States, Erotic comics

Carnal Comics is an adults-only comic book imprint created in 1992 which has so far been published by three companies: Revolutionary Comics, Re-Visionary Press, and Opus Graphics. Carnal Comics' flagship title is Carnal Comics: True Stories Of Adult Film Stars, which features autobiographies co-created with porn stars.
Since the line’s inception, over 100 Carnal Comics have been published, including several crossovers with other adult comic publishers (Rip Off Press, Mu Press, Eros Comics and others).  Carnal claims to have sold over a million comic books, and their late-90s series Triple-X Cinema: A Cartoon History was reported to be the best-selling adult comic ever carried by Diamond Comic Distributors, the leading (and essentially only) full service United States comic book distributor.  Carnal’s comics were the first monthly comics widely carried in adult novelty boutiques and their inclusion in large-scale mail order catalogs like Adam & Eve’s enabled the line to sell in numbers previously unheard-of for standard 32-page adult comics. 
At its peak, Carnal also had a color section in each issue of Oui on newsstands, and its stars were doing regular TV and radio promotions on shows with Howard Stern, Jenny Jones, and others.  Ads for the comics even infiltrated mainstream magazines, earning the company some notoriety and, in at least one case, inclusion in a stack of comic contraband taken during a police raid of a retail comic shop.

[[Flow birefringence]]
CATEGORIES: Protein structure

In biochemistry, flow birefringence is a hydrodynamic technique for measuring the rotational diffusion constants (or, equivalently, the rotational drag coefficients).  The birefringence of a solution sandwiched between two concentric cylinders is measured as a function of the difference in rotational speed between the inner and outer cylinders.  The flow tends to orient an ellipsoidal particle (typically, a protein, virus, etc.) in one direction, whereas rotational diffusion (tumbling) causes the molecule to become disoriented.  The equilibrium between these two processes as a function of the flow provides a measure of the axial ratio of the ellipsoidal particle.

Formestane (Lentaron) is a type I, steroidal aromatase inhibitor.  It is used in the treatment of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer in post-menopausal women.  It is available as an intramuscular depot injection.
Formestane is often used to suppress estrogen production from anabolic steroids or prohormones.  It also acts as a prohormone to 4-hydroxytestosterone, an active steroid which displays weak androgenic activity in addition to acting as a mild aromatase inhibitor.
Formestane has poor oral bioavailability and as such is no longer popular as many orally active aromatase inhibitors have been identified.

Ross Global Academy Charter School, or RGA, was a public charter school located in Lower Manhattan. It opened in September 2006 with  more than 160 students. It was closed in 2011 by New York City and state officials for various reasons, including poor performance.The New York Times, Jan. 21, 2011: "Charter School Loses Bid to Stay Open"The New York Times, Dec. 6, 2010: "Ross Global Academy Is Among 12 Chosen to Close"
The school was developed in collaboration with New York University's Steinhardt School and Ross School in East Hampton, which follows a spiral curriculum designed by William Thompson and Ralph Abraham. The school was initially slated to be housed in the same building as the NEST+m school, in the Lower East Side, a controversial decision which was eventually revised.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
In its inception, the school was housed within the New York City Department of Education building, formerly the Tweed Courthouse, at 52 Chambers Street. The school began its 2006-2007 school year at full enrollment on September 4, 2006, with students in grades K, 1, 2, 6, and 7.  It was a project of the Ross School in East Hampton.  RGA was founded by Courtney Sale Ross, who is a philanthropist and the widow of Steve Ross, the former CEO of Time-Warner.
By 2009, RGA had expanded to serve grades K-8, and had moved to a new building on East 11th Street in the Lower East Side, which it stayed in until it closed in 2011.http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2011/01/17/110117ta_talk_meadhttp://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/charter-school-loses-bid-to-stay-open/

Montauban Cathedral (Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption de Montauban) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and a national monument of France, located in the town of Montauban.
It is the seat of the Bishopric of Montauban, created in 1317, abolished by the Concordat of 1801 and transferred to the Archdiocese of Toulouse, and restored in 1822.
The cathedral of Montauban was Protestant from the start of the Wars of Religion until Catholicism returned to Montauban in 1629.
The construction of a new church, the present building, was agreed after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The cornerstone of the new cathedral was laid in 1692, and the church was consecrated in 1739. Initially, the architect François d'Orbay supervised the works. When he died in 1697, he was succeeded by Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Robert de Cotte. 
The towers frame the west façade, a pure product that applies all the conventions of classical art, i.e. an Ionic facade with a peristyle mounted by statues of the Four Evangelists which replaced the original statues. The interior is decorated with pilasters, metopes and triglyphs, and the cathedral's strict and elegant vertical lines make it a masterpiece of classical architecture. A famous painting by Ingres, "The Vow of Louis XIII", hangs in the north arm of the transept.

Dydrogesterone was first introduced to the market in 1961, and is currently approved in over 100 countries worldwide. It has an estimated cumulative exposure of more than 10 million pregnancies.
Dydrogesterone is a potent, orally active progestogen indicated in a wide variety of gynaecological conditions related to progesterone deficiency. Although similar in molecular structure and pharmacological effects to endogenous progesterone. It is orally active at far lower doses. Its freedom from estrogenic, androgenic, anabolic, corticoid and other undesirable hormonal effects gives it additional benefits over most other synthetic progestogens.
The therapeutic use of dydrogesterone is closely related to its physiological action on the neuro-endocrine control of ovarian function, as well as on the endometrium. As such, it is indicated in all cases of relative or absolute endogeneous progesterone deficiency.
Dydrogesterone is to be withdrawn from the UK market from March 2008 for commercial reasons. Dydrogesterone was licensed for use in several indications,including threatened or recurrent miscarriage, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and hormone replacement therapy.
Dydrogesterone has proven effective in the following conditions associated with progesterone deficiency:[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
Dydrogesterone has also been registered as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to counteract the negative effects of unopposed estrogen on the endometrium in women with an intact uterus. Dydrogesterone is relatively safe and well tolerated, and does not exhibit the androgenic side effects that are common with some other progestins, like medroxyprogesterone.

[[Septage]]

CATEGORIES: Sewerage

In the United States, the partially treated waste store in a septic tank is called septage.http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wweb/septslud.htm  It generally consists of all the household wastes that are disposed of through a home's plumbing system that neither drain out into the soil nor are converted to gases by the bacteria in the tank.  
Disposing of septage in the United States is becoming an increasing problem as people build homes outside of city sewer systems.  Septage waste can be transported to local waste water treatment centers, used by farmers for fertilizer, or stored in large septage waste storage facilities for later treatment or use on crops.

CATEGORIES: 1929 novels, Novels by Leslie Charteris, Ward Lock & Co books

Daredevil is the title of a mystery novel by Leslie Charteris which was first published by Ward Lock in 1929 (followed by an American edition that same year by The Crime Club). This was Charteris' fourth full-length novel, and is one of the few full-length books in his canon that does not feature the character of Simon Templar, alias "The Saint". However, the book does have a connection to the Saint series.
The novel was a follow-up to an earlier work entitled X Esquire, which was Charteris' first novel, published in 1927. Daredevil followed the exploits of Christopher "Storm" Arden, described as "the fighting daredevil". The character featured many elements that would later be incorporated into The Saint (including the car he drove, a Hirondel, of the type later used by Simon Templar in the early Saint novels and stories).
The most notable element of the book is that it featured the first appearance of Scotland Yard Inspector Claud Eustace Teal, the gum-chewing detective who would go on to become a recurring character in the Simon Templar novels, novellas, and short stories starting in 1929 (Templar had been introduced in the 1928 novel, Meet - The Tiger! but this book did not feature Teal; the earliest stories to feature Teal and Templar together can be found in the 1930 collection Enter the Saint). 
Charteris would go on to write one further novel in 1929, The Bandit, before focusing almost exclusively on writing Simon Templar adventures (with a few exceptions) for the remainder of his literary career.

Lynestrenol is a progestogen hormone. It is a synthetic orally-available progestagen associated with numerous effects of the natural progesterone hormone. Lynestrenol has a strong progestational effect on the uterine endometrium (transforming proliferative endometrium into secretory one), inhibits secretion of gonadotropin, suppresses maturation of follicles in the ovaries and ovulation, reduces menstrual bleeding. 
This synthetic gestagen is associated with minimal estrogenic, androgenic and anabolic effects. 
Lynestrenol is used in treatment of hormonal disorders and diseases caused by insufficient secretion of the natural progesterone, except in case of risky pregnancies and prevention of miscarriage, since it is not efficient enough in this indication.

CATEGORIES: Fictional characters introduced in 1940, Fictional mummies, Fictional undead, Fictional priests and priestesses, Fictional shapeshifters, Fictional mass murderers, The Mummy films, Horror film characters

Kharis[tpl]pronunciation-needed[/tpl] is a fictional character featured in Universal Studios's Mummy series in the 1940s following their original 1932 film The Mummy, which starred Boris Karloff as a different mummy character, Imhotep, though their backstories are practically identical. Universal's Mummy films were inspired by worldwide interest in Egyptian archeology during the first half of the twentieth century.
In the first Kharis film, The Mummy's Hand (1940), the character was played by Western-film actor Tom Tyler, while the three subsequent films, The Mummy's Tomb (1942), The Mummy's Ghost (1944), and The Mummy's Curse (also 1944), starred Lon Chaney, Jr. in the role. Although the iconic image of the mummy's face is usually Karloff's, the Kharis films are responsible for the enduring stereotype of the lumbering, foot-dragging monster, as Karloff's bandaged creation is seen only briefly while Kharis is a major on-screen character in all four follow-up films. The Kharis movies also introduce the notion of tana leaves as integral to the mummy's survival.
The Mummy's Hand introduces Kharis in a series of flashbacks that are pulled from the original 1932 film except for inserts with Tyler replacing shots in which Karloff would have been conspicuous. The original film's ancient-Egypt scenes tell the story of Imhotep, who is punished for attempting to resurrect a dead lover, while in the Kharis films the identities and details of this story are simply changed to describe a similar but alternate scenario. For this reason the Kharis films are not sequels to the original, as occasionally misperceived.
The make-up for Kharis was designed by Universal's resident monster expert Jack Pierce. While Tyler's features can be discerned easily under the make-up (as could Karloff's), Chaney is unrecognizable, due to the use of a mask rather than customized make-up over the course of the series (Pierce had earlier fashioned a mask for Tyler to wear for certain long shots in The Mummy's Hand, and the difference between the mask and the painstaking original makeup is fairly easy to spot on film). While in The Wolf Man Chaney played the starring role both in and out of makeup, Tyler was shown as the human Kharis in Chaney's Mummy films during flashback scenes, a somewhat demoralizing budgetary measure that showed Chaney's importance to be mainly that of his famous name.
Christopher Lee portrayed Kharis in the 1959 Hammer horror film The Mummy.

[[Luxembourg general election, 1945]]
CATEGORIES: Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg elections, History of Luxembourg (1945–present), 1945 elections in Europe, 1945 in Luxembourg

General elections were held in Luxembourg on 21 October 1945.Nohlen, D & Stöver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1244 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7 They were the first elections held after the German occupation during World War II. As a result of the war, the political alliances of the interwar period had been ended.  In their place were new parties; the Christian Social People's Party, the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party, and the Patriotic and Democratic Group in place of the Party of the Right, Socialist Party, and Radical Liberal Party respectively.  It is regarded as a realigning election, as the election established the party political order, with four established parties, that would be maintained until 1974.
The conservatives remained the dominant faction, and the Christian Social People's Party's leader, Pierre Dupong, was invited to head another government.  The election was also a success for both liberal and communist candidates, with both the Patriotic and Democratic Group and the Communist Party gaining four more seats than in the last election before the war.Although the Patriotic and Democratic Group was a new party, they won four more than their ideological predecessors, the Radical Liberals, had in 1937. To restore political stability, Grand Duchess Charlotte asked Dupong to create a more broad-based coalition than the preceding Liberation Government.  The resulting National Union Government would embrace all four political parties, and also include the solitary independent, guaranteeing the support of the whole Chamber of Deputies.  The government remained in place until 1947.

Rogers Park is a Metra commuter railroad station in the Rogers Park neighborhood on the north side of Chicago.  It is located at 7000 N. Ravenswood Avenue, between W. Greenleaf Avenue and W. Lunt Avenue.  In Metra's zone-based fare system, Rogers Park is in zone B. The neighborhood that surrounds the station is residential, with single-family houses and small apartment buildings, but just a block to the east is Clark Street, a major north-south artery with buses and shopping.
The station has two side platforms, and although it does not contain a ticket agent booth, a heated waiting room is available on the Lunt side between 5:45 AM - 2:00 PM. This line retains the "left-hand main" policy of the original builder, the Chicago and North Western Railway: northbound trains stop on the west platform and southbound trains stop on the east platform.  
Rogers Park is served by Metra's Union Pacific/North Line trains, traveling between Ogilvie Transportation Center in Chicago and points as far north as Kenosha, Wisconsin.  Rogers Park is the northernmost Union Pacific/North Line station in Chicago.  Travel time to Ogilvie is usually 20 minutes, but can be as fast as 15 minutes on a rush hour express train and as slow as 23 minutes during overcrowding.
The closest CTA Red Line station is Morse, located five blocks to the east of Rogers Park station.

[[Scientific priority]]
CATEGORIES: Scientific method

In science, priority is the credit given to the individual or group of individuals who first made the discovery or propose the theory. Fame and honours usually go to the first person or group to publish a new finding, even if several researchers arrived at the same conclusion independently and at the same time. Thus between two or more independent discoverers, the first to make formal publication is the legitimate winner. Hence, the tradition is often referred to as the priority rule, the procedure of which is nicely summed up in a phrase "publish or perish", because there are no second prizes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Strevens M|year=2003 |title= The Role of the Priority Rule in Science| journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=55–79| pmid= |pmc= |jstor=3655792[/tpl] In a way, the race to be first inspires risk-taking that can lead to scientific breakthroughs which is beneficial to the society (such as discovery of malaria transmission, DNA, HIV, etc.); on the other hand, it can create an unhealthy competition, thus, becoming detrimental to scientific progress.[tpl]cite journal|author=Fang FC, Casadevall A|year=2012 |title= Reforming science: structural reforms | journal=Infect Immun|volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=897–901 |pmid= 22184420| pmc=3294664|doi= 10.1128/IAI.06184-11[/tpl]

[[Chasséen culture]]
CATEGORIES: Archaeological cultures of Western Europe, Indo-European, Stone Age Europe, Archaeology of France

Chasséen culture is the name given to the archaeological culture of prehistoric France of the late Neolithic (stone age), roughly between 4500 BC and 3500 BC.  The name "Chasséen" derives from the type site near Chassey-le-Camp (Saône-et-Loire).
Chasséen culture spread throughout the plains and plateaux of France, including the Seine basin and the upper Loire valleys, and extended to the present-day départments of Haute-Saône,  Vaucluse, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Pas-de-Calais and Eure-et-Loir.  Excavations at Bercy (in Paris) have revealed a Chasséen village (4000 BC - 3800BC) on the right bank of the Seine; artifacts include wood canoes, pottery, bows and arrows, wood and stone tools.
Chasséens were sedentary farmers (rye, panic grass, millet, apples, pears, prunes) and herders (sheep, goats, oxen).  They lived in huts organized into small villages (100-400 people). Their pottery was little decorated.  They had no metal technology (which appeared later), but mastered the use of flint.
By roughly 3500 BC, the Chasséen culture in France gave way to the late Neolithic transitional Seine-Oise-Marne culture (3100BC - 2000 BC) in Northern France and to a series of archaeological cultures in Southern France.

[[Claud Eustace Teal]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional British police detectives, Literary characters, The Saint

Claud Eustace Teal is a fictional character who made many appearances in a series of novels, novellas and short stories by Leslie Charteris entitled The Saint, starting in 1929. A common spelling variation of his first name in reference works and websites is Claude, however in his works Charteris uses the spelling without the 'e'.
Teal was a London-based police detective for Scotland Yard, with which he initially held the rank of Inspector. He first appeared not in a Saint story, but in a 1929 novel entitled Daredevil as a friend of that book's hero, "Storm" Arden.[ref]
</ref> When Charteris decided to launch an ongoing series of stories featuring his [[Robin Hood]]-inspired anti-hero, Simon Templar (a.k.a. The Saint) in late 1929, he imported the character of Teal though it's not known if ''Daredevil'' plays any role in the actual continuity of the Saint series. (The first Saint story, 1928's ''[[Meet - The Tiger!]]'', predated ''Daredevil'' and featured a character named Detective Carn, who was a template for the later Teal).<ref>
</ref>
Teal first appeared opposite Simon Templar in several novella-length stories that appeared in the UK magazine Thriller in the spring and summer of 1929; several were published in 1930 as the collection Enter the Saint (which is where most readers were first exposed to Teal),[ref]
</ref> though the earliest stories in the series would not be published in book form until they were rewritten and included in a later collection, ''[[Featuring the Saint]]''.<ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref>
At some point, Teal received a promotion to Chief Inspector and he is identified with this rank for the first time in the short story collection The Brighter Buccaneer.[ref]
</ref>
Teal is described as a heavy set, blue-eyed, perpetually weary policeman who, instead of smoking (a common behaviour during the era), chews gum incessantly. Little if any family life is indicated for the character. According to Daredevil, however, he had married at the age of 22. It isn't known whether Teal chews gum in an attempt to quit smoking; the Wrigley's Spearmint brand is frequently mentioned by name (and even illustrated on the cover of some editions of Saint books that involve Teal). 
Teal's relationship with Templar varies throughout the long-running Saint series. Sometimes they are adversaries, with Teal striving to put Templar behind bars and stop his "law-bending" crimefighting ways. Templar, in return, baits Teal frequently and in The Holy Terror goes so far as to blackmail Teal (an action that earns Templar a rare rebuke from his girlfriend and partner, Patricia Holm, in the later book, Once More the Saint).[ref]
</ref>
[ref]
</ref>
At other times, Teal and Templar maintain a cordial relationship bordering on friendship. Indeed, in several of the early Saint books (including The Holy Terror), Teal states outright that he would consider Templar a friend if they weren't on the opposite sides of the law.[ref]
</ref> For his part, Templar is shown to always have a fresh stick of chewing gum ready to give to Teal during his frequent visits, though Teal is less appreciative of Templar's habit of poking him in his expansive belly whenever he wants to emphasize a point (or sometimes just for the fun of it, as occurs several times in ''[[The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal]]'').<ref>
</ref>
Despite giving an air of being weary and slow-moving, Teal is a brilliant detective, and one whom Templar occasionally underestimates. He also has demonstrated the ability to exhibit surprising dexterity and speed when the need arises. (In one early story, he braves entering a gas-filled cellar – at grave risk of being gassed to death himself – in order to carry an unconscious Templar to safety, an action he later half-jokingly regrets.[ref]
</ref>) In ''The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal'', Charteris states outright that Teal's weary, sloth-like demeanor is an affectation.<ref>
</ref> In several Saint stories, Teal is shown unexpectedly noticing a detail or uncovering a clue that more often than not hinders Templar's quest for "[[boodle]]" (loot), as in, for example, the story "The Unusual Ending" in ''The Brighter Buccaneer''.<ref>
</ref>
Teal, however, is also shown acknowledging Templar's crimefighting and deduction abilities on numerous occasions. Although an attempt to make Templar an agent of Scotland Yard meets with failure (as seen in the novel She Was a Lady[ref]
</ref>), Teal is often seen turning to Templar for advice and, occasionally, "off-book" assistance on a case. Templar, in return, willingly allows Teal to receive the credit (and, sometimes, the blame) when a case is resolved, though he is quick to berate Teal whenever he feels Teal is treating him unfairly and with undue suspicion.
Teal disappears from the book series for a time after the 1939 short story collection The Happy Highwayman, as the Saint entered into a series of books set in America during World War II, reappearing after the war.
In "The Talented Husband" (a short story in the 1956 collection The Saint Around the World) the Saint returns to the UK and indulges in one final round of 'Teal-baiting' before the Chief Inspector retires.[ref]
</ref> Teal is persuaded out of retirement in ''Le Saint contre les Cagoules Grises'' (one of the many French-language Saint novels published in the late 1950s-1960s and based upon one of the American [[comic strip]]s) to help the Saint battle the Grey Hoods. Teal later returned in the 1975 collection ''[[Catch the Saint]]'', which featured two novellas set prior to the Second World War.<ref>
</ref> 
Teal was considered a major character by Charteris, so much so that he named a 1934 volume The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal. (Later editions of 1933's Once More the Saint were also retitled The Saint and Mr. Teal.)

CATEGORIES: 1974 births, American Jeet Kune Do practitioners, American kickboxers, American Muay Thai practitioners, American practitioners of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Kickboxers from Massachusetts, Living people, Muay Thai trainers, Mixed martial arts trainers, People from Boston, Massachusetts

Mark DellaGrotte (born November 14, 1974) is an American former professional Muay Thai kickboxer and a trainer in Muay Thai. He is the owner and operator of the Sityodtong USA Branch in Somerville, Massachusetts, and was certified and appointed by Master Yodtong to be recognized as an international conservator of Thai style boxing. Mark also has extensive training and is certified in the arts of Kali Escrima, Pencak Silat, Jeet Kune Do, Savate, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
DellaGrotte, known for his Boston accent,Sherdog is a featured kickboxing trainer in Spike TV's "The Ultimate Fighter 4." He also has trained mixed martial arts fighters like Kenny Florian, Frank Mir, Stephan Bonnar, Marcus Davis, Alex Karalexis, Jorge Rivera and Patrick Côté .
DellaGrotte is the owner and operator of the Sityodtong USA Branch. He began his martial arts studies at an early age. His initial training involved classical martial arts, such as Tae Kwon Do, Shotokan and Tai-Chi. As his athleticism and martial skills grew, so did his desire to further his training in the martial arts.
In 1992, his quest for a more combative martial art was complete when he met Guro Guy Chase, who had studied with some of the greatest martial artists of his time. Guro Chase had trained with Dan Inosanto, Ben Lagusa, Herman Suwanda, Ted Lucay, Salam Allsi, Surachai Sirisute and even Karl Gotch.
At that point, Mark devoted himself entirely to the martial arts. Through this training he became certified in the arts of Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do, Indonesian Pencak Silat, Boxe Francaise Savate, Filipino Kali-Excrima, Submission wrestling and Muay Thai Kickboxing.
DellaGrotte was first introduced to Muay Thai in 1997 when he was taken by a friend to the famed Yodtong boxing camp in Pattaya where he lived and trained. After proving his worth as a student and a fighter he was looked favorably upon by Kru Yodtong himself, a famous Muay Thai instructor who also takes in troubled youths. After eight years Kru Yodtong, as he’s known professionally, designated DellaGrotte as his representative in the United States to teach and preserve the art. In honor of his mentor, DellaGrotte named his gym Sityodtong, which means, “Student of Yodtong.”http://www.intothesharktank.com/pdf/Sityodtong.pdf
Since he had taught martial arts prior to his fight career, he decided to step into the ring only to become a better trainer and teacher. So, he traveled throughout Thailand learning different styles of Muay Thai such as Mae Mai Muay Thai, Kun Khmer, Muay Boran, Muay Lao, and also Burmese Boxing.
Contrary to general belief he has, by his own admission, less than 10 fights under his belt, most of which were held in Thailand. He says he has a winning record but admits a few losses and a draw too.
Master Yodtong Senanan appointed Mark to teach, conserve and promote Thai style boxing worldwide. He is one of two of Kru Yodtong's US representatives and is honored to be an international conservator of Thai style boxing.
Mark portrays himself as a striking coach to fictional character Scott Voss (played by Kevin James) in the 2012 sports comedy film Here Comes the Boom.

[[Myrmecodia]]
CATEGORIES: Rubiaceae, Myrmecophytes, Epiphytes

Myrmecodia is a genus of epiphytic myrmecophytes (ant plants) native to Southeast Asia and large islands extending south to Queensland in Australia. Myrmecodia plants grow in tree branches and on trunks. In nature, Myrmecodia tubers often grow hanging downward on bare branches without significant amounts of substrate, and thus depend upon symbiosis for most nutriment. The plants store food and water in a greyish brown caudex that swells and grows spines over time.  The thick, unbranched stems are covered in clypeoli and alveoli which also grow spines and are densely filled with dry bracts.
From the alveoli emerge small white flowers which can self-pollinate to yield a bright orange, fleshy berry filled with up to six small seeds. Seed dispersal is by birds, that often deposit droppings on the branches and trunks of trees they land on. In this they resemble various parasitic plants such as the mistletoes in families such as Loranthaceae, Santalaceae, and Misodendraceae, but Myrmecodia species are unrelated to the true parasites, being in the coffee- and gardenia family Rubiaceae. Nor are they known to be significantly parasitic themselves, in spite of being epiphytes; their well-developed leaves, plus their adaptations to mutualism with ants, suggest that they use the plants on which they grow mainly for support and to escape from deep shade on the forest floor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
They form a symbiotic relationship with antsWilson, Edward O., The Insect Societies,  Publisher: Belknap Press 1971, ISBN 978-0-674-45490-3 and fungi[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]. Ant plants provide habitats for ant colonies high up into the forest canopy, protecting them from the elements and also predators because of the spines. Hollow, smooth-walled tunnels form within the caudex with external entrance holes, providing an above-ground home for ant colonies. Ants likewise provide defense for the plant and prevent tissue damage. Ant colonies also provide nutrients to the plants by leaving wastes within the tunnels inside the caudex. Special glands lining the tunnels then absorb nutriment for the plant. This symbiosis allows the plants to effectively gather nutrients (via the ants) from a much larger area than the roots ever could cover.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Native people in Vietnam and Papua New Guinea have been using it for generations to treat many ailments.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Myrmecodia is derived from Greek myrmekodes meaning "ant-like" or "full of ants". It is one of five ant-plant genera in the family Rubiaceae, the others being Anthorrhiza, Hydnophytum, Myrmephytum, and Squamellaria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.botanicgardens.ie/herb/research/hydnophytum.htm|title=A revision of the ant-plant genus Hydnophytum (Rubiaceae)|last=Jebb M, Huxley C|date=8 February 2009 |work=National Botanic Gardens Glasnevin website|publisher=National Botanic Gardens Glasnevin |accessdate=19 December 2009|location=Dublin, Ireland[/tpl]

[[Scandinavian flick]]
CATEGORIES: Driving techniques

The Scandinavian flick, Finnish flick, Manji Drifting, or Pendulum turn, is a technique used in rallying. While approaching the turn, the driver applies a slight steering input to the opposite direction of the turn, then steering into the turn, while sharply lifting off the throttle and (in some cases, depending on speed and type of layout) lightly applying the brakes. This will cause the car to slide sideways facing slightly away from the turn. Then steering input is applied towards the turn and as the driver releases the brake pedal while still holding down the throttle the car will slingshot itself around the corner to the desired direction. Of course, countersteering will again be required to control the induced oversteer. A recent research paper initiates a mathematical analysis of this technique.Efstathios Velenis, Panagiotis Tsiotras and Jianbo Lu, "Modeling Aggressive Maneuvers on Loose Surfaces: The Cases of Trail-Braking and Pendulum-Turn," European Control Conference, Kos, Greece, July 2-5, 2007
This technique is used to help the driver get around corners that have an increasing radius, but it is also used as a show off as the result of the flick involves the car oversteering heavily.

CATEGORIES: Kings of Munster, 742 deaths, High Kings of Ireland, 8th-century Irish monarchs, Irish chieftains, Year of birth unknown

Cathal mac Finguine (died 742) was an Irish King of Munster or Cashel, and effectively High King of Ireland as well.  He belonged to the Eóganacht Glendamnach sept of the dominant Eóganachta kin-group whose members dominated Munster from the 7th century to the 10th. His father, uncle, grandfather, and great-grandfather had also been kings of Cashel, so too were his son and grandson.
Cathal's conflict with the Uí Néill kings, Fergal mac Máele Dúin, Flaithbertach mac Loingsig, and Áed Allán, son of Fergal mac Máele Dúin, is reported at some length in the Irish annals, and again northern and southern versions provide differing accounts. Cathal also appears as a character, not always portrayed sympathetically as in Aislinge Meic Con Glinne where he is possessed by a demon of gluttony, in a number of prose and verse tales in the Middle Irish language.
Widely regarded as the most powerful Irish king of the first half of the 8th century, and the strongest (historical) king from Munster before Brian Bóruma,Mac Shamhráin 2005 Cathal mac Finguine is believed to be the last king mentioned in the Baile Chuinn Chétchathaig.Mac Shamhráin and Byrne 2005, pp. 210–12 The most expansionist historical Eóganacht king before him was Faílbe Flann mac Áedo Duib (d. 639).

[[Sofia Central Station]]
CATEGORIES: Railway stations in Sofia, Railway stations opened in 1888

The Central Railway Station Sofia ([tpl]lang-bg|Централна железопътна гара София[/tpl], Tsentralna zhelezopatna gara Sofiya) is the main passenger railway station of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, as well as the largest railway station of the country. It is located 1 km north of the city centre after Lavov most, on Marie Louise Boulevard in the immediate proximity of the Central Bus Station Sofia.
The original building of the Sofia Railway Station was opened on 1 August 1888 to serve the Tsaribrod-Sofia-Vakarel line, the first line of the Bulgarian State Railways entirely built by Bulgarian engineers. The building was designed by the architects Antonín Kolář, Václav Prošek and Marinov, and built with the participation of Italian specialists under Bulgarian undertaker Ivan Grozev between 1882 and 1888. It was a one-storey building, 96 m long and 12 m wide, featuring a small clock tower looking towards Vitosha on the façade and a second storey in the western and eastern part. The first station master was Yosif Karapirov. The Sofia Railway Station was renovated and expanded several times. When the Poduyane Railway Station was constructed in 1948, the Sofia Railway Station was renamed the Central Railway Station.
The old building was completely demolished on 15 April 1974, as the construction of a new Brutalist Central Railway Station had begun in 1971. The station was opened on 6 September 1974, having been designed by the Transproekt company under lead architect Milko Bechev. It has two underground and three overground storeys and 365 premises and was built of mainly white marble.
Between January and July 2004 the Central Railway Station in Sofia had served 2,323,844 passengers, or 11.8% of all in the country's railway network for that period. An average 10,910 people pass through the station daily, as well as an average 166 trains (84 arriving and 82 departing). The station has 30 ticket offices and 5 electronic timetable displays.

The Battle of Huế during 1968 (also called the Siege of Huế), was one of the bloodiest and longest battles of the Vietnam War (1959–1975). Battalions of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), two U.S. Army battalions, and three understrength U.S. Marine Corps battalions defeated 10 battalions of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN or NVA) and the Viet Cong (Việt Cộng or VC, also known as National Liberation Front or NLF).
With the beginning of the Tet Offensive on January 30, 1968, the Vietnamese lunar New Year (Vietnamese: Tết Nguyên Đán) large conventional American forces had been committed to combat upon Vietnamese soil for almost three years. Passing through the city of Huế, Highway One was an important supply line for ARVN, US and allied forces from the coastal city of Đà Nẵng to the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). It also provided access to the Perfume River (Vietnamese: Sông Hương or Hương Giang) at the point the river ran through Huế, dividing the city into northern and southern areas. Huế was also a base for United States Navy supply boats. Considering its logistical value and its proximity to the DMZ (only [tpl]convert|50|km[/tpl]), Huế should have been well-defended, fortified, and prepared for any communist attack.
However, the city had few fortifications and was poorly defended. The South Vietnamese and U.S. forces were completely unprepared when the North Vietnamese army and Viet Cong failed to observe the promised Tet Truce. Instead, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army launched a massive assault throughout South Vietnam, attacking hundreds of military targets and population centers across the country, among them the city of Huế.
The North Vietnamese forces rapidly occupied most of the city. Over the next month they were gradually driven out during intense house-to-house fighting led by the Marines. In the end, although the Allies declared a military victory, the city of Huế was virtually destroyed and more than 5000 civilians were killed (2,800 of them executed by the PAVN and Viet Cong according to the South Vietnamese government). The North Vietnamese forces lost an estimated 1,042 to 5,000 killed, while Allied forces lost 668 dead and 3,707 wounded. The tremendous losses negatively affected the American public's perception of the war and political support for the war began to wane.

The copper is bound in several sites; Type 1, Type 2, and/or Type 3. The ensemble of types 2 and 3 copper is called a trinuclear cluster (see figure).  Type 1 copper is available to action of solvents, such as water. It can be displaced by mercury, substituted by cobalt or removed via a copper complexone. Removal of type 1 copper causes a decrease in laccase activity. Cyanide can remove all copper from the enzyme however re-embedding with type 1 and type 2 copper has been shown to be impossible. Type 3 copper however can be embed back into the enzyme. Laccases act on phenols and similar molecules, performing a one-electron oxidations, which remain poorly defined.  It is proposed that laccases play a role in the formation of lignin by promoting the oxidative coupling of monolignols, a family of naturally occurring phenols.Edward I. Solomon, Uma M. Sundaram, Timothy E. Machonkin "Multicopper Oxidases and Oxygenases" Chemical Reviews, 1996, Volume 96, pp. 2563-2606.  Laccases can be polymeric, and the enzymatically active form can be a dimer or trimer.  Other laccases, such as ones produced by the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus, play a role in the degradation of lignin, and can therefore be included in the broad category of ligninases.'''
Because laccase belongs to the oxidase enzyme family it requires oxygen as a second substrate for the enzymatic action.
Spectrophotometry can be used to detect laccases, using the substrates  ABTS, syringaldazine, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Activity can also be monitored with an oxygen sensor, as the oxidation of the substrate is paired with the reduction of oxygen to water. 
Laccase was first studied by Gabriel BertrandGabriel Bertrand on isimabomba.free.fr (French) in 1894Science and civilisation in China: Chemistry and chemical ..., Volume 5, Part 4 By Joseph Needham, Ping-Yü Ho, Gwei-Djen Lu and Nathan Sivin, p. 209
in Chinese lacquer tree sap, where it serves in the formation of lacquer (hence the name "laccase").
Laccase is able to catalyze ring cleavage of aromatic compounds.

Mount Currie is a small community in British Columbia, 164 kilometres north-west of Vancouver and 40 kilometres north-west of Whistler along Highway 99. "The Mount Currie settlement and mountain were named after Scottish settler John Currie, who located to Quebec in 1851. After failure as a gold seeker in California and the Cariboo, Currie turned to ranching and finally settled near Pemberton with his Lillooet Indian wife in 1885."
Mount Currie has a total population of about 2018[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl], and it is the centre of the Mount Currie Indian reserve, with a population of close to 800.Canada 2006 Community Profile - Mount Currie 6 The area is traditional territory of the Lil'wat, a subgroup of the St'at'imc people who with the communities of In-SHUCK-ch to the south comprise the Lower St'at'imc or Lower Lillooet. 
Although it is fairly close to Whistler, the community is not much reliant on the tourist industry. Most tourist industry in Mount Currie comes from outdoor activities in the nearby Joffre Lakes Provincial Park, the Birkenhead River or the Skookumchuck Hot Springs.

"The Third Man Theme" (also known as "The Harry Lime Theme") is an instrumental written and performed by Anton Karas for the soundtrack to the film The Third Man (1949).
Karas was working as a zither player when director Carol Reed, during location scouting for the film, heard him playing in a beer garden. Reed wanted music that wasn't a waltz but would be appropriate to the city of Vienna, in which the film was set, so he asked Karas if he would write and record the film's score. Karas agreed, and he wrote the theme based on a melody in a practice book. The zither had not previously been widely used in English or American music, but the theme became popular with audiences of the film soon after its premiere.
The tune was originally released in the U.K. in 1949, where it was known as 'The "Harry Lime" Theme.'  Following its release in the U.S. in 1950 (see 1950 in music), "The Third Man Theme" spent eleven weeks at number one on Billboard's U.S. Best Sellers in Stores chart, from April 29 to July 8.Song title 199 - Third Man Theme Its success led to a trend in releasing film theme music as singles.
A guitar version by Guy Lombardo also sold strongly. Four other versions charted in the U.S. during 1950."The Third Man Theme". ntl.matrix.com.br. Retrieved August 25, 2006. According to Faber and Faber, the different versions of the theme have collectively sold an estimated forty million copies.

He was able to gain valuable intelligence that he reported to the Carthaginian commander, Ad Herbal and to the Carthaginian Senate. He later was forced to run aground by the Roman navy, and his ship was taken  by Roman marines. The Romans took his ship design and used it to construct a navy as capable as the Carthaginians.

CATEGORIES: Blake's 7 spacecraft

Scorpio is a fictional spacecraft featured throughout the fourth season of the British science fiction television series Blake's 7. It is a freighter, noted by Tarrant as an early Mk IV "Wanderer-class" planet-hopper.
Scorpio was owned by an alleged salvage operator named Dorian, who had a base on the planet Xenon. Dorian rescues the crew of the recently destroyed Liberator, who are stranded on the planet Terminal. The former crew of Liberator later kill Dorian in self-defence, occupy the Xenon base and use Scorpio for their own purposes.
Scorpio was docked in an underground silo within the Xenon Base. Unlike Liberator, which was superior in speed and weaponry to the Terran Federation's finest warships, Scorpio was initially disadvantaged in comparison. It is slow, ungainly and has no weaponry until the crew modify the ship to increase its capabilities. In the episode "Power", Avon and Orac complete construction of a teleport system for the ship, similar to that seen on Liberator, which Dorian had begun to create but had failed. In the episode "Star Drive", Scorpio is fitted with a new, experimental engine called the 'photonic drive', developed by Doctor Plaxton, that increases the ship's speed to the equivalent of Time Distort 15 but in real time - without the need for the ship to move into a "time-distorted" dimension - making Scorpio faster than the Liberator had been. The photonic drive is powered by light rather than plasma.
In the final episode of the series, Scorpio is shot down en route to the planet Gauda Prime where it crash-lands. The crew escapes by teleporting, apart from Tarrant who is injured but survives the crash.
Scorpio's' interior was designed by Roger Cann. The set made use of some panels that had previously adorned the set of the Heart of Gold in the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy TV series. The exterior model was designed by Jim Francis.

[[Thomas S. Smith]]
CATEGORIES: 1921 births, 2004 deaths, Presidents of Lawrence University, Ohio University faculty, Kenyon College alumni, Ohio State University alumni

Thomas S. Smith (1921–2004) served as the 13th president of Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, USA, from 1969 to 1979.
Smith came to Lawrence from Ohio University, where he had spent two years as provost, assuming the president’s office on July 1, 1969. He presided over the college until his retirement on August 31, 1979.
He led the college during one of the more difficult periods in its recent history. Student unrest over Vietnam and civil rights activism, as well as pressure from the student body for more of a voice in matters of academic and student life required delicate but decisive leadership. When Smith arrived on campus in 1969, his first faculty meeting was disrupted by students protesting U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.
During the 1970s, the college, along with American higher education in general, faced an extended period of fiscal austerity, necessitating difficult decisions and the retrenchment of faculty, staff, and administration.
Among the milestones of his presidency were the completion of a major capital campaign; the opening of the Seeley G. Mudd Library in 1975; the strengthening of the university endowment; an extensive administrative reorganization involving academic affairs, admissions, development and student life; improvements in the curriculum and the renovations of Sage and Ormsby Halls.
"Tom was a quiet and unassuming man, yet forceful and straightforward in his dealings and interactions with others," recalled Richard Warch, who succeeded Smith as Lawrence president in 1979. "I had the privilege of serving with him for the last two years of his tenure (as vice president of academic affairs) and counted him a friend and mentor and admired him as a man of principle and honor."
In 1972, President Richard Nixon appointed Smith to the President's Committee on the National Medal of Science, the selection committee for the prestigious awards for distinguished contributions in physical, biological, mathematics, or engineering sciences. The following year, Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey appointed Smith chairman of the newly created State Ethics Board, a position he still held when he left Lawrence.
Smith also served on the boards of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and Independent College Funds of America, Inc.
After leaving Lawrence, Smith served as executive director of the Lakeshore Consortium in Support of the Arts, an organization promoting increased awareness of, participation in, and contributions to an enhanced environment for arts activities in the Fox River Valley. He maintained a commitment to liberal education in retirement remaining active with the Waupaca-based Winchester Academy, encouraging it to foster its historic focus on the liberal arts and sciences and music.
Born February 8, 1921, Smith was one of 10 children—five of whom survived infancy—born to a Hubbard, Ohio steelworker and his wife. He attended Kenyon College on a full tuition scholarship and graduated magna cum laude in 1947, earning a bachelor of arts degree in physics. He earned a Ph.D. in physics at Ohio State University in 1952.
Later that same year, Smith began his academic career as an assistant professor of physics at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. In 1961, he was appointed an assistant to the president of Ohio University. From 1962 to 1967, he served as vice president for academic affairs and was named provost in 1967.

Carlo de' Medici (March 19, 1595 – June 17, 1666) was the son of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Christina of Lorraine. Born in Florence, he had a successful career in the Church, rising to become Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Dean of the College of Cardinals.
De' Medici was raised to the cardinalate by Pope Paul V in the consistory of December 2. 1615, and was made Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica. He was an elector at the papal conclaves of 1621 and 1623 that elected Pope Gregory XV and Pope Urban VIII. He transferred deaconries to that of San Nicola in Carcere in 1623, and was the Cardinal protodeacon at the conclave of 1644 that elected Pope Innocent X. He was briefly Cardinal Deacon of Sant'Eustachio, before being raised to the order of Cardinal Priests in December 1644, with the title of San Sisto.
The next year, de' Medici was raised to Cardinal Bishop of Sabina, but opted for the suburbicarian see of Frascati seven months later. On April 29, 1652, he was made Cardinal Bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina and Vice-Dean of the College of Cardinals. On September 23 of the same year, he became Dean of the College of Cardinals and Cardinal Bishop of Ostia e Velletri. He presided over the conclave of 1655 and announced the papal election of Pope Alexander VII.Salvador Miranda (1998-2005), The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church: Consistory of December 2, 1615, accessed August 24, 2006
Carlo de' Medici died in Florence in 1666. He is buried at his family crypt at the Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze.

[[Shifting baseline]]

CATEGORIES: Evaluation, Biostatistics, Fisheries science, Environmental terminology

A shifting baseline (also known as sliding baseline) is a type of change to how a system is measured, usually against previous reference points (baselines), which themselves may represent significant changes from an even earlier state of the system.  
A conceptual metaphor for a shifting baseline is the price of coffee. A cup of coffee may have only cost a $0.05 in the 1950s, but in the 1980s the cost shifted to $1.00 (ignoring inflation). The current (21st century) coffee prices are based on the 1980s model, rather than the 1950s model. The point of reference moved.
The concept arose in landscape architect Ian McHarg's famous manifesto "Design With Nature"[tpl]cite book|last=McHarg|first=Ian|title=Design With Nature|date=1969|publisher=The Natural History Press|pages=67-70[/tpl] in which the landscape as we know it is compared to that which ancient men once lived on. The concept was then considered by the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly in his paper "Anecdotes and the shifting baseline syndrome of fisheries".Pauly (1995) Pauly developed the concept in reference to fisheries management where fisheries scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct "baseline" population size (e.g. how abundant a fish species population was before human exploitation) and thus work with a shifted baseline. He describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline, rather than the fishery in its untouched state. Areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago, may have experienced long term decline, but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations. In this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were, and are, masked. There is a loss of perception of change that occurs when each generation redefines what is "natural". 
Most modern fisheries stock assessments do not ignore historical fishing and account for it by either including the historical catch or use other techniques to reconstruct the depletion level of the population at the start of the period for which adequate data is available. Anecdotes about historical populations levels can be highly unreliable and result in severe mismanagement of the fishery.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
The concept was further refined and applied to the ecology of kelp forests by Paul Dayton and others from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. They used a slightly different version of the term in their paper, "Sliding baselines, ghosts, and reduced expectations in kelp forest communities".Dayton (1998) Both terms refer to a shift over time in the expectation of what a healthy ecosystem baseline looks like.

[[Canby Ferry]]
CATEGORIES: Ferries of Oregon, Transportation in Clackamas County, Oregon, Canby, Oregon, Crossings of the Willamette River, 1914 establishments in Oregon

The Canby Ferry (formally the M.J. Lee II) is a ferry in the U.S. state of Oregon that connects Canby, and Wilsonville/Stafford in Clackamas County across the Willamette River. The service has been in operation since 1914, except from 1946 to 1953.[tpl]cite news|last=Runquist|first=Justin|title=Canby Ferry restarts trips this morning |page=B3|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=July 19, 2013|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty/index.ssf/2013/07/canby_ferry_to_begin_operating.html |accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl]  The specific vessel used has been replaced and updated several times, most recently in 1997. It is one of three remaining ferries on the Willamette River. 
The ferry has room for six cars (or 75 tons) and a total passenger capacity of 49. A toll is charged for all crossings. As of 2013, a passenger car costs $4.00, a motorcycle, bicycle, or pedestrian $2.00, and $24.00 is charged if a vehicle takes up the entire ferry.  The ferry, the M.J. Lee II, is a cable ferry powered by electricity provided by overhead lines and is guided across the river by an underwater cable [tpl]convert|1.25|in[/tpl] in diameter, leaving the vessel relatively unaffected by the river's currents.
The ferry is required by the Navigation Rules to display a day shape and, at night, certain lights that communicate to other vessels its (right-of-way) rights on navigable waters.US Dept of Transportation, United States Coast Guard "Navigation Rules, International-Inland", COMDTINST M16672.2D, Paradise Cay Publications, Arcata, California  ISBN 0-939837-49-8
Because the ferry is guided by an underwater cable, and is fed electricity from an overhead cable, its ability to maneuver is restricted.  Such vessels must display the day shape for restricted maneuverability which is a ball, diamond, and ball displayed vertically in the rigging.  As the Canby Ferry is permanently with restricted maneuverability, the shipbuilders mounted a metal ball-diamond-ball on a mast.  Before sunrise and after sunset, and during periods of restricted visibility, the ferry must display the red over white over red array of a vessel restricted in ability to maneuver.
The ferry is named after Millard Jerome Lee, the first child born in Canby. Lee was born in 1872, two years after the town was platted in 1870.[ref]
</ref>  The vessel currently in use, ''M.J. Lee II'', has been providing the service since 1997.<ref name='"restarts"'/> 
In 2013, operation of the ferry was suspended from January to July, to allow major maintenance work to be carried out.  The work included retrofitting the vessel with a new propulsion equipment that is quieter and more energy-efficient – using less electricity – than previously.

[[Sky Londa, California]]

CATEGORIES: Unincorporated communities in California, Unincorporated communities in San Mateo County, California

Sky Londa is an unincorporated community mountain community in San Mateo County, California located at the intersection of State Route 84 (Woodside Road) and State Route 35 (Skyline Boulevard). The community is inside area code 650 and ZIP code 94062.
Atop the coastal range west of Woodside, the community's official elevation is 1,520 feet (463 m) above mean sea level (AMSL).[tpl]GR|3[/tpl]
While Sky Londa is the spelling approved by the U.S. Board of Geographic Names, a frequently used state government variant spelling is Skylonda. The variant spelling is used on a Caltrans sign for southbound SR35 north of SR84 and on the name of a CDF Fire station in the community. This variant name is also shown as a variant in the National Geographic Names Database. The 1994 USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle, Woodside, California shows it spelled Sky Londa.http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/usgsmaps/usgsmaps.html#7.5-minute Maps recorded as early as 1909 show it as Sky L'onda apparently derived from the crossroad names Skyline Boulevard and Woodside-La Honda Road.
The 7.5-minute quadrangle, Woodside, California, (1994), shows Woodside VOR north of the settlement. The aircraft navigation facility is shown as being outfitted with distance measuring equipment. It lies one mile (1.6 km) at 285 degrees off true north from the intersection of SR35 and SR84. Its identifier is "OSI" and publicly available FAA documents show the VOR signal is on 113.9 MHz.
Many of the area's characteristic redwood-log homes were first built in the early 1930s by a developer who subdivided a few tracts and established a water supply and reservoirs dedicated to the new community. The redwood "logs" came from unused railroad-tie stock sawn by a mill located at the intersection until the Depression. The local water is still pumped from wells and La Honda Creek, and delivered to 154 homes by the Sky L'onda Mutual Water Company.
There are a few commercial establishments at the intersection of SR35 and SR84, including two service stations, a convenience store, a real estate office, a small events center, and one restaurant. The restaurant is called Alice's Restaurant, but it is not the one mentioned in Arlo Guthrie's famous song.
The area is a popular destination for motorcycle and bicycle riders, especially during spring and summer weekends.

The first Bideford railway station was opened on 2 November 1855 as the terminus of the Bideford Extension Railway from Barnstaple. This was taken over by the London and South Western Railway about ten years later.
This station was resited in 1872 when the line was extended to Torrington.
Regular passenger trains from Barnstaple were withdrawn on Sat. 2 October 1965 although special trains occasionally used the station until the line was closed in 1982. After closure a railway preservation society was formed to reopen the station and part of the line. They laid over 200 yards of track in the station and collected some rolling stock and a small diesel locomotive. A train service was operated but they were then forced to close temporarily due to vandalism and a threat to build houses on the trackbed. The site is open to the public and is currently being prepared for service again. See Bideford Railway Heritage Centre.
The station buildings are privately owned and are currently empty awaiting a new use.
Recently, the station was included on the ATOC Connecting Communities report, that recommends closed lines and stations that should have a railway station. The report suggests the reopening of the Barnstaple - Bideford railway line.

Buckton Castle is a medieval ringwork near Carrbrook, Stalybridge, England. It is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument due to its proximity to the Buckton Vale Quarry. The castle is oval, with a stone curtain wall [tpl]convert|3|m|ft|0[/tpl] wide, surrounded by a ditch [tpl]convert|10|m|ft[/tpl] wide and [tpl]convert|6|m|ft[/tpl] deep. Buckton Castle was probably constructed for William de Neville in the late 12th century; it was lying derelict by 1360. The small number of finds retrieved during archaeological investigation of the site indicates that Buckton Castle may not have been completed.
In the 16th century, the site was used as a beacon for the Pilgrimage of Grace. During the 18th century, the castle was of interest to treasure hunters following rumours of the presence of buried treasure. It was used as an anti-aircraft decoy site in the Second World War. The castle is overgrown with heather and peat, and there are no above-ground ruins. Since 1996, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit has been involved in excavations to maintain the site and reveal more information on its origins and purpose.

Shapsugs (Adyghe: шапсыгъ [tpl]IPA-ady|ʃaːpsəʁ|[/tpl], Russian: шапсуги, Arabic: الشابسوغ) are a Circassian tribe of the Adyghe branch, who are currently living in the Tuapsinsky District (Tuapse) of Krasnodar Krai, Lazarevsky City District of Sochi, and in the Republic of Adygea, all in Russia. These areas are a small part of historical Circassia, in addition to diaspora (Amman, Naour, Marj Al-hamam, Wadi Al Seer) Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Israel (Kfar Kama), Syria, Europe, United States of America. The first Circassians to settle in Amman were from the Shapsug tribe and as a result the Shapsugs neighbourhood considered the oldest neighbourhood in the Capital Amman and was the down town of it,http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/en/gam/about.asp Official Website of Amman however later other Circassians from the Kabardian, Abadzekh and Bzadoug tribes also came to Amman. 
The Shapsugs speak a dialect of the Adyghe language.http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/archivage/languages/Shapsug.htm Shapsug Dialect (French Language) According to some indirect data, there were over four thousand Shapsugs in Russia in 1926, but the Shapsug people were not enumerated as a separate group in Russian Censuses until 2002, when the population was recorded at 3,231. however; the Shapsugs who live in the Republic of Adyghea (mainly in District of Takhtamukaysky and District of Teuchezksky) were enumerated as an Adyghe instead of Shapsug, because the Adyghe/Circassians nation considered the Umbrella for all Adyghe Tribes.
In District of Takhtamukaysky a reservoir which was built in 1952 was named on the Shapsug tribe ([tpl]lang-ru|Шапсугское водохранилище[/tpl]) since the area was inhabited by the Shapsug tribe for thousands of years, and considered part of historical Shapsugia which was part of historical Circassia.   
Shapsugs are primarily Sunni Muslims.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0617FE385B137B93C3AB178DD85F438784F9&scp=21&sq=circassia%20caucasus&st=cse via New York Times
The Shapsugs used to make up one of the biggest groups of the Black Sea Adyghe (причерноморские адыги; today's Adyghe people). They inhabited the region between the Dzhubga (in [tpl]lang-ady|Жьыбгъэ[/tpl] means "Winds" or "The Valley of Winds") River and Shakhe Rivers (the so-called Maly Shapsug, or Little Shapsug) and high-altitude mountainous areas of the northern slopes of the Caucasus Range along the Antkhir, Abin, Afips, Bakan, Ships and other rivers (Bolshoy Shapsug, or Greater Shapsug).

Joseph Francis Shea (September 5, 1925 – February 14, 1999) was an American aerospace engineer and NASA manager. Born in the New York City borough of the Bronx, he was educated at the University of Michigan, receiving a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics in 1955. After working for Bell Labs on the radio inertial guidance system of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile, he was hired by NASA in 1961. As Deputy Director of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, and later as head of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, Shea played a key role in shaping the course of the Apollo program, helping to lead NASA to the decision in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous and supporting "all up" testing of the Saturn V rocket. While sometimes causing controversy within the agency, Shea was remembered by his former colleague George Mueller as "one of the greatest systems engineers of our time".Mueller, "Joseph F. Shea," in Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 10, p. 211.
Deeply involved in the investigation of the 1967 Apollo 1 fire, Shea suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of the stress that he suffered. He was removed from his position and left NASA shortly afterwards. From 1968 until 1990 he worked as a senior manager at Raytheon in Lexington, Massachusetts, and thereafter became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. While Shea served as a consultant for NASA on the redesign of the International Space Station in 1993, he was forced to resign from the position due to health issues.

CATEGORIES: Radio stations in Charlottetown, Country radio stations in Canada, Maritime Broadcasting System radio stations

CFCY-FM is a country music radio station in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, broadcasting at 95.1 FM. The station is owned by the Maritime Broadcasting System. It was first launched by radio pioneer Keith Rogers on August 15, 1924 as 10AS on 250 meters. In 1925, the station was granted a full license as CFCY, broadcasting at 960 kHz. It is the Maritimes' oldest radio station.  In 1931, it moved to 580 kHz, and then to 630 in 1933.
Known as "The Friendly Voice of the Maritime", the location in the centre of the Gulf of St. Lawrence allowed CFCY's 5,000-watt daytime signal to reach portions of Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec and New England as well as most of the Maritimes. 
Rogers wanted to expand into television, but died in 1954.  His company, Island Broadcasting, passed to his widow Flora, daughter Betty Rogers Large and son-in-law Bob Large.  They fulfilled his dream of bringing television to the Island when CFCY-TV launched on July 1, 1956.
The CFCY stations were both CBC affiliates.  However, in 1969, CFCY-TV was sold directly to the CBC as CBCT.  The radio station remained a CBC affiliate until 1977, when the CBC opened CBCT-FM in Charlottetown.  Island Broadcasting was renamed Eastern Broadcasting.  The Rogerses sold the station to Maritime Broadcasting in 1986, earning a handsome return on their original investment of 62 years earlier.
The station has deep roots in traditional country music, bringing "Don Messer and His Islanders" to national recognition through the 1940s and 1950s. National broadcasts over the CBC network from CFCY lead to the Messer group gaining stature as the "most popular group in Canada during the mid-20th century", eventually helping the group make the successful jump from radio to television. The station's varied mix of music saw little competition until the arrival of FM radio which led to rebranding in a country music format since 1996.
Loman McAulay was one of many who had lengthy careers with the station, from the 1940s until his death in 1987.  Betty Rogers Large spent over 60 years at the station in various capacities--one of the longest careers in Canadian broadcasting history.  She first appeared on-air in 1925 at age 12. Her history of broadcasting on PEI, "Out of Thin Air", was published in 1989.
On March 24, 2006, approval was given for CFCY to switch over to the FM band.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2006-89 In September, CFCY made its switch to FM with permission to simulcast the new station on the old 630 AM signal for 90 days and cease operation of the AM signal afterwards.
In December 2006, the audio feed for CFCY-AM on 630 kHz ceased.  However, an open carrier remained on the air on 630 kHz which had some wondering if it was CFCY-AM or a pirate taking over the frequency. No link was established between this open carrier on 630 kHz and the mysterious "tone" stations widely heard throughout North America on the MW broadcast band in late November 2006. In January 2007 it was realized that the CFCY AM transmitter simply had not been turned off.

The Samsung MM-A920 is a thin, fully loaded multimedia flip phone. Features include:
Other technical data include:
The MM-A920 was introduced in late 2005 around the same time as the MM-A900 (which was Samsung's first attempt to compete with the Motorola RAZR), and was fairly well received by critics upon its release. At that time, Sprint reps were recommending the A920 over the A900, due to a variety of glitches experienced by early A900 users. While the phone has bluetooth connectivity, many users have complained that it is crippled, allowing only certain types of devices to be used, and is unable to 
transfer files.
The Samsung MM-A920 ceased production in 2007.

The Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project was founded by scientist turned filmmaker, Dr. Randy Olson in 2002, with the modus operandi of communicating the gradual declining state of our oceans to a broad audience through the use of comedy/humor and Hollywood Celebrity.  Since its creation, it has produced many environmental media campaigns, most notably a 2003 campaign and public service announcement, titled "The Ocean Symphony PSA", which starred such Hollywood actors/celebrities as Jack Black, Henry Winkler, Tom Arnold, and Madeleine Stowe, among many others.
Their slogan of "Create... Innovate... Communicate"  has taken on a more direct meaning since the August 2006 launch of the Shifting Baselines Flix Contest, a 1-minute short film contest aimed at channeling the youthful, creative energy of such "viral video" internet sites as Youtube and Ifilm.  The contest featured Celebrity Judges, and cash prizes, and succeeded in bringing out an explosion of innovative new ways to communicate the environmental and social messaging associated with ocean awareness and the idea of shifting baselines/lowered standards.

Cerrito is a city in the Ñeembucú Department, Paraguay.
It is located along the Paraná River with two types of beaches: one with shallow depths in which you can basically cross a long stretch of the river and a deep one just within a few meters from the coast. The city has a population of about 1,100.
Its name comes from a little hill (cerrito) from which you can see the beautiful landscape of the city and the river. At the top of the hill lied a statue of former Paraguayan president Alfredo Stroessner which was destroyed by a lightning strike just before he was overthrown out of the presidency in 1989. Some believe this event indicated a "prediction" of the eventual fall of Stroessner. Others say the statue was never hit by lightning, but was actually toppled by the local citizens celebrating Strossener's overthrow. Local residents say the "hit-by-lighting" story was invented out of embarrassment by local politicians because they belonged to the Colorado Party (Paraguay), same as the disgraced dictator.
A lot of Indian tribes inhabit the city, and several pre-Columbine tombs were found in an area that is very hard to reach because of the poor conditions of the dirt roads. The main tourist attraction of this city is the good fishing spots in the river. Fishing guides and camping areas are available. There are also water taxis to take passengers across the river to Argentina.
Cerrito is the birthplace of Paraguay national football team goalkeeper Justo Villar who currently plays for Club Estudiantes de La Plata.

CATEGORIES: 2004 albums, El-P albums, Jazz fusion albums, Albums produced by El-P

High Water is an album by hip hop artist El-P, released on March 9, 2004 through Thirsty Ear Recordings. 
Made in conjunction with jazz pianist Matthew Shipp and the group for which he is artistic director, The Blue Series Continuum, the album is a striking departure from El-P's usual style, almost completely eschewing conventional ideas of hip hop in favour of electronically-tinged jazz fusion compositions, bordering on the avant-garde.
The album was created by the Blue Series Continuum improvising to original compositions by El-P, which he then manipulated and restructured. It enjoyed generally very favourable reviews from both the hip-hop and jazz worlds, as well as from more mainstream critics independent of both scenes. The album is part of an already extensive series of such collaborations (the "Blue Series" of the name) on the part of the jazz group. 
One track, "When the Moon Was Blue", features vocals from El-P's father Harry Meline, also known as Harry Keys, himself a jazz pianist.

CATEGORIES: Neman basin, Rivers of Lithuania

The Širvinta is a river in Lithuania. Stretching for 129 km, it is the longest tributary of the Šventoji River. Its source is in the hinterlands of the Širvintos district. After it passes through the city of Širvintos, where a low head dam has been built, it continues through the Ukmergė district, and borders the Jonava district. It ends when it flows into the Šventoji River between Upninkai and Vepriai.
The Širvinta is distinctive for its rapid flow and winding rocky bed, which is enjoyed by kayak enthusiasts. The Širvinta Landscape Reserve, encompassing the picturesque river banks and escarpments of the Širvinta, was established in 1992 to protect the channel's unique landscape. Some of the loamy scarps near Upninkai reach as high as 40 metres.
The name of the river is probably derived from the Baltic adjective širmas/širvas, meaning brown.

It is on the B767 road between Clarkston and Eaglesham, which are one mile north and south respectively, while Newton Mearns is about two miles to the west and East Kilbride about three miles to the east.
The Glasgow Southern Orbital road (part of the A726) passes just to the south of Waterfoot.
The village lies on the west bank of the White Cart Water, and the original settlement grew up around a farm, mill and smithy. One early record of the village is in Timothy Pont's maps of Scotland (1583 - 1596). 
Waterfoot today is, however, purely residential in character, having expanded in the latter half of the 20th century as a commuter dormitory village. Although Waterfoot is relatively affluent, there are no shops or other services, with residents having to travel to other areas to access amenities. The 2001 census reported that Waterfoot had a population of 1,279.
A small part of Waterfoot on the east side of the White Cart lies in the South Lanarkshire council area.

Kil-Kare Raceway is a motorsports complex located in Xenia Township, Greene County, near Xenia and Dayton, Ohio, USA.  It first opened in 1959 and features two separate tracks: Kil-Kare Speedway, a 3/8 mile (0.6 km) asphalt oval for stock car racing and Kil-Kare Dragway, a 1/4 mile dragstrip.  The oval is unconventional in shape, with the cars almost in a continuous slide between turns one and four.
The facility is affiliated with both the NHRA and NASCAR and holds events in the Whelen All-American Series as well as local events including figure 8 races.  It formerly hosted races in ARCA and USAR Pro Cup Series competition.
The name Kil Kare is believed to be derived from an old resort that once stood on the property currently occupied by the raceway. The Creekside Trail bicycle path, which borders the raceway to the south, was once the Columbus and Xenia Railroad. The railroad carried passenger trains near the turn of the 20th century. The passenger trains stopped at the resort that was named "Kill all your cares". As time progressed, the resort closed and the name Kil-Kare stuck.

[[Galea (helmet)]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman legionary equipment, Warfare of the Ancient era, Ancient Roman helmets

A galea was a Roman soldier's helmet. Some gladiators, myrmillones, also wore a bronze galea with a face mask and a decoration, often a fish on its crest.Kennett, Basil. "Romae antiquae notitia; or, The antiquities of Rome". 1792, p.275 The exact form or design of the helmet varied significantly over time, between differing unit types, and also between individual examples - pre-industrial production was by hand – so it is not certain to what degree there was any standardization even under the Roman Empire.
Originally, Roman helmets were influenced by the neighboring Etruscans, people who utilised the "Nasua" type helmets. The Greeks in the south also influenced Roman design in the early history of Rome. For instance, the ancestor of the Chalcidian helmet, the Attic helmet, was widely used by officers until the end of the empire.Kausel, Cecilia. "Design & Intuition: Structures, Interiors and the Mind". WIT Press, 2012, p.69-70 Lastly, the Gauls were the peoples who most impacted the design of the Roman helmet hence the popular "Imperial Gallic" type helmets. In addition to this, it is commonly thought that the Gauls also introduced chainmail to the Romans.Abdale, Jason. "Four Days in September: The Battle of Teutoburg". Trafford, 2013, p.170
The primary evidence is scattered archaeological finds, which are often damaged or incomplete. There are similarities of form and function between them.

The Singapore Turf Club was founded in 1842 as the Singapore Sporting Club to operate the Serangoon Road Race Course at Farrer Park. 
It is today the only horse-racing club in Singapore and is part of the Malayan Racing Association, which also regulates the three Turf Clubs in Malaysia, the Selangor Turf Club, Penang Turf Club and Perak Turf Club
The Singapore Turf Club is the only authorised operator of horse racing, and totalisator (horse betting) services in Singapore. It is the agent and proprietary club of the Tote Board, Singapore, who manages and directs its donation of surplus funds for charitable purposes.
The first race was held on 23 February 1843 when prize money on offer was only $150. 
In 1924, the Club changed its name to the Singapore Turf Club. This was done to reflect its role as a horse racing club more accurately. 
The Club moved to Bukit Timah in 1933 before relocating to its present location at the Singapore Racecourse at Kranji in 1999. The racecourse is adjacent to Kranji MRT Station.
Racing is staged all-year round on almost every Fridays and Sundays.
Races from Australia, Hong Kong, South Africa and occasionally from UK, France and Japan are also shown live at the Turf Club and off-course betting centres and outlets.  The newest off-course betting centres are at China Square at Telok Ayer Street and at The Majestic in Chinatown.
A feature of the racing calendar is the S$3 million Group 1 Singapore Airlines International Cup (SAIC), which was first held in 2000 in conjunction with the opening of the Singapore Racecourse at Kranji. It is held in May, coupled with its sister sprint race, the S$1 million KrisFlyer International Sprint. Both events are part of the Singapore International Racing Festival (SIRF), which will be attended by some of the world's top owners, jockeys and trainers.YourSingapore.com - Singapore International Racing Festival

"The Diary of Horace Wimp" is the fourth track on the Electric Light Orchestra album Discovery, written by Jeff Lynne.
Released in 1979 as a single, the song is Beatlesque in nature and became a Top Ten hit in the UK and Ireland. The lyrics describe a week in the life of a repressed man who nevertheless overcomes his shy nature with the help of "a voice from above." The day Saturday is omitted – this is because, as explained by Jeff Lynne: "'The football match is played on a Saturday".
Jeff Lynne references Citizen Kane when he says "Horace Wimp" while actually seeing a close-up shot of his lips at the end in its music videoELO - The Diary of Horace Wimp as well just like Orson Welles did with "Rosebud".CITIZEN KANE - Rosebud

Rabbi Dov Berish Weidenfeld (1881–1965) was the Chief Rabbi of Tshebin (Trzebinia), Poland, and after World War II spent his final years in Jerusalem. His principal work of Jewish law is titled "Dovev Meisharim".
Dov Berish was born in Hrimlov, Galicia (now Ukraine) on 5 January 1881 (5 Shvat 5641 in the Jewish calendar) to his father Jacob 'Yekele' Weidenfeld, rabbi of the town and author of the responsa Kochav miYaakov.Biography at Yad vaShem
With Reb Yekele's death shortly before Beirish's Bar Mitzvah, the delicate task of raising a new prodigy fell to his widow - herself renowned for her genius and wit (she wrote a great number of her husband's responsa on dictation) and to her two older sons: Reb Yitzchak, who replaced his late father as Rav of Rimlov, and Reb Nachum, Rav of Dombrovo and author of the Chazon Nachum, and later celebrated as a great posek in his own right.
By age 19 Reb Beirish entered by marriage into the illustrious family of Rav Yisroel Yoseif HaCharif of Tshebin. Since he did not want any rabbinic post, his wife administered a modest coal business, while he continued his single-minded pursuit of Torah study, amassing knowledge of phenomenal breadth and scope. Nonetheless, the avalanche of requests from varied kehillos[tpl]dn|date=January 2013[/tpl] that he lead them as their Rav continued, and his friend, Reb Meir Arik, prayed that his business fail so that Klal Yisrael not be deprived of his leadership. For twenty years, this Tshebiner ba'al habayis (layman) - already renowned as the "Gaon of Tshebin" - was consulted by leading rabbanim with whom he maintained a vigorous correspondence; still he remained deaf to all rabbinical offers. However, due to his love of learning and teaching, he would commute daily to and from Cracow to say shiurim to the local bachurim after business hours.  
He carefully collected copies of these responsa, amassing enough material to publish ten volumes. In 1937 he succeeded in producing the first and only sefer every printed in Tshebin, entitled Doveiv Meishorim - the other nine volumes were never published. 
His noted son-in-law, his successor as rosh yeshiva of Kochav MiYaakov, and a noted gaon and author in his own right, Rabbi Baruch Shimon Schneersohn relates: Upon republishing these responsa some 26 years after they were written, he included the Rav's subsequent handwritten glosses to the first edition. He found not one correction, only additional proofs to those very answers originally written without as much as a Gemara.
The Tshebiner Rav's picture, along with those of the Rebbeim of Ger and Belz, had appeared in the venomous tabloid Der Sturmer, his caption reading: "The world's greatest Talmudist." Realizing that he was a target for elimination, he fled, crossing the Communist border and entering Lvov (Lemberg). Communist authorities were carrying out their systematic erasure of religious life, and the gaon of Tshebin, along with his wife, youngest daughter and thousands of other Jews, were deported to Siberia, arriving in Sverdelovsk, Siberia, in late 1940. 
The Tshebiner Rav arrived on Erev Pesach, 1946, in Jerusalem, which he was to call home for the rest of his life. He was soon recognized as one of the leaders of Chareidi Jewry in the Land of Israel and served as a leading member of the Council of Sages of Agudas Yisroel.
He established the Kochav miYaakov Yeshiva in Jerusalem, first in the Shaarei Chesed neighborhood and  later in a purpose-built building in Tel Arza.
He died on the fourth of Cheshvan, 5726, 70 minutes before Shabbos. He was interred on Har HaMenuchot.

[/ref] Colloquia provides support for a conversational and activity-based model of learning; maintaining information about people, resources, and tasks. Teachers set up activities and sub-activities at different levels of granularity and allocate people, resources and tasks to those activities. Learners may also create and parameterize sub-activities. Personalisation is only possible in a limited sense in that teachers and learners may add resources for an activity or subactivity. Most importantly, however, the new system incorporates a strong element of social networking - individual users constructed activities and invited friends to participate, rather than subscribing to courses or having courses allocated to them. This was implemented in Colloquia using peer-to-peer networking, however the conceptual foundations for this feature lay in earlier educational literature, such as Ivan Illich's concept of learning exchanges and networks.

CATEGORIES: 1813 births, 1856 deaths, Alumni of Lincoln College, Oxford, Bishops of Grahamstown, People educated at Charterhouse School, People from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, 19th-century Anglican bishops

John Armstrong (22 August 1813 – 16 May 1856) was a Church of England clergyman and Bishop of Grahamstown.
He was born at Bishop-Wearmouth, August 22, 1813. he was the second child and eldest son of Dr. Armstrong, a physician of eminence. Dr. Armstrong settled in London about the year 1818. His son John, at eight years old, was sent to a preparatory school at Hanwell, under the care of Dr. Bond. He suffered much during this time from rheumatism, and delicacy of health, and his studies were often interrupted. In the year 1827, when now fourteen years of age, he was sent to the Charterhouse School. He went in the year 1832, when nearly nineteen years of age, to a private tutor, the Rev. Jas. Tweed, of Harlow, Essex, with the view of fitting himself to become a candidate for Lord Crowe's Exhibition at Lincoln College, Oxford. About this time the resolution was formed to devote himself to the ministry. He took a third-class degree in classics in Michaelmas term, 1836. In 1837 he was ordained Deacon, and commenced his ministry as Curate of Alford, in Somersetshire.
Armstrong was consecrated Bishop of Grahamstown at Lambeth Parish Church on St Andrews Day in 1853,[tpl]cite book|author=Charles Gould|title=Grahamstown Cathedral: A Guide and Short History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_vadHwAACAAJ|accessdate=16 September 2013|year=1924|publisher=Grahamstown Diocesan Registry[/tpl] but he did not reach his Diocese of Grahamstown until the following October.
Armstrong, who was a man of delicate health, devoted himself to two prime objects. The first was missions to the heathen, which had been completely neglected by the Church. The Bishop laid the foundations upon which the missionary work of this diocese and St John's has been built. His further object was the successful founding of St. Andrew's College in 1855, whose dedication commemorates the date of his consecration. But the rough travelling and many anxieties of his diocese were too severe for the Bishop's delicate frame, and he died on 16 May 1856, after less than two years in the country.[tpl]cite book|author=Thomas Thellusson Carter|title=A Memoir of John Armstrong, D.D.: Late Lord Bishop of Grahamstown|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mkic9ULgPtMC|accessdate=16 September 2013|year=1857|publisher=John Henry and James Parker[/tpl]

Air Liberté began operations in April 1988 with a leased MD-83. It mainly operated to destinations in European and Mediterranean holiday resorts, however it had some interncontinental routes. A route to Montreal was inaugurated in 1992,[tpl]cite news |title=OAG Desktop Flight Guide: Worldwide Edition |publisher=Official Airline Guides, |date=August 1992 |page=842[/tpl] and Réunion and the Caribbean were also served by the airline. Unsuccessful routes included one from Toulouse to Dakar and London, which were scrapped in a conflict over slot allocations at Orly. 1996 saw a new route to Nice, and in May the route network of Euralair was taken on. Around 1996, the airline had a fleet of 5 Boeing 737-200 airplanes, 8 McDonnell Douglas MD-83 planes and 5 McDonnell Douglas DC-10 planes.
1996 also brought with it financial distress. The airline lost 1 billion FF ($181 million) that year, and in 1997 British Airways acquired 70% of the shareholding. At this time, British Airways brought Air Liberté together with TAT and inaugurated them under one management.

Despite government aid, the airline amounted debts of €120 million and was forced to declare bankruptcy in August 2002. The government then ordered the implementation of a new restructuring plan before the end of the year. Several projects were to be offered or wanted but no result, and the company was liquidated on 17 February 2003. As a result, no other competing international level full-service French airline had appeared, leaving only Air France (now controlled by Air France-KLM) as a de facto monopoly.

[[William S. Pierce]]

CATEGORIES: 1937 births, Living people, American surgeons, Pennsylvania State University faculty

William S. Pierce (born January 12, 1937) is the cardiothoracic surgeon and chemical engineer who led development of the first pneumatic heart assist pump.  The Pierce-Donachy Ventricular Assist Device, also known as the Penn State Assist Pump, was designated an International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1990.
Born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Pierce received his B.S. degree from Lehigh University in chemical engineering in 1958 and subsequently attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine where he obtained an M.D. degree in 1962, together with an Alpha Omega Alpha honor.  He received his surgical training at the University of Pennsylvania and at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
In 1970, Pierce was asked to join the surgical faculty at the new College of Medicine of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State Hershey Medical Center).  He was appointed professor of surgery in 1977 and subsequently served as chief of the Division of Artificial Organs, chief of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, director of surgical research, and associate chair of the Department of Surgery.  He was awarded the Faculty Scholar Medal in 1983 and in 1986 was named Evan Pugh Professor, the University's highest academic honor.
At Penn State, Pierce established an interdisciplinary group to develop mechanical circulatory support devices and the artificial heart.  The original pneumatic heart assist pump, now known as the Thoratec ventricular assist device (Thoratec Pneumatic VAD), has been used in nearly 4,000 patients for right, left, and biventricular support.  His pioneering work led him to be considered around the world as a father of the ventricular assist device.
The group, including Pierce, James Donachy and its current chief, Gerson Rosenberg, went on in partnership with Arrow International of Reading, Pennsylvania, to develop the Arrow Lion Heart, an implantable, permanent, left ventricular heart assist system powered by a wearable, external NiCd battery.  The pump represented the first successful use of a transcutaneous energy transfer system, eliminating any transcutaneous wire, and the first clinical use of a compliance sac, eliminating the need for a transcutaneous vent.  It has been used in over thirty patients to date.
Pierce's artificial-organs group subsequently focused on a completely implantable electromechanical artificial heart consisting of two prosthetic blood pumps actuated by pusher plates driven by a compact DC motor.  This biventricular heart pump, with its microprocessor-based digital control system, transcutaneous energy transfer system, and implanted compliance sac, has been successfully used in numerous calf implant studies.
Pierce received the 2007 Jacobson Innovation Award, given by the American College of Surgeons to "living surgeons who have been innovators of a new development or technique in any field of surgery."  He won "in recognition of his pioneering work in the conception and development of mechanical circulatory support and the total artificial mechanical heart and his contributions to surgical bioengineering and patient care." Pierce has edited three books and published more than 280 articles and 90 book chapters.  He holds nine United States patents.

[[Clearing the neighbourhood]]
CATEGORIES: Planetary science, Planets, Definition of planet, Pluto's planethood, Dynamics of the Solar System, Celestial mechanics

"Clearing the neighbourhood around its orbit" is a criterion for a celestial body to be considered a planet in the Solar System.  This was one of the three criteria adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in its 2006 definition of planet.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/detail/iau0603/| title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes| date=24 August 2006| accessdate = 2009-10-23| publisher=IAU[/tpl]
In the end stages of planet formation, a planet will have "cleared the neighbourhood" of its own orbital zone (see below), meaning it has become gravitationally dominant, and there are no other bodies of comparable size other than its own satellites or those otherwise under its gravitational influence.
A large body which meets the other criteria for a planet but has not cleared its neighbourhood is classified as a dwarf planet. This includes Pluto, which shares its orbital neighbourhood with Kuiper belt objects such as the plutinos. The IAU's definition does not attach specific numbers or equations to this term, but all the planets have cleared their neighbourhoods to a much greater extent than any dwarf planet, or any candidate for dwarf planet.
The phrase may be derived from a paper presented to the general assembly of the IAU in 2000 by Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison. The authors used several similar phrases as they developed a theoretical basis for determining if an object orbiting a star is likely to "clear its neighboring region" of planetesimals, based on the object's mass and its orbital period.[tpl]cite journal | last=Stern | first=S. Alan | coauthors=and Levison, Harold F. | year=2002 | title=Regarding the criteria for planethood and proposed planetary classification schemes | url=http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/PDF/planet_def.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Highlights of Astronomy| volume=12 | pages=205–213, as presented at the XXIVth General Assembly of the IAU–2000 UK, 7–18 August 2000|bibcode = 2002HiA....12..205S [/tpl]
Clearly distinguishing "planets" from "dwarf planets" and other minor planets had become necessary because the IAU had adopted different rules for naming newly discovered major and minor planets, without establishing a basis for telling them apart. The naming process for Eris stalled after the announcement of its discovery in 2005, pending clarification of this first step.

[[Puerto Rican art]]
CATEGORIES: Puerto Rican art, Art by nationality

With the country's ethnically diverse background, Puerto Rican art reflects many infls, an especially beloved form of folk art, evolved from the Spanish church's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity.  Meaning "saints" in Spanish, santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons.  Families continue to pass this centuries-old craft down from generation to generation.  The artisans, called santeros, create santos from native wood, clay, and stone.  After shaping simple effigies, they often finish by painting them in vivid colors.  Santos vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall.  Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven.  As such, they occupied a special place on household altars, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection.  
Also popular, caretas are masks worn during carnivals.  Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes.  The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented.  Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs, true to their historic origins.  While they are usually constructed of papier-mâché, coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well.  Though red and black were originally the typical colors for caretas, their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns.

[[Remote deposit]]

CATEGORIES: Finance, Banking terms

Remote deposit refers to the ability to deposit a check into a bank account from a remote location, such as an office or home, without having to physically deliver the check to the bank. This is typically accomplished by scanning a digital image of a check into a computer, then transmitting that image to the bank, a practice that became legal in the United States in 2004 when the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (or Check 21 Act) took effect. This service is typically used by businesses, though a remote deposit application for consumers has been developedFIS Introduces Consumer Remote Deposit Solution, Bank Systems & Technology, July 24, 2008.  Accessed on July 27, 2008. and has begun to be implemented by a handful of banks.BankFox - Deposit Checks Online With Your Scanner  It should not be confused with:
Check 21
Intended in part to keep the country's financial industries operational in the event of a catastrophe that could make rapid long-distance transportation impossible, like the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Check 21 Act makes the digital image of a check legally acceptable for payment purposes, just like a traditional paper check.
Before 2004, if someone deposited a check from one bank (for example, PNC Bank) into an account at a different bank (for example, Bank of America), the banks would have to physically exchange the paper check before the money would be credited to the account. But under Check 21, one bank can simply send an image of the check to the other bank. The practical effect of the law is that checks can still be deposited and cleared, even if a disaster makes it impossible for banks to exchange the physical paper checks with each other.

Anji county is well known for its bamboo, containing as it does 60,000 hectares of bamboo groves, with over 40 different species of bamboo. It has been designated a pilot county for ecological and green building construction.
Anji is 65 kilometers from Hangzhou. During the 1990s, it took more than two hours to travel to Hangzhou by bus. Poor transportation isolated Anji from the rest of Zhejiang Province, and for many years its economy remained underdeveloped. From 1997 to 2000, highways were built to Hangzhou and Huzhou, and from 2000 to 2002, highways connecting to National Highway G318 were constructed. The provincial highways within its boundary were also widened. Now the highway system traversing the entire boundary has been completed, and it takes less than three hours to reach Shanghai, Nanjing or Suzhou, and less than one hour to get to Hangzhou and Huzhou. Some of Anji's residents have attempted to take the sustainable development road by developing ecology-friendly agriculture, industry and tourism, and building an ecology-friendly city.
Tianhuangping Pumped Storage Power Station is located there.

CATEGORIES: Wet'suwet'en

Babine Portage, British Columbia (population ~13) is a locality in located about 12 km north of the Portage Yekooche First Nation Reserve along a gravel road, on the west end of Babine Lake, in Central British Columbia, part of traditional Babine territory. Its elevation is 782 m. (2565 ft).
Although people from Tache, Fort St. James, and Prince George visit the area, it is mostly used by members of Yekooche First Nation who spend most of the summer there before returning to Portage Reserve in the fall. The lake provides them with salmon and kokanee, while moose, deer and bear hunting can be done nearby around Salt Lake, Frank's Meadow, and a lagoon west of the camp. Frank's Meadow was likely named after a hermit named Frank who inhabited the area. People also fish at 4 Mile and 6 Mile Creek, east of the camp near Quarter Island. People from Yekooche rely on their catch from Babine Portage for winter food.

[[Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice]]

CATEGORIES: Deathspell Omega albums, 2004 albums

Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice is a 2004 album by the black metal band Deathspell Omega. The album title is Latin for 'If you seek his monument, look around you', from the epitaph of Christopher Wren's tomb at St Paul's Cathedral.The text on Wren's tomb is "Si monumentum requiris, circumspice", where requiris is active indicative second person singular present of the Latin word requiro ('I seek'); the form requires is the future tense form of that word.
Musically, it represents a massive departure in sound from the band's previous work, both for the increase in recording quality and for the pursuit of far more avant-garde and experimental directions than the band's previous work. The album is also intentionally structured in the manner of 1970s double albums, with each LP side opening with a "prayer" (side four, which opens with "Carnal Malefactor", being an arguable exception).
The track "Malign Paradigm" is a tribute to the Swedish black metal band Malign, and their track "Ashes and Bloodstench".[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] "Drink the Devil's Blood" is a re-recording of a song of the same title appearing on the band's first album, Infernal Battles. The re-interpretation of this station contains completely new lyrics dealing with a Eucharistic theme, in keeping with the more cerebral lyrical approach of this and subsequent releases.
Si Monumentum (the title is written both with u's and v's in the packaging of various editions that have been released) is the first entry in a metaphysical trilogy the band released dealing with the relationship between God, Satan, and man. The second and third entries are Fas – Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum (2007) and Paracletus (2010).

kinsmod is a program written by Silvio Cesare which, in the Linux operating system, allows the insertion of a potentially malicious Loadable kernel module by writing to the /dev/kmem device, regardless of whether the kernel has been compiled with Loadable kernel module support.  The Grsecurity Linux kernel patch-set provides a safe guard against this security risk, providing an option "Deny writing to /dev/kmem".  Note that on a correctly configured system only trusted users (normally only the administrator) are permitted to write to the /dev/kmem device and using kinsmod does not give a potential attacker any advantage.

[[TubeTwist]]

CATEGORIES: 2006 video games, OS X games, Windows games, Torque Game Engine games

TubeTwist is a puzzle game created by 21-6 Productions. The game uses the classic mechanic of balls moving through a labyrinth of tubes which you must utilize to construct a Rube Goldberg style device. The game is broken up into five chapters, with each chapter taking place in a different area which continues the story.
The player plays the role of a scientist searching for their missing professor, re-assembling the TubeTwist experiments to unlock the professor’s secrets. Macrotons are the balls of energy that must be guided from the Injector Tubes to the Reactor tubes. Three types of Macrotons exist: green, blue, and exploding Macrotons. The green and blue Macrotons must reach the reactor of the same color to release the energy from the Macrotons. Exploding Macrotons are used to clear paths for the green and blue Macrotons.
After completing all the experiments in a chapter, the story will continue and the player will get closer to finding the missing Professor Jaymour.
TubeTwist along with the story element was originally conceived and developed by Keith Johnston and Mike Panico of Pinoli Software, who eventually partnered with 21-6 Productions to assist in producing the game. The final core team to create the game, along with Keith Johnston and Mike Panico as game designers, was Justin Mette as executive producer, Dave Calabrese as artist/scripter/story writer, Mike Panico as texture artist, environment designer and modeler, Chris Brethren as level artist, and Matt Sayre as the game composer creating the audio and musical score to the game.
On December 6 of 2006, the 'Quantum-Flux Edition' of TubeTwist was officially released. This new edition officially adds support for Experiment Packs, ships with 2 built-in experiment packs, adds the ability to have up to 13 individual player profiles, performance enhancements, various other small additions and can import saved data from the original TubeTwist.
As of March 1 of 2007, TubeTwist is available for purchase in a box on CD-Rom. The game can be purchased through many sites including Amazon.com, and in brick and mortar stores such as GameStop.

[[Classical music]]

CATEGORIES: European music, Classical music

Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music (both liturgical and secular). It encompasses a broad period from roughly the 11th century to the present day."Classical", The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music, ed. Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), Oxford Reference Online. Retrieved July 23, 2007. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period.
European music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century.[tpl]GroveOnline|Notation, §III, 1(vi): Plainchant: Pitch-specific notations, 13th–16th centuries|Chew, Geffrey & Rastall, Richard|July 23|2007[/tpl] Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitch, speed, meter, individual rhythms and exact execution of a piece of music. This leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular music.[tpl]GroveOnline|Japan, §III, 1: Notation systems: Introduction|Malm, W.P./Hughes, David W.|July 23|2007[/tpl][tpl]GroveOnline|Notation, §I: General|IAN D.

The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly "canonize" the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Beethoven as a golden age.Rushton, Julian, Classical Music, (London, 1994), 10 The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary is from about 1836.[tpl]cite web|author=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=The OED Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50040930?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=classical&first=1&max_to_show=10|accessdate=May 10, 2007|title=classical, a.|year=2007[/tpl]

On certain issues, Mach Song Media mobilizes local faith and community organizations to reach deep into their constituencies. So far they have worked with over 200 such organizations on various issues and have the capacity to reach 1,000 faith and community organizations in the Vietnamese communities across the US.
Boat People SOS has invested over 1 million dollars to develop its own network of Vietnamese-language mass media. This network includes Mach Song monthly publication, Mach Song radio programs and Mach Song television programs. If necessary, Mach Song can readily increase the circulation to 100,00 copies, distributed through their vast community networks within and without their areas of physical presence.

[[Public utility model]]
CATEGORIES: Emergency medical services in the United States

Public Utility Model (PUM), is an emergency medical service (EMS) system.  In a Public Utility Model system, the government is a "purchaser" of dispatchers, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedic providers from an EMS provider (contractor).  In most cases, this is a private (for-profit) ambulance company.  In the ownership of a Public Utility Model, the community retains control of EMS system capital assets and accounts receivable through daily oversight.  The EMS provider (contractor) manages the day-to-day operations of the service and provides the system with properly trained providers.  
The system is designed whereas the government not only regulates and oversees system performance, but the ambulance service contractor is held accountable to meet or exceed performance requirements.   These requirements include, but not limited to, time constraints.  Such limits are set to ensure an ambulance arrives to life-threatening emergencies without delay.  The contractors failure in fulfilling the contractual obligations can result in fines being imposed, up to and including termination of contract.  The agreement and contract between government and contractor are done through a competitive bidding process.  This insures that the most cost-effective provision of EMS services is guaranteed.

The Kunigami language includes the Okinoerabujima dialect ([tpl]lang|ja|島ムニ[/tpl] Shimamuni) and the Yoronjima dialect ([tpl]lang|ja|ユンヌフトゥバ[/tpl] Yunnu futuba) in the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture.
Like the Central Okinawan language, Kunigami is part of the Ryukyuan family. The Nakijin dialect is often referred to as representative of Kunigami, in comparison with the Shuri/Naha dialect in the central Okinawan. The number of fluent native speakers of Kunigami is not known. As a result of Japanese language policy, the younger generation mostly speaks Japanese as their first language.
In Japan, the Ryukyuan language family does not have national recognition as a language but are considered dialects despite the lack of mutual intelligibility with Japanese. As a result, the Kunigami language is referred to as the [tpl]nihongo|Okinoerabu-Yoron-Northern Okinawa dialects|沖永良部与論沖縄北部諸方言|Okinoerabu Yoron Okinawa Hokubu Shohōgen[/tpl].

Michał Waszyński (29 September 1904 – 20 February 1965) was first a film director in his native Poland, then in Italy, and later (as Michael Waszynski) a producer of the major American films, mainly in Spain. Known for his elegance and impeccable manners he was called by people who knew him "the prince".
Waszyński was born as Mosze Waks into a Polish-Jewish family as Michał Waks in 1904 in Kowel, a small town in Volhynia (now in Ukraine), which at the time was part of Imperial Russia. As Germany occupied this part of Europe during World War I, he moved first to Warsaw and later to Berlin. As a young man he worked as an assistant director of the legendary German director F.W. Murnau. Upon his return to Poland he changed his name to Michał Waszyński and converted to Catholicism.
In the 1930s Waszyński became the most prolific film director in Poland, directing 37 of the 147 films made in Poland in that decade, nearly one out of four. Along with the popular films in Polish directed to a wide local audience, he directed an important film in Yiddish The Dybbuk, today a monument of the rich cultural life of East European Jewry before the Holocaust.
At the beginning of World War II Waszyński escaped from Warsaw, which was being bombed by German planes, to Białystok. That city was taken in mid-September 1939 by the Germans, but within weeks, as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, the city was given to Soviet Union and occupied by its army. Waszyński began a new career as a theater director, first in Białystok and later in Moscow.
In the summer of 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Waszyński joined the newly formed Polish Army of general Władysław Anders (loyal to the Polish government in Exile in London) and subsequently was relocated to Persia (Iran), and later as a soldier of the 2nd Corps of the Polish Army to Egypt and Italy. As a member of the army film unit, he filmed the Battle of Monte Cassino, where the Polish Army suffered great losses, but helped to win the day.
After WWII, he stayed in Italy, where he directed a Polish language feature film about the Battle of Monte Cassino, and then three Italian films.
Later in his career, Waszyński worked as a producer for the major American studios in Italy and (primarily) Spain, credited as Michael Waszynski. His credits include The Quiet American (1958) (associate producer), El Cid (1961), and The Fall of the Roman Empire (film) (1964) (executive producer and associate producer).
He died of a heart attack on 20 February 1965 in Madrid, and was buried in a ceremonious Catholic funeral in Rome.

SDN’s role in the industry has not always been that of facilitating and accrediting. When it was first established in 1984 as SDU, it functioned on its own, organising activities for its members without the help of commercial agencies. It was only in 2006 that the then SDU decided on a major change in approach: it let the private sector be the main provider of matchmaking and dating services, focusing instead on accrediting and funding private dating agencies and projects. This was done in the hopes of creating a more vibrant dating scene and of allowing singles to have more options to interact with others of different educational levels.[tpl]Citation | last =Wong | first =Tessa | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =SDU’s Role as Cupid Comes to an End | newspaper =The Straits Times | pages = | date =November 2006 | url = [/tpl]

[[Extensor retinaculum of the hand]]

CATEGORIES: Human anatomy

The extensor retinaculum (dorsal carpal ligament, or posterior annular ligament) is an anatomical term for the thickened part of the antebrachial fascia that holds the tendons of the extensor muscles in place.  It is located on the back of the forearm, just proximal to the hand.  It is continuous with the palmar carpal ligament, which is located on the anterior side of the forearm.
It is a strong, fibrous band, extending obliquely downward and medialward across the back of the wrist, and consisting of part of the deep fascia of the back of the forearm, strengthened by the addition of some transverse fibers.
The extensor retinaculum is attached laterally to the lateral margin of the radius. However, it is not attached to the ulna medially, as the distance between these two bones varies with supination and pronation of the forearm. Instead the medial attachment is to the most medial of the carpal bones, the triquetrum (or triquetral bone) and pisiformis (or pisiform bone). The retinaculum is also attached in its passage across the wrist, to the ridges on the dorsal surface of the radius.

CATEGORIES: 1911 novels, 20th-century French novels, Novels set in Paris

Fermina Márquez is a short novel in twenty chapters written by French writer Valery Larbaud. It was considered for the Prix Goncourt in 1911 but did not win. Nonetheless, it is still considered to be a minor classic of French Literature and one of Larbaud's best known works along with his Diary of A.O. Barnabooth.
The story concerns the arrival of a young girl from Colombia at Saint Augustine's, a Roman Catholic school for boys located near Paris, and her effect on the young men there; in particular on a bookish and solitary student named Joanny Léniot. The eponymous Fermina Márquez arrives at the school with her aunt, sister, and younger brother "little Márquez," who has just been enrolled there as a student. His family makes an arrangement with the school authorities whereby they are allowed to visit him at Saint Augustine's for a time until he becomes adjusted to life at his new school. The students are entranced by Fermina's beauty and proximity, and each of them begins to fantasize about her and to look for opportunities to seduce her.

[[The Saint (novel)]]
CATEGORIES: 1997 novels, Simon Templar books

The Saint is the title of a mystery novel by Burl Barer published by Pocket Books in 1997. It was based upon the screenplay for the film The Saint, which in turn was loosely based upon the character Simon Templar, created by Leslie Charteris. Val Kilmer portrayed Templar and is pictured on the book's front cover.
This was the first book featuring Templar since Salvage for the Saint ended the original series of books (which began in 1928) in 1983. It is also the first Saint story to be published since Charteris' death in 1993 and the first to not be published by either Hodder & Stoughton (UK) or The Crime Club (US).
Barer wrote the book based upon the screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and Wesley Strick. Barer himself is a longtime fan of the Saint books and in 1993 had published a  comprehensive study on the many literary, radio, and television stories featuring the character of Simon Templar. Ironically, Barer uses as a framing sequence around his historical work then-current plans to launch a new film series based upon the Saint; these plans ultimately failed and the 1997 film resulted.
The film only loosely adapted the Simon Templar character, making many wholesale changes to the concept of The Saint and Templar; Barer nonetheless incorporated elements from Charteris into his manuscript, including characters from past Saint books such as Roger Conway. Barer would go on to write an original Saint novel (more closely related to the character) entitled Capture the Saint, which was also published in 1997.

Andy Travis is a fictional character on the television situation comedy WKRP in Cincinnati (1978–82). He was played by Gary Sandy.
Travis was originally intended to be the lead character, the more-or-less normal person who would anchor the series and provide the focus for most of the stories. He is the subject of the theme song, and one critic went so far as to describe Sandy as "Gary Tyler Moore." However, as the first season went on, it became apparent that Sandy did not resonate enough with the audience enough to be the "star", and WKRP shifted to being more of an ensemble comedy, where any one of the eight regulars could carry an episode. Despite this change, Sandy retained top billing for all four seasons.

[[Chaos theory in organizational development]]

CATEGORIES: Business theory, Chaos theory, Organizational theory

In organizational development, chaos theory is a subset of more general chaos theory that incorporates principles of quantum mechanics and presents them in a complex systems environment. To the observer the systems seem to be in chaos. Organizational Development of a business system is the management of that apparent chaos. The term “Managing Organized Chaos” is used in the book by the same name Managing Organized Chaos – Business Planning 1.0, to describe the daily management of an entity (business) engaged in continual activity.

[[Plutoid]]

CATEGORIES: Plutoids, Dwarf planets, Trans-Neptunian objects

A plutoid or ice dwarf is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet: that is a body orbiting beyond Neptune that is large enough to be rounded in shape. The term plutoid was adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) working group Committee on Small Bodies Nomenclature, but was rejected by the IAU working group Planetary System Nomenclature.[tpl]cite journal |author=Karel A. van der Hucht, [tpl]dabbr|ed.|editor[/tpl] | title=Reports on Astronomy 2006–2009 | year=2009 | journal=Transactions IAU | volume=XXVIIA | doi=10.1017/S1743921308025398|bibcode = 2009IAUTA..27..149B |pages=149 [/tpl] The term plutoid is not widely used by astronomers, though ice dwarf is not uncommon.
There are thought to be thousands of plutoids in the Solar System, although only four have been formally designated as such by the IAU. 
The IAU developed this category of astronomical objects as a consequence of its 2006 resolution defining the word "planet". The IAU's formal definition of "plutoid", announced 11 June 2008, is:
Accordingly, in the language of mathematical set theory, plutoids can be thought of as the intersection of the set of dwarf planets and the set of trans-Neptunian objects.
In light of the difficulty of remotely ascertaining hydrostasis, the IAU only formally confers "dwarf planet" (and by extension, "plutoid") status to those bodies whose minimum estimated size is substantially greater than what is generally thought necessary to guarantee hydrostatic equilibrium. [tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], Pluto, [tpl]dp|Eris[/tpl], [tpl]dp|Haumea[/tpl], and [tpl]dp|Makemake[/tpl] are the only objects officially recognized as plutoids, while upwards of seventy more bodies that currently lack formal recognition are thought likely to meet the definition, and can expect formal recognition at some time in the future.[tpl]cite web|authorlink=Michael E. Brown|title=The Dwarf Planets|first=Michael E.|last=Brown |publisher=California Institute of Technology, Department of Geological Sciences|url=http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/|accessdate=2008-01-26[/tpl]
Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute believes the outer planets show signs of collisions with plutoids 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in diameter: Uranus could have been tipped off its axis by a plutoid, and Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, is probably a captured plutoid from the Kuiper belt.

His presentations spanned three decades. In 1951, when he co-founded the Roslyn Music Group, presenting chamber-music ensembles and soloists on Long Island, his concert career as an impresario was underway. Because Long Island had "an omnivorous appetite for the arts", as he phrased it, Bernstein launched the nonprofit Concert Hall subscription series in 1964, offering 30 annual performances of classical, jazz, dance and theater, including Broadway road company shows and New York Philharmonic concerts. The popular events were staged at Long Island University's C. W. Post Center, the Nassau Coliseum and other Long Island auditoriums.

It was the seat of the former Archbishopric of Embrun, which was divided between the Bishopric of Gap and the Archbishopric of Aix in 1822. On its door were posted in 1489 the thirty-two propositions imputed to the Waldenses, that presaged the campaign to extirpate them as heretics, which resurfaced in the Dauphiné with intense savagery during the Wars of Religion in France: Lesdiguières pillaged Embrun cathedral in 1585.
In the fifth century relics of St Nazarius were translated to Embrun, which had supported a bishop since the fourth century; Embrun became a noted place of pilgrimage. Charlemagne erected the basilica that was visited by Pope Leo III.As well, at a later date by Henry II of France and Louis XVIII (The Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. "Gap, diocese of").  The cathedral church, built on foundations that date to its founding in the ninth century, was constructed between 1170 and 1220; its Romanesque portal, columns supported on crouching lions in the north portal"On the south side or at the west end shafts rest sometimes on the backs of crouching lions (Embrun) as in Italy."

The present cathedral was previously the church of the former Condat Abbey (founded in the 5th century), which with the village that grew up round it soon acquired however the name of Saint-Oyand or Saint-Oyend after Saint Eugendus (d. 510), fourth abbot and a popular saint. In 687 Saint Claudius resigned as Bishop of Besançon and became the twelfth abbot. After he died, in 696, his grave became a very popular pilgrimage centre, to the extent that by the thirteenth century, the name "Saint-Claude" had become more used than that of "Saint-Oyand", which it superseded.Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Eugendus
The Bishopric of Saint-Claude was created in 1742, out of the parishes in the care of the abbey. The abbey church, built in the 15th century, became the cathedral.

CATEGORIES: Hungarian emigrants to the United States, American film actresses, American female singers, 1966 births, Living people

Eszter Balint  (born in Budapest, Hungary)  is a singer, songwriter, violinist, and actress.         
She first emerged as a child member of the avant-garde Squat Theatre troupe before making her cinematic debut in 1984 in director Jim Jarmusch's independent film Stranger Than Paradise. From there she seemed to drop out of sight for the remainder of the decade, not reappearing on-screen until 1990's little-seen Bail Jumper. Roles in The Linguini Incident, Woody Allen's Shadows and Fog and Steve Buscemi's Trees Lounge followed. 
Balint's musical releases, Flicker and Mud, both produced by JD Foster, were praised by The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Billboard Magazine. In his review of Mud, Jon Pareles writes: "Miss Balint has her own film noir sensibility as a songwriter. She puts arty twists into back-alley Americana... but the cleverness is not the point. She slips inside her characters to project their restlessness and longing."
Balint has appeared on recordings by Michael Gira's Angels of Light, Marc Ribot's Los Cubanos Postizos and John Lurie's Marvin Pontiac's Greatest Hits, Dayna Kurtz, and the Swans. She was a featured guest member of Marc Ribot's Ceramic Dog touring Europe throughout 2009 and is featured on their 2013 release "Your Turn."

The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) is a bipartisan non-governmental organization (NGO) established in 1975 to serve the members and staff of state legislatures of the United States (states, commonwealths, and territories). NCSL provides research, technical assistance and opportunities for policymakers to exchange ideas on the most pressing state issues and is an effective and respected advocate for the interests of the states in the American federal system. It has three objectives: to improve the quality and effectiveness of state legislatures; to promote policy innovation and communication among state legislatures; and to ensure state legislatures a strong, cohesive voice in the federal system.
All state legislators and staff members are automatically members of NCSL. NCSL provides research, publications, and networking opportunities to aid, train, and serve its members in a wide variety of ways.
NCSL is the premier legislative organization in the country and maintains relationships with the smaller policy organizations like the Council for State Governments (CSG).  CSG representatives sit on NCSL's Executive Committee and NCSL representatives sit on CSG's Executive Committee and Governing Board.
NCSL maintains two offices: one in Denver and the other in Washington, D.C..
Day-to-day operations of the organization are in the hands of its Executive Director, William T. Pound. The organization is led by a legislator who serves as its President and by a legislative staffer who serves as Staff Chair. Twenty years after its founding, NCSL was led in 1994 by its first female President, former Congresswoman Karen McCarthy. Its first African-American President, Rep. Daniel T. Blue, served in 1998-99. Currently, the 2011-2012 President of NCSL is Sen. Stephen Morris of Kansas, and the Staff Chair is Michael Adams. Each year, NCSL’s presidency alternates between legislators of the Republican and Democratic parties.

[[Gold Center, Nevada]]

CATEGORIES: Ghost towns in Nye County, Nevada, Populated places established in 1904, Ghost towns in Nevada

Gold Center was a mining town in Nye County, Nevada. Located in the Bullfrog Mining District south of Tonapah, Gold Center was established in December 1904 with a United States Post Office being authorized on January 21, 1905. The town began publishing its own newspaper in 1907. The location of the town was ideal as it was on the stagecoach route to Rhyolite and Beatty. It was also near the Amargosa River, allowing sufficient water for drinking and for two mills and an ice house. Gold Center also sold water to Rhyolite and Carrara. The Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, the Las Vegas & Tonopah Railroad and the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad all ran through Gold Center.  Gold Center also had the first brewery in the area which was built underground to maintain a cool temperature.[tpl]cite web|last=Reidhead|first=Claudia|date=March 1, 2004|url=http://www.beattymuseum.com/news_07a.html|title=The Gold Center Mining and Development Company – Part I|work=Bullfrog Mining District History|publisher=Beatty Museum and Historical Society|accessdate=2006-08-04[/tpl]
Today, little remains of the original town other than the foundations of a stamp mill, the footers for a tank at the cyanide plant and sections of the water line that ran between Gold Center and Carrara. It is a ghost town. However, what is left of the town does now sit along the paved road connecting U.S. Highway 95 to Beatty's airport. On January 22, 2011, new life came to the area in the form of Nevada's newest legal bordello when, somewhat appropriately given the area's railway history, a retired short-line railroad owner by the name of Guy Brenkman opened Bikini's Gentlemen's Club off Airport Road in Gold Center.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sex-in-nevada.com/directions/beatty.html|title=Beatty-area Brothels|work=Speed Racer's Driving Directions to Nevada's Legal Brothels|accessdate=2012-01-28[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Green algae

A green algae of the family Scenedesmaceae in the order Chlorococcales.
Scenedesmus is an example of a colonial green algae.  It is more often found floating in the creek water and not attached to rocks on the bottom.  Unlike most of the colonial green algae that form long filaments, scenedesmus forms small chains of four cells.  The ends of the colony possess cell wall extensions that have a spike like appearance.  Small vacuoles, filled with oil, can be seen at either end of each cell.  The oil enables them to float in the water, maximizing their exposure to sunlight.

Blessed James of Viterbo (c. 1255 – 1308), known as Giacomo da Viterbo, Jacobus de Viterb(i)o, surname Capocci, and nicknamed Doctor speculativus, was an Augustinian friar and student of Giles of Rome.Antony Black, Political Thought in Europe 1250-1450 (1992, p.49): and Giles, i.e. Aegidius were members of the order of Eremitical Augustinians, both had studied at Paris (Aegidius probably under Aquinas, James probably under Aegidius), and rose to be archbishops.
He was born in Viterbo, Italy. He was professor of theology at the University of Paris from 1293 to 1300.
He wrote on the relationship between ecclesiastical and temporal power in his book De Regimine Christiano. It argued that although human power alone is lawful, it could only be perfected through the influence of a spiritual power. Walter UllmannMedieval Foundations of Renaissance Humanism, p.144 says that it was 'the first systematic exposition of the concept of the Church'.
He became Archbishop of Benevento in 1302, and Archbishop of Naples in 1303.
He died in Naples.

[[7.7×58mm Arisaka]]
CATEGORIES: Pistol and rifle cartridges, Military cartridges

The 7.7×58mm Arisaka cartridge or Type 99 rimless 7.7 mm was chambered in the World War II Arisaka Type 99 Rifle. The cartridge was designed to replace the aging 6.5×50mm Arisaka cartridge after seeing the 8×57 IS in action in China during 1937. Due to lack of materials the plan to phase out the 6.5 mm Arisaka cartridge by the end of the war was not completed.
While the round chambered by the Arisaka rifle used a rimless case, rimmed and semi-rimmed variants were produced for use in some Japanese machine guns. This machine gun ammunition is more powerful, and the altered rim is meant to prevent it from being chambered in a rifle. The 7.7 mm Arisaka uses the same .311–.312" bullets as the .303 British,http://www.chuckhawks.com/7-7mmArisaka.htm and its cartridge case is similar in power to the .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm). Factory loaded ammunition and brass cases are available from Norma and Graf; Hornady, Sierra and Speer also produce usable bullets. Reloadable cartridge cases can be produced by reforming .30-06 brass, or fire forming 7.92×57mm cases. Case heads derived from the .30-06 will be slightly undersized and will bulge slightly just ahead of the web on firing, while the 7.92×57mm derived cases will be slightly short. Normal cases of the correct dimensions will also bulge slightly, however, as most Japanese rifles of this era had slightly oversized chambers, intended to allow the bolt to be closed on a round even in a very dirty chamber. Reloading data for .303 British is a good starting point for load development, since the two cartridges are nearly identical.
The 7.7×58mm Arisaka as a sporting cartridge is suitable for most big game with proper bullet selection.

Ringway 2 was the second innermost of the series of four London Ringways, ring roads planned in the 1960s to circle London at various distances from the city centre. They were part of a comprehensive scheme developed by the Greater London Council (GLC) to alleviate traffic congestion on the city's road system by providing high speed motorway-standard roads within the capital linking a series of radial roads taking traffic into and out of the city. The scheme was cancelled in 1973.
Ringway 2 was planned as an upgrade to the North Circular Road (A406) and South Circular Road (A205) which, in the 1960s, were sign-posted routes circling the capital through the suburbs on mostly standard roads selected by route planners in the 1930s.
Much of the Ringway, particularly the southern section where a new route was required, would have been placed in cuttings to mitigate disruption to local residents.

The aft pressure bulkhead or rear pressure bulkhead is a component of all large commercial aircraft.  It is an airtight bulkhead located between the cabin and the tail of the aircraft.  Its purpose is to seal the rear of the plane and thus maintain cabin pressure, and as such it is a vital part of the aircraft.
Japan Airlines Flight 123 crashed after a catastrophic failure of the aft pressure bulkhead. The failure occurred due to faulty repair of the bulkhead, when a double row of rivets was replaced by a much weaker single row. Failure of the bulkhead damaged hydraulic pipes passing through.

[[Alexander Dalzeel]]
CATEGORIES: 1660s births, 1715 deaths, Scottish pirates

Alexander Dalzeel (c. 1662 – December 5, 1715) was a seventeenth-century pirate and former officer under Henry Avery. 
Born in Port Patrick, Scotland, Dalzeel went to sea as a child and, by the age of 23, was  captain of his own ship with six successful voyages to his credit. Earning a reputation for dishonesty, Dalzeel arrived in Madagascar in 1685 and soon enlisted into the ranks of Captain Avery. 
According to pirate lore, Dalzeel participated in the capture of the treasure ship Ganj-i-Sawai, which carried The Great Mogul's daughter to her arranged marriage. Avery, who had decided to take her as his own wife, gave Dalzeel his own ship and crew within Avery's fleet. Dalzeel would continue to serve under Avery until finally leaving for the West Indies on his own. 
However, upon their arrival in the Caribbean, the pirates' search for targets was fruitless. With their supplies slowly running short, starvation began to set in before a Spanish vessel was sighted. As the ship came into view, Dalzeel realized the Spanish ship was a well-armed Spanish war galleon which had presumably become separated from its escorts. Despite their ship's smaller size, Dalzeel gave orders to close in on the ship. 
Although the Spanish ship's captain had been informed of the pirate ship's presence earlier, he felt it too small to be a threat and retired to his cabin for a game of cards. As the ship approached the galleon, Dalzeel ordered a hole to be drilled in the side of his own ship so that his crew would be forced to fight to the death. Caught completely off guard, the Spaniards offered little resistance as Dalzeel's crew boarded the galleon. Within minutes the ship was theirs and, storming into the captain's quarters, they demanded his surrender at gunpoint. 
After sailing his prize to Jamaica, Dalzeel was apprehended while attempting to capture a fleet of twelve Spanish pearl ships escorted by a Spanish man-o-war. In exchange for his surrender, Dalzeel and his crew were not forced into slavery or hard labor, as was common practice for captured pirates. 
Released ashore, Dalzeel made his way back to Jamaica. There he began outfitting another ship and was soon sailing for Cuba. Again his outnumbered crew was captured by a Spanish naval patrol of three warships bound for Havana, where he was sentenced to be hanged at sea. Dalzeel, however, quickly made his escape after stabbing a guard and using two empty jugs to float to shore. Soon encountering another band of pirates, Dalzeel was able to convince them to attack and successfully capture the warship which had held him prisoner. As the pirates neared Jamaica, their ship sank in a sudden storm although Dalzeel was able to survive the storm in a canoe. 
During the War of the Spanish Succession, Dalzeel was granted a commission by the French as a privateer. He enjoyed considerable success against British and allied nations before his eventual capture in 1712. Taken back to England, he was tried and convicted of treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. However, at the behest of the Earl of Mar, Dalzeel received a royal pardon and, upon his release, sailed for French waters, where he captured a French ship. He then had the captured crew's necks tied to their heels and thrown overboard to watch them drown. 
Eventually captured in Scotland, he was returned to London, where he was hanged on December 15, 1715.

Eduardo Oliver "Ted" Robledo (July 26, 1928 - December 6, 1970) was a Chilean professional football player. He played as a left-sided defender, and is most notable for his time spent with Newcastle United.
Robledo was born in Iquique, Chile to a Chilean father and an English mother. He emigrated with his family to Wath-on-Dearne, Yorkshire in 1932, at the age of four, due to the political instability in Chile at the time.http://pratina.tripod.com/id16.html  The family lived at Barnsley Rd, West Melton, in the same house where the Anglo-French biographer David Bret was later raised. 
Robledo started his footballing career at Barnsley with his brother George. First Division Newcastle United signed him on January 27, 1949. Newcastle were only interested in signing his brother, but neither of the Robledo brothers would move without the other. Their appearance together in the 1952 FA Cup Final was the first time more than one foreign player had appeared in a cup final eleven.
The majority of Robledo's appearances for the club came in the 1951-52 season. Robledo played for Newcastle until the end of the 1952-53 season, when he was sold to Colo-Colo. After retiring from football, Robledo served on an oil tanker where he died in mysterious circumstances in December 1970 at the age of 42. It was rumoured that Robledo was thrown off the tanker and drowned. His body has never been found.http://tennis.rivals.net/default.asp?sid=0&p=2&stid=8287815 His brother George outlived him by nearly two decades, dying in April 1989 just before his 63rd birthday.http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/4826466.Lennonsketch_of_United_cup_hero___/

After Thaksin was deposed in a military coup, the junta transformed the ISOC into a "government within a government", giving it wide-reaching authority over the National Counter Corruption Committee, the Department of Special Investigation, and the Anti-Money Laundering Office. The junta also authorized it to help provincial authorities in marketing OTOP products.Bangkok Post, CNS advises extended term for AEC, 14 February 2007 In June 2007, the junta approved a draft national security bill which would give ISOC sweeping powers to handle "new forms of threats" to the country.

The Statue of Ramesses II  is a 3,200-year-old figure of Ramesses II, depicting him standing, that was discovered in 1820 by Giovanni Battista Caviglia at the Great Temple of Ptah  near Memphis, Egypt. It is made from red granite.
The statue was found broken in six pieces and earlier attempts at restoration failed. In 1955, Egyptian Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser moved the statue to the large Bab Al-Hadid square in Cairo that was then renamed Ramses Square.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.egy.com/landmarks/97-08-07.shtml |title=97-08-07: Ramses comes home| accessdate=2007-01-04 |archiveurl = \http://web.archive.org/web/20061207065318/http://www.egy.com/landmarks/97-08-07.shtml  |archivedate = 2006-12-07[/tpl] There the statue was restored to its full height of 11 metres and erected on a three metre pedestal at the edge of a fountain. It was stabilized by iron bars inside the body.[tpl]cite web | last = Hawass | first = Zahi | authorlink = Zahi Hawass | title = The removal of Ramses II Statue  | url = http://guardians.net/hawass/news/removal_of_ramses_ii_statue.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-17 [/tpl]
Over time Ramses Square turned out to be an unsuitable location, as the statue continued to be exposed to noise, pollution, and vibration from traffic and subways. The Egyptian government therefore decided to relocate the statue to a safer and more dignified location. At a temporary location on the Giza Plateau it will undergo restoration. The eventual resting place of the statue of Ramesses II will be the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) that is under construction. It is planned that the statue will greet visitors at the entrance to the GEM that is scheduled to open in 2015.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
The transport of the statue from Ramses Square to Giza was a technological challenge that had been in the planning since 2002. The statue weighs about 83 tons. A replica had been made and was transported several weeks before the scheduled actual move along the planned route to Giza to test the proposed relocation process. The move took place on August 25, 2006.[tpl]cite web|  url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/world/4140740.html| title=Ramses statue moved closer to pyramids| date=2006-08-25| accessdate=2006-08-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] During its ten-hour transport the statue was wrapped and covered in rubber foam.

[[Hotel Wolcott]]

CATEGORIES: Hotels in Manhattan

The Hotel Wolcott at 4 West 31st Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in the Midtown East neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, was built between 1902 and 1904 by developer William C. Dewey and was designed by the prominent architect John H. Duncan, who employed a bold French Beaux-Arts style combined with French Neo Classicism.Architects' and Builders' Magazine(September 1903) The hotel was named after Henry Roger Wolcott, a businessman, politician and philanthropist.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission "Hotel Wolcott Designation Report", (December 20, 2011)
Before it was even completed, the building was leased by Dewey to James H. Breslin, a prominent hotelier of the time, for three-years.  Nonetheless, Dewey had difficulty with the financing for the building: unable to purchase steel locally, he imported it from Europe, which caused an unusually long construction period, which in turn made it difficult for Dewey to pay his creditors. In early 1905 The American Mortgage Company repossessed the building, which was sold at auction.  Breslin's lease remained, but the hotel passed through the hands of a series of owners in the following decades.
The hotel was popular with travelers, but also housed many permanent residents, including dancer Isadora Duncan and Doris Duke, the heiress.  Other prominent guests of the hotel included Edith Wharton and Henry Miller, and Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers stayed there while recording at Beltone Studios, which was in the building. The hotel also hosted events such as the meeting where Col. Jake Ruppert and Col. Tillinghast Huston purchased the New York Yankees in 1914 and Fiorello La Guardia's inauguration ball in 1938.
On December 20, 2011 the hotel was designated a New York City landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.

The Langara Point Lighthouse is a manned lighthouse located atop a scenic bluff on the northwest corner of Langara Island.  It is one of only two lighthouses in the Queen Charlotte Islands – the other being at Cape St. James (now an automated station), at the southern tip of the islands. Both were built in 1913.
During World War II, the lighthouse was painted camouflage green and a radar station was built here to monitor the North Pacific.
The original light, still in use today, is a first-order Fresnel lens (the largest type of lighthouse lens) manufactured by Chance Brothers of England.  Each side of the lens is over 8’ tall and 5’ wide with a focal length of 3’
The lighthouse is easily seen from the water and tours are possible via helicopter.  Guests to Langara Island can enjoy a 1-2 hour tour of the lighthouse and its surrounding grounds, usually including a trip up to the top of the light tower, as well as coffee or tea with the lightkeepers.

The Synagogue of Tomar is the best preserved of the medieval synagogues of Portugal. It is located in the historic centre of the city of Tomar, and houses a small Jewish Museum.
The synagogue of Tomar was built in the mid-15th century by the thriving Jewish community of the town. From the outside, it does not look different from the other houses in the street. The current main entrance, facing North, did not exist in the Middle Ages. It was the gothic pointed arch facing East - the direction of Jerusalem - that used to be the main entrance to the temple.
Inside, the synagogue is a square-shaped hall with three short aisles divided by four pillars supporting Gothic vaulting. The capitals bear geometric and vegetal motifs. Excavations in a building beside the synagogue revealed the remnants of a mikveh (ritual bath for women).
With the expulsion and forced conversions of Portuguese Jews in 1496, the synagogue served as jail, church and later as storage house. In the 1930s, the old synagogue was bought by the Polish scholar Samuel Schwarz, who restored the building and donated it to the Portuguese government with the condition that it should be turned into a museum.
Since 1939 it functions as the small Jewish Museum Abraão Zacuto (Abraham Zacuto), with several mediaeval tomb slabs from the whole country. Among its best exhibits is a stone plate from the Lisbon synagogue, dated from 1308 and bearing a greeting inscription.
Other well-preserved, pre-expulsion synagogues can be found in Híjar, Toledo, and Córdoba.

The Ugly One with the Jewels (full title: The Ugly One with the Jewels and Other Stories: A Reading from Stories From the Nerve Bible) is the title of a primarily spoken-word album released by Laurie Anderson on Warner Bros. Records in 1995, the last of the seven-album deal that she signed in the early 1980s.
An immediate follow-up to her album of only a few months earlier, Bright Red, The Ugly One with the Jewels consisted of stories and monologues taken from Anderson's performance piece, Stories from the Nerve Bible. Many of the pieces are autobiographical (including one in which she reminisces about working on stage with the late comic Andy Kaufman). The album was recorded live in London, England. Although most of the pieces are spoken word, they have musical accompaniment, with the exception of "The Cultural Ambassador".
Two previously recorded pieces are performed again on this album: the poem "White Lily", which was earlier performed in Anderson's 1986 concert film Home of the Brave, and Same Time Tomorrow, which closes this album just as it closed Bright Red.
Discounting a greatest hits collection which followed in 2000 (Talk Normal: The Laurie Anderson Anthology), this was the final Laurie Anderson album to be released by the main Warner Bros. Records label. Commencing with her next new release, Life on a String, Anderson moved to the Warner subsidiary label, Nonesuch Records.

[[Charles Thilorier]]
CATEGORIES: Students in France

Charles-Saint-Ange Thilorier was a student at the École polytechnique in the class / year of 1815, who was mistakenly believed to have been the first person to create solid carbon dioxide ("dry ice").  Actually, a French inventor, Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier (1790–1844), discovered dry ice.
Unfortunately, in almost all of his technical articles, Adrien Thilorier gave his name simply as "Thilorier";However, his name is given as "A. Thilorier" in one article:  A. Thilorier (1836) "Acide carbonique liquéfié et solidifié" (Liquefied and solidified carbonic acid), Journal de chimie médicale, de pharmacie et de toxicologie, 2nd series, 2 : 3-8. similarly, whenever others referred to him in technical articles, his name was also given only as "Thilorier".  This impeded efforts by scholars to identify him subsequently.Even a brief (romanticized) biographical article about Thilorier didn't mention his first name.  See:  Samuel-Henry Berthoud, Les Petites chroniques de la science (Paris, France:  Garnier Frères, 1861), volume 2, pages 180-186.  The confusion was compounded when Paul Thénard wrote a biography of his father, Louis Thénard, a French chemist:Paul Thénard, Un grand Français:  Le chimiste Thénard (1777-1857) (Dijon, France:  Imprimerie Jobard, 1950).  In 1835, Adrien Thilorier had created dry ice by spraying liquid carbon dioxide into a glass vessel.  He had thought that the dry ice was merely snow; that is, water vapor from the atmosphere which had condensed as a result of the cold that the evaporation of the liquid carbon dioxide had produced.  Louis Thénard had explained to Thilorier that his "snow" was actually solidified carbon dioxide.[ref]See:
Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier was an employee of the French Post Office in Paris who invented, among other things, an oil lamp, a gas compressor, and an apparatus for producing liquid carbon dioxide.  It was a French scholar who revealed that he had discovered dry ice.
During the 1960s, Madeleine Ambrière-Fargeaud, a scholar in France, was trying to identify the person who served as the model for a "mad scientist" character, Balthazar Claës, in Honoré de Balzac's novel La Recherche de l’absolu (The Quest of the Absolute).  Her research suggested that Claës was inspired (in part) by Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier.Madeleine Ambrière-Fargeaud, Balzac et "La Recherche de l’absolu", 2nd ed. (Paris, France:  Presses Universitaires de France, 1999), pp. 91-107.  By 2003, Joost Mertens, a Dutch historian of science, had verified many of the findings that Ms. Ambrière-Fargeaud had made about Thilorier.Joost Mertens (2003) "Du côté d’un chimiste nommé Thilorier: Balthazar Claës modèle d’Adrien Thilorier" (Towards a chemist named Thilorier:  Balthazar Claës model Adrien Thilorier), L'Année balzacienne 2003, 1 (4) : 251-263.
That "Thilorier" is actually Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier is proved by French government documents, especially patents.  In 1826, he was granted a patent for a "hydrostatic lamp"; the patent lists his name as "Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)" of Paris.Patent 4913:  Adrien-Jean Thilorier, "Pour une lampe hydrostatique," Description des machines et procédés spécifiés … , 44 :  416-429 (1841); issued:  May 12, 1826.  His 1831 patent for a gas compressor also lists his name as "Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)" and describes him as an employee of the "Administration des postes" (i.e., the Post Office) in Paris.Patent 2896:  Thilorier, Adrien-Jean-Pierre, "Pour le perfectionnement d'une machine à comprimer le gaz, …" (For the improvement of a machine to compress gas, …), Description des Machines et Procédés consignés dans les brevets d'invention, … , 30 : 251-267 (1836); issued:  May 16, 1831.  In 1832, the Bulletin of the laws of the kingdom of France also lists him as "Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)" and as an employee of the Post Office, who resided at number 21 on the Place Vendôme in Paris, and as the inventor of a gas compressor.The Bulletin des Lois du Royaume de France (Bulletin of the laws of the kingdom of France), 9th series, part ii, no. 92, page 74 (February 1832) lists:  "24° M. Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre) employé à l'administration des postes, demeurant à Paris, place Vendôme, no 21, auquel il a été délivré le 16 mai dernier, le certificat de sa demande d'un brevet d'invention de dix ans pour le perfectionnement d'une machine à comprimer le gaz; …" (24th Mr. Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre) employed at the Post Office, residing in Paris, Place Vendôme, no. 21, where was delivered May 16th last, the certificate, by his request, for a patent of invention for ten years for the improvement of a machine to compress gas; … )

A familygram is a personal message sent to a sailor of the United States Navy on a submarine by their families. 
Because submarines normally maintain radio silence to avoid detection, personal messages from the 'outside world' are severely restricted. Familygrams were originally limited to 15 words, though later as many as 50 words were permitted. Content was also severely restricted.  Familygrams were not private communications.  Familygrams were scanned for content before being transmitted, and scanned again before delivery to the intended recipients.  There are many examples of such familygrams on the Internet, dating from the Vietnam War and earlier.
The term is also used colloquially by families wishing to communicate news to friends and extended family via printed or email newsletters.

Live in New York was a 2-CD live album released by performance artist Laurie Anderson on Nonesuch Records in 2002. It was her ninth album of new recordings released since 1982. The front cover of the CD has the title Live at Town Hall, New York City September 19–20, 2001, however the official title of the album is just Live in New York.
Recorded less than 10 days after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York City, the album was produced during a tour Anderson gave of the United States in which she performed a mixture of older pieces from earlier in her career and newer works, including songs from her then-recent album Life on a String, as well as earlier albums such as United States Live, Big Science, Bright Red, Home of the Brave and Strange Angels.
Following so close to the attacks, Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style. The performance is highlighted by a performance of "O Superman," the song that launched Anderson to stardom in 1981 and that contains lyrics that can—in retrospect—be seen to relate to the terrorist attacks. One song, "Progress", is a retitled performance of the song "The Dream Before" which Anderson debuted in her 1986 short film What You Mean We? and later featured on Strange Angels.

[[Dress code (Western)]]
CATEGORIES: Formalwear, Western culture, Business ethics, Dress codes

Not to be confused with Western wear
A dress code is a set of rules governing what garments may be worn together and in what setting. In Western culture, examples of dress codes are combinations such as "smart casual", or "morning dress".  A classification of these codes is normally made for varying levels of formality and times of day. In traditional Western dressing, for men the more formal dress codes, such as "black tie", are highly codified with essentially fixed definitions, mostly unchanged for more than fifty years, while the more casual classifications change very quickly, and a worldwide or widely relevant discussion is impossible. For women, changes in fashion are more rapid.
In practical use, dress codes are either followed intuitively or enforced by peer pressure, so that people wear similar clothing in the same situations. Alternatively, at more formal events where a dress code is specified, invitees wear clothes at the specified level; if some variation is permitted (for example, "black tie preferred"), the host will wear the most formal option to save guests the embarrassment of out-dressing him. Appropriate national dress is generally permitted, and national variations are also widely worn as an exception to the trend of uniformity with peers, often in the form of headgear (see kippa, turban, hijab).

A black and white cookie, or half and half cookie, is a soft, sponge-cake-like shortbread which is iced on one half with vanilla fondant, and on the other half by chocolate fondant. It is similar to a neenish tart, although neenish tarts are filled with a cream center, whereas a black and white cookie is not.
Notably, this style cookie is often seen as a particularly "New York" snack.
Although bearing a superficial resemblance to black and white cookies, halfmoon cookies, popular in Central New York, are made with a significantly different recipe. The traditional halfmoon cookie is a devil's food cake cookie with buttercream frosting, resulting in a cookie that is richer and moister than the black and white cookie. Halfmoon cookies are now also available with a vanilla cookie base.

Garranger was able to locate the grave on Eretoka island by analyzing local folklore. According to legend, when Roy Mata conquered the land, his first goal was to unite the tribes. His reign is reputed to have been a peaceful one. Sadly, Roy Mata was poisoned to death by his brother, but his body was not buried on his homeland because the locals feared his spirit. To this date, the name Roy Mata is never used.
In 2008, three sites associated with Roy Mata, on the islands of Efate, Lelepa and Eretoka, were made UNESCO World Heritage Sites."Chief Roi Mata’s Domain", UNESCO[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=40819 |title=World Heritage Status set to ensure protection of Vanuatu’s Roi Mata domain |date=July 9, 2008 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=November 6, 2011[/tpl]

[[Dingir]]

CATEGORIES: Mesopotamian deities, Sumerian words and phrases, Mesopotamian mythology, Cuneiform determinatives

Dingir (usually transliterated diĝir, pronounced [tpl]IPA|/diŋir/[/tpl]) is a cuneiform sign, most commonly the determinative for "deity" although it has related meanings as well. As a determinative, it is not pronounced, and is conventionally transliterated as a superscript "D" as in e.g. DInanna.  Generically, dingir can be translated as "god" or "goddess".Edzard, 2003
The sign in Sumerian cuneiform (DIĜIR, 20px [tpl]Script|Xsux|𒀭 [/tpl])By assyriological convention, capitals identify a cuneiform sign, while the phonemic value of a sign in a given context is given in lower case. See also Sumerogram. by itself represents the Sumerian word an ("sky" or "heaven"),Hayes, 2000 the ideogram for An or the word diĝir ("god"), the supreme deity of the Sumerian pantheon. In Assyrian cuneiform, it (AN, DIĜIR, 20px) could be either an ideogram for "deity" (ilum) or a syllabogram for an, or ìl-. In Hittite orthography, the syllabic value of the sign was again an.
The concept of "divinity" in Sumerian is closely associated with the heavens, as is evident from the fact that the cuneiform sign doubles as the ideogram for "sky", and that its original shape is the picture of a star. The original association of "divinity" is thus with "bright" or "shining" hierophanies in the sky. A possible loan relation of Sumerian  dingir with Turkic Tengri "sky, sky god" has been suggested.[ref]Mircea Eliade, John C. Holt, Patterns in comparative religion, 1958, p. 94. The connection of dingir and Old Turkic tengere was made by F. Hommel in Grundriss der Geographie und Geschichte des alten Orients (1928).
P. A. Barton in Semitic and Hamitic Origins (1934) suggested that the Mesopotamian sky god Anu may have been imported from Central Asia to Mesopotamia. 
The similarity of dingir and tengri was noted as early as 1862 (i.e. during the early phase of the decipherment of the Sumerian language, before even the term "Sumerian" had been coined to refer to it),  by George Rawlinson in his The Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World (p. 78).[/ref]

[[Ringway 3]]

CATEGORIES: London Ringways

Ringway 3 was the third from the centre of the series of four London Ringways, ring roads planned in the 1960s to circle London at various distances from the city centre. They were part of a comprehensive scheme developed by the Greater London Council (GLC) to alleviate traffic congestion on the city's road system by providing high speed motorway-standard roads within the capital linking a series of radial roads taking traffic into and out of the city. Most of the scheme was cancelled in 1973.
Ringway 3 was planned as a new motorway running either through or around the periphery of the capital's outer suburbs linking areas such as Barnet, Epping, Dartford, Purley and Chessington. Construction began on the first section of the motorway between South Mimms and Potters Bar in 1973 and the motorway was initially designated as the M16 motorway before its opening.
Whilst the construction of the first section was in progress, the plan for Ringways 3 and 4 was modified considerably. Broadly speaking, the northern and eastern section of Ringway 3 (from the current junction 23 of the M25 motorway with the A1 east and south to the current junction 3 with the M20) was to be built and connected to the southern and western section of Ringway 4 to create the M25. The remaining parts of the two rings became redundant. 
The South Mimms to Potters Bar section (junction 23 to junction 24) was opened in 1975, temporarily designated as an A-road (A1178). The remaining sections of the northern Ringway 3 were constructed over the next eleven years: the M25 motorway was completed in 1986 with the opening of the Ringway 4 to Ringway 3 linking section from Micklefield to South Mimms (junction 19 to junction 23).

Hae Buru (86 - 48 BCE) was king of Bukbuyeo and founder of Dongbuyeo (86 BCE - 22 CE), an ancient Korean kingdom.
Hae Buru took the throne and became the king of Bukbuyeo. Hae Buru led his followers and some of Bukbuyeo people to the city of Gaseopwon, a city near the Sea of Japan (East Sea). In that same year, Hae Buru founded another Buyeo, which he named Dongbuyeo, due to its position east of Bukbuyeo. 
According to the Samguk Yusa,Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book One, page 29. Silk Pagoda (2006). ISBN 1-59654-348-5 Aranbul, a minister of the Buyeo court, had a dream in which the Heavenly Emperor told him that Buyeo was to make way for the descendants of Heaven, and believing that the dream was a sort of omen, he advised his king Buru to move the capital. Buru later moved his capital to Gaseopwon, and named his country Dongbuyeo.
Hae Buru's wives apparently were not able to produce a male heir for Hae Buru until he was in old age. Hae Buru eventually got a son, Geumwa, of whom he trained and grew into his successor. When Hae Buru died in 48 BCE, Geumwa rose to the throne by proclaiming himself "King of Dongbuyeo."

Kopperunchinga II (reigned c. 1243-1279 CE) was a Kadava chieftain, who succeeded his father Kopperunchinga I and continued his successes against the Hoysalas. Since the Chola power no longer constituted a threat, Kopperunchinga II acted as the de facto protector of the Chola king and helped him maintain his position on the throne. As he expanded his territorial holdings, Kopperunchinga II assumed such titles as Maharajasimha, Khadgamalla, Kadava Pallava, Alappirandan, Avaniyalappirandan, Kanakasabhapathy, etc-. He has left numerous inscriptions mainly in the South Arcot and Chingleput districts and the northern portion of Thanjavur, and a few have also been found in the North Arcot and Chittoor districts.  Ultimately, however, the resurgence of the power of the Pandya kingdom of Madurai ended Kopperunchinga's reign and the Kadava dynasty.

CATEGORIES: 1988 in cycle racing, 1988 in Italian sport, Giro d'Italia

The 1988 Giro d'Italia was the 71st edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro started off in Urbino on 23 May with a [tpl]convert|9|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] individual time trial and concluded in Vittorio Veneto with a [tpl]convert|43|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] individual time trial on 12 June. Twenty teams entered the race, which was won by American Andrew Hampsten of the [tpl]ct|MOT|1988[/tpl] team. Second and third respectively were Dutchman Erik Breukink and Swiss rider, Urs Zimmermann. It was the third time – and the second year in succession – in the history of the Giro, that the podium was occupied solely by non-Italian riders. Breukink had been part of the non-Italian podium in 1987, behind Ireland's Stephen Roche and Great Britain's Robert Millar.
Hampsten first gained the race lead after the famed fourteenth stage, which crossed the Gavia Pass towards Bormio, and where the riders battled against a snowstorm, strong winds, and muddy roads. Beforehand, the overall classification had been headed for several days by Massimo Podenzana. He had participated in a breakaway during stage 4a, which won him sufficient time to hold the race leader's maglia rosa ([tpl]lang-en|pink jersey[/tpl]) for more than a week. Franco Chioccioli also wore the pink jersey for a two-stage period, before Hampsten took the lead. After stage 14, Hampsten began to build up a solid two-minute barrier against the second-placed rider, Breukink. This gap was sufficient to win Hampsten the race, despite losing around twenty seconds in the final two stages.
Hampsten became the first American, and non-European, to win the Giro. He also won the secondary mountains and combination classifications, as well as the special sprints classification In the other classifications, Fanini-Seven Up rider Stefano Tomasini of Italy placed ninth overall to finish as the best neo-professional in the general classification; Johan van der Velde of the GIS-Ecoflam-Jolly team was the winner of the points classification, and [tpl]ct|CAR|1988[/tpl] finished as the winners of the team classification.

"The Thin Wall" is Ultravox's first single from the Rage in Eden album, recorded in Conny Plank’s Studio in Cologne, Germany and released on Chrysalis Records on 14 August 1981.
The music video, directed by Russell Mulcahy, features Midge Ure struggling to cope among strange and nightmarish imagery, similar to a haunted house setting, while the other band members seemingly plot his demise.
The song is a fast and stark synth melody with obscure lyrics like many Ultravox songs and New Romantic music in general. It peaked at #14 in the UK Single Charts.
There is no extended version of "The Thin Wall" unlike other Ultravox singles; the A-side on the 12" is identical to the album version, while the 7" version is an edit.

The light-hitting Girard turned pro in 1991 and challenged Byron Mitchell for WBA Super Middleweight Title in 1999, in his first US fight. The fight was a draw, and in the rematch in 2000 Girard won a unanimous decision to win the belt. 
Girard defended the belt once against Manny Siaca and then was stripped of the title for declining a rematch. 
In late 2001 he moved up to light heavyweight and took on southpaw Lou Del Valle for the Vacant WBA Light Heavyweight Title and drew with him. Later that year, he took on Robert Koon for the Vacant belt, and won via TKO. 
He defended the belt twice before losing to Mehdi Sahnoune via 7th round TKO in 2003. Girard retired after the bout.

Crandon mine was a mine proposed for northeastern Wisconsin, USA. It was to be situated near the town of Crandon and the Mole Lake Ojibwe Reservation in Forest County. The mine was the center of a multi-decade political and regulatory battle between environmentalists, American Indian tribes, sportfishing groups, and the State of Wisconsin and several large mining corporations. The purchase of the mine site in 2003 by the Sokaogon Ojibwe and Forest County Potawatomi marked a major victory for the tribes and environmental activists, and raised questions about the future of mining, economics, and tribal power in Wisconsin.

[[Indictment and arrest of Augusto Pinochet]]

CATEGORIES: Indictment and arrest of Augusto Pinochet, 1998 in Chile, 1998 in London, 1998 in law

General Augusto Pinochet was indicted for human rights violations committed in his native Chile by Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón on 10 October 1998. He was arrested in London six days later and held for a year and a half before finally being released by the British government in March 2000. Authorized to freely return to Chile, Pinochet was there first indicted by judge Juan Guzmán Tapia, and charged with a number of crimes, before dying on 10 December 2006, without having been convicted in any case. His arrest in London made the front-page of newspapers worldwide as not only did it involve the head of the military dictatorship that ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990, but it was the first time that several European judges applied the principle of universal jurisdiction, declaring themselves competent to judge crimes committed by former heads of state, despite local amnesty laws.
Pinochet came to power in a violent 11 September 1973 coup which deposed Socialist President Salvador Allende. His 17-year regime was responsible for numerous human rights violations, a number of which committed as part of Operation Condor, an illegal effort to suppress political opponents in Chile and abroad in coordination with foreign intelligence agencies. Pinochet was also accused of using his position to pursue personal enrichment through embezzlement of government funds, the illegal drug trade and illegal arms trade. The Rettig Report found that at least 2,279 persons were conclusively murdered by the Chilean government for political reasons during Pinochet's regime, and the Valech Report found that at least 30,000 persons were tortured by the government for political reasons.
Pinochet's attorneys, headed by Pablo Rodríguez Grez (former leader of the far-right group Fatherland and Liberty), argued that he was entitled to immunity from prosecution first as a former head of state, then under the 1978 amnesty law passed by the military junta. They furthermore claimed that his alleged poor health made him unfit to stand trial. A succession of judgments by various Courts of Appeal, the Supreme Court, medical experts, etc., led to Pinochet's successive house arrest and release, before he finally died on 10 December 2006, just after having been again put under house arrest on 28 November 2006 in the Caravan of Death case.Procesan a Pinochet y ordenan su arresto por los secuestros y homicidios de la "Caravana de la Muerte", 20minutos, 28 November 2006.

Wolfgang Přiklopil (May 14, 1962 – August 23, 2006) was an Austrian communications technician. In 1998, he kidnapped 10-year-old Natascha Kampusch and held her for eight years, committing suicide after she escaped.
Přiklopil was born to Karl and Waltraud Přiklopil, in Vienna, an only child. Karl was a cognac salesman and Waltraud a shoe saleswoman.[tpl]cite news | title = The silence of the lamb | work = Guardian | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-2483706_2,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-10  | location=London | first=Patrick | last=Foster[/tpl] Přiklopil worked for a time at Siemens as a communications technician.
Přiklopil kidnapped Kampusch on the morning of March 2, 1998 as she was on her way to school, eventually keeping her in a custom built basement (sometimes referred to as a "dungeon" in news reports) under his house in Strasshof, Lower Austria.  The house was built by Přiklopil's grandfather, Oskar Přiklopil, after World War II. During the Cold War period, Oskar and his son Karl built a bomb shelter, thought to be the origin of Kampusch's dungeon.  Přiklopil took over the house in 1984 following his grandmother's death.
Kampusch escaped on August 23, 2006. After a police chase, from which he escaped, Přiklopil committed suicide by stepping in front of a moving train near the Vienna Northern Station.[tpl]cite news | first = Duke| last = Katie| title = 'Respect my privacy' says kidnap victim | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/austria/article/0,,1859303,00.html| work = Guardian Unlimited| date = 2006-08-27| accessdate = 2006-08-27 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|publisher=Washington Post|date=24 August 2006|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/24/AR2006082400174.html|title=Austrian girl's suspected kidnapper kills himself|accessdate=2006-08-25|first=Karin|last=Strohecker[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

[[Sadz]]
CATEGORIES: History of Russia, Ethnic groups in Turkey, Abkhaz diaspora, Sub-ethnic groups

The Sadz or Asadzwa, also Jigets are a subethnic group of the Abkhazians. They are sometimes purported to have originated from the Sanigoi tribe mentioned by the Classic authors. In the 6th century, they formed a tribal principality, which later commingled with the Abasgoi, Apsilae and Missimianoi into the Kingdom of Abkhazia. 
Until 1864 Sadz lived at the Black Sea coast north to Gagra until the Khosta River (Khamysh River). They formed the Sadzyn area, which consisted of the possessions of Kamysh, Arydba, Amarshan and Gechba clans, under the hegemony of Tsanba clan. The Ubykh princes Oblagua, Chizmaa and Dziash also originated from the Sadz. 
Some think that in the 12-14th centuries a part of the Sadz have been forced to resettle to the northern mountainside of Caucasus Major under the Ubykh pressure. They formed there Abazin people. This is only one of the theories explaining the migration from Abkhazia of the ancestors of what is now the Abaza people. After the Russian-Circassian War ended in 1864 the most of Sadz were forced to turn muhajirs, moving to the Ottoman Empire. Some of them settled in Adjara (then under the Ottoman possession).
Now the Sadz dialect of the Abkhaz language is spoken only in Turkey. It consists of Akhaltsys and Tswyzhy subdialects.
The Sadz, Aibga and Akhchipsou tribes of Abkhazia were the last ethnic groups to have offered the resistance to the Russian advances during the Caucasus War. The last tribes conquered by Russians were Ahchypsy and Aibga, who lived in and around of what is now Krasnaya Polyana.

John Hamal Hubbard was born on October 6 or 7, 1945 (the actual date is unknown). He is an American mathematician who is currently a professor at Cornell University and the Université de Provence. He is well known for the mathematical contributions he made with Adrien Douady in the field of complex dynamics, including a study of the Mandelbrot set.  One of their most important results is that the Mandelbrot set is connected.
Hubbard graduated with a Doctorat d'État from Université de Paris-Sud in 1973 under the direction of Adrien Douady; his thesis was entitled Sur Les Sections Analytiques de La Courbe Universelle de Teichmüller and was published by the American Mathematical Society. Hubbard has a variety of mathematical interests ranging from complex analysis to differential geometry. He has written many influential papers on complex dynamics,[tpl]cite journal|last = Douady|first = Adrien|coauthors = Hubbard, John Hamal|title = On the dynamics of polynomial-like mappings|journal = Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure|volume = 18|issue = 2|year = 1985|pages = 287–343|url = http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/search?h=nc&ma=67319&id=ASENS_1985_4_18_2_287_0&format=complete|accessdate = 2007-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last = Hubbard|first = John H|coauthors = Oberste-Vorth, Ralph W.|title = Hénon mappings in the complex domain I : the global topology of dynamical space|journal = Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS|volume = 79|pages = 5–46|year = 1994|url = http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?h=nc&id=PMIHES_19945_0|accessdate = 2007-03-11[/tpl]John H. Hubbard and Ralph W. Oberste-Vorth (1994) Henon mappings in the complex domain II: projective and inductive limits of polynomials and he has written several books. In 2006, he has completed another: the first volume of a series devoted to Teichmüller theory and applications to four revolutionary theorems of  William Thurston. Hubbard is a former student of Harvard University's infamous Math 55, where he famously struggled initially because he "just didn't know proofs," a somewhat shocking fact considering his eventual mathematical successes. He later returned to Harvard to teach that same class. However, Hubbard garnered a rather profound distaste for Math 55's method of teaching proofs largely centered around algebraic induction. In response, he wrote a book entitled Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach, on which his wife Barbara is listed as a co-author. At Cornell University, he routinely teaches Math 2230 & 2240, classes specifically structured around this same text. When asked how well these classes correspond to Math 55, he responded: "This class may indeed be somewhat easier than Math 55, albeit perhaps covering slightly more material." Hubbard is known throughout the Cornell community for his very relaxed style of teaching. He often starts class late, after a period of conversing with students on a variety of more personal, informal topics, such as his hobby of collecting and purveying various local varieties of mushrooms found across campus, easily citing the given binomial nomenclature for each species.

[[Ford Quadricycle]]

CATEGORIES: 1896 introductions, Ford vehicles, First automobile made by manufacturer, Automobiles powered by boxer engines

The Ford Quadricycle was the first vehicle developed by Henry Ford. Ford's first car was a simple frame with an ethanol-powered engine and four bicycle wheels mounted on it.
The earliest cars were hand built, one by one, and very expensive.  The peculiar machines were seen as toys for the rich.[tpl]cite book |title=Crazy Cars |last=Doeden |first=Matt |year=2007 |publisher=Lerner Publications |isbn= 978-0-8225-6565-9|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Nzvq_4WqIjQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA4&dq=quadricycle+ford&ots=uzqmRIUD-D&sig=0qmQCUnGkdmFpU_AGOCrTSOJB5M#v=onepage&q=quadricycle%20ford&f=false[/tpl]
In the 1890s, the "horseless carriage" was a relatively new idea, with no one having a fixed, universal idea of what a car should look like or how it should work.  Most of the first car builders were inventors, rather than businessmen, working with their imaginations and the parts they had on hand.  Thus, the invention of the Quadricycle marks an important innovation as a proto-automobile that would lay the foundation for future, more practical designs to follow.

Ford put the finishing touches on his pure ethanol-powered motor After more than two years of experimentation, Ford, at the age of 32, had completed his first experimental automobile. He dubbed his creation the "Quadricycle," so named because it ran on four bicycle tires, and/or because of the means through which the engine drove the back wheels.Brinkley, David, Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress, (New York: Penguin Group, 2003), p.22 The success of the little vehicle led to the founding of the Henry Ford Company and then later the Ford Motor Company in 1903.The Showroom of Automotive History: 1896 Quadricycle

The Indy Japan 300 presented by Bridgestone was an Indy Racing League IndyCar Series race held at Twin Ring Motegi in Motegi, Japan. The 2008 race marked the historic first ever win for a woman driver in American open wheel racing when Danica Patrick of Andretti-Green Racing took the checkered flag.
The first American open-wheel race in Japan was held in 1966 at Fuji Speedway. Jackie Stewart won the Fuji Japan 200, which was held as an exhibition race, and no championship points were awarded. USAC did not return.
For a short period in the late 1980s and early 1990s the CART series explored the prospects of holding a race in Japan. Possible locations would be either Suzuka, Fuji, or a street course in another city. The FIA objected, citing conflicts with Formula One and other interests. In addition, rules were put into place requiring that any CART race outside of North America be held on an oval. Despite the objections, in 1991 CART made their first trip across the Pacific Ocean, and held a street race at Surfer's Paradise, Australia. The plans for a race in Japan were scrapped.
In 1994, Honda joined the CART series, and by 1996, was widely successful. Interest in holding a race in Japan resurfaced, and upon the completion of the Twin Ring Motegi oval, a race was first held in 1998 without FIA objection. The race continued as a Champ Car event through 2002. In 2003, Honda switched alliances to the Indy Racing League, and the race became an Indycar Series event.  On February 9, 2011, it was announced that the series would not return to Motegi for the 2012 season.[tpl]cite web|last=Lewandowski|first=Dave|title=Sayonara, Twin Ring Motegi|url=http://www.indycar.com/news/show/55-izod-indycar-series/41218-sayonara-twin-ring-motegi/|work=IndyCar.com|accessdate=13 February 2011[/tpl]

The Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre is the maritime museum of the Royal Australian Navy. The centre opened on 4 October 2005 and is located within the Public Access Area on the northern end of Garden Island Naval base.
The need for such a facility was first recognised in 1922, by Vice Admiral Sir William Creswell who suggested the building of a museum to permanently display the Australian Navy’s already rich and unique heritage. Since then, there have been several attempts to establish an international-standard naval museum.
The origins of the RANHC date from 2001, when the then Chief of the Navy commissioned a Naval Heritage Management Study to examine in detail how the RAN’s past might best be used to support the present Navy’s goals. One of the most important recommendations was the creation of a facility for the public display of the Naval Heritage Collection (NHC). Once approval for funding was received, a RANHC Project Board was formed and the project began on 24 May 2004. The NHC contains more than 250,000 individual items, and the mission of the RANHC is to display those objects of museum standard to the public, and through these displays capture something of the Australian naval experience.

Dogs is the first album by American singer-songwriter Nina Nastasia. It was originally released in 2000 by Socialist Records and re-released in 2004 by Touch and Go Records.
John Peel has described the album as "astonishing".

Engineer Steve Albini has described it as one of the albums he is the most proud of, as well as one of his personal favorites:   "In the process of making a record, you hear it so many times that the charms of even the best of them can wear off through over-exposure. On rare occasions, records I've worked on have withstood this scrutiny and ended up being personal favorites. Nina Nastasia's 'Dogs' is a record so simultaneously unassuming and grandiose that I can't really describe it, except in terms that would make it (and me) sound silly. Of the couple thousand records I've been involved with, this is one of my favourites, and one that I'm proud to be associated with."

Robert Porcher ([tpl]IPAc-en|p|ɔr|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ[/tpl]; born July 30, 1969) is a former American football defensive end. He played college football for Willie Jeffries at South Carolina State University.  He played for the Detroit Lions his entire professional career. He retired before the 2004 season with 95.5 career sacks. Porcher has been involved in the Detroit community since his retirement.  He has opened 3 successful businesses in Downtown Detroit: Detroit Breakfast House & Grill, Sweet Georgia Brown, and Seldom Blues.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metrotimes.com/guide/restaurants/review.asp?id=9565 |title=Detroit Breakfast House & Grill - Upscale, down-home |accessdate=2008-05-16 |last=Slaughter |first=Jane |coauthors= |date=2005-10-26 |work=Metro Times |publisher=[/tpl]
Porcher is perhaps best recognized as a standout with the Detroit Lions. A 6-foot-3, 275-pound defensive-end, Porcher was a dominant pass-rush specialist and defensive leader.
During much of his 13-year playing career, he was one of the league's most productive and feared defensive ends. Originally a first-round draft choice in 1992 from South Carolina State University, Porcher played in 187 games (third all-time in Detroit history), and set a team record with 95.5 quarterback sacks during his career. He led Detroit in sacks eight times (also a Detroit record). He also became the first Lion to record double-digit sack totals in four consecutive seasons (1996–99).
Porcher earned trips to the Pro Bowl in 1998, 2000 and 2002. He also finished his career with 24 career games notching more than one sack. From 1996-01, Porcher garnered 68 sacks during that six-year period - which was the second-highest in the NFL during that span. His 673 career tackles are ranked seventh in Detroit Lions’ history.
Off the field, Porcher became actively involved in the community. His foundation for cancer research and relief fund raised thousands of dollars for programs at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. The Lions annual Man of the Year award is named the "Robert Porcher Man of the Year" in honor of his tremendous contributions to the community, especially in Detroit.
Porcher is now an entrepreneur, with various business interests - most notably food/hospitality in downtown Detroit: Detroit Breakfast House & Grill, Sweet Georgia Brown, and Seldom Blues.[ref]

The Bagutta Prize is an Italian literary prize that is awarded annually to Italian writers. The prize originated among patrons of Milan's Bagutta Ristorante. The writer Riccardo Bacchelli discovered the restaurant and soon he regularly gathered numerous friends who would dine there together and discuss books. They began charging fines to the person who arrived last to an appointed meal, or who failed to appear. 
At first the funds so collected were spent on miscellaneous items, but on 11 November 1927 the group decided to use the funds to create a literary prize. They named it after the restaurant.
Other directors of the prize include Emilio Tadini, Mario Soldati, and Isabella Bossi Fedrigotti.

[[Ontological security]]
CATEGORIES: Ontology, Sociological terminology

Ontological security is a stable mental state derived from a sense of continuity in regard to the events in one's life. Giddens (1991) refers to ontological security as a sense of order and continuity in regard to an individual’s experiences. He argues that this is reliant on people’s ability to give meaning to their lives. Meaning is found in experiencing positive and stable emotions, and by avoiding chaos and anxiety (ibid; Elias, 1985). If an event occurs that is not consistent with the meaning of an individual's life, this will threaten that individual's ontological security. Ontological security also involves having a positive view of self, the world and the future.

The occupation of the Ottoman Bank ([tpl]lang-hy|Պանք Օթօմանի Գրաւումը[/tpl], Bank Otomani Cravumĕ "Ottoman Bank takeover") by members of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnak Party) took place in Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, on 26 August 1896. In an effort to raise further awareness and action by the major European powers, 28 armed men and women led primarily by Papken Siuni and Armen Karo took over the bank which largely employed European personnel from Great Britain and France. Stirred largely due to the inaction of the European powers in regards to pogroms and massacres instigated by the Sultan Abdul-Hamid II, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation members saw its seizure as their best attempt to bring full attention to the massacres. The Ottoman bank, at the time, served as an important financial center for both the Empire and the countries of Europe.
Armed with pistols, grenades, dynamite and hand-held bombs, the seizure of the bank lasted for 14 hours, resulting in the deaths of ten of the Armenian men and Ottoman soldiers. The Ottoman reaction to the takeover saw further massacres and pogroms of 6,000 Armenians living in Constantinople and also Hamid threatening to level the entire building itself.Bloxham, Donald. The Great Game of Genocide. Imperialism, Nationalism, and The Destruction of The Ottoman Armenians. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 53. ISBN 0-19-927356-1 However, intervention on part of the European diplomats in the city managed to persuade the men to give, assigning safe passage to the survivors to France. Despite the level of violence the incident had wrought, the takeover was reported positively in the European press, praising the men for their courage and the objectives they attempted to accomplish.Balakian, Peter. The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response. New York: HarperCollins, 2003, pp. 107–8. Nevertheless, aside from issuing a note condemning the pogroms in the city, the European powers did not act on their promises to enforce reforms in the country as future massacres of Armenians continued to take place.

The highway is located in Galveston, Chambers, and Jefferson counties and also serves the communities of Hamshire, Fannett, and Cheek. A portion of SH 124 is part of a longer coastal hurricane evacuation route.
The route number was originally assigned over a portion of the current [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|16[/tpl] between Fredericksburg and Comanche in Central Texas during the late 1920s. By the early 1930s, the route number was assigned along the current route south of Stowell to High Island and along the current SH 87 to Port Bolivar and eventually Galveston.

Scott Andrew Mink (October 13, 1963 – July 20, 2004) was executed by the State of Ohio. A drug addict and alcoholic, he had been sentenced to die on June 29, 2001, for beating his 79-year-old father and 72-year-old mother to death with a hammer.
The crimes occurred on September 19, 2000, when Mink, angry with his parents because they hid his car keys to prevent him from leaving the house to buy drugs and alcohol, attacked William and Sheila Mink while they slept in their rural Montgomery County home. 
Enraged at being thwarted in his quest to get high, Mink beat his sleeping parents with a claw hammer until the head broke. He then battered them with cutting boards until those shattered. Finally, he repeatedly stabbed his parents with kitchen knives and strangled his mother with an electrical cord. Mink then stole his parents' credit cards and sold their belongings to purchase crack cocaine. He later confessed the brutal slayings to police.
He pled guilty before a panel of three judges and asked for a death sentence, which the judges handed down. Under Ohio law, all death sentences are automatically reviewed by an appellate court regardless of the inmate's desire to appeal. After his conviction was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court on direct appeal in April 2004, Mink dropped his efforts to fight his sentence.
Mink spent 1,118 days (i.e., 3 years and 23 days) on death row before being executed by lethal injection – the second-shortest time, aside from Rocky Barton, since Ohio began executing criminals in 1999.

[[Agar diffusion test]]
CATEGORIES: Microbiology techniques

Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing (KB testing or disk diffusion antibiotic sensitivity testing) is a test which uses antibiotic-impregnated wafers to test whether particular bacteria are susceptible to specific antibiotics. A known quantity of bacteria are grown on agar plates in the presence of thin wafers containing relevant antibiotics. If the bacteria are susceptible to a particular antibiotics, an area of clearing surrounds the wafer where bacteria are not capable of growing (called a zone of inhibition).
The bacteria in question is swabbed uniformly across a culture plate. A filter-paper disk, impregnated with the compound to be tested, is then placed on the surface of the agar. The compound diffuses from the filter paper into the agar. The concentration of the compound will be highest next to the disk, and will decrease as distance from the disk increases. If the compound is effective against bacteria at a certain concentration, no colonies will grow where the concentration in the agar is greater than or equal to the effective concentration. This is the zone of inhibition. This along with the rate of antibiotic diffusion are used to estimate the bacteria's sensitivity to that particular antibiotic. In general, larger zones correlate with smaller minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotic for that bacteria. Inhibition produced by the test is compared with that produced by known concentration of a reference compound. This information can be used to choose appropriate antibiotics to combat a particular infection.

[[Weber and German politics]]

CATEGORIES: Max Weber

This article is about the political views and activities of the German sociologist Max Weber.
Weber described himself as a left-wing liberal. An example of his 19th-century liberal views is staunch nationalism based on classical republicanism, and that a nation with freedom for individuals is maintained by the virtues and character of its citizens. He also had a strong belief in the benefits of capitalism. Weber's assertion that capitalism had deep Christian origins was, ultimately, a political defense of the market system. His work stands in sharp contrast to socialists like Werner Sombart or RH Tawney, who argued that capitalism was fundamentally un-Christian.

Katowice-Muchowiec Airport ([tpl]lang-pl|Lotnisko Katowice-Muchowiec[/tpl], ICAO code: EPKM) is a general aviation (mainly sport use) airport in the Muchowiec neighbourhood of Katowice, Poland.
It has one inoperative concrete runway, RWY 05/23 with the dimensions of [tpl]convert|1109|x|30|m|ft[/tpl]. There is a displaced threshold length of [tpl]convert|221|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] on both RWY 05 and RWY 23, yielding a landing distance of [tpl]convert|888|m|ft|abbr=off[/tpl]. However, coal-mining activity damaged the runway and it is no longer used. The parallel 770-metre grass RWY 05/23 is also closed per NOTAM until the end of 2007. This leaves the 655-metre grass RWY 07/25 as the sole working runway.
The airport was built in the 1920s, and was used for civil aviation including scheduled passenger traffic, starting in 1926 with service to Warsaw. Ground damage due to coal-mining activity eliminated the passenger traffic, and now only the sport use remains with infrequent general aviation arrivals and departures.
On the other hand, because of the long commute from the city centre to the 30 km-distant Katowice International Airport, it has been proposed to the Katowice government in 2005 that a city airport be built at Katowice-Muchowiec Airport, offloading Katowice International for general aviation as well as some smaller scheduled traffic, serving primarily the business community and STOL aircraft.

In the United States, affirmative action refers to  equal opportunity employment measures that Federal contractors and subcontractors are legally required to adopt. These measures are intended to prevent discrimination against employees or applicants for employment on the basis of "color, religion, sex, or national origin". Examples of affirmative action offered by the United States Department of Labor include outreach campaigns, targeted recruitment, employee and management development, and employee support programs.
The impetus toward affirmative action is to redress the disadvantages associated with overt historical discrimination.[tpl]cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/ |title=Affirmative Action |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26[/tpl] Further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve.
Affirmative action is a subject of controversy. Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger. Affirmative action as a practice was upheld by the court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger.

Žirmūnai ([tpl]IPA-lt|ʒirˈmuːnɐi|pron|Lt_Zirmunai.ogg[/tpl]) ([tpl]lang-pl|Żyrmuny[/tpl]), ([tpl]lang-ru|Жирму́най[/tpl]) is the most populous administrative division (elderate) in Vilnius. It is also a neighbourhood in the Lithuanian capital city Vilnius, encompassing the city district of the same name, built in the 1960s.
Žirmūnai's history has been traced to the late 14th century, when a Lithuanian fishing village was founded across the River Neris from Vilnius' Old Town. Several historic sites in Žirmūnai are internationally significant; it is the home of Lithuania's largest Jewish cemetery, as well as the location of mass graves of soldiers belonging to Napoleon's Grande Armée and victims of the NKGB's and MGB's executions after World War II.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite serial |url=http://www.lietuvospilys.lt/data/tiltas-krosnis.htm |title=Archaeological research near King Mindaugas Bridge|accessdate=2007-02-19 |author=Gediminas Gendrėnas, Egidijus Ožalas|date=2002-2003 |publisher=Vilniaus pilys[/tpl] Tuskulėnai Manor, built in 1825, and the surrounding Peace Park  are important historical and cultural attractions in Vilnius. 
The area was given the name Žirmūnai during the early 1960s, when it became the site of an award-winning residential construction project; it was the first city district in the Lithuanian SSR to be constructed applying urban planning concepts established in the USSR at the time. The massive Palace of Concerts and Sports and Žalgiris Stadium are other relics of Žirmūnai's Soviet history. Žirmūnai was important to the industrial sector in the USSR; since that time, this function has been replaced or supplanted by newer businesses, including some of Lithuania's leading companies.
Žirmūnai has undergone major renovation and development in the 21st century. Šiaurės miestelis ("North Town") is an area of Žirmūnai that has rapidly evolved into one of the key business and residential districts of the city. This quarter was used by a number of regimes as a military garrison, and internationally significant historical findings have been made in the area.

The United States Senior Men's Amateur Golf Championship is a national tournament for amateur golf competitors at least 55 years of age.  It is operated by the United States Golf Association (USGA).
The tournament starts with 36 holes of stroke play, with the top 64 competitors advancing to the match play portion of the tournament.  Golfers must have a USGA handicap index of 7.4 or lower to enter.
The tournament was founded in 1955, expanding on a tournament conducted by the U.S. Senior Golf Association (not affiliated with the USGA), which itself had grown from a senior amateur event at the Apawamis Golf Club in the early 1900s.  Membership in this precursor tournament was limited, so the USGA agreed to start a national championship open to all senior golfers.
Senior Amateur contestants have been permitted to ride in carts since 1969.

thumb|J. C. WilliamsonJames Cassius Williamson (August 26, 1845 – July 6, 1913) was an American actor and later Australia's foremost theatrical manager, founding J. C. Williamson Ltd.
Born in Pennsylvania, Williamson moved with his family to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  His father died when he was eleven years old.  He acted in amateur theatricals and joined a local theatre company as a call-boy at the age of 15, soon taking roles and eventually moving to New York where he played for several years at Wallack's Theatre and then other New York theatres.  In 1871, he became the leading comedian at the California Theatre in San Francisco and the next year married comedienne Maggie Moore.  
The two found success touring in Australia, and then playing in London, the U.S. and elsewhere in a comedy called Struck Oil.  In 1879, Williamson obtained the right to present H.M.S. Pinafore and then other Gilbert and Sullivan operas in Australia.  He soon formed his Royal Comic Opera Company.  In 1881, Williamson became the lessee of the Theatre Royal, and the next year he entered into a partnership with Arthur Garner and George Musgrove, expanding to own more theatres and bringing famous actors to Australia, such as Sarah Bernhardt, H. B. Irving and (Dame) Nellie Melba, and becoming known for spectacular, large-scale productions. 
After 1907, Williamson moved his family to Europe and, his old partners having left, he hired capable managers and changed the theatre company's name to J. C. Williamson Ltd.  Williamson died in 1913, but he left a strong theatrical empire that became the largest theatrical firm in the world, with extensive film and property holdings.  The company continued to produce seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, operetta, musical comedy, straight plays, pantomimes and occasional musical revues, and later grand opera, ballet seasons, and concert tours by visiting celebrity singers and musicians, at the many theatres that it owned or leased throughout Australia and New Zealand.  It also toured and presented shows in London and elsewhere.  In 1976, the company closed and leased out its name.

Fahad Saleh Al-Ghesheyan ([tpl]lang-ar|فهد صالح الغشيان[/tpl]) (born August 1, 1973) is a former Saudi Arabian football (soccer) player who participated in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, scoring one goal against Sweden in the Round of 16.[tpl]FIFA player|94332|Fahad Al Ghesheyan[/tpl] Al-Ghesheyan played for Al-Hilal at the time.
Fahad Al-Ghesheyan is also known as the first Saudi player to play in Europe when he moved to AZ Alkmaar in the Netherlands. AZ's manager at that time was Willem van Hanegem, who previously managed Al-Hilal. He had been impressed by Al-Ghesyan back in Hilal. Al-Ghesheyan was known to be a right winger with good dribbling skills but a lack of professionalism and consistency.
Al-Ghesheyan first came into the spotlight when he was part of Saudi Arabia's Asian Youth Cup qualifiers, where he guided the Saudi team to qualification. He was the main star player in the match between Saudi Arabia vs Brazil in that FIFA World Youth Cup where he was too much dominating player and singly took over the momentum of the game. Brazilians were not able to control his pace and ball-control and it was because of him that Saudi Arabia totally dominated over Brazil in the Mid-Field and many counter-attacks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
Being on top of his game, he tried to break into the senior team back in 1994 but his path was blocked by a Saudi side then rich in prolific attacking players, like Majid Abdullah, Sami Al Jabir, Fahad Al Mahalel and Saeed Owairan. Being a winger, the coaches rarely gave him a chance to play.
He was only introduced in the second half when Saudi were already two goals behind Sweden – even though he managed to get the score to 2–1 while missing another close chance to make it 2–2 before Sweden finally finished the game off at 3–1.
Somewhere down the line, he fell out with his club's management. To his astonishment, he was sold to Al Naser, who were Hilal's derby rivals in Riyadh. Fans[tpl]Who|date=April 2011[/tpl] could not believe that their best player had just left and joined Naser, and he was upset that after he left he only played a few games for Naser, and soon quit the game out of frustration of not being able to play for his boyhood club Hilal.  He retired early when he was only 25 or 26 years old.
He later moved to the netherlands, to AZ Alkmaar for a brief spell.

[[Open-circuit voltage]]
CATEGORIES: Electrical parameters

Open-circuit voltage (abbreviated as OCV or VOC ) is the difference of electrical potential between two terminals of a device when disconnected from any circuit.http://www.learnabout-electronics.org/resistors_18.php There is no external load connected. No external electric current flows between the terminals.  It is sometimes given the symbol Voc. In network analysis this voltage is also known as the Thévenin voltage.
The open-circuit voltages of batteries and solar cells are often quoted under particular conditions (state-of-charge, illumination, temperature, etc.).
Open Circuit Potential is important since the metal with the low open potential will dissolve faster in the electrolyte than the metal with high open circuit potential.

[[Chestnut-capped Brush Finch]]
CATEGORIES: Emberizidae, Birds of El Salvador

The  Chestnut-capped Brush Finch (Arremon brunneinucha), is a  passerine bird  which breeds in highlands from central Mexico to southeastern Peru. Despite its name, it is not a true  finch, but rather a member of the large Emberizidae family, which also includes buntings,  American sparrows,  juncos and towhees. Until recently, it was generally placed in the genus Buarremon,Cadena, C. D., J. Klicka and R. E. Ricklefs. (2007). Evolutionary differentiation in the Neotropical montane region: molecular phylogenetics and phylogeography of Buarremon brush-finches (Aves, Emberizidae). Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution. 44(3): 993-1016. while it occasionally has been placed in Atlapetes.
This is a common bird in the undergrowth of wet mountain forests, second growth, and ravines from  900 m to 2500 m altitude.
The nest, built by the female, is a large cup of plant material placed less than 2.5 m up in a shrub or small tree in dense scrub or a ravine. The typical clutch is two glossy, unmarked white or pale blue eggs, which are incubated by the female alone for 12–14 days to hatching. 
The Chestnut-capped Brush Finch is a large, robust, mainly terrestrial species, 19 cm long and weighing 45 g. It has a long slender bill  and large feet and legs. The adult has a distinctive head pattern, with a yellow-edged chestnut crown and nape, black forehead and head sides, white spots in the centre and each side of the forehead, and a white throat which is often puffed up  when the bird is excited. The upperparts are dark olive, with darker wings . The white central breast is separated from the white throat by a black band. The breast sides are grey, and the flanks and lower belly are olive-green.   Young birds have a sooty-brown cap, sooty face and olive-brown upperparts, throat and breast.
The Chestnut-capped Brush Finch has a thiny pink call and a very high-pitched psssst. The male’s song consists of  a mixture of whistles and sharper notes.
The Chestnut-capped Brush Finch feeds on insects and spiders  extracted from the leaf litter with its bill, and also pick  berries and invertebrate prey from low bushes.  It is seen in pairs, family parties, or with warblers and other Emberizids as part of a mixed-species feeding flock.

[[List of Australian floral emblems]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of Australian plants, Lists of flowers, National emblems

This is a list of Australian floral emblems.  It encompasses the national flower and the official flowers of the constituent states.
After the Federation of Australia took place in 1901, the upsurge in nationalism led to the search for an official national floral emblem. Archibald Campbell had founded the Wattle Club in Victoria in 1899 to promote interest in and profile of the wattle as a unique Australian flower. The New South Wales waratah was considered alongside the wattle Acacia pycnantha, although lost out to the latter in 1912. The economist and botanist R. T. Baker proposed that the waratah's endemism to the Australian continent made it a better choice than the wattle, as well as the prominence  of its flowers. The South Australian Evening News also supported the bid, but to no avail.[tpl]cite book|last=Nixon|first=Paul|title=The Waratah|publisher=Kangaroo Press|location=East Roseville, NSW|year=1997|origyear=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-86417-878-6|page=85[/tpl]
In New South Wales, the New South Wales waratah was proclaimed as the official floral emblem of the state in 1962 by the then governor Sir Eric Woodward, after being used informally for many years.Nixon, p. 86. 
The Cooktown Orchid (Vappodes phalaenopsis), has been the official floral emblem of Queensland since 19 November 1959.[ref]

In November 1960, Anigozanthos manglesii was adopted as the floral emblem of Western Australia in a proclamation made by then Premier of Western Australia David Brand, to promote tourist interest in the State's wildflowers.

CATEGORIES: Contemporary dance companies, Dance companies in Canada, Culture of Vancouver, Performing groups established in 1993, 1993 establishments in Canada

The Holy Body Tattoo is a now defunct award-winning Canadian contemporary dance company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Formed in 1993 by co-artistic directors and choreographers Noam Gagnon and Dana Gingras, who had performed together since 1987, and also Jean-Yves Thériault composer-musician and co-founder of Voivod, initially as a multi-media dance company, they have performed throughout Canada, Europe, Asia, and the United States, and received international critical acclaim as well.
Their works often comment on modern life through repetitive and strenuous physical movement that pushes performers to the point of exhaustion. This technique is based on the idea that the secrets locked within the body will be revealed when pushed to its limit.
The company has been Artist in Residence at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre since 1998 and has captured a number of significant awards and honours for both its stage and film work. In 1997, our brief eternity won The Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best Ensemble Performance.
Their performances have included collaborations with musical, visual, and literary artists including author William Gibson, UK bands Tindersticks and The Tiger Lillies, visual artist Jenny Holzer and Bill Pechet.
Their repertoire includes the works White Riot and Poetry & Apocalypse (1994); our brief eternity (1996); Circa (2000), a tango-influenced pas de deux; Running Wild (2004); and monumental (2005), which explored modern anxiety in urban corporate culture.
Poetry & Apocalypse was adapted into a film in 1997 by William Morrison (director).

[[... Not!]]

CATEGORIES: 1990s slang, English grammar, Word of the year, Saturday Night Live catch-phrases

... Not! is a grammatical construction in the English language that became a sardonic catchphrase in North America in the 1990s. A declarative statement is made, followed by a pause and then an emphatic "not!" is postfixed. The result is a negation of the original declarative statement.
According to the above, the phrase "He is a nice guy... not!" is synonymous to "He is not a nice guy". Whereas the latter structure is a neutral observation, the former expresses rather an annoyance, and is most often used jocularly.
Popularized in North America in the 1990s by a Saturday Night Live skit and subsequent movie Wayne's World, it can be found earliest in print in an 1893 Princeton Tiger (March 30) 103: "An Historical Parallel-- Not." It was such a popular catch phrase that it was selected as the 1992 Word of the Year by the American Dialect Society.
The "Not!" catchphrase was the basis of a scene in the 2006 movie Borat where a lecturer in humour attempted to explain the grammatical construction to Borat with limited success.
The comedic utility of the word became apparent, again, in February 2011 in Canada, when a minister of the Crown, Bev Oda, was implicated in a scandal that saw her deny knowledge of the insertion of the word "not" on a legal document denying funding to a respected non-profit organization and offer no explanation as to how her signature appeared on the document. Normal procedure would, of course, have been not to sign the approval document. She later told a Committee of Canada's House of Commons (parliament) that she had no idea where the insertion of the word "not" came from. Weeks later, she claimed that she ordered its insertion. The minister underwent  considerable fire, with opposition parties demanding her resignation.http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/in-wake-of-oda-controversy-ottawa-must-explain-why-aid-decisions-are-made/article1910799/ She resigned on July 3, 2012.

Four branded products have been the object of legal, ethical, and health concerns related to the company allegedly marketing them to the underaged and the danger of combining alcohol and caffeine.

The terms a priori ("from the earlier") and a posteriori ("from the later") are used in philosophy (epistemology) to distinguish two types of knowledge,  justification, or argument:
There are many points of view on these two types of knowledge, and their relationship is one of the oldest problems in modern philosophy.
The terms a priori and a posteriori are primarily used as adjectives to modify the noun "knowledge", or taken to be compound nouns that refer to types of knowledge (for example, "a priori knowledge").  However, "a priori" is sometimes used as an adjective to modify other nouns, such as "truth". Additionally, philosophers often modify this use. For example, "apriority" and "aprioricity" are sometimes used as nouns to refer (approximately) to the quality of being "a priori".[tpl]harvnb|Kitcher|2001[/tpl][tpl]failed verification|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Although definitions and use of the terms have varied in the history of philosophy, they have consistently labelled two separate epistemological notions. See also the related distinctions:  deductive/inductive, analytic/synthetic, necessary/contingent.

[[Khmer traditional wrestling]]
CATEGORIES: Cambodian martial arts, Folk wrestling styles

Khmer traditional wrestling (Bok Cham Babចំបាប់) is a folk wrestling style from Cambodia. It has been practiced as far back as the Angkor period and is depicted on the bas-reliefs of certain temples. Although predominantly a male sport today, Khmer wrestling was once practiced by both sexes as female wrestlers are also displayed on the Banteay Srei temple. In Khmer wrestling, the dancing is as important as the wrestling. There is a pre-match ritual dancing before the match in which the wrestlers dance and move to the music. Matches consists of three rounds. Victory is obtained by forcing the opponent on their back. The person who is able to win two of the three rounds is the winner of the match. After each round the loser is asked if he wishes to continue with the match. The match is accompanied by the music of two drums (called skor ngey and chhmol which means female drum and male drum). Traditional matches are held during the Khmer New Year and other Cambodian on holidays. This sport used to be a means of choosing tribal and regional leaders. In the olden times, elders taught the young in their village on the full moon night after harvesting. It would take place on a rice paddy outside the village and under the moonlight.

[[Diplomatic accreditation]]
CATEGORIES: Diplomacy

Diplomatic accreditation is the process in which an ambassador is certified as one country's official representative to another.
Accreditation occurs when a new ambassador presents "letters of credence", or credentials, to the host country's head of state. Letters of credence, which are signed by the ambassador's own head of state, confirm that the ambassador is authorised to represent his or her country, and ask that the host country respect this fact. The presentation of letters of credence is often an elaborate ceremony, and serves as an official welcome to the new ambassador.
In accordance with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, ambassadors are not regarded as having officially taken up their duties until the accreditation process is complete. Among the diplomats accredited to a particular country (the diplomatic corps), seniority is determined by the date of accreditation.
Usually, an ambassador is accredited to only one country at a time, but this is not always the case — multiple accreditations (often called dual accreditations or cross-accreditations) are quite possible. In this case, ambassadors live in one country, and travel to the others as required. This allows a country to have full diplomatic relations with a country even if maintaining a resident ambassador is not necessary, or is an inefficient use of resources.

[[History of Hamburg]]
CATEGORIES: History of Hamburg

The history of Hamburg begins with its foundation in the 9th century as a mission settlement to convert the Saxons. Since the Middle Ages Hamburg was an important trading centre in Europe. The convenient location of the port and its independence as a city and state for centuries strengthened this position.
The city was member in the medieval Hanseatic trading league and a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1815 until 1866 Hamburg was an independent and sovereign state of the German Confederation, then the North German Confederation (1866–71), the German Empire (1871–1918) and during the period of the Weimar Republic (1918–33). In Nazi Germany Hamburg was a city-state and a Gau from 1934 until 1945. After the Second World War Hamburg was in the British Zone of Occupation and became a state in the western part of Germany in the Federal Republic of Germany (Since 1949).

[[Wood River Refinery]]
CATEGORIES: Energy infrastructure completed in 1917, ConocoPhillips, Oil refineries in the United States, Energy resource facilities in Illinois, Companies based in Madison County, Illinois, Buildings and structures in Madison County, Illinois

The Wood River Refinery is an oil refinery located in Roxana, Illinois, approximately [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] north of St. Louis, Missouri, on the east side of the Mississippi River. The refinery is currently owned by Phillips 66 and Cenovus Energy, and operated by the joint-venture company WRB Refining, LLC (WRB).  WRB was formed on 1 July 2007, with Encana taking a 49% interest in Wood River and also Phillips 66' Borger refinery. Encana subsequently spun off heavy oil producer Cenovus and ConocoPhillips spun-off Phillips 66.  In return for a 49% stake in the refinery, ConocoPhillips gained a joint interest in two Alberta oil sands (bitumen) heavy oil projects: Christina_Lake_(Alberta) and Foster Creek.  Both are operated by Cenovus using SAGD (steam-assisted gravity drainage) technology.   
The complex is capable of refining [tpl]convert|360000|oilbbl|m3[/tpl] of crude oil per day and is the largest refinery operated by ConocoPhillips. Oil is supplied from the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, and domestic sources through pipelines. The facility produces [tpl]convert|165000|oilbbl/d|m3/d[/tpl] of gasoline, [tpl]convert|90000|oilbbl/d|m3/d[/tpl] of diesel and jet fuels, as well as other products including asphalt, propane, and chemical feedstocks.
A new four-drum coker, part of Wood River Refinery's Coker and Refinery Expansion (CORE) was completed in November 2011. The new coker has a capacity of 75,000 barrels per day and is expected to expand the capacity to handle the bitumen from the Alberta oil sands by nearly 700%. The new Wood River coker's processing capacity is approximately 200,000 - 220,000 barrels per day. The CORE project took about three years to build, with a total cost of US $3.8 billion (US $1.9 billion to Cenovus), and has increased clean product yield by 5% to approximately 85%. While the expansion was undertaken specifically to handle heavy oil imported from Alberta, the refined transportation fuels products are destined for the U.S. Midwest market, including St. Louis and Chicago not Canada. 
An RO filtration system upgrade to treat boiler water was also completed in 2011. 3500 total feet of pipe on 800 feet of modular pipe rack was installed along movable trailers containing the filtration system. This expansion increased the amount of steam available to the refinery.  Thermal cracking, stripping and power generation are some of the major processes within a refinery that use steam.
Wood River Refinery was originally built by Shell in 1917.  In the late 1990s, Shell and Texaco merged their downstream segments to form the Motiva (with Saudi national oil company Saudi ARAMCO) and Equilon joint ventures.  During a prolonged period of low refining profit margins, Equilon sold the refinery to Tosco in 2003.  Shortly thereafter, Phillips Petroleum acquired Tosco.  When Conoco and Phillips merged, the refinery became an asset of ConocoPhillips.  Multiple ownership of refineries is not uncommon in the United States, where many refineries (in original form) predate World War II.

thumb|Floris of London|right Floris is the oldest English retailer of toiletries and accessories and second oldest in the world after Farina gegenüber of Cologne, Germany.
Floris was founded in 1730 by Juan Famenias Floris, who arrived in England from his native island of Menorca to seek fortune. Shortly after his arrival, in 1730, he secured premises in Jermyn Street, in the elegant quarter of London's St.James. Juan Famenias Floris initially set up business as a barber and comb-maker, however, he soon missed the aromas and sensations of his Mediterranean youth.
The first Royal Warrant was granted to J.Floris Ltd was in 1820 as 'Smooth Pointed Comb-makers' to the then newly appointed King George IV. Today this first Royal warrant is still on display at 89 Jermyn Street together with no less than sixteen others. Floris holds two today: Perfumers to HM The Queen Elizabeth II and Manufacturers of Toilet Preparations to HRH The Prince of Wales.
The Floris archives hold letters from famous customers detailing their preferences and their thanks, examples include:
In addition to the Floris Jermyn Street shop, Floris used to have a shop in exclusive Madison Avenue, New York. Similar in style to the Jermyn Street shop, Floris Madison Avenue was the focus for all Floris sales across the USA.  All product is now sold through London's Apothecary in the United States.
The London store is in Jermyn Street, London in the same building Juan Floris created the business in the 18th Century.  The mahogany counter still used in the store was purchased directly from the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park in 1851.  Many customs still endure today, an example of which is the passing of cash change to customers on a velvet pad; it was considered vulgar in the 18th Century to touch another's hand.

Loudblast is a Death/Thrash band that pioneered the genres in France, and one of the most important French metal bands of the 1990s.Loudblast entry encyclopedia metallum - retrieved on 2008-02-06
The band began in 1986 in the northern city of Lille. Its first recording was a split CD with the Nice based band Agressor. They have released eight albums on the record labels Semetary/fnac and Metal13. They began playing thrash metal influenced by the classic American bands such as Slayer. In 1991 they recorded the album "Disincarnate" in Morrisound Recording studios in Tampa, Florida, and the result was a pure death metal album. In the late 90's they incorporated more melody and groove in their music while maintaining a thrash/death aesthetic.
The band announced that they were splitting in 1999, but after a support concert to Chuck Schuldiner's Death in 2002, the band reformed with Agressor's Alex Colin-Tocquaine and released Planet Pandemonium in 2004. After a few year hiatus, Stéphane and Hervé announced in November 2009 a new line-up including Alex Lenormand (Locust) and Drakhian (Fornication, Black Dementia, Griffar).

[[Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992]]

CATEGORIES: United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1992, Tax legislation in the United Kingdom

The Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 is an Act of Parliament which governs to levying of capital gains tax in the United Kingdom. Capital gains tax is a tax charged on the increase in the capital value of an asset between purchase and sale of that asset.
The tax operates under two different regimes for a natural person and a body corporate. For a natural person the tax is levied at a rate determined by the highest rate of income tax which that person pays. If the person is a higher-rate tax payer then the higher rate of income tax (currently 40%) is charged on the gain. The rates of capital gains tax are the same as those for earned income. Each year a natural person has an amount of gain which is exempt from tax. Bodies corporate by contrast have capital gains tax charged as additional corporation tax. The chargeable gain is treated as additional profits for the accounting period in question. Bodies corporate have no allowance for gains free from tax.
Various reliefs from capital gains tax exist. These include indexation relief, where the amount of gain subject to tax is reduced by factoring in general price inflation and taper relief where set percentages of the gain are exempt from tax if the asset has been held for a certain length of time.
The Act has been amended yearly by the subsequent Finance Acts.

The Norfolk Ballerz are an inactive team of the American Basketball Association.
They played part of the 2006-07 ABA season as the Richmond Ballerz before ending their season on February 23, 2007 due to scheduling problems attributed to several nearby ABA franchises failing to start the 2006-07 season or folding early in the season.  The Richmond Ballerz were coached by former Virginia Tech guard Michael Davis.
In March 2007, the Ballerz announced that they would move to the Hampton Roads area in order to be closer to their owner, Ann Iverson, mother of Memphis Grizzlies star Allen Iverson.  The Ballerz may change their formal name for the 2007-08 season, but intend to use the name Ballerz as an informal nickname.  The press release indicated that another ABA franchise would be placed in Richmond for 2007-08.  According to ABALive.com, the team is now the Norfolk Ballerz.  In July 2007, both the Ballerz and the tentative Richmond franchise were removed from the ABALive.com website.
The team was originally going to be called the Richmond Warriors, but the ABA made them change the name out of respect for the NBA's Golden State Warriors, despite the existence of another ABA team with a similar nickname, the Twin City Ballers, and the existence of another ABA team with a nickname shared with the NBA, the Peoria Kings.

The Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) is an intergovernmental organization, composed of the four Melanesian states of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, and the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front of New Caledonia. It was founded as a political gathering in 1983. On 23 March 2007, members signed the Agreement Establishing the Melanesian Spearhead Group, formalizing the group under international law. It is headquartered in Port Vila, Vanuatu. A secretariat building has been constructed by the People's Republic of China and handed over to the MSG in November 2007.MSG Secretariat building handed over to govt, Vanuatu DailyPost, 6 November 2007. The first MSG Director General was Rima Ravusiro of Papua New Guinea.Rima Ravusiro heads the MSG, Radio Australia, 6 June 2008. Since September 2011, Peter Forau of Solomon Islands heads the MSG.New MSG boss arrives in Vanuatu, Solomon Star, 22 September 2011.
One of the key features of the MSG is the Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade Agreement, a sub-regional preferential trade agreement established to foster and accelerate economic development through trade relations and provide a political framework for regular consultations and review on the status of the Agreement, with a view to ensuring that trade both in terms of exports and imports is undertaken in a genuine spirit of Melanesian Solidarity and is done on a most favoured nation (MFN) basis. Negotiations are held regularly between the members' leaders to consider the progress and developments of the agreement. After a revision in 2005, it covers 180 articles free of fiscal duty.
The MSG Trade Agreement was signed in 1993 by Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. At the 6th Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) Trade and Economic Officials’ Meeting on 16 April 1997 in Honiara, the Fiji delegation indicated its willingness to accede to it. This initiative was endorsed at the 1997 MSG Leaders Summit. Fiji became a formal member of the MSG Trade Agreement on 14 April 1998. The 9th MSG Trade & Economic Officials meeting was held in Papua New Guinea on 29 and 30 November 2000. This meeting saw the acceptance of the expansion of the MSG Product Schedule tariff headings from four digit to six digits, thereby facilitating MSG trade by removing the ambiguity in product identification at Customs points of entry. The agreement is General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) consistent and has been approved and accorded recognition by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Committee on Regional Arrangements to be compatible and meeting the requirements of Article 24 of the GATT/WTO Agreement.
More recently, the Melanesian Spearhead Group got heavily involved in the political discussions following Fiji's suspension from the Pacific Islands Forum in May 2009.Fiji PM wins backing from MSG leaders, Radio Australia, 11 July 2009.
In July 2010, Fiji expelled Australia's acting high commissioner accusing the latter of causing the postponement of a so-called Engaging Fiji meeting.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10609711 Australia responded that it had to do with the lack of democracy in the country.

Informal attire, also called international business attire or Western business attire is a dress code, typified by a suit and necktie. On the scale of formality, informal attire is more formal than casual but less formal than semi-formal. It is more presentational than semi-casual, but offers more room for personal expression than semi-formal dress.  Informal should not be confused with casual, not even smart casual — in loose common usage, many people refer to informal dress as semi-formal or formal and formal dress (in the technical sense — that is, white tie, black tie, and similar) as very formal. The technical definition of informal is used in this article.

A field-programmable analog array (FPAA) is an integrated device containing configurable analog blocks (CAB) and interconnects between these blocks.  Unlike their digital cousin, the FPGA, the devices tend to be more application driven than general purpose as they may be current mode or voltage mode devices.  For voltage mode devices, each block usually contains an operational amplifier in combination with programmable configuration of passive components.  The blocks can, for example, act as summers or integrators.
FPAAs usually operate in one of two modes: continuous time and discrete time.

[[Time to Burn (Giant album)]]
CATEGORIES: Giant (band) albums, 1992 albums, Epic Records albums

Time to Burn is the second studio album by Giant, released in 1992.
Vocalist/guitarist Dann Huff had proven his guitar-playing chops as a studio musician on hit albums and singles across the popular music spectrum throughout the 1980s before starting a band with brother David on drums, Mike Brignardello on bass and Alan Pasqua on keyboards and scoring a hit of their own with "I'll See You In My Dreams" in 1989-1990. For the follow-up the band was joined in the writing process on two songs by Jim Vallance and on four by Van Stephenson, the latter of whom also guested on background vocals in the studio. Huff had previously done guitar work on Stephenson's solo albums.  It was produced by Terry Thomas, a former member of the band Charlie who had previously produced albums for such rock notables as Bad Company and Foreigner.
Although well-reviewed, Time to Burn was among the last of its commercial AOR/melodic hard rock genre to be released by a major label — and not the label of their previous album — as record companies and media outlets stopped promoting '80s artists in favor of newer grunge styles. The album's most successful single was "Chained", which peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, although second single "Stay" received some airplay as well.

[[Wright v. Houston Independent School District]]
CATEGORIES: Textbook controversies, United States creationism and evolution case law, 1972 in United States case law, 1972 in religion

Wright v. Houston Independent School District was a 1972 American legal case brought by a parent of a student in the Houston Independent School District in Houston, Texas suing on behalf of her daughter and fellow students to prevent the district from teaching evolution as fact and without reference to alternative theories.[tpl]cite book |title=Evolution in the courtroom: a reference guide |last=Moore |first=Randy |isbn=978-1-57607-420-6 |year=2002 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=381 [/tpl]  The plaintiffs claimed evolutionary theory endorsed a secularist religious view, and argued the school's failure to incorporate the teaching of a particular religious alternative to evolutionary theory as derived from the Bible's creation account held that religious view up to ridicule and contempt.  To allow evolution while avoiding creationism was unconstitutional, the suit claimed, because it advanced one particular sectarian view over another."Memorandum and Order",Rita Wright et al v. Houston Independent School District et al, United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division-District Judge Seals presiding, August 3, 1972, amended October 30, 1972, text  The plaintiffs maintained that the school's evolutionary teaching constituted "the establishment of a sectarian, atheistic religion" and was an interference of their own rights to the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the Establishment clause in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.486 F2d 137 Wright v. Houston Independent School District, United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, October 10, 1973, No. 72-3463 full text of decision  The case is one of a series of legal battles over the teaching of evolution in American public schools, and the first to be initiated by opponents of such teaching.
The suit was dismissed prior to trial, the presiding judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas finding Wright had "wholly failed to establish the analogy" between the teaching of evolution and an establishment of religion. The Court held:Wright v. Houston I.S.D.
 Plaintiffs' case depends in large measure upon their demonstrating a connection between "religion," as employed in the first amendment, and Defendants' approach to the subject of evolution. The Court is convinced that the connection is too tenuous a thread on which to base a first amendment complaint. 
The judge Woodrow B. Seals outlined three findings. He found the Houston school district was not following any policy to promote secularism.  Further, he found the free exercise of religion did not include any such right to be shielded from scientific theories which are incompatible with a particular religious belief. And he rejected the plaintiffs' proposal that the school district be court ordered to provide "equal time" in the curriculum for alternative theories, finding such an order would constitute unwarranted intrusion into the district's affairs.
Wright appealed the decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1973 the Appeals Court affirmed the lower court decision dismissing the suit.  In June 1974 the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case, and later lawsuits involving restrictions and impositions on evolution in school curricula reaffirmed the Wright decision.

The 1994 Kangaroo Tour was the last played in the conventional format, where the Australian side plays a number of matches against British and French clubs or provincial outfits, in additions to the Test matches. The outbreak of the Super League war meant that the next Kangaroo Tour, set for 1998, never eventuated; although shortened tours were staged in 2001 and 2003.
Australia continued its dominance, winning both Test series against Great Britain and France, suffering only one loss (against Great Britain in the First Test at Wembley, just as they had done in 1990), and remained undefeated against British club outfits in a streak stretching back to 1978.
The team was coached by Bob Fulton who was making his fourth Kangaroo Tour (1973 and 1978 as a player, the latter as captain, and 1990 as coach). Mal Meninga created history by becoming the first and so far only player to make four tours as a player. Fulton and Meninga also became the first pair to be the Coach and Captain on consecutive Kangaroo Tours.
Paul Sironen became just the fourth forward to be selected for three Kangaroo Tours, having previously toured in 1986 and 1990.
This was the last full strength Australian side to take the field until after the resolution of the Super League war.

John Leonard Still (born 24 April 1950) is an English former footballer and the current manager of Luton Town.
After his playing career was cut short by injury, Still began managing non-League clubs around his hometown area of East London, Essex and Kent, achieving title wins with three different clubs. He was manager of Redbridge Forest in 1992 when the club merged with Dagenham to become its current incarnation – Dagenham & Redbridge. Still accepted his first job in The Football League in August 1994 at Peterborough United, and later joined Barnet in June 1997. He took the club to the play-offs twice, before leaving in 2002 after the club was relegated to the Football Conference. Still returned to Dagenham & Redbridge in April 2004, promoting the club to League Two in 2006–07 and then to League One in 2009–10. The club was relegated back to League Two the following season. In February 2013, after nine seasons in charge, Still left Dagenham to join Luton Town. In his first full season as Luton's manager, the club were crowned as Conference Premier champions and won promotion to League Two, making Still the only manager to lead three different clubs to promotion out of non-League football.
Still has earned a reputation for spotting young talented footballers in the non-League game, particularly during his time at Dagenham. A number of players that Still has developed have gone on to play in the Championship and even the Premier League.
