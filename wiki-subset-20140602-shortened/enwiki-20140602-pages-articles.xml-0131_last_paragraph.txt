CATEGORIES: Cities and towns in Croatia, Lists of cities by country, Croatia geography-related lists

An urbanized area in Croatia can gain the status of grad (which can be translated as town or city as there is no distinction between the two terms in Croatian) if it meets one of the following requirements:
Grad (city/town) is the local administrative equivalent of općina (translated as "municipality"), with the only distinction being that the former usually comprise urban areas whereas the latter commonly consist of a group of villages. Note that both municipalities and city/towns often comprise more than one settlement, as the administrative territory of a grad may include suburban villages or hamlets near the city/town in question. Individual settlements (or naselje in Croatian) are the smallest statistical unit counted by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics but are not administrative entities, i.e. they are governed by the municipal or city/town council of the local administrative unit they belong to.

[[List of cities and towns in Iceland]]
CATEGORIES: Populated places in Iceland, Lists of cities by country, Iceland geography-related lists

This is a list of cities and towns in Iceland. Some of Iceland’s larger cities and towns are also self-contained municipalities whose geography and populations are therefore equal. However, most of Iceland’s municipalities, which are semi-autonomous administrative zones, contain several disparate towns or cities, each of whose population contributes to that of its respective municipality. 
In addition to Iceland's many independent towns, this article includes cities and towns whose municipalities consist of one, self-contained city of the same name, such as Hafnarfjörður and Akranes. Municipalities that are not also cities or towns, such as Árborg, are not included here, but their constituent towns and cities are. For Árborg, these include the towns of Selfoss, Eyrarbakki, and Stokkseyri. 
For more information on the administrative divisions of Iceland, refer to the “Divisions” section of the "Iceland" infobox on this page.

Randonneurs USA or RUSA is the Audax Club Parisien-approved brevet coordinating organization for the United States.  U.S. Cyclists riding in the Paris–Brest–Paris qualify for the event through RUSA. RUSA also promotes randonneuring within the U.S..
Randonneuring is a style of bicycle riding that requires covering long-distances within a generously allotted time period of almost continuous riding.  As randonneurs, riders do not compete against their fellow cyclists, but only against their own personal best, the weather and the mind's desire for sleep.  Skills in self-sufficiency, bicycle mechanics, night-riding and endurance are all valued over ability to cycle at racing speeds or with racing strategies.

The Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others is a resolution of the UN General Assembly. The preamble states:
 "Whereas prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger the welfare of the individual, the family and the community" 
It was approved by the General Assembly on 2 December 1949General Assembly resolution 317(IV) and came into effect on 25 July 1951. As at December 2013, 82 states were party to the convention (see map). An additional 13 states had signed the convention but had not yet ratified it.Signatories and ratifications status
The Convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of forced prostitution. Signatories are charged with three obligations under the 1949 Convention: prohibition of trafficking, specific administrative and enforcement measures, and social measures aimed at trafficked persons. The 1949 Convention presents two shifts in perspective of the trafficking problem in that it views prostitutes as victims of the procurers, and in that it eschews the terms "white slave traffic" and "women," using for the first time race- and gender-neutral language.[tpl]Dead link|date=November 2009[/tpl] To fall under the provisions of the 1949 Convention, the trafficking need not cross international lines.

[[Palomino]]
CATEGORIES: Horse coat colors, Palomino horses, Color breeds

Palomino is a coat color in horses, consisting of a gold coat and white mane and tail. Genetically, the palomino color is created by a single allele of a dilution gene called the cream gene working on a "red" (chestnut) base coat. However, most color breed registries that record palomino horses were founded before equine coat color genetics were understood as well as they are today, and hence the standard definition of a palomino is based on the coat color visible, not the underlying presence of the dilution gene. 
Due to their distinct color, palominos stand out in a show ring, and are much sought after as parade horses. They were particularly popular in movies and television during the 1940s and 1950s.  One of the most famous palomino horses was Trigger, known as "the smartest horse in movies", the faithful mount of the Hollywood cowboy star Roy Rogers. Another famous palomino was Mr. Ed (real name Bamboo Harvester) who starred on his own TV show in the 1960s.

[[Sustainable industries]]

CATEGORIES: Industries, Sustainability, Sustainable technologies

The earliest mention of the phrase sustainable industries appeared in 1997 in a story about a Japanese group reforesting a tropical forest to help create sustainable industries for the local populace. (Dietrich, Bill. "Our Troubled Earth – Japan." The Seattle Times. November 13, 1990. Page F-2.)  Soon after, a study entitled “Jobs in a Sustainable Economy” by Michael Renner of the Worldwatch Institute was published, using the term sustainable industries. (1991)
This 1991 report concluded, "Contrary to the jobs-versus-owls rhetoric that blames environmental restrictions for layoffs, the movement toward an environmentally sustainable global economy will create far more jobs than it eliminates. The chief reason: non-polluting, environmentally sustainable industries tend to be intrinsically more labour intensive and less resource intensive than traditional processes."  Among the features of sustainable industry offered in the paper were energy efficiency, resource conservation to meet the needs of future generations, safe and skill-enhancing working conditions, low waste production processes, and the use of safe and environmentally compatible materials. Some of the benefits, however would be offset by higher prices (due to labor costs) and a theoretically larger population needed to perform the same amount of work, increasing the agricultural and other loads on the system.
In February 2003 the business magazine Sustainable Industries was first published, offering news and analysis of core industries such as clean energy and green building. By 2012 the company had expanded to include digital media and event production with the Sustainable Industries Economic Forum in the U.S.

[tpl]Italic title[/tpl]

Macroglossum stellatarum, known as the hummingbird hawk-moth or sometimes the hummingmoth, is a species of Sphingidae. Its long proboscis and its hovering behaviour, accompanied by an audible humming noise, make it look remarkably like a hummingbird while feeding on flowers. It should not be confused with the moths called hummingbird moths in North America, genus Hemaris, members of the same family and with similar appearance and behavior.
The resemblance to hummingbirds is an example of convergent evolution. It flies during the day, especially in bright sunshine, but also at dusk, dawn, and even in the rain, which is unusual for even diurnal hawkmoths. Its visual abilities have been much studied, and it has been shown to have a relatively good ability to learn colours.

Shlomo Kleit (1880–1962) was a leader of the Yiddishist/Socialist movement in Lithuania. 
Kleit was active in the anti-Tsarist revolutionary movement, and the anti-German underground between 1915 and 1918. After World War I he was elected as the Socialist vice-president of the Vilna Kehilla. Kleit left Lithuania for political reasons and lived in Berlin, Cairo, Tel Aviv, Southern France and Toronto. With the assistance of Yaakov (Yankel) Pat, the international Bundist leader, Kleit went to the United States in 1927 and there worked as a teacher in the Arbeter Ring schools until his death.
During and after World War II, Kleit worked to rescue Jews from the Holocaust and to bring survivors into the United States from Cuba and possibly other countries. There is some evidence to indicate that the circle of groups and individuals included Hashomer Hatzair, returning war veterans, non-Jewish pilots and engineers and (with inconclusive evidence) mobsters such as Meyer Lansky and (somewhat questionably) Lucky Luciano.
Among Kleit's colleagues in Jewish education were Leo Dashefsky, Leah Vevetches, Pesach Simon and Michel Gelbart.

Their narrow wings and streamlined abdomens are adaptations for rapid flight.
Some hawk moths, such as the hummingbird hawk moth or the white-lined sphinx, hover in midair while they feed on nectar from flowers, so are sometimes mistaken for hummingbirds. This hovering capability has evolved only four times in nectar feeders: in hummingbirds, certain bats, hoverflies, and these sphingids[ref]Kitching, Ian J.

Sphingids have been much studied for their flying ability, especially their ability to move rapidly from side to side while hovering, called 'swing-hovering' or 'side-slipping.'  This is thought to have evolved to deal with ambush predators that lie in wait in flowers.
Sphingids are some of the faster flying insects; some are capable of flying at over 5.3 m/s (12 miles per hour).[ref]

Brian Michael Stanislaus Hoban (7 October 1921, British Guiana – 6 July 2003), was a teacher of classics, and Headmaster of Harrow School from 1971-81.
His father died when he was a small child and he spent two years in an orphanage. In 1934 he won a scholarship to Charterhouse, where he remained until the onset of World War II in 1939. He spent the war as a captain with the Westminster Dragoons, and was mentioned in dispatches. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
From 1946-49 he was a student of classics at University College, Oxford. In 1947 he married Jasmine Holmes, the daughter of his Charterhouse house master. From 1949-52 he was an assistant master at Uppingham School teaching classics. From 1952-59 he was an assistant master at Shrewsbury School teaching classics. From 1960-64 he was Headmaster of St Edmund's School, Canterbury.
From 1964-71, he was Headmaster of Bradfield College. In 1971 he was named Headmaster of Harrow. He headed Harrow at a difficult time for British public schools generally, due to the political environment and financial pressures. Despite sometimes public criticism, Hoban responded with cost-saving measures, whilst refurbishing houses. During his tenure at Harrow, numbers slipped below 700 only three times. He oversaw many important building projects, including the new Central Feeding block; the New Knoll boarding house; and new physics and maths schools. He retired in 1981.

Blood Simple is a 1984 neo-noir crime film written, directed and produced by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film's title derives from the Dashiell Hammett novel Red Harvest, in which "blood simple" is a term to describe the addled, fearful mindset of people after a prolonged immersion in violent situations.Falsani, Cathleen. "The Dude Abides: The Gospel According to the Coen Brothers". Grand Rapids, MI: 2009. Zondervan. p. 31
It was the directorial debut of the Coens and the first major film of cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld, who later became a noted director, as well as the feature film debut of Joel Coen's wife Frances McDormand, who subsequently starred in many of his features.
In 2001, a "Director's cut" DVD was released. It ranked #98 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills. The film also placed #73 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.

[[Railway signalling]]

CATEGORIES: Railway signalling

Railway signalling is a system used to control railway traffic safely, essentially to prevent trains from colliding. Being guided by fixed rails, trains are uniquely susceptible to collision; furthermore, trains cannot stop quickly, and frequently operate at speeds that do not enable them to stop within sighting distance of the driver.  In the UK, the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 introduced a series of requirements on matters such as the implementation of interlocked block signalling and other safety measures as a direct result of the Armagh rail disaster in that year.
Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network (e.g., a signalman or stationmaster) to the train crew. The set of rules and the physical equipment used to accomplish this determine what is known as the method of working (UK), method of operation (US) or safeworking (Aus.). Not all these methods require the use of physical signals and some systems are specific to single track railways.
The earliest rail cars were first hauled by horses or mules. A mounted flagman on a horse preceded some early trains.  Hand and arm signals were used to direct the “train drivers”.  Foggy and poor-visibility conditions gave rise to flags and lanterns. Wayside signalling dates back as far as 1832, and used elevated flags or balls that could be seen from afar.

CATEGORIES: Lycosidae

Wolf spiders are members of the family Lycosidae, from the Ancient Greek word "[tpl]lang|grc|λύκος[/tpl]" meaning "wolf".  They are robust and agile hunters with excellent eyesight.  They live mostly solitary lives and hunt alone.  Some are opportunistic hunters pouncing upon prey as they find it or even chasing it over short distances. Some will wait for passing prey in or near the mouth of a burrow.
Wolf spiders resemble Nursery web spiders (family Pisauridae), but wolf spiders carry their egg sacs by attaching them to their spinnerets (Pisauridae carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae and pedipalps). Two of the Wolf spider's eight eyes are large and prominent, which distinguishes them from the Nursery web spiders whose eyes are all of approximately equal size. This can also help distinguish them from grass spiders.

Bob Seger is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and pianist. As a locally successful Detroit-area artist, he performed and recorded as Bob Seger and the Last Heard and Bob Seger System throughout the 1960s. By the early 1970s, he had dropped the "System" from his recordings and continued to strive for broader success with other various bands. In 1973, he put together The Silver Bullet Band, a group of Detroit-area musicians, with whom he became most successful on the national level with the album Live Bullet, recorded live with the Silver Bullet Band in 1975 at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan. In 1976, he achieved a national breakout with the studio album Night Moves. On his studio albums, he also worked extensively with the Alabama-based Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, which appeared on several of Seger's best-selling singles and albums.
A roots rocker with a classic raspy, shouting voice, Seger wrote and recorded songs that dealt with love, women, blue-collar themes and was an exemplar of heartland rock. Seger has recorded many hits, including "Night Moves", "Turn the Page", "We've Got Tonight", "Against the Wind", and "Shakedown" that was written for Beverly Hills Cop II and "Like a Rock", and also co-wrote the Eagles' number-one hit "Heartache Tonight". His iconic recording of "Old Time Rock and Roll" was named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001.
With a career spanning five decades, Seger continues to perform and record today. Seger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/bob-seger/ |title=Bob Seger: inducted in 2004 | The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-seger-gordon-lightfoot-jim-steinman-inducted-into-songwriters-hall-of-fame-20120615 |title=Bob Seger, Gordon Lightfoot, Jim Steinman Inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame | Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=2013-08-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/483079/bob-seger-gordon-lightfoot-among-songwriter-hall-inductees |title=Bob Seger, Gordon Lightfoot Among Songwriter Hall inductees |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://songhall.org/news/entry/songwriters_hall_of_fame_announces_2012_inductees |title=Songwriters Hall of Fame Announces 2012 Inductees |publisher=SongHall |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06[/tpl]

The Brat Pack is a nickname given to a group of young actors who frequently appeared together in teen-oriented coming-of-age films in the 1980s. First mentioned in a 1985 New York magazine article, it is now usually described as the cast members of two specific films released in 1985 – The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire – although sometimes other actors are included. The "core" members were Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy.
The actors themselves were known to dislike the label. Many of their careers peaked in the middle of the 1980s but declined afterwards for various reasons.

CATEGORIES: Fungi of Europe, Fungi of North America, Edible fungi, Cantharellus, Pacific Northwest cuisine

Cantharellus cibarius, commonly known as the chanterelle, golden chanterelle or girolle, is a fungus. It is probably the best known species of the genus Cantharellus, if not the entire family of Cantharellaceae. It is orange or yellow, meaty and funnel-shaped. On the lower surface, underneath the smooth cap, it has gill-like ridges that run almost all the way down its stipe, which tapers down seamlessly from the cap. It has a fruity smell, reminiscent of apricots and a mildly peppery taste (hence its German name, Pfifferling) and is considered an excellent edible mushroom.

The Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) is a medium-sized plover.
The adults have a brown back and wings, a white belly, and a white breast with two black bands. The rump is tawny orange. The face and cap are brown with a white forehead. The eyering orange-red. The chicks are patterned almost identically to the adults, and are precocial — able to move around immediately after hatching. The Killdeer frequently uses a "broken wing act" to distract predators from the nest. It is named onomatopoeically after its call.Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper

[[Islamic architecture]]

CATEGORIES: Islamic architecture, Islamic art, Islamic architectural elements

Islamic architecture encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Islam to the present day. What today is known as Islamic architecture owes its origin to similar structures already existing in Roman, Byzantine and Persian lands which the Muslims conquered in the 7th and 8th centuries.Krautheimer, Richard. Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture Yale University Press Pelican History of Art, Penguin Books Ltd., 1965, p. 285.Fletcher, Banister A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method 4th Edition, London, p. 476. The principal Islamic architectural types are: the Mosque, the Tomb, the Palace and the Fort. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used for buildings of less importance such as public baths, fountains and domestic architecture.Copplestone, p.149http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&cid=1158658332974&pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout A Tour of Architecture in Islamic Cities

[[Piping Plover]]

CATEGORIES: Charadrius, Shorebirds, Native birds of the Canadian Prairies, Native birds of Eastern Canada, Native birds of the Eastern United States, Native birds of the Plains-Midwest (United States)

The Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) is a small sand-colored, sparrow-sized shorebird that nests and feeds along coastal sand and gravel beaches in North America. The adult has yellow-orange legs, a black band across the forehead from eye to eye, and a black ring around the neck. This chest band is usually thicker in males during the breeding season, and it's the only reliable way to tell the sexes apart. The bird is difficult to see when it is standing still, as it blends well with open, sandy beach habitats. It typically runs in short spurts and stops.
There are 2 subspecies of Piping Plovers: the eastern population is known as Charadrius melodus melodus and the mid-west population is known as Charadrius melodus circumcinctus. The bird's name is derived from its plaintive bell-like whistles which are often heard before the bird is visible.
Total population is currently estimated at about 6,510 individuals. A preliminary estimate showed 3,350 birds in 2003 on the Atlantic Coast alone, 52% of the total.BirdLife International (2008) Species factsheet: Charadrius melodus. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 24/12/2008 http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=3127&m=0 The population has been increasing since 1999.
Their breeding habitat includes beaches or sand flats on the Atlantic coast, the shores of the Great Lakes, and in the mid-west of Canada and the United States. They nest on sandy or gravel beaches or shoals.   These shorebirds forage for food on beaches, usually by sight, moving across the beaches in short bursts. Generally, Piping Plovers will forage for food around the high tide wrack zone and along the water's edge. They eat mainly insects, marine worms, and crustaceans.

Although they normally move unobtrusively and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very agile jumps, notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats. Both their book lungs and the tracheal system are well-developed, and they use both systems (bimodal breathing). Jumping spiders are generally recognized by their eye pattern. All jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes with one pair being their particularly large anterior median eyes.

[[Avant-garde music]]
CATEGORIES: Experimental music, 20th century in music

Avant-garde music is a term used to characterize music which is thought by critics to be ahead of its time, i.e., containing unique or original elements, or unexplored fusions of different genres.
Historically speaking, musicologists primarily use the term "avant-garde music" for the radical, post-1945 music after the death of Anton Webern in 1945,Paul Du Noyer (ed.), "Contemporary", in the Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music: From Rock, Pop, Jazz, Blues and Hip Hop to Classical, Folk, World and More (London: Flame Tree, 2003), p. 272. ISBN 1-904041-70-1 or "starting with Wagner"Don Michael Randel, "Modernism", The Harvard Dictionary of Music, fourth edition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2003). ISBN 9780674011632. or even with Josquin des Prez.Edward Lowinsky, "The Musical Avant-Garde of the Renaissance; or, the Peril and Profit of Foresight", in Music in the Culture of the Renaissance and Other Essays, edited and with an introduction by Bonie J. Blackburn with forewords by Howard Mayer Brown and Ellen T. Harris, 2 vols. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1989) 2:730–54, passim.
Today the term may be used to refer to any other post-1945 tendency of modernist music not definable as experimental music, though sometimes including a type of experimental music characterized by the rejection of tonality.
Although some modernist music is also avant-garde, a distinction can be made between the two categories. Because the purpose of avant-garde music is necessarily political, social, and cultural critique, so that it challenges social and artistic values by provoking or goading audiences,  composers such as Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, George Antheil, and Igor Stravinsky may reasonably be considered to have been avant-gardists in their early works (which were understood as provocative, whether or not the composers intended them that way), but the label is not really appropriate for their later music. Modernists of the post–World War II period, such as Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt, György Ligeti, Witold Lutosławski, and Luciano Berio, never conceived their music for the purpose of goading an audience, and so cannot be classified as avant-garde. Composers such as John Cage and Harry Partch, on the contrary, remained avant-gardists throughout their creative careers.Larry Sitsky, Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2002): xiii–xiv.

Chess is a musical with music by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, formerly of ABBA, and with lyrics by Tim Rice.  The story involves two chess grandmasters, an American and a Soviet, fighting over a woman who manages one and falls in love with the other—all in the context of a politically-driven, Cold War-era tournament between the two men. Although the protagonists were not intended to represent any real individuals, the character of the American grandmaster (Freddie Trumper) was loosely based on Bobby Fischer,[tpl]cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7D9163EF93BA35756C0A96E948260 |title=Does Anyone Make a Bad Move In 'Chess'? |accessdate=2008-04-27 |date=1998-05-08 |author=Harold C.

A highly successful concept album of Chess was released in 1984. The first theatrical production of Chess opened in London's West End in 1986 and played for three years. A much-altered U.S. version premièred on Broadway in 1988, but survived only for two months. Chess is frequently revised for new productions, many of which try to merge elements from both the British and American versions; however, no major revival production of the musical has yet been attempted either on West End or Broadway.

[[Dendrobium]]

CATEGORIES: Dendrobium, Orchid genera, Epiphytic orchids

Dendrobium is a huge genus of orchids. It was established by Olof Swartz in 1799 and today contains about 1,200 species. The genus occurs in diverse habitats throughout much of south, east and southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Borneo, Australia, New Guinea, Vietnam, Solomon Islands and New Zealand. The name is from the Greek dendron ("tree") and bios ("life"); it means "one who lives on trees", or, essentially, "epiphyte".
In 1981, Briegar reclassified all terete-leaved Dendrobiums from Australia and New Guinea into a new genus, Dockrillia. The Winika orchid from New Zealand was formerly D. cunninghamii, but has now been moved into a monotypic genus Winika. In 1989, Clements upgraded the D. speciosum complex into individual species;Clements (1989) similarly, the D. bigibbum complex (which contains the well-known Cooktown Orchid of Australia, D. phalaenopsis) has recently been split up. However, as an illustration of the current revisions in the taxonomy of  Orchidaceae these 'splits' have now been reversed and the currently accepted species, natural nothospecies and synonyms are presented on Wikispecies Dendrobium.  The site includes a list of references that help explain the contemporary taxonomy of Dendrobium Sw., Nova Acta Regiae Soc. Sci. Upsal. 6: 82 (1799), nom. cons.

CATEGORIES: 1961 novels, James Bond books, Novels by Ian Fleming, Thriller novels, Thunderball (film), British novels adapted into films, Aviation novels, Jonathan Cape books

Thunderball is the ninth book in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, and the eighth full length James Bond novel. It was first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 27 March 1961, where the initial print run of 50,938 copies quickly sold out. The first novelization of an unfilmed James Bond screenplay, it was born from a collaboration by five people: Ian Fleming, Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, Ivar Bryce and Ernest Cuneo, although the controversial shared credit of Fleming, McClory and Whittingham was the result of a courtroom decision.
The story centres on the theft of two atomic bombs by the crime syndicate SPECTRE and the subsequent attempted blackmail of the Western powers for their return. James Bond, Secret Service operative 007, travels to the Bahamas to work with his friend Felix Leiter, seconded back into the CIA for the investigation. Thunderball also introduces SPECTRE's leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in the first of three appearances in Bond novels, with On Her Majesty's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice being the others.
Thunderball has been adapted three times, once in a comic strip format for the Daily Express newspaper and twice for the cinema. The Daily Express strip was cut short on the order of its owner, Lord Beaverbrook, after Ian Fleming signed an agreement with The Sunday Times to publish a short story. On screen, Thunderball was released in 1965 as the fourth film in the Eon Productions series, with Sean Connery as James Bond. The second adaptation, Never Say Never Again, was released as an independent production in 1983 also starring Connery as Bond and was produced by Kevin McClory.

It has applications in any field that requires simultaneous modelling of discrete and continuous data. It gives a new definition of a derivative such that if one differentiates a function which acts on the real numbers then the definition is equivalent to standard differentiation, but if one uses a function acting on the integers then it is equivalent to the forward difference operator.

Modern scholarship has questioned, though, whether a coherent heretical movement existed behind these condemnations, and has emphasised instead the friction in the Eastern Church caused by Messalianism's 'ascetical practices and imagistic language far more characteristic of Syriac Christianity than of the imperial Church centred on Constantinople'.Columba Stewart,  'Working the Heart of the Earth': The Messalian Controversy in History, Texts and Language to AD431, (1991); Frances Young, From Nicaea to Chalcedon, (2nd edn, 2010), p118
The condemnation of the sect by St John Damascene and Timothy, priest of Constantinople, expressed the view that the sect espoused a sort of mystical materialism. The sect's teaching asserted that:
Messalians taught that once a person experienced the essence of God they were freed from moral obligations or ecclesiastical discipline.The Vision of God by Vladimir Lossky pg 111-112The Macarian Legacy: The Place of Macarius-Symeon in the Eastern Christian Tradition (Oxford Theological Monographs 2004) by Marcus Plested pg 16–27 They had male and female teachers whom they honored more than the clergy, the "perfecti".

He continued serving in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period until his death.
Zhang He began his military career when the Yellow Turban Rebellion erupted in 184 and subsequently served under the warlords Han Fu and Yuan Shao before defecting to Cao Cao during the Battle of Guandu. He participated in many major campaigns, including those against Yuan Tan, Zhang Lu, Ma Chao, and Liu Bei. After Cao Cao's death in 220, Zhang He was primarily engaged with defending the state of Cao Wei against the Northern Expeditions led by Zhuge Liang of Shu Han. He died from an arrow wound received during an encounter with Shu forces in 231.
Famed for his resourcefulness that even Zhuge Liang was said to be wary of, Zhang He was considered by Chen Shou, author of the historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms, to be one of the Five Elite Generals of Cao Cao, along with Zhang Liao, Xu Huang, Yue Jin and Yu Jin. He was also said to be full of respect for Confucian scholars, and supported the idea of allowing masters of the Five Classics to serve in the imperial court of Cao Pi, the first emperor of Wei.

Gan Ning (died c. 220), courtesy name Xingba, was a military general serving under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. Originally a pirate notorious for his plundering and murderous ways, Gan Ning gave up the life of a marauder in the late 190s and became a subordinate of Huang Zu, the Administrator of a commandery in present-day east-central Hubei. Disheartened by Huang Zu's indifferent attitude towards him, Gan Ning eventually left Huang and made his way into Wu territory (present-day southeastern China), where he found his calling and became a military officer under the warlord Sun Quan. Throughout his years of service under Sun Quan until his death, Gan Ning fought in numerous battles for his lord, including: Jiangxia (208), Red Cliffs (208–209), Xiaoyao Ford (214–215) and Ruxu (217).

The  Olive Warbler (Peucedramus taeniatus) is a small passerine bird. It is the only member of the genus Peucedramus and the family Peucedramidae.
This species breeds from southern Arizona and New Mexico, USA, south through Mexico to Nicaragua. It is the only bird family endemic to North America (including Central America).[tpl]cite book|last=Wheatley|first=Nigel|last2=Brewer|first2=David|title=Where to Watch Birds in Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean |isbn=0691095159|publisher=Princeton University Press|location= Princeton, New Jersey|year= 2001[/tpl] It was in the past classed with the Parulidae (New World warblers), but DNA studies suggest that it split early from the other related passerines, prior to the differentiation of the entire New World warbler/American sparrow/Icterid group. It is therefore now given a family of its own.
It is an insectivorous species of coniferous forests. Though it is often said to be non-migratory, most New Mexican birds leave the state from November to late February.[tpl]cite book | last = Parmeter | first = John |coauthors = Neville, Bruce; Emkalns, Doug | year = 2002 | title = New Mexico Bird Finding Guide | edition = 3rd | pages = 314–315 | publisher = New Mexico Ornithological Society[/tpl] It lays 3–4 eggs in a tree nest.

[[Mesopotamian Half Flight]]
CATEGORIES: RAAF independent flights, Aviation in World War I

The Mesopotamian Half-Flight, or Australian Half-Flight was the first Australian Flying Corps (AFC) unit to see active service.
At the start of World War I, the air forces of the Allied forces were small and primitive. Most of the available aircraft and pilots were assigned to the Western Front. This meant that the Indian Army, which was attacking the Ottoman Empire in Mesopotamia, had no air support.
On 8 February 1915, the Australian government received a request for air assistance from the British Government of India. The AFC was still in its infancy and could provide enough aircrews and ground staff for only half a flight: the unit therefore became known as the Mesopotamian Half-Flight, or Australian Half-Flight and Captain Henry Petre was appointed commander. The Australians were to be augmented by personnel from the Indian Army and New Zealand. The AFC contingent sailed for Bombay, and on 20 April it left for Basra.
The half-flight's aircraft were to be provided by the Indian Government, and on its arrival in Basra on 26 May, two Maurice Farman Shorthorns and a Maurice Farman Longhorn were handed over. These three biplanes were of a "pusher" design, so-called because the propeller faced backwards, behind the cockpit. The planes were already obsolete and were not suitable for the desert conditions. To start with, their top speed was only 50 mph (80 km/h), while the desert wind (known as the shamal) often reached 80 mph (129 km/h). Secondly, the warmer desert air reduced the aircraft lift capability, rendering them unable to take off on occasions. The Longhorn was a second-hand aircraft and had persistent mechanical problems, meaning that it spent a lot of time being repaired.
After arrival, the aircraft were immediately put to use on reconnaissance missions. Shortly afterwards, the Indian Army captured the town of Amarah, and the half-flight moved there on 9 June.
On 4 July, the half-flight's equipment was augmented with two Caudron G.3 aircraft, which were still not up-to-date, but generally preferred to the Farmans. On 30 July, one of the Caudrons was forced to land in enemy territory due to mechanical problems.  It was later reported that the crew — Lieutenants George Pinnock Merz (a medical doctor and formerly of the Melbourne University Rifles) and W. W. A. Burn (a New Zealander) — were killed by armed civilians after a running gun-battle over several miles. They were Australia's first air-war casualties.
On 24 August, the half-flight was attached to No. 30 Squadron Royal Flying Corps, which was operating four Martinsyde S.1s. Three Maurice Farman seaplanes were added to the squadron in September. Because the Tigris river was too shallow for the seaplanes to use at that time of  year, the seaplanes were converted into Shorthorns.
On 27 September, Kut was captured and 30 Squadron was moved there. In October, four BE2c aircraft arrived, and 30 Squadron was divided into two flights, with the Australian half-flight incorporated into B Flight. However the Australian personnel suffered an increasing number of misadventures with at least two crews being taken prisoner, either after being shot down or suffering engine failure.
The Indian Army soon met with stiff opposition outside Baghdad, and were forced back to Kut on 4 December, where the city was besieged. Ottoman forces eventually broke through and nine Australian ground staff from the half-flight became prisoners of war. Like the rest of the Allied POWs, AFC personnel taken prisoner in Mesopotamia endured a punishing forced march to Turkey proper and only four of them survived captivity.
Petre, the last remaining Australian airman in Mesopotamia, left No. 30 Squadron and flew the only remaining Shorthorn to Egypt on 7 December, where he and it were eventually incorporated into 1 Squadron AFC.

Petrified Forest National Park is a United States national park in Navajo and Apache counties in northeastern Arizona. Named for its large deposits of petrified wood, the park covers about [tpl]convert|146|mi2|km2[/tpl], encompassing semi-desert shrub steppe as well as highly eroded and colorful badlands. The park's headquarters is about [tpl]convert|26|mi|km[/tpl] east of Holbrook along Interstate 40 (I-40), which parallels the BNSF Railway's Southern Transcon, the Puerco River, and historic U.S. Route 66, all crossing the park roughly east–west. The site, the northern part of which extends into the Painted Desert, was declared a national monument in 1906 and a national park in 1962. About 600,000 people visit the park each year and take part in activities including sightseeing, photography, hiking, and backpacking.
Averaging about [tpl]convert|5400|ft|m[/tpl] in elevation, the park has a dry windy climate with temperatures that vary from summer highs of about [tpl]convert|100|F|C[/tpl] to winter lows well below freezing. More than 400 species of plants, dominated by grasses such as bunchgrass, blue grama, and sacaton, are found in the park. Fauna include larger animals such as pronghorns, coyotes, and bobcats; many smaller animals, such as deer mice; snakes; lizards; seven kinds of amphibians, and more than 200 species of birds, some of which are permanent residents and many of which are migratory. About half of the park is designated wilderness.
The Petrified Forest is known for its fossils, especially fallen trees that lived in the Late Triassic, about 225 million years ago. The sediments containing the fossil logs are part of the widespread and colorful Chinle Formation, from which the Painted Desert gets its name. Beginning about 60 million years ago, the Colorado Plateau, of which the park is part, was pushed upward by tectonic forces and exposed to increased erosion. All of the park's rock layers above the Chinle, except geologically recent ones found in parts of the park, have been removed by wind and water. In addition to petrified logs, fossils found in the park have included Late Triassic ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and many other plants as well as fauna including giant reptiles called phytosaurs, large amphibians, and early dinosaurs. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the park's fossils since the early 20th century.
The park's earliest human inhabitants arrived at least 8,000 years ago. By about 2,000 years ago, they were growing corn in the area and shortly thereafter building pit houses in what would become the park. Later inhabitants built above-ground dwellings called pueblos. Although a changing climate caused the last of the park's pueblos to be abandoned by about 1400 CE, more than 600 archeological sites, including petroglyphs, have been discovered in the park. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers visited the area, and by the mid-19th century a U.S. team had surveyed an east–west route through the area where the park is now located and noted the petrified wood. Later roads and a railway followed similar routes and gave rise to tourism and, before the park was protected, to large-scale removal of fossils. Theft of petrified wood remains a problem in the 21st century.

These lands later would become large portions of the states of Alabama and Mississippi, with the exclusion of Spanish West Florida, which became the lower third of each state, and a narrow northern strip of land claimed by South Carolina in the Treaty of Beaufort that also stretched westward to the river, which became the two states' border counties with Tennessee.
In the 1790s, the Yazoo lands were the subject of a major political scandal in the state of Georgia, called the Yazoo land scandal. It led to Georgia's cession of the land to the U.S. government in the Compact of 1802.[tpl]cite web|title=The Pine Barrens Speculation and Yazoo Land Fraud|url=http://www.aboutnorthgeorgia.com/ang/The_Pine_Barrens_Speculation_and_Yazoo_Land_Fraud|publisher=About North Georgia|accessdate=July 27, 2013[/tpl]

[[Skywave]]

CATEGORIES: Broadcast engineering, Ionosphere, Radio frequency propagation

In radio communication, skywave or skip refers to the propagation of radio waves reflected or refracted back toward Earth from the ionosphere, an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere.  Since it is not limited by the curvature of the Earth,  skywave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances.  It is mostly used in the shortwave frequency bands.
As a result of skywave propagation, a signal from a distant AM broadcasting station, a shortwave station, or—during sporadic E propagation conditions (principally during the summer months in both hemispheres)—a low frequency television station can sometimes be received as clearly as local stations. Skywave propagation is distinct from groundwave propagation, where radio waves travel near Earth's surface without being reflected or refracted by the atmosphere—the dominant propagation mode at lower frequencies, and line-of-sight propagation, in which radio waves travel in a straight line, the dominant mode at higher frequencies.   Most long-distance shortwave (high frequency) radio communication—between 3 and 30 MHz—is a result of skywave propagation. Since the early 1920s amateur radio operators (or "hams"), limited to lower transmitter power than broadcast stations, have taken advantage of skywave for long distance (or "DX") communication.

The orthography of the Old Norse language was diverse, being written in both Runic and Latin alphabets, with many spelling conventions, variant letterforms, and unique letters and signs. In modern times, scholars established a standardized spelling for the language. When Old Norse names are used in texts in other languages, modifications to this spelling are often made. In particular, the names of Old Norse mythological characters often have several different spellings.

The Black-fronted Dotterel (Elseyornis melanops) is a small, slender plover, widespread throughout most of Australia, to which it is native and New Zealand, where it self-introduced in the 1950s.Common Birds in New Zealand ISBN 0-589-00759-9 It is common in freshwater wetlands, around the edges of lakes and billabongs, and in shallow, temporary claypan pools. It is also found occupying saline mudflats and estuaries, but rarely.
Unlike many other wading birds, Black-fronted Dotterels retain the same plumage all year round, which makes identification easier.
They forage in a series of short running motions, holding the body horizontal, stopping to peck from time to time with a rapid bobbing motion. Diet is mostly insects and other small creatures, supplemented by a few seeds.
They are generally sedentary, a single bird, a pair, or a family group occupying a stretch of habitat on a more or less permanent basis, however some individuals appear to travel considerable distances, and flocks will sometimes congregate in food-rich areas.

[[Derny]]

CATEGORIES: Motorized bicycles, Utility motorcycles, Track cycling

A derny is a motorized bicycle for motor-paced cycling events such as during six-day and Keirin racing and motor-paced road races. It is driven by a [tpl]convert|98|cc|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] Zurcher two-stroke engine and by being pedalled through a fixed gear, typically of 70 teeth on the front chainring and 11 on the sprocket on the back wheel. The combination allows for smooth acceleration and slowing, important when the rider taking pace is centimetres from the pacer's shielded back wheel. A coupling between the motor and the back wheel ensures the derny will not stop dead if the motor seizes. Top speed, with rider pedalling, is up to [tpl]convert|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl], depending on gearing.[tpl]fact|date=July 2013[/tpl] 
The first Derny 'Entraineur' or 'Bordeaux–Paris' models, with their characteristic petrol tank across the handlebars, were built by Roger Derny et Fils of the Avenue de St Mandé, Paris, France in 1938. A fleet of Dernys was maintained for the long-established 'Bordeaux-Paris' road-race and the Derny was used for many other track and road events and for endurance training. Derny also built a touring adaptation called the 'Solo' and tandems and mopeds. 
The firm closed in 1957, after an unsuccessful venture with the 'Taon', a Roger Tallon-designed motorcycle. Another company, Service Derny, of Rue Picpus, Paris, serviced and rebuilt machines into the 1970s. 
The name derny is now applied to all cycle-pacing vehicles, regardless of manufacturer. It is used by the Larousse dictionary as a generic term for a small pacing motorcycle used in cycle races. There have been several attempts to copy or improve the original. One, the Burdin, was briefly used, but proved neither durable nor fast enough for repeated high-speed riding on the steep tracks used in six-day racing. Modern machines are made by a small company in Neerpelt, Belgium, and dernys are either new or have the original frames with new [tpl]convert|90|cc|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] engines.
The machine has to be bump-started. It can then pace riders up to [tpl]convert|90|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl], although races rarely exceed [tpl]convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl]..[tpl]fact|date=July 2013[/tpl] 
The rider sits close to the back in an upright position to provide an envelope of low wind resistance for the cyclist drafting or slipstreaming behind. For most derny races, the cyclist sits in the slipstream for the duration of the event. In keirin races, common in Japan and familiar elsewhere, the derny brings riders up to speed then pulls off, and the race finishes in a sprint without the pacer.
Some riders train behind a derny on the road.
A small group of semi-professional pacers travels around Europe for the winter six-day season. Most are in their 60s and 70s and some have been pacing for more than 40 years. 
In most of its later history, the [tpl]convert|560|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] Bordeaux–Paris classic road race was motor-paced using dernys from half-distance. Other important races on the road behind dernys have included the Critérium des As in Paris.

The first Mr. Olympia was held on September 18, 1965 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York City, with Larry Scott winning his first of two straight titles.
The record number of wins is eight, held by Lee Haney (1984–1991) and Ronnie Coleman (1998–2005). Phil Heath currently holds the title. The film Pumping Iron (1977), featured the build up to the 1975 Mr. Olympia in Pretoria South Africa and helped launch the acting careers of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno. There is also a female bodybuilder crowned, the Ms. Olympia, as are winners of Fitness Olympia and Figure Olympia for fitness and figure competitors. All four contests occur during the same weekend.

[[Malabar region]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of India, Regions of Karnataka, Regions of Kerala

Malabar region is an area of southern India lying between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea. The name is thought to be derived from the Malayalam word Mala (hill) and vaaram (range, region) derived or westernised into bar. This part of India was a part of the British East India Company-controlled State, when it was designated as  Malabar District. It included the northern half of the state of Kerala and some coastal regions of present day Karnataka. The area is predominantly Hindu but the majority of Kerala's Muslim population known as Mappila also live in this area, as well as a sizable ancient Christian population."Kerala". Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 8 June 2008 The name is sometimes extended to the entire south-western coast of the peninsula, called the Malabar Coast. Malabar is also used by ecologists to refer to the tropical and subtropical moist broad-leaf forests of south-western India (present day Kerala). Kozhikode is considered as the capital of Malabar.
In ancient times, the term Malabar was used to denote the entire south-western coast of the Indian peninsula. But today, Malabar is only used for the former Malabar district, or northern districts of Kerala state.
The Malabar region lies along the south-west coast of the Indian peninsula and forms the northern part of present-day Kerala state. Malayalam is the chief language of the region, and the ancestors of today's population have inhabited the region for centuries. Tulu speakers can be found mainly in the northern Kasaragod District. The region formed part of the ancient kingdom of Chera until the early 12th century. Following the breakup of the Chera Kingdom, the chieftains of the region proclaimed their independence. Notable among these were the Kolathiris of North Malabar, Zamorins of Calicut, the Coylot Wanees Country of NorthEast and coastal Ceylon (including Puttalam) and the Valluvokonathiris of Walluvanad. The Zamorin of Calicut became the most powerful of the Kings in the region by the 13th century primarily due to flourishing international trade at Calicut and Beypore port. The region came under British rule in the 18th century, during the Anglo-Mysore Wars.
During the British rule, Malabar's chief importance lay in producing pepper.Pamela Nightingale, ‘Jonathan Duncan (Governor of Bombay) (bap. 1756, d. 1811)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 The area was divided into two categories as North and South.  North Malabar comprises present Kasaragod and Kannur Districts, Mananthavady Taluk of Wayanad District and Vadakara and Koyilandy Taluks of Kozhikode District. Left-over area is South Malabar.
At the conclusion of the Anglo-Mysore wars, the region was organized into a district of Madras Presidency. The British district included the present-day districts of Kannur, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Malappuram, much of Palakkad. The administrative headquarters was at Calicut (Kozhikode). With India's independence, Madras presidency became Madras State, which was divided along linguistic lines on 1 November 1956, whereupon Kasaragod region was merged with the Malabar immediately to the north and the state of Travancore-Cochin to the south to form the state of Kerala.

[[Ram air turbine]]

CATEGORIES: Electrical generators, Aircraft components

A ram air turbine (commonly known by the acronym RAT) is a small turbine that is connected to a hydraulic pump, or  electrical generator, installed in an aircraft and used as a power source. The RAT generates power from the airstream by ram pressure due to the speed of the aircraft.
With the exception of crop dusters (see below), modern aircraft only use RATs in an emergency  — in case of the loss of both primary and auxiliary power sources the RAT will power vital systems (flight controls, linked hydraulics and also flight-critical instrumentation). Some RATs produce only hydraulic power, which is in turn used to power electrical generators. In some early aircraft (including airships), small RATs were permanently mounted and operated a small electrical generator or fuel pump.  
Modern aircraft generate power in the main engines or an additional fuel-burning turbine engine called an auxiliary power unit, which is often mounted in the rear of the fuselage or in the main-wheel well. The RAT generates power from the airstream due to the speed of the aircraft. If aircraft speeds are low, the RAT will produce less power. In normal conditions the RAT is retracted into the fuselage (or wing), and is deployed manually or automatically following complete loss of power. In the time between power loss and RAT deployment, batteries are used.
RATs are common in military aircraft which must be capable of surviving sudden and complete loss of power.  Many modern types of commercial airliners are equipped with RATs.  In the 1960s the Vickers VC10 was one of the first types of airliner equipped with a RAT. The Airbus A380 has the largest RAT propeller in the world at 1.63 m in diameter, but around 80 cm is more common. A typical large RAT on a commercial aircraft can be capable of producing, depending on the generator, from 5 to 70 kW. Smaller, low airspeed models may generate as little as 400 watts.
A possible "pioneering" use of such a device could be said to have been the standardized installation on the Me 163B Komet rocket fighter in 1942-43.  The unit was installed in the extreme nose of the aircraft to provide an auxiliary source of electrical power while the aircraft was in flight. 
In other military uses, pod-fitted systems such as the M61A1 Vulcan or electronic systems (e.g. the AN/ALQ-99 TJS) can be powered by a RAT in standard operation. Also, some free-fall nuclear weapons, such as the British Yellow Sun and Blue Danube, used RATs to power radar altimeters and firing circuits; these were a more reliable alternative to batteries.
In non-military use, RATs have been used to power centrifugal pumps to pressurize the spray systems on aircraft that are used as crop dusters to deliver liquid agents to cropland.  The major reason for choosing a RAT is safety; using a RAT allows, in the case of the US, the FAA-certified engine and power systems on the aircraft to remain unmodified.  There is no need to use an engine power takeoff to drive the pump, as the pump can be placed low or below the exterior of the airframe greatly simplifying plumbing. Being the lowest point in the plumbing, it will have gravity feed from the spray tanks and never need to be primed.  In the event of a pump failure that could result in seizure, there is no effect on the flying ability of the aircraft or its systems apart from the fact that the spray systems are non-functional.
Honeywell and Hamilton Sundstrand are the main US suppliers of RAT systems.

[[Wedding breakfast]]
CATEGORIES: Wedding traditions, Breakfasts

A wedding breakfast is a dinner given to the bride, bridegroom, and guests at the wedding reception that follows a wedding in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Scandinavia and some English-speaking countries. The Compact Oxford DictionaryCompact Oxford Dictionary lists the phrase as only “British”, and the Merriam-Webster online dictionaryMerriam-Webster online dictionary does not list it at all.
Wedding breakfast custom is occasionally spotted in touristic countries - especially ones that are destination for tourists from English speaking countries. Countries like Polandhttp://forgetmenots-weddings.blogspot.dk/2011/02/twoj-slub-jak-sniadanie-u-tiffniego.html have prepared offers to cater especially for wedding tourists.
Nowadays the wedding breakfast is not normally a morning meal, so its name can be confusing. The name is claimedWagner, L. (1894). Manners, customs and observances.  London: Heinemann.  (Chapter 7) to have arisen from the fact that in pre-Reformation times the wedding service was usually a Eucharistic Mass and that the bride and bridegroom would therefore have been fasting before the wedding in order to be eligible to receive the sacrament of Holy Communion. After the wedding ceremony was complete, the priest would bless and distribute some wine, cakes, and sweetmeats, which were then handed round to the company, including the bride and groom.  This distribution of food and drink was therefore a literal “break fast” for the bride and groom, though others in attendance would not necessarily take Communion and therefore would not necessarily have been fasting. Since usage of the phrase cannot be shown to date back earlier than the first half of the nineteenth century however, a pre-16th-century origin seems unlikely.
The author of Party-giving on Every Scale (London, n.d. 1880) suggests the phrase may have evolved fifty years earlier:
 The orthodox "Wedding Breakfast" might more properly be termed a "Wedding Luncheon," as it assumes the character of that meal to a great extent; in any case it bears little relation to the breakfast of that day, although the title of breakfast is still applied to it, out of compliment to tradition. As recently as fifty years ago luncheon was not a recognized meal, even in the wealthiest families, and the marriage feast was modernized into the wedding breakfast, which appellation this entertainment still bears. 
The Oxford English Dictionary does not record any occurrences of the phrase "wedding breakfast" before 1850, but it was used at least as far back as 1838.In a newspaper review of a recently published book, The Veteran by John Harley, the reviewer quotes: 'C--- and his bride returned to the coffee house, where they were received with great kindness the master and mistress who, notwithstanding the short notice, had a comfortable wedding-breakfast prepared for them'.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Times|date=15 January 1838|page=7[/tpl] This would agree with the quotation above, which suggests the phrase came into use about the 1830s.

CATEGORIES: Norwegian monarchy, Political history of Norway, Political history of Sweden

The Viceroy of Norway (Constitutional Danish: Vice-Konge) was the appointed head of the Norwegian Government in the absence of the King, during the era of the Union between Sweden and Norway. The role was essentially the same as that of the Governor-general, which has led to confusion as to who filled which office. Decisive, however, is that the title of Viceroy could only be held by the crown prince, or his oldest son, when he had come of age. Commoners with a similar mandate were merely styled Statholder (Governor-general).

Chloral hydrate is an organic compound with the formula C2H3Cl3O2.  It is a colourless solid.  It was once used as  sedative and hypnotic drug.  It remains a useful laboratory chemical reagent and precursor. It is derived from chloral (trichloroacetaldehyde) by the addition of one equivalent of water.
It was discovered through the chlorination (halogenation) of ethanol in 1832 by Justus von Liebig in Gießen.[ref]
</ref><ref>
</ref> Its [[sedative]] properties were first published in 1869 and subsequently, because of its easy synthesis, its use was widespread.<ref>
</ref> It was widely [[Recreational drug use|used recreationally]] and [[Medical prescription|misprescribed]] in the late 19th century. Chloral hydrate is soluble in both water and [[Ethanol|alcohol]], readily forming concentrated solutions.

Because of its status as a regulated substance, chloral hydrate can be difficult to obtain. To cope with procurement problems, Rutgers scientists have developed a substitute for chloral hydrate for use in microscopy, known as ''Visikol'',<ref>http://visikol.com</ref><ref>[tpl]cite journal | url = http://otc.rutgers.edu/pdf/Simon-2012-146.pdf | title = Visikol: Novel Clearing Agent and Mounting Medium to replace Chloral Hydrate Solution for use in Microscopy, Forensics, Quality Control, Education, and Biological, Food, and Earth Sciences | journal = Rutgers Technology #: 2012-146[/tpl]</ref> which has been shown to be an effective replacement for chloral hydrate for clearing plant specimens.<ref>[tpl]cite journal | url = http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.3732/apps.1300016 | title = An Improved Clearing and Mounting Solution to Replace Chloral Hydrate in Microscopic Applications | journal = Applications in Plant Sciences, 1(5) [/tpl]</ref>
It is, together with chloroform, a minor side-product of the chlorination of water when organic residues such as humic acids are present. It has been detected in drinking water at concentrations of up to 100 micrograms per litre (µg/L) but concentrations are normally found to be below 10 µg/L. Levels are generally found to be higher in surface water than in ground water.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/chloralhydratesumstatement.pdf | title=Summary statement - 12.20 Chloral hydrate (trichloroacetaldehyde) | publisher=World Health Organization | accessdate=March 14, 2013[/tpl]

The Sand Reckoner ([tpl]lang-el|Αρχιμήδης Ψαμμίτης, Archimedes Psammites[/tpl]) is a work by Archimedes in which he set out to determine an upper bound for the number of grains of sand that fit into the universe. In order to do this, he had to estimate the size of the universe according to the contemporary model, and invent a way to talk about extremely large numbers. The work, also known in Latin as Archimedis Syracusani Arenarius & Dimensio Circuli, which is about 8 pages long in translation, is addressed to the Syracusan king Gelo II (son of Hiero II), and is probably the most accessible work of Archimedes; in some sense, it is the first research-expository paper.Archimedes, The Sand Reckoner, by Ilan Vardi, accessed 28-II-2007.

The bridesmaids are members of the bride's party in a wedding. A bridesmaid is typically a young woman, and often a close friend or sister.  She attends to the bride on the day of a wedding or marriage ceremony. Traditionally, bridesmaids were chosen from unwed young women of marriageable age.
The principal bridesmaid, if one is so designated, may be called the chief bridesmaid or maid of honor if she is unmarried, or the matron of honor if she is married. A junior bridesmaid is a girl who is clearly too young to be marriageable, but who is included as an honorary bridesmaid. In the United States, typically only the Maid/Matron of Honor and the Best Man are the official witnesses. 
Often there is more than one bridesmaid: in modern times the bride chooses how many to ask. Historically, no person of status went out unattended, and the size of the retinue was closely calculated to be appropriate to the family's social status. A large group of bridesmaids provided an opportunity for showing off the family's social status and wealth. Today, the number of bridesmaids in a wedding party is dependent on many variables, including a bride's preferences, the size of her family, and the number of attendants her partner would like to have as well.
The male equivalent is the groomsman, also known in British English as the Best Man; in the United States, the role of attending to the groom has diverged from that of escorting guests to their seats, which is undertaken by Ushers, and the two positions are no longer synonymous and are often if not usually filled by different persons.
In some countries, such as in Norway and England, it is customary for bridesmaids to be small children rather than grown women. They may carry flowers during the wedding procession and pose with the married couple in bridal photos.  In an American-style wedding, this role is likewise separate from that of the bridesmaid, and the small child performing it is known as a flower girl.

[[Module (mathematics)]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic structures, Module theory

In abstract algebra, the concept of a module over a ring is a generalization of the notion of vector space over a field, wherein the corresponding scalars are the elements of an arbitrary ring. Modules also generalize the notion of abelian groups, which are modules over the ring of integers.
Thus, a module, like a vector space, is an additive abelian group; a product is defined between elements of the ring and elements of the module that is distributive over both parameters and is compatible with the ring multiplication. 
Modules are very closely related to the representation theory of groups. They are also one of the central notions of commutative algebra and homological algebra, and are used widely in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology.

CATEGORIES: European Union law

European Union law is a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states. The three sources of European Union law are primary law, secondary law and supplementary law. The main sources of primary law are the Treaties establishing the European Union. Secondary sources include regulations and directives which are based on the Treaties. The legislature of the European Union is principally composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which under the Treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the Treaties.
European Union law is applied by the courts of member states and where the laws of member states provide for lesser rights European Union law can be enforced by the courts of member states. In case of European Union law which should have been transposed into the laws of member states, such as Directives, the European Commission can take proceedings against the member state under the EC Treaty. The Court of Justice of the European Union is the highest court able to interpret European Union law. Supplementary sources of European Union law including case law by the Court of Justice, international law and general principles of European Union law.

During much of World War II, Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany. The occupation began with Operation Weserübung on April 9 1940, and lasted until German forces withdrew at the end of World War II following their surrender to the Allies on 5 May 1945. Contrary to the situation in other countries under German occupation, most Danish institutions continued to function relatively normally until 1943. Both the Danish government and king remained in the country in an uneasy relationship between a democratic and a totalitarian system until German authorities dissolved the government following a wave of acts of sabotage and labour strikes.
Just over 3,000 Danes died as a direct result of the occupation.Gert Laursen, The Occupation in Numbers, 1997, Danish Military History. Accessed 14 December 2012. (A further 4,000 Danish volunteers died fighting in the German army on the Eastern Front). Overall this represents a very low mortality rate (approximately 0.08% of population) when compared to other occupied countries and most belligerent countries. (See: World War II casualties).
An effective resistance movement developed by the end of the war, and most Danish Jews were rescued in 1943 when German authorities ordered their internment as part of the Holocaust.
In 2003, in a speech for the 60th anniversary of the end of the 1940–43 collaborationist government,  Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that Denmark's cooperation with Nazis was "morally unjustifiable", which was the first public condemnation of the World War II era Danish leadership by a Danish leader.Denmark: Apology For Cooperation With Nazis, 30 August 2003, The New York Times.

Roger III (1175 – 24 December 1193) was the son and heir of Tancred of Sicily by Sibylla of Acerra. He was made duke of Apulia, probably in 1189, at his father's succession.
In 1193, his father, King Tancred, arranged his marriage to Irene Angelina, daughter of the Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos. Tancred then had his son Roger crowned. Roger died at the end of that same year, shortly before his father's death on the February 20, 1194. His younger brother William III assumed the throne of Sicily under the regency of their mother Sibylla of Acerra.
On the November 20, 1194, Henry VI von Hohenstaufen, King of Germany and Emperor of Rome, entered Palermo, Sicily, and on December 25 William was stripped of his title. In 1197 Roger's widow, Irene, married Henry VI's brother Philip of Swabia.

CATEGORIES: Lists of companies by revenue, Fortune (magazine), Top lists, Annual magazine issues

The Fortune 500 is an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks the top 500 U.S. closely held and public corporations as ranked by their gross revenue after adjustments made by Fortune to exclude the impact of excise taxes companies incur.Fortune 500, USPages.com. The list includes publicly and privately held companies for which revenues are publicly available. The first Fortune 500 list was published in 1955.
Although the Fortune 500 list is the most familiar one, similar gross revenue lists of the top firms range from the highest ranking Fortune 100 including the top one hundred to the broader ranking Fortune 1000 that includes the top thousand firms. While the membership on the smaller lists are somewhat stable, the ranking on the lists may change over time depending upon revenues, and often because of mergers among firms already listed.
The original Fortune 500 was restricted to companies whose revenues were derived from manufacturing, mining, or energy exploration.  At the same time, Fortune published companion "Fortune 50" lists of the 50 largest commercial banks (ranked by assets), utilities (ranked by assets), life insurance companies (ranked by assets), retailers (ranked by gross revenues) and transportation companies (ranked by revenues).  Fortune magazine changed its methodology in 1994 to include service companies.  With the change came 291 new entrants to the famous list including three in the Top 10.[tpl]cite news|last=Groves|first=Martha|title=Service Now Counts With Fortune 500|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-26/business/fi-59111_1_fortune-services-companies|accessdate=2014-04-26|newspaper=Los Angeles TImes|date=1995-04-26[/tpl]

[[Netsuke]]
CATEGORIES: Japanese crafts, Japanese folk art, Ivory works of art, Fashion accessories

[tpl]nihongo|Netsuke|根付[/tpl] are miniature sculptures that were invented in 17th-century Japan to serve a practical function (the two Japanese characters ne+tsuke mean "root" and "to attach"). Traditional Japanese garments—robes called kosode and kimono—had no pockets; however, men who wore them needed a place to store their personal belongings, such as pipes, tobacco, money, seals, or medicines.
Their solution was to place such objects in containers (called sagemono) hung by cords from the robes' sashes (obi). The containers may have been pouches or small woven baskets, but the most popular were beautifully crafted boxes (inrō), which were held shut by ojime, which were sliding beads on cords. Whatever the form of the container, the fastener that secured the cord at the top of the sash was a carved, button-like toggle called a netsuke. 
Netsuke, like the inrō and ojime, evolved over time from being strictly utilitarian into objects of great artistic merit and an expression of extraordinary craftsmanship. Such objects have a long history reflecting the important aspects of Japanese folklore and life. Netsuke production was most popular during the Edo period in Japan, around 1615-1868. Today, the art lives on, and some modern works can command high prices in the UK, Europe, the USA, Japan and elsewhere. Inexpensive yet faithful reproductions are available in museums and souvenir shops.

[[Metallothionein]]
CATEGORIES: Enzymes

Metallothionein (MT) is a family of cysteine-rich, low molecular weight (MW ranging from 500 to 14000 Da) proteins. They are localized to the membrane of the Golgi apparatus. MTs have the capacity to bind both physiological (such as zinc, copper, selenium) and xenobiotic (such as cadmium, mercury, silver, arsenic) heavy metals through the thiol group of its cysteine residues, which represents nearly the 30% of its amino acidic residues.[tpl]cite book | editors = Sigel H, Sigel A | title = Metallothioneins and Related Chelators (Metal Ions in Life Sciences) | publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry | location = Cambridge, England | year = 2009 | pages = | isbn = 1-84755-899-2 | series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences | volume = 5 [/tpl]
MT was discovered in 1957 by Vallee and Margoshe from purification of a Cd-binding protein from horse (equine) renal cortex.[tpl]cite journal | author = Margoshes M, Vallee  BL | title = A cadmium protein from equine kidney cortex | journal=Journal of American Chemical Society | volume = 79 | issue = 17 | pages = 4813 | year = 1957 | doi = 10.1021/ja01574a064  [/tpl] MTs function is not clear, but experimental data suggest MTs may provide protection against metal toxicity, be involved in regulation of physiological metals (Zn and Cu) and provide protection against oxidative stress. There are four main isoforms expressed in humans (family 1, see chart below): MT1 (subtypes A, B, E, F, G, H, L, M, X), MT2, MT3, MT4.  In the human body, large quantities are synthesised primarily in the liver and kidneys.  Their production is dependent on availability of the dietary minerals, as zinc, copper and selenium, and the amino acids histidine and cysteine.

Small businesses are normally privately owned corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships. What constitutes "small" in terms of government support and tax policy varies depending on the country and industry.  Small businesses range from 15 employees under the Australian Fair Work Act 2009, 50 employees according to the definition used by the European Union, and fewer than 500 employees to qualify for many U.S. Small Business Administration programs. However,in 2006 there were over 18,000 "small businesses" with over 500 employees that accounted for half of all the employees employed by all "small business".Table 7. Size Distribution of American Business in 2006 Small businesses can also be classified according to other methods such as sales, assets, or net profits.
Small businesses are common in many countries, depending on the economic system in operation.  Typical examples include: convenience stores, other small shops (such as a bakery or delicatessen), hairdressers, tradesmen, lawyers, accountants, restaurants, guest houses, photographers, small-scale manufacturing, and online businesses, such as web design and programming, etc.

These products are engineered to precise design specifications which are tested to meet national or international standards. Engineered wood products are used in a variety of applications, from home construction to commercial buildings to industrial products.A Guide To Engineered Wood Products, Form C800. Apawood.org. Retrieved on 2012-02-10. The products can be used for joists and beams that replace steel in many building projects.Naturally:wood Engineered wood. Naturallywood.com. Retrieved on 2012-02-10.
Typically, engineered wood products are made from the same hardwoods and softwoods used to manufacture lumber. Sawmill scraps and other wood waste can be used for engineered wood composed of wood particles or fibers, but whole logs are usually used for veneers, such as plywood, MDF or particle board. Some engineered wood products, like oriented strand board (OSB), can use trees from the poplar family, a common but non-structural species.Canadian Wood Council OSB
Alternatively, it is also possible to manufacture similar engineered bamboo from bamboo; and similar engineered cellulosic products from other lignin-containing materials such as rye straw, wheat straw, rice straw, hemp stalks, kenaf stalks, or sugar cane residue, in which case they contain no actual wood but rather vegetable fibers.
Flat pack furniture is typically made out of man-made wood due to its low manufacturing costs and its low weight, making it easy to transport.

[[Vector bundle]]
CATEGORIES: Differential topology, Algebraic topology, Vector bundles, Vectors

In mathematics, a vector bundle is a topological construction that makes precise the idea of a family of vector spaces parameterized by another space X (for example X could be a topological space, a manifold, or an algebraic variety): to every point x of the space X we associate (or "attach") a vector space V(x) in such a way that these vector spaces fit together to form another space of the same kind as X (e.g. a topological space, manifold, or algebraic variety), which is then called a vector bundle over ''X''.
The simplest example is the case that the family of vector spaces is constant, i.e., there is a fixed vector space V such that V(x) = V for all x in X: in this case there is a copy of V for each x in X and these copies fit together to form the vector bundle X × V over X. Such vector bundles are said to be trivial. A more complicated (and prototypical) class of examples are the tangent bundles of smooth (or differentiable) manifolds: to every point of such a manifold we attach the tangent space to the manifold at that point. Tangent bundles are not, in general, trivial bundles: for example, the tangent bundle of the sphere is non-trivial by the hairy ball theorem. In general, a manifold is said to be parallelizable if and only if its tangent bundle is trivial.
Vector bundles are almost always required to be locally trivial, however, which means they are examples of fiber bundles. Also, the vector spaces are usually required to be over the real or complex numbers, in which case the vector bundle is said to be a real or complex vector bundle (respectively). Complex vector bundles can be viewed as real vector bundles with additional structure. In the following, we focus on real vector bundles in the category of topological spaces.

[[Fiber bundle]]
CATEGORIES: Fiber bundles, Differential topology, Algebraic topology, Homotopy theory

In mathematics, and particularly topology, a fiber bundle (or, in British English, fibre bundle) is a space that is locally a product space, but globally may have a different topological structure. Specifically, the similarity between a space E and a product space B × F is defined using a continuous surjective map 
that in small regions of E behaves just like a projection from corresponding regions of B × F to B.  The map π, called the projection or submersion of the bundle, is regarded as part of the structure of the bundle.  The space E is known as the total space of the fiber bundle, B as the base space, and F the fiber.
In the trivial case, E is just B × F, and the map π is just the projection from the product space to the first factor. This is called a trivial bundle. Examples of non-trivial fiber bundles include the Möbius strip and Klein bottle, as well as nontrivial covering spaces.  Fiber bundles such as the tangent bundle of a manifold and more general vector bundles play an important role in differential geometry and differential topology, as do principal bundles.
Mappings which factor over the projection map are known as bundle maps, and the set of fiber bundles forms a category with respect to such mappings.  A bundle map from the base space itself (with the identity mapping as projection) to E is called a section of E.  Fiber bundles can be generalized in a number of ways, the most common of which is requiring that the transitions between the local trivial patches lie in a certain topological group, known as the structure group, acting on the fiber F.

The Battle of the Somme is a 1916 British documentary and propaganda film, shot by two official cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell. The film depicts the British Army in the preliminary and early days of the battle of the Somme (1 July – 18 November 1916). The film had its première in London on 10 August 1916 and was released generally on 21 August. The film depicts trench warfare, showing marching infantry, artillery firing on German positions, British troops waiting to attack on 1 July, treatment of wounded British and German soldiers, British and German dead and captured German equipment and positions. A scene where British troops crouch in a ditch then "go over the top" was staged for the camera behind the lines.
The film was a great success, was watched by [tpl]circa| 20 million[/tpl] British people in the first six weeks of exhibition and the film was distributed in eighteen more countries. A second film covering a later phase of the battle, was released in 1917 as The Battle of the Ancre and the Advance of the Tanks. In 1920 the film was preserved in the film archive of the Imperial War Museum and was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. In 2005 the film was digitally restored and in 2008 was released on DVD. The Battle of the Somme is an early example of film propaganda, an historical record of the battle and a popular source of footage illustrating the First World War.[tpl]sfn|Fraser|Robertshaw|Roberts|2009|p=xv[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Smither|2004|p=1[/tpl]

Stefan Nemanja (Old Church Slavonic: [tpl]unicode|Стѣфань[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sr|Стефан Немања[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sh|stêfaːn ně̞maɲa|pron[/tpl]  ; ca 1113 – 13 February 1199) was the Grand Prince (Veliki Župan) of the Serbian Grand Principality (Rascia) from 1166 to 1196. He was an heir of the Vukanović dynasty and was the founder of the Nemanjić dynasty. He issued the "Hilandar Charter" for the newly founded monastery at Mount Athos.
He is remembered for his contributions to Serbian culture and history, being the founder of the powerful Serbian state that would evolve into the Serbian Empire, and the national church. He was the father of Stefan Nemanjić, the first King of Serbia, and of Saint Sava, the first archbishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church. In 1196, he abdicated in favour of his son Stefan, and went to Mount Athos, where he became a monk and took the name of Simeon. Together with his son Sava, Simeon built the Hilandar Monastery from 1198-1199. The monastery later became the cradle of the Serbian Orthodox Church.
After his death, Stefan Nemanja was canonized by the Serbian Orthodox Church under the name Saint Simeon the Myrrh-streaming (Свети Симеон Мироточиви) after numerous alleged miracles following his death. He is regarded the most remarkable Serb for his literary contributions and altruistic attributes, according to the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.„100 najznamenitijih Srba“, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 1993, ISBN 86-82273-08-X : He has the first place

The Devil's Disciple  is an 1897 play written by Irish dramatist, George Bernard Shaw. The play is Shaw's eighth, and after Richard Mansfield's original 1897 American production it was his first financial success, which helped to affirm his career as a playwright. It was published in Shaw's 1901 collection Three Plays for Puritans together with Captain Brassbound's Conversion and Caesar and Cleopatra.  Set in Colonial America during the Revolutionary era, the play tells the story of Richard Dudgeon, a local outcast and self-proclaimed "Devil's disciple".  In a twist characteristic of Shaw's love of paradox, Dudgeon sacrifices himself in a Christ-like gesture despite his professed Infernal allegiance.

Ground sloths are a diverse group of extinct sloths, in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra. The term "ground sloth" is used as a reference for all extinct sloths because of the large size of the earliest forms discovered, as opposed to the extant "tree sloths."  However, this is a historical convention and does not imply that all extinct sloths were strictly terrestrial in nature.J.L. White (1993) Their most recent survivors lived in the Antilles, where it has been proposed they may have survived until 1550 CE;R.M. Nowak (1999) however, radiocarbon dating suggests an age of between 2819 and 2660 BCE for the last known occurrence of Megalocnus in Cuba.[ref]
</ref> Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of [[North America|North]] and South America for 10,000 years or more.<ref name = "Fiedal">
</ref> Their later survival in the Caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans. Some insular sloth populations persisted 5,000-6,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives, in congruence with the global pattern of late Quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal.<ref name = "Steadman_2005">
</ref>
The bulk of ground sloth evolution took place during the mid to late Tertiary of South America while the continent was isolated.  At their earliest appearance in the fossil record, the ground sloths were already distinct at the family level.  The presence of intervening islands between the American continents in the Miocene allowed a dispersal of forms into North America.  A number of mid- to small-sized forms are believed to have previously dispersed to the Antilles islands either by making short swims or using land bridges.  Ground sloths were a hardy group as evidenced by their diverse numbers and dispersals into remote areas given the finding of their remains in Patagonia (Cueva del Milodón)C.M. Hogan (2008) and parts of Alaska.
Sloths, and xenarthrans as a whole, represent one of the more successful South American groups during the Great American Biotic Interchange. During the interchange, many more taxa moved from North America into South America than in the other direction. At least five genera of ground sloths have been identified in North American fossils; these are examples of successful immigration to the north.

[[Juniper, New Brunswick]]
CATEGORIES: Communities in Carleton County, New Brunswick

Juniper (2001 pop.: 450) is a Canadian hamlet in Carleton County, New Brunswick.  Juniper is located in Aberdeen Parish. It is situated on Route 107, which runs from Route 105 at Bristol, northeast to Juniper, and then bends southeast towards Napadogan and Deersdale.  Geographic coordinates: 46° 33' North, 67° 13' West; elevation 899 ft. 
Juniper is named for the low growing juniper shrub which allegedly grows in the boggy spruce forest near Juniper Station.
The local economy is largely forestry-based, with a modern lumber mill operated by Fraser Papers (Nexfor, Inc). The assets of Juniper Lumber at the time of purchase by Fraser included an I-joist plant, a sawmill and 1,060 square kilometres of forest land under management through Crown licenses and sub-licenses. The I-joist plant, which commenced production in mid-1998, has an annual production capacity of 80 million lineal feet (two shifts). Juniper employs 250 in New Brunswick.www.panelworldmag.com  There is also a tree nursery operated by J.D. Irving Ltd.  
The economy also benefits from some hunting and fishing-related tourism, as the village is on the South Branch of the Southwest Miramichi River, renowned for its salmon and trout fishing.
The nearby Juniper Barrens String Bog, the largest bog in the area, covers 12 square kilometres, and is home to the White Fringed Orchid (Platanthera blepharglottis), an uncommon type of Butterfly Orchid, and the sedge (grass) Carex eburnea. The peat is two to three metres deep. The bog is one of several unique sites  in Maine and the Maritime Provinces of Canada, featured on the Irving Forest Discovery Network.

Principality of Serbia or Serbian Principality ([tpl]lang-sr|Cрпска Кнежевина/Srpska Kneževina[/tpl]) was an early medieval state of the Serbs ruled by the Vlastimirović dynasty, that existed from ca 768 to 969 in Southeastern Europe. It was established through an unification of several South Slavic tribes under the supreme rule of Višeslav, the first known Serbian ruler by name ([tpl]floruit[/tpl] 768–814). In 822, the Serbs were said to rule the "greater part of Dalmatia", and at the same time the Bulgars had taken the lands to the east, preparing to conquer Serbia. Vlastimir defeated the Bulgar army in a three-year-war (839–842), and the two powers lived in peace for some decades. Vlastimir's three sons succeeded in ruling Serbia together, although not for long; Serbia became a key part in the power struggle between the Byzantines and Bulgars (in predominantly Byzantine alliance), which also resulted in major dynastic civil wars for a period of three decades.  Serbia was annexed by the Bulgars for three years (924–927), until the return of the political hostage Prince Časlav, who united several provinces, becoming the most powerful of the Vlastimirović. An important event was the establishment of Christianity as state-religion in 869 AD, and the founding of the first Serbian eparchy, the Eparchy of Ras. The information of the Vlastimirović dynasty ends with De Administrando Imperio (fl. 950–960). Serbia was annexed by the Byzantines in 969 and ruled as the Catepanate of Ras.

[[Killing field]]
CATEGORIES: Land warfare

A killing field, in military science, is an area in front of a defensive position that the enemy must cross during an assault and is specifically intended to allow the defending troops to incapacitate a large number of the enemy. Defensive emplacements such as anti-tank obstacles, barbed wire and minefields are often used to funnel the enemy into these killing fields. The fields are generally cleared of most cover so that attackers are exposed when being fired upon. Some methods of destroying the assault capabilities of attacking forces include machine guns, artillery and mortars; often with interlocking fields of fire. Such a term may be used to describe the approaches to an "ideal" defensive fortification. An example of a killing field would be the exposed beaches in front of the seawall at Normandy.
The term originated in medieval warfare to describe clear areas outside of a castle's walls such as pastures or specifically cleared fields where enemy soldiers could be easily and methodically killed in large numbers by ranged weapons. It also refers to areas within castles specially designed to bunch attackers who had breached the outer defenses into an area where the defenders could kill them easily through arrow loops and murder holes. Often these were small courtyards surrounded by high walls.

[[Ricci curvature]]

CATEGORIES: Riemannian geometry, Tensors in general relativity, Curvature (mathematics)

In differential geometry, the Ricci curvature tensor, named after Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, represents the amount by which the volume of a geodesic ball in a curved Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space.  As such, it provides one way of measuring the degree to which the geometry determined by a given Riemannian metric might differ from that of ordinary Euclidean n-space. The Ricci tensor is defined on any pseudo-Riemannian manifold, as a trace of the Riemann curvature tensor.  Like the metric itself, the Ricci tensor is a symmetric bilinear form on the tangent space of the manifold [tpl]harv|Besse|1987|p=43[/tpl].It is assumed that the manifold carries its unique Levi-Civita connection. For a general affine connection, the Ricci tensor need not be symmetric.
In relativity theory, the Ricci tensor is the part of the curvature of space-time that determines the degree to which matter will tend to converge or diverge in time (via the Raychaudhuri equation).  It is related to the matter content of the universe by means of the Einstein field equation.  In differential geometry, lower bounds on the Ricci tensor on a Riemannian manifold allow one to extract global geometric and topological information by comparison (cf. comparison theorem) with the geometry of a constant curvature space form.  If the Ricci tensor satisfies the vacuum Einstein equation, then the manifold is an Einstein manifold, which have been extensively studied (cf. [tpl]harvnb|Besse|1987[/tpl]).  In this connection, the Ricci flow equation governs the evolution of a given metric to an Einstein metric, the precise manner in which this occurs ultimately leads to the solution of the Poincaré conjecture.

[[Xerox art]]
CATEGORIES: Art genres

Xerox art (sometimes, more generically, called electrostatic art or copy art) is created by putting objects on the glass, or image area, of a copying machine and by pressing "start" to making an image.  If the object is not flat, or the cover does not totally cover the object, the image is distorted in some way.  The curvature of the object, the amount of light that reaches the image surface, the distance of the cover from the glass all affect the final image. Often, with proper manipulation, rather ghostly images can be made.  Xerox art appeared shortly after the first Xerox copying machines were made.  There are exhibits now in Los Angeles and New York City museums of more controlled examples of the form.  It is akin to photography.  Color copiers added to the form, as can be seen by surrealist Jan Hathaway's combining color xerography with other media, Carol Heifetz Neiman's layering prismacolor pencil through successive runs of a color photocopy process (1988-1990), or R.L. Gibson's use of large scale xerography such as in Psychomachia (2010).
The San Francisco Bay Area had an active Color Xerox arts scene starting in 1978 many local artists worked in the medium. From post card stores to gallery exhibits, to Barbara Cushman's Color Xerox Calendar this was a busy time for copy art.
Xerox art is often used in mail art.

The fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) is a medium-sized wild cat of South and Southeast Asia. In 2008, the IUCN classified the fishing cat as Endangered since they are concentrated primarily in wetland habitats, which are increasingly being settled, degraded and converted. Over the last decade, the fishing cat population throughout much of its Asian range declined severely.[tpl]IUCN |assessors=Mukherjee, S., Sanderson, J., Duckworth, W., Melisch, R., Khan, J., Wilting, A., Sunarto, S., Howard, J.G. |year=2010 |id=18150 |taxon=Prionailurus viverrinus |version=2012.2[/tpl]

[[George Crabbe]]

CATEGORIES: 1754 births, 1832 deaths, English poets, English entomologists, English naturalists, English clergy, People from Aldeburgh, 18th-century English medical doctors, English surgeons

George Crabbe ([tpl]IPAc-en|k|r|æ|b[/tpl];Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary: "Crabbe" 24 December 1754 – 3 February 1832) was an English poet, surgeon, and clergyman. He is best known for his early use of the realistic narrative form and his descriptions of middle and working-class life and people.
In the 1770s, Crabbe began his career as a doctor's apprentice, later becoming a surgeon. In 1780, he travelled to London to make a living as a poet. After encountering serious financial difficulty and unable to have his work published, he wrote to statesman and author Edmund Burke for assistance. He included samples of his poetry, and Burke was impressed enough by Crabbe's poems to promise to aid him in any way he could. The two became close friends and Burke helped Crabbe greatly both in his literary career and in building a role within the church.
Burke introduced Crabbe to the literary and artistic society of London, including Sir Joshua Reynolds and Samuel Johnson, who read The Village before its publication and made some minor changes. Burke secured Crabbe the important position of Chaplain to the Duke of Rutland. Crabbe served as a clergyman in various capacities for the rest of his life, with Burke's continued assistance in securing these positions. Later, he developed friendships with many of the great literary men of his day, including Sir Walter Scott, whom he visited in Edinburgh, and William Wordsworth and some of his fellow Lake Poets, who frequently visited Crabbe as his guests.
Lord Byron, an avowed admirer of Crabbe's poetry, described him as "nature's sternest painter, yet the best." Crabbe's poetry was predominantly in the form of heroic couplets, and has been described as unsentimental in its depiction of provincial life and society. Modern critic Frank Whitehead has said that "Crabbe, in his verse tales in particular, is an important–indeed, a major–poet whose work has been and still is seriously undervalued." Crabbe's works include The Village (1783), Poems (1807), The Borough (1810), and his poetry collections Tales (1812) and Tales of the Hall (1819).

Field Marshal Sir Henry Hughes Wilson, 1st Baronet, [tpl]post-nominals|country=GBR|GCB|DSO[/tpl] (5 May 1864 – 22 June 1922) was one of the most senior British Army staff officers of World War I and was briefly an Irish Unionist politician.
Wilson served as Commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, and then as Director of Military Operations at the War Office, in which post he played a vital role in drawing up plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France in the event of war. During these years Wilson acquired a reputation as a political intriguer for his role in agitating for the introduction of conscription and in the Curragh Incident of 1914.
As Sub Chief of Staff to the BEF, Wilson was Sir John French's most important advisor during the 1914 campaign, but his poor relations with Haig and Robertson saw him sidelined from top decision-making in the middle years of the war. He played an important role in Anglo-French military relations in 1915 and - after his only experience of field command as a corps commander in 1916 - again as an ally of the controversial General Nivelle in early 1917.  Later in 1917 he was military advisor to the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and then British Permanent Military Representative at the Supreme War Council at Versailles.
In 1918 Wilson served as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (professional head of the Army). He continued to hold this position after the war, a time when the Army was being sharply reduced in size whilst attempting to contain industrial unrest in the UK and nationalist unrest in Mesopotamia, Iraq and Egypt. He also played an important role in the Irish War of Independence.
After retiring from the Army, Wilson served briefly as a Member of Parliament, and also as security advisor to the Northern Ireland government. He was assassinated on his own doorstep by two IRA gunmen in 1922 whilst returning home from unveiling a war memorial at Liverpool Street station.

[[Political risk insurance]]

CATEGORIES: Types of insurance

Political risk insurance is a type of insurance that can be taken out by businesses, of any size, against political risk—the risk that revolution or other political conditions will result in a loss.
Political risk insurance is available for several different types of political risk, including:
As with any insurance, the precise scope of coverage is governed by the terms of the insurance policy.
The underwriting of political risk insurance is a dynamic, growing business. As globalisation increases, there are more corporations doing more business in more places around the world with each passing year. Some of the changes occurring in the business are high growth, new product offerings, and a greater role for private capital.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1027950 | title=For political risk, insurance isn’t all | date=May 5, 2006 | accessdate=2006-07-17 | work=Rustomjee | publisher=Diligent Media Corporation | last=Mishra | first=K.C.[/tpl][tpl]cite news  | last = Kambayashi | first = Satoshi | title = Of coups and coverage: Political turmoil is costly.

While political risk insurance policies are sometimes manuscripted for specific situations, the major political risk insurers have standard forms for the coverages that they issue.  For "complex" or larger investments manuscripted policies are the norm and there may be several insurers providing cover in the form of a syndication, through co-insurance, or perhaps with the participation of a reinsurer on a facultative basis. 
Providers of political risk insurance include public agencies and private insurance companies.  With there being a wide range of options available, the use of a specialized broker is highly recommended.

[[S1C reactor]]
CATEGORIES: United States naval reactors

The S1C reactor was a prototype naval reactor designed for the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships.  The S1C designation stands for:
This nuclear reactor was built in Windsor, Connecticut as a prototype for the experimental USS Tullibee (SSN-597) submarine, though that boat was in fact powered by a S2C reactor. The propulsion plant was unusual in that the steam turbines powered an electric motor, rather than a set of reduction gears.  The USS Tullibee was an early advanced-design, fast-attack submarine constructed by Electric Boat and commissioned in 1960. 
Throughout the Cold War, the S1C Prototype nuclear submarine propulsion plant at the Windsor Site (41°52'45.08" N  72°43'02.55" W) supported the submarines and surface ships of the Navy’s nuclear fleet by testing new equipment and training Naval propulsion plant operators. S1C was the prototype for the USS Tullibee. The S1C Prototype was operated at the Windsor Site from 1959 until 1993. During that time, over 14,000 Naval operators were trained there, including Admiral Kirkland H. Donald early in his career. 
Full cleanup of the S1C site was recently declared to be complete by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection in 2006.DOE Reactor Site Returns To Green Field Conditions - First Unrestricted Release Of A Nuclear Power Site Remediation of the site was undertaken by Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL), based out of Schenectady, New York. KAPL had taken over operation of the S1C site in the 1960s after expiration of the Navy's original contract with C-E.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
The reactor was situated on land and known as the S1C Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU). Except for its size and electric drive, the system layout was very similar to the S5W reactor used in most nuclear-powered submarines at the time.

[[Minimal surface]]

CATEGORIES: Differential geometry, Differential geometry of surfaces, Minimal surfaces

In mathematics, a minimal surface is a surface that locally minimizes its area. This is equivalent to (see definitions below) having a mean curvature of zero.
The term "minimal surface" is used because these surfaces originally arose as surfaces that minimized total surface area subject to some constraint. Physical models of area-minimizing minimal surfaces can be made by dipping a wire frame into a soap solution, forming a soap film, which is a minimal surface whose boundary is the wire frame. However the term is used for more general surfaces that may self-intersect or do not have constraints. For a given constraint there may also exist several minimal surfaces with different areas (for example, see minimal surface of revolution): the standard definitions only relate to a local optimum, not a global optimum.

[[Medium-density fibreboard]]
CATEGORIES: Composite materials, Engineered wood

Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) is an engineered wood product made by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres, often in a defibrator, combining it with wax and a resin binder, and forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure.Spence, 2005, p. 114 MDF is generally denser than plywood. It is made up of separated fibres, but can be used as a building material similar in application to plywood. It is stronger and much more dense than particle board.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.decorativesurfaces.org/products/medium-density-fiberboard.html/details/ |title=Medium Density Fiberboard, Moulding, Embossing, Kitchen Cabinets – Composite Panel Association |publisher=Decorativesurfaces.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02[/tpl]
The name derives from the distinction in densities of fibreboard. Large-scale production of MDF began in the 1980s, in both North America and Europe.United Nations (2005). European forest sector outlook study: 1960/2000/2020, main report. New York u.a.: United Nations. p. 32. ISBN 9211169216.

Homo ergaster (meaning "working man") or African ''Homo erectus[tpl]cite news|last=Hazarika|first=Manji|title=Homo erectus/ergaster and Out of Africa: Recent Developments in Paleoanthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology|date=16–30 June 2007[/tpl] is an extinct chronospecies of Homo'' that lived in eastern and southern Africa during the early Pleistocene, between 1.8 million and 1.3 million years ago.
There is still disagreement on the subject of the classification, ancestry, and progeny of H. ergaster, but it is now widely accepted to be the direct ancestor of later hominids such as Homo heidelbergensis, Homo sapiens, and Homo neanderthalensis and Asian Homo erectus.[tpl]cite journal|author=G. Philip Rightmire|title=Human Evolution in the Middle Pleistocene: The Role of Homo heidelbergensis|year=1998|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology[/tpl]

C. (2003), Natural history of Homo erectus. Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., 122: 126–170. [tpl]doi|10.1002/ajpa.10399[/tpl] "By the 1980s, the growing numbers of H. erectus specimens, particularly in Africa, led to the realization that Asian H. erectus (H. erectus sensu stricto), once thought so primitive, was in fact more derived than its African counterparts. These morphological differences were interpreted by some as evidence that more than one species might be included in H. erectus sensu lato (e.g., Stringer, 1984; Andrews, 1984; Tattersall, 1986; Wood, 1984, 1991a, b; Schwartz and Tattersall, 2000)." ... "Unlike the European lineage, in my opinion, the taxonomic issues surrounding Asian vs. African H. erectus are more intractable. The issue was most pointedly addressed with the naming of H. ergaster on the basis of the type mandible KNM-ER 992, but also including the partial skeleton and isolated teeth of KNM-ER 803 among other Koobi Fora remains (Groves and Mazak, 1975). Recently, this specific name was applied to most early African and Georgian H. erectus in recognition of the less-derived nature of these remains vis à vis conditions in Asian H. erectus (see Wood, 1991a, p. 268; Gabunia et al., 2000a). It should be noted, however, that at least portions of the paratype of H. ergaster (e.g., KNM-ER 1805) are not included in most current conceptions of that taxon. The H. ergaster question remains famously unresolved (e.g., Stringer, 1984; Tattersall, 1986; Wood, 1991a, 1994; Rightmire, 1998b; Gabunia et al., 2000a; Schwartz and Tattersall, 2000), in no small part because the original diagnosis provided no comparison with the Asian fossil record."
The latest discoveries go even further claiming that all five contemporary species of early "Homo" in Africa, "Homo habilis", "Homo rudolfensis", "Homo ergaster", and "Homo erectus" are representatives from the same species, best named "Homo erectus" who evolved about 2 million years ago in Africa and expanded through Eurasia, as far as China and Java, where it was first documented from about 1.2 million years ago.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131017173906.htm[/tpl]
The binomial name was published in 1975 by Groves and Mazák. The second part, "ergaster", is derived from the Ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἐργαστήρ[/tpl] "workman", in reference to the comparatively advanced lithic technology developed by the species, introducing the Acheulean industry.

CATEGORIES: Meat substitutes, Vegan cuisine, Vegetarian cuisine, Buddhist vegetarianism, Wheat

Wheat gluten, also called seitan (Japanese: セイタン), wheat meat, mock duck, gluten meat, or simply gluten, is a food made from gluten, the main protein of wheat. It is made by washing wheat flour dough with water until all the starch granules have been removed, leaving the sticky insoluble gluten as an elastic mass which is then cooked before being eaten.[tpl]reflist|first=Pauldragron |date=January 2007| url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H2qzA50jZQ[/tpl]
Wheat gluten is an alternative to soybean-based meat substitutes such as tofu. Some types of wheat gluten have a chewy or stringy texture that resembles meat more than other substitutes. Wheat gluten is often used instead of meat in Asian, vegetarian, Buddhist, and macrobiotic cuisines. Simulated duck is a common use for wheat gluten.
Wheat gluten has historically been popular in the cuisines of China, Japan and other East and Southeast Asian nations. In Asia, it is commonly found on the menus of restaurants catering primarily to Buddhist customers who do not eat meat.

It was written to clarify and increase the scope of the previous version of [tpl]USC|18|1030[/tpl] while, in theory, limiting federal jurisdiction to cases "with a compelling federal interest-i.e., where computers of the federal government or certain financial institutions are involved or where the crime itself is interstate in nature." (see "Protected Computer", below). In addition to clarifying a number of the provisions in the original section 1030, the CFAA also criminalized additional computer-related acts. Provisions addressed the distribution of malicious code and denial of service attacks. Congress also included in the CFAA a provision criminalizing trafficking in passwords and similar items. 
The Act has been amended a number of times—in 1989, 1994, 1996, in 2001 by the USA PATRIOT Act, 2002, and in 2008 by the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act.

[[Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives]]

CATEGORIES: Voting system criteria

Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives (ISDA) is a voting system criterion defined such that its satisfaction by a voting system occurs when the selection of the winner is independent of candidates who are not within the Smith set.
A simple way to describe is that if a voting system is ISDA, then whenever you can partition the candidates into group A and group B such that each candidate in group A is preferred over each candidate in group B, you can eliminate all candidates of group B without changing the outcome of the election.
Any election method that is independent of Smith-dominated alternatives automatically satisfies the Smith criterion, and all criteria implied by it, notably the Condorcet criterion and the mutual majority criterion.

She has appeared in multiple film and television adaptations of the Peter Pan stories, in particular the 1953 animated Walt Disney picture Peter Pan. She also appears in the official sequel Peter Pan in Scarlet by Geraldine McCaughrean and commissioned by Great Ormond St Hospital as well as the "Peter and the Starcatchers" book series by Ridley Pearson and Dave Barry. At first only a supporting character described by her creator as "a common fairy", her animated incarnation was a hit and has since become a widely recognized unofficial mascot of The Walt Disney Company, and the centerpiece of its Disney Fairies media franchise including the direct-to-DVD film series Tinker Bell.

Rattle and Hum is the sixth studio album by rock band U2, and a companion rockumentary film directed by Phil Joanou, both released in 1988. The film and the album feature live recordings, covers, and new songs. To a greater extent than on their previous album, The Joshua Tree, the band explores American roots music and incorporates elements of blues rock, folk rock, and gospel music in their sound. The motion picture was filmed primarily in the United States in late 1987 during The Joshua Tree Tour and it features their experiences with American music. Although Rattle and Hum was intended to represent the band paying tribute to rock legends, some critics accused U2 of trying to place themselves amongst the ranks of these artists. While critical reception was mixed, the album was a commercial success, reaching the number one spot in several countries and selling 14 million copies.Stokes (2005), p. 78

Let Go is the debut album by Franco-Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne, released on 4 June 2002. For a year after signing a record deal with Arista, Lavigne struggled due to conflicts in musical direction. Lavigne relocated to Los Angeles, California, and recorded there her earlier materials for the album, the kind of sound to which the label was not amenable. She was paired to the production team The Matrix, who understood her vision for the album.
The album was credited as the biggest pop debut of 2002, and was 6x platinum in the United States. It was released to generally positive critical reviews, although Lavigne's songwriting received some criticism. It also did extremely well in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association,[tpl]r|cria[/tpl] as well as reaching multi-platinum in many countries around the world, including the UK in which she became the youngest female solo artist to have a number-one album in the region.

They have a brown cap, a white forehead, a black mask around the eyes and a short orange and black bill.
Their breeding habitat is open ground on beaches or flats across northern Canada and Alaska. They nest on the ground in an open area with little or no plant growth.
They are migratory and winter in coastal areas of the southern United States, the Caribbean and much of South America. They are extremely rare vagrants to western Europe, and have been found in Tierra del Fuego and the Isles of Scilly.[tpl]cite book|last=Coomber|first=Richard|title=Birds of the World|year=1991|publisher=Colour Library Books Ltd.|location=Godalming, Surrey|isbn=0862838061|pages=97–100|accessdate=25 July 2013|chapter=Charadriiformes: Plovers[/tpl] Their true status may be obscured by the difficulty in identifying them from the very similar Ringed Plover of Eurasia, of which it was formerly considered a subspecies.
These birds forage for food on beaches, tidal flats and fields, usually by sight. They eat insects, crustaceans and worms.
This bird resembles the Killdeer but is much smaller and has only one band.Kaufman, Kenn. (2000) Kaufman Field Guide to Birds of North America. New York: Houghton-Mifflin. The term "semipalmated" refers to its partly webbed feet. Like the Killdeer and since its nest is on the ground, it uses a "broken-wing" display to lure intruders away from the nest.

The Richelieu River takes it source in Lake Champlain, from which it flows to the north in the province of Quebec, Canada and empties into the St. Lawrence river. It was formerly known as the Iroquois River and the Chambly River. This river was a key route of water transport for cross-border trade between Canada and the United States, until the arrival of the railway in the mid-19th century.
Because of its strategic position between New France and New England, several military fortifications were erected on the course of the river. It served as a key pathway for several military tours and was the scene of several battles between the end of the 17th and early 19th centuries, first between the French and the Iroquois, then between the French and the English, during the regime of the New France and finally between the English and the Americans after 1760.

[[Points of sail]]

Points of Sail describes a sailing boat's course in relation to the wind direction.
There is a distinction between the port tack and the starboard tack.  If the wind is coming from anywhere on the port side, the boat is on port tack.  Likewise if the wind is coming from the starboard side, the boat is on starboard tack.   Except when head to wind, a boat will be on either port or starboard tack while on any point of sail.  For purposes of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and the Racing Rules of Sailing, the wind is assumed to be coming from the side opposite that which the boom is carried.

[[Jibe]]
CATEGORIES: Sailing manoeuvres

A jibe or gybe is a sailing maneuver whereby a sailing vessel reaching downwind turns its stern through the wind, such that the wind direction changes from one side of the boat to the other.  For square-rigged ships, this maneuver is called wearing ship.
In this maneuver, the mainsail will cross the center of the boat while the jib is pulled to the other side of  the boat.  If the spinnaker is up, the pole will have to be manually moved to the other side, to remain opposite the mainsail.  In a dinghy, raising the centerboard can reduce the risk of capsizing during what can be a somewhat violent maneuver.  
The other way to change the side of the boat that faces the wind is turning the bow of the boat into, and then through, the direction of the wind. This operation is known as tacking or coming about.

The Tychonic system (or Tychonian system) was a model of the solar system published by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century which combined what he saw as the mathematical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical and "physical" benefits of the Ptolemaic system. The model may have been inspired by Valentin Naboth[tpl]cite book |last= Westman |first= Robert S. |authorlink= Patronage_in_Astronomy#Robert_Westman |title= The Copernican achievement |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=sLb6k-62vbQC&lpg=PA285&pg=PA322#v=onepage&q&f=true |year= 1975 |publisher= University of California Press |isbn= 978-0-520-02877-7 |oclc= 164221945 |page= 322 [/tpl] and Paul Wittich, a Silesian mathematician and astronomer.Owen Gingerich, The Book Nobody Read: Chasing the Revolutions of Nicolaus Copernicus, Penguin, ISBN 0-14-303476-6 A similar geoheliocentric model was also earlier proposed by Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Ramasubramanian | first1 = K. | year = 1994 | title = Modification of the earlier Indian planetary theory by the Kerala astronomers (c. 1500 AD) and the implied heliocentric picture of planetary motion | url = | journal = Current Science | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 784–90 [/tpl]Joseph, George G.

It is essentially a geocentric model; the Earth is at the center of the universe. The Sun and Moon and the stars revolve around the Earth, and the other five planets revolve around the Sun. It can be shown that the motions of the planets and the Sun relative to the Earth in Brahe's system are mathematically equivalent to the motions in Copernicus' heliocentric system, "The Tychonic system is, in fact, precisely equivalent mathematically to Copernicus' system." (p. 202) and "The Tychonic system is transformed to the Copernican system simply by holding the sun fixed instead of the earth.  The relative motions of the planets are the same in both systems ..." (p. 204), Kuhn, Thomas S. , The Copernican Revolution (Harvard University Press, 1957). but the Tychonic system fit the available data better than Copernicus system  "This new geoheliocentric cosmology had two major advantages going for it: it squared with deep intuitions about how the world appeared to behave, and it fit the available data better than Copernicus's system did.."

[[Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy]]
CATEGORIES: French colonial governors and administrators, 1583 births, 1660 deaths, People from Saint Kitts

Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy (1583–1660) was a French nobleman and Bailiff Grand Cross of the Knights of Malta.  He governed the island of Saint Christopher from 1639 to his death in 1660, first under the Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique and later under the Knights of Malta themselves.  Poincy was the key figure in the Hospitaller colonization of the Americas.
On 12 January 1638 de Poincy set sail for the Caribbean on board  La Petite Europe On February 20 he took up his commission as Lieutenant Governor of the Isles of America and Captain general of the French at St Kitts. He arrived wearing the regalia of the Knights of St John and soon dispensed with the authority of the French king, declaring "The people of St Kitts will have no other Governor than De Poincy and will take no orders from the King of France."
In 1639 he reached an agreement with the English on St Kitts that neither nation should grow tobacco. for one and a half years.
He instructed one of his followers, the Huguenot Levasseur with sixty buccaneers to drive out the English from Tortuga. Levasseur was successful and on 6 November 1640 a treaty was drawn up between de Poincy and Levasseur which allowed religious tolerations and trade between the two islands.
By 1642 he started building the Chateau de Montagne on his estate called La Fontaine. This was an elaborate building, credited as being one of the grandest ever constructed in the Americas, though today it is in ruins. The grounds of La Fontaine were also heavily planted with exotic tropical plants. The Poinciana (Caesalpinia pulcherrima) was named in his honor, the name later becoming secondarily associated with the Royal Poinciana (Delonix regia).
He had a Town Hall erected in Basseterre in what is now known as Church Street. This served as his administrative centre, where he dispensed justice and administered the colony.
On 26 December 1644, the French king sent de Thoissy to relieve him, de Poincy refused to let him land. Eventually de Thoissy was sent back to France in chains. The Capuchins were also expelled at this time for taking the side of de Thoissy. The Jesuits were invited in to take their place. De Poincy bought the nearby island of St Croix, which he bequeathed to the Knights of St John.
In 1648 first he seized the island of St Bartholomew, populated by 170 Europeans and fifty enslaved Africans. Then he sent his nephew, Robert de Lonvillliers, with 300 men to take over the French half of Saint Martin. This was ratified at the Treaty of Concordia. In 1650 he heard that the Spanish had evacuated St Croix, so he sent Vaugelan with two ships and one hundred and sixty men to capture it. The French set fire to the trees which had made settling there so problematic for the Spanish.
Following the intervention of the Knights of Malta in 1651 he paid 90,000 livres to make peace with de Thoissy. He persuaded Giovanni Paolo Lascaris, Grand Master of the Knights of Malta to pay 120,000 livres for St Kitts, St Croix, St Bartholomew and St Martin. Although de Poincy was immediately appointed governor, Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny was soon appointed in his place. However, when Montmagny arrived, like with de Thoissy, de Poincy refused to step aside, and Montmagny was obliged to settle down in Cayonne where he lived waiting upon the death of Poincy until his own death in 1657.
In 1653 the French king further entrenched the authority of the Knights of Malta on the four islands, retaining sovereignty over the islands with 1,000 crowns to be paid on the accession of each new French King.
De Poincy died at the age of 77 on 11 April 1660. He was a Bailiff Grand cross of the Knights of Malta and Chef d'escadre of the French Brittany Fleet. he was buried in Basseterre, probably in the grounds of what is now St George's church. He is credited with turning Bassterre into a successful Caribbean trading port. The annual Saint Kitts carnival troupe, Les Actors, are people descended from a troupe of Acrobats from Africa whom he had imported to Saint Kitts as his slaves and personal performers for parties at La Fontaine.

CATEGORIES: Articles containing proofs, Theorems in calculus, Theorems in real analysis

In calculus, the extreme value theorem states that if a real-valued function f is continuous in the closed and bounded interval a,b, then f must attain a maximum and a minimum, each at least once. That is, there exist numbers c and d in a,b such that:
A related theorem is the boundedness theorem which states that a continuous function f in the closed interval a,b is bounded on that interval. That is, there exist real numbers m and M such that:
The extreme value theorem enriches the boundedness theorem by saying that not only is the function bounded, but it also attains its least upper bound as its maximum and its greatest lower bound as its minimum.
The extreme value theorem is used to prove Rolle's theorem.  In a formulation due to Karl Weierstrass, this theorem states that a continuous function from a compact space to a subset of the real numbers attains a maximum and a minimum.

Rare stamps are among the most portable of tangible investments, take up little space but require careful storage as condition is one of the most important factors in determining the value of a stamp. Other tangible investments include art, antiques, precious metals, rare coins and many others that are all termed alternative investments. Interest in stamps as an investment tends to increase when traditional investments are not doing well, causing investors to seek alternatives. The increasing age of the population in western countries has also been credited with a resurgence in interest in stamps.[tpl]cite web|last=Sandler |first=Linda |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&sid=aklLsB4MpiZI&refer=home |title=Bill Gross's British Stamps Outperformed Pimco Fund (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-03-04[/tpl]
A British auctioneer warned: "Unless you know what you are doing – and this only comes with many years of experience – it is very difficult to buy sensibly and at the right prices. When you buy on a retail basis, you have to overcome the profit margins the dealer has built into his selling price, plus VAT. When you sell, you also have to overcome dealing charges, whether you sell to an auction house or a dealer. That would consume an awful lot of value. To overcome that mark-up and sell at a profit would require quite a few years of appreciation."

OMEGA was the first truly global radio navigation system for aircraft, operated by the United States in cooperation with six partner nations.  It enabled ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving very low frequency (VLF) radio signals in the range 10 to 14 kHz,  transmitted by a network of fixed terrestrial radio beacons, using a receiver unit.  It became operational around 1971 and was shut down in 1997.

Menhirs may be found singly as monoliths, or as part of a group of similar stones. Their size can vary considerably, but their shape is generally uneven and squared, often tapering towards the top. Menhirs are widely distributed across Europe, Africa and Asia, but are most numerous in Western Europe; in particular in Ireland, Great Britain and Brittany. There are about 50,000 megaliths in these areas,[tpl]cite book|last=Greene|first=Janice|title=Strange But True Stories|date=January 2006|isbn=1-59905-010-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8Nic-eFE2LAC&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=%2250,000+megaliths%22&source=bl&ots=nE6tXPe2VP&sig=hubpu-AdDz806TG4JedMbXPLrcg&hl=en&ei=ztRWToinMNLjsQLp2tXLDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%2250%2C000%20megaliths%22&f=false|accessdate=25 August 2011[/tpl] while there are 1,200 menhirs in northwest France alone.Oliphant, Margaret "The Atlas Of The Ancient World" 1992 p. 81 Standing stones are usually difficult to date, but pottery found underneath some in Atlantic Europe connects them with the Beaker people. They were constructed during many different periods across pre-history, erected as part of a larger megalithic culture that flourished in Europe and beyond.
Some menhirs have been raised next to buildings that often have an early or current religious significance. One example is the South Zeal Menhir in Devon, which formed the basis for a 12th-century monastery built by lay monks. The monastery later became the Oxenham Arms Hotel at South Zeal, and the standing stone remains in place in the ancient snug bar at the hotel. 
Where menhirs appear in groups, often in a circular, oval, henge or horseshoe formation, they are sometimes called megalithic monuments. These are sites of ancient religious ceremonies, sometimes containing burial chambers.Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 (ISBN 0-7862-8517-6) The exact function of menhirs has provoked more debate than practically any other issue in European pre-history. Over the centuries, they have variously been thought to have been used by Druids for human sacrifice, used as territorial markers or elements of a complex ideological system, or functioned as early calendars.Patton, Mark. "Statements in Stone: Monuments and Society in Neolithic Brittany". (New York), Routledge, 1993. P. 4. Until the nineteenth century, antiquarians did not have substantial knowledge of prehistory, and their only reference points were provided by classical literature. The developments of radiocarbon dating and tree-ring calibration have done much to further knowledge in this area.
The word menhir was adopted from French by 19th century archaeologists. It is a combination of two words found in the Breton language; men and hir. In modern Welsh, they are described as maen hir, or "long stone". In modern Breton, the word peulvan is used.

[[Krautrock]]

CATEGORIES: Krautrock, Progressive rock, Music scenes, German styles of music

Krautrock is rock and electronic music that originated in Germany in the late 1960s. The term was popularized in the English-speaking press. Later, German media started to use it as a term for all German rock bands from the late 1960s and 1970s, while abroad the term specifically referred to more experimental artists who often but not always used synthesizers and other electronic instruments. 
The term is a result of the English-speaking world's reception of the music at the time and not a reference to any one particular scene, style, or movement, as many krautrock artists were not familiar with one another. BBC DJ John Peel in particular is largely credited with spreading the reputation of krautrock outside of the German-speaking world.[tpl]CN|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock & roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and New Age music. Key artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon Düül II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.

Exegesis (from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἐξήγησις[/tpl] from [tpl]lang|grc|ἐξηγεῖσθαι[/tpl] 'to lead out') is a critical explanation or interpretation of a text, especially a religious text.  Traditionally the term was used primarily for exegesis of the Bible; however, in modern usage it has broadened to mean a critical explanation of any text, and the term "biblical exegesis" is used for greater specificity.
Exegesis includes a wide range of critical disciplines:  textual criticism is the investigation into the history and origins of the text, but exegesis may include the study of the historical and cultural backgrounds for the author, the text, and the original audience.  Other analysis includes classification of the type of literary genres present in the text, and an analysis of grammatical and syntactical features in the text itself.
The terms exegesis and hermeneutics have been used interchangeably.

The indigobirds and whydahs, are a family, Viduidae, of small passerine birds native to Africa.
These are finch-like species which usually have black or indigo predominating in their plumage. The birds named "whydahs"The Yellow-mantled Widowbird was the type species of its genus, and was originally named from the city of Ouidah in Benin. Nowadays the name Whydah (i.e. Ouidah) is however applied to the long-tailed species of the Viduidae. have long or very long tails in the breeding male.
All are brood parasites, which lay their eggs in the nests of estrildid finch species; most indigobirds use fire-finches as hosts, whereas the paradise whydahs chose pytilias.
Unlike the cuckoo, the indigobirds and whydahs do not destroy the host's eggs. Typically, they lay 2–4 eggs in with those already present. The eggs of both the host and the victim are white, although the indigobird's are slightly larger. 
Many of the indigo-plumaged species named "indigobirds" are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. The best guide is often the estrildid finch with which they are associating, since each indigobird parasitises a different host species. For example, the Village Indigobird is usually found with Red-billed Fire-finches.
Indigobirds and whydahs imitate their host's song, which the males learn in the nest. Although females do not sing, they also learn to recognise the song, and choose males with the same song, thus perpetuating the link between each species of indigobird and firefinch.
The nestling indigobirds mimic the unique gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species.
The matching with the host is the driving force behind speciation in this family, but the close genetic and morphological similarities among species suggest that they are of recent origin.

[[Time spent listening]]
CATEGORIES: Radio terminology

Time spent listening (TSL) is one of the measurements surveyed by Nielsen Audio in determining ratings for radio stations in the United States. It is the equivalent of Average
Time Exposed (ATE), Daily or Weekly.
TSL is defined as the amount of time the average listener surveyed spent listening to each radio station at one time, before changing the station or turning it off. Alternately, it is an estimate of how long the average panelist (listener) was exposed to a particular station or stations for a specific time period.
TSL trends are used in conjunction with AQH Share ("AQH") to evaluate listenership to a station. In some radio formats, a station with low AQH (number of listeners) but high TSL is considered more attractive to advertisers than a high AQH / low TSL station, because the station's listeners are more likely to stick with the station through commercial breaks and hear the paid advertisements.

The transmitter/studio link (or TSL) of a radio station or television station is a return link which sends telemetry data from the remotely located radio transmitter or television transmitter back to the studio for monitoring purposes.  The 'TSL may return the same way as the studio/transmitter link (STL), or it can be embedded in the station's regular broadcast signal as a subcarrier (for analog stations) or a separate data channel (for digital stations).  
Analog or digital data such as transmitter power, temperature, VSWR, voltage, modulation level, and other status information are returned so that broadcast engineering staff can correct any problems as soon as possible.  These data may be attended to by an automated transmission system.

[[Studio/transmitter link]]
CATEGORIES: Broadcast transmitters, Broadcast engineering, Television terminology

A studio-transmitter link (or STL) sends a radio station's or television station's audio and video from the broadcast studio to a radio transmitter or television transmitter in another location.  
This is often necessary because the best locations for an antenna are on top of a mountain, where a much shorter tower is required, but where a studio is completely impractical.  Even in flat regions, the center of the station's allowed coverage area may not be near the studio location or within a populated area where a transmitter would be frowned upon by the community, so the antenna must be placed several miles or kilometres away.
Depending on the locations that must be connected, a station may choose either a point to point (PTP) link on another special radio frequency, or a newer all-digital wired link via a dedicated T1 or E1 (or larger-capacity) line.  Radio links can also be digital, or the older analog type, or a hybrid of the two.  Even on older all-analog systems, multiple audio and data channels can be sent using subcarriers.
Stations that employ an STL usually also have a transmitter-studio link (or TSL) to return telemetry information.  Both the STL and TSL are considered broadcast auxiliary services (BAS).

It exists in two versions, with minor differences between them. The original was written by Keats in 1819. He used the title of a 15th century poem by Alain Chartier, though the plots of the two poems are different. 
The poem is considered an English classic, stereotypical to other of Keats' works. It avoids simplicity of interpretation despite simplicity of structure. At only a short twelve stanzas, of only four lines each, with a simple ABCB rhyme scheme, the poem is nonetheless full of enigmas, and has been the subject of numerous interpretations.

A combat engineer, also called pioneer or sapper in many armies, is a soldier who performs a variety of construction and demolition tasks under combat conditions. Such tasks typically include constructing and breaching trenches, tank traps and other fortifications, bunker construction, bridge and road construction or destruction, laying or clearing land mines, and other physical work in the battlefield. More generally, the combat engineer's goals involve facilitating movement and support of friendly forces while impeding that of the enemy. 
Usually, a combat engineer is also trained as an infantryman, and combat engineering units often have a secondary role fighting as infantry. Beyond self-defense, combat engineers, infantry and assault troopers from armored corps units are generally the only troops that engage in the assault while dismounted. This role is limited by a lack of fire support (such as that obtained by infantry units from their mortars and recoilless rifles). However combat engineers typically do have extensive antiarmor capability in their infantry fighting role, such as with antitank missiles.  There are no advanced academic qualifications required to be a combat engineer.  The term "engineer" is not to be confused with the term applied to Professional Engineer or Chartered Engineer.

[[Campanology]]
CATEGORIES: Bell ringing, Musicology

Campanology (from Late Latin campana, "bell"; and Greek [tpl]lang|grc|-λογία[/tpl], -logia) is the study of bells. It encompasses the technology of bells — how they are cast, tuned and sounded — as well as the history, methods, and traditions of bell-ringing as an art.
It is common to collect together a set of tuned bells and treat the whole as one musical instrument. Such collections — such as a Flemish carillon, a Russian zvon, or an English "ring of bells" used for change ringing — have their own practices and challenges; and campanology is likewise the study of perfecting such instruments and  composing and performing music for them.
In this sense, however, the word "campanology" is most often used in reference to relatively large bells, often hung in a tower. It is not usually applied to assemblages of smaller bells, such as a glockenspiel, a collection of tubular bells, or an Indonesian gamelan.

[[Shelf (computing)]]

CATEGORIES: NeXT, Graphical user interface elements

The Shelf is an interface feature in NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP, and is used as a repository to store links to commonly used files, directories and programs, and as a temporary "holding" place to move/copy files and directories around in the file system hierarchy. In Mac OS X, items may be dragged onto the sidebar area of the Finder while holding the Apple key, but these do not behave as placeholders and cannot be manipulated in the below manner.
The dynamics of the Shelf in file system operations can be illustrated by comparison with the metaphor used in the Microsoft Windows operating systems. In order to move a file the following steps may be taken:
With the NeXT operating systems, in addition to moving files by dragging them from window to window, the following method can be used:
Note that the file, when dragged to the Shelf, has not moved anywhere and is not changed in any way. The Shelf icon is merely a placeholder for the file. In moving the placeholder off the shelf, the actual action occurs.
The NeXT functionality builds upon this concept by allowing the destination directory to be put on the Shelf as well, and the file can be merely dragged to the destination directory icon.  
The process is similar to the Microsoft Windows functionality of copying or cutting file system objects (a file or files, a folder or folders, or a combination of both) to the clipboard; the objects are not copied or removed from their original location until the paste operation to the new location is completed.  The Shelf concept, though older, is more powerful in that the file system objects, their sources and destinations are persistent and available as long as they are on the Shelf (in the Windows cut, copy, and paste metaphor the objects and locations persist until one copy/move operation is complete or until something else is placed in the clipboard).  
Since Shelf icons are 'placeholders' of sorts, icons can be put on the Shelf representing commonly used directories, and commonly used programs can be put on the Shelf as well.
The NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP file management application (called FileViewer and run by the Workspace Manager) also allowed users to have different shelves associated with particular directories. Users simply opened a new browser rooted in a particular subdirectory, and that browser window would show the corresponding shelf, allowing users to have many different shelves based on whatever folder hierarchy they happened to be using to organize their files.

The Snake (蛇) is one of the 12-year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac and related to the Chinese calendar, as well as in related East Asian zodiacal or calendrical systems. The Year of the Snake is associated with the Earthly Branch symbol 巳. Snake Horoscope Information Retrieved 28 August 2012.
According to one mythical legend, there is a reason for the order of the 12 animals in the 12-year cycle. The story goes that a race was held to cross a great river, and the order of the animals in the cycle was based upon their order in finishing the race. In this story, the Snake compensated for not being the best swimmer by hitching a hidden ride on the Horse's hoof, and when the Horse was just about to cross the finish line, jumping out, scaring the Horse, and thus edging it out for sixth place.
The same 12 animals are also used to symbolize the cycle of hours in the day, each being associated with a two-hour time period. The "hour" of the Snake is 9:00 to 11:00 a.m., the time when the sun warms up the earth, and Snakes are said to slither out of their holes.
The reason the animal signs are referred to as "zodiacal" is that one's personality is said to be influenced by the animal sign(s) ruling the time of birth, together with elemental aspects of the animal signs within the sexegenary (60 year) cycle. Similarly, the year governed by a particular animal sign is supposed to be characterized by it, with the effects particularly strong for people who were born in a year governed by the same animal sign.
In Chinese symbology, Snakes are regarded as intelligent, but with a tendency to be somewhat unscrupulous.Eberhard, sub "Snake (She)", p. 268

The W.S. Cox Plate is an Australian Group 1 Thoroughbred horse race held in Melbourne every October by the Moonee Valley Racing Club to honour W.S. Cox, the club's founder.  For three-year-olds and over, the race is considered to be the Weight for Age championship of Australasia. It is run over 2,040 metres (2,231 yards) on turf, and carries Australia's richest weight-for-age prize of A$3 million. The plate is named for William Samuel Cox, who established the Moonee Valley Racecourse in 1883.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/moonee-valley-signing-its-death-warrant-20110406-1d4eg.html |title=Developer Proposes Housing Plan For Moonee Valley Racecourse |author=Andrew Lemon |date=7 April 2011 |work=The Age |accessdate=8 April 2011[/tpl]
The Cox Plate is rated by many to be the truest test of horses' abilities in Australia, and in 1999 it was included in the Emirates World Series Racing Championship, a global "grand prix" of horse racing. The series included the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, the Japan Cup, the Dubai World Cup, the Arlington Million, the Hong Kong Cup, the Canadian International Stakes, the Grosser Preis von Baden, the Irish Champion Stakes, and Breeders' Cup Turf and Breeders' Cup Classic.

[[Martinho da Costa Lopes]]

Martinho da Costa Lopes (1918 – February 27, 1991) was an East Timorese religious and political leader.  Msgr da Costa Lopes, who was a Timorese priest of many years experience, was also a member of the National Assembly in Lisbon.  By 1975, when the Indonesian troops landed in Timor, he had become the assistant to the Portuguese Bishop of Dili, Dom José Joaquim Ribeiro. When the latter, distraught by the killings, requested retirement in May 1977, his position was taken by Msgr da Costa Lopes, who at the age of 58 became the Apostolic Administrator of the Dili diocese, answerable directly to the Pope and responsible for the whole of East Timor. 
For some years he privately took up issues of allegations of atrocities and starvation with the Indonesian military leaders, but came to realise that he was being ignored. So in 1981 he changed tactics. He now made his complaints public by writing letters overseas and then giving his permission for them to be published in newspapers and through the media, so that the world community, unaware of what was happening in the closed territory, would come to learn of the killings by the Indonesians. In particular he criticized the forced conscription of 50,000 men and boys to form a human chain to help crush the Fretilin resistance, and later denounced the Indonesian army for war crimes, in particular the massacre of 500 women and children at the Shrine of St Anthony at Lacluta in September 1981. 
He was reprimanded by the military and infuriated President Suharto. Never before had an East Timorese so publicly exposed and humiliated the Indonesian Armed Forces.  His response was: "I feel the irrepressible need to tell the whole world about the genocide being practised in Timor so that, when we die, at least the world will know we died standing."
Meanwhile he continued to highlight the evidence of massive starvation in the resettlement camps and gave his support to his priests who sought to stand alongside the people. Desperately he wrote to the Pope requesting a special audience, to which the Vatican responded that it was neither timely nor necessary. For Msgr da Costa Lopes this was one of his hardest blows. He went on, in a letter to Australia, to accuse the Indonesian military of mass murder, and anticipated widepead famine unless large food supplies were urgently imported. His predictions were proved correct. 
Former Australian Prime Minister Whitlam, called the bishop "a liar, who was simply stirring up trouble".[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] However his denunciations proved so controversial and supported by outside agencies that Indonesia could no longer tolerate them. 
General Benny Moerdani was suspected of persuading the Papal Pro-Nuncio in Jakarta, whom he was suspected of being close to, to advise the Pope to request the resignation of the Apostolic Administrator. This happened in May 1983, when Msgr da Costa Lopes retired, painfully leaving his native land to live in Lisbon where he died on February 27, 1991. Lopes was succeeded as Apostolic Administrator by Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo.Robinson, G. “If you leave us here, we will die” Princeton University Press 2010 p 87.
Martinho da Costa Lopes grew up in an era when the Portuguese church in what was then Portuguese Timor cooperated closely with the Portuguese colonial government, but was less strongly linked with the people, of whom only 28% were Catholic in 1975. In spite of this grounding and in spite of his being in his 60s, he oriented the church towards support for the Timorese people fighting in the mountains and for those priests (Portuguese and Timorese) who had gone to live in the mountains with them. In 1981 the country's lingua franca the Tetum language, was made an official language of the Catholic liturgy in East Timor, instead of Indonesian. 
The decision by the Vatican to force him to leave was made over the heads of the Timorese clergy, many of whom wrote to the Pope opposing it. Msgr da Costa Lopes paid for his outspoken criticism of Indonesian actions in East Timor with his job. 
However his name remains associated with a historic re-orientation of the Timorese church towards the local culture and people. This new and indigenous church achieved, during these six years, a numerical growth which centuries of work by Portuguese missionaries had never managed in East Timor.

The Mendip Hills (commonly called the Mendips) is a range of limestone hills  to the south of Bristol and Bath in Somerset, England. Running east to west between Weston-super-Mare and Frome, the hills overlook the Somerset Levels to the south and the Chew Valley and other tributaries of the Avon to the north. The hills give their name to the local government district of Mendip, which administers most of the area.
The hills are largely formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. The higher, western part of the hills has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), which gives it a level of protection comparable to a national park. The AONB is [tpl]Unit area|sqkm|198|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.mendiphillsaonb.org.uk/faqs.php | publisher= Mendip Hills AONB | title= Frequently Asked Questions | accessdate=2 March 2009[/tpl] The Mendip Hills AONB and Somerset County Council's outdoor education centre is at the Charterhouse Centre near Blagdon.

The Senate of Finland combined the functions of cabinet and supreme court in the Grand Duchy of Finland from 1816 to 1917 and in the independent Republic of Finland from 1917 to 1918.
The body that would become the Senate was established in 1809, when the Diet of Porvoo was requested to, and drew up regulations for a Government Council.Jutikkala, Eino and Pirinen, Kauko. A History of Finland. Dorset Press, 1988 p. 162. ISBN 0-88029-260-1  In 1816, this institution was renamed to the Senate by the tsar, to demonstrate that it was equal to, rather than subsidiary to its Russian equivalent.Jutikkala, Eino and Pirinen, Kauko. A History of Finland. Dorset Press, 1988 p. 163. ISBN 0-88029-260-1 
The Senate was headed by the Governor-General of Finland. The members of the Senate had to be Finnish citizens. The Senate was divided into the economic division and the judicial division. In 1822 both divisions were given a Finnish vice-chairman. From 1858 and onwards the members of the senate were formally known as senators. After the February Revolution in Russia the Vice Chairman of the Economic Division became the Chairman of the Senate. Due to the Civil War in 1918 the Senate was relocated to the town of Vaasa from January 29 to May 3.
In 1918 the economic division became the Cabinet and the judicial division became the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court of the independent Republic of Finland. The vice chairman of the economic division became the Prime Minister of Finland, and the other senators became ministers.

In mathematics, a root system is a configuration of vectors in a Euclidean space satisfying certain geometrical properties. The concept is fundamental in the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Since Lie groups (and some analogues such as algebraic groups) and Lie algebras have become important in many parts of mathematics during the twentieth century, the apparently special nature of root systems belies the number of areas in which they are applied.  Further, the classification scheme for root systems, by Dynkin diagrams, occurs in parts of mathematics with no overt connection to Lie theory (such as singularity theory).  Finally, root systems are important for their own sake, as in graph theory in the study of eigenvalues.

In common parlance, a devil's advocate is someone who, given a certain argument, takes a position they do not necessarily agree with (or simply an alternative position from the accepted norm), for the sake of debate or to explore the thought further. In taking this position, the individual taking on the devil's advocate role seeks to engage others in an argumentative discussion process. The purpose of such a process is typically to test the quality of the original argument and identify weaknesses in its structure, and to use such information to either improve or abandon the original, opposing position. It can also refer to someone who takes a stance that is seen as unpopular or unconventional, but is actually another way of arguing a much more conventional stance.

A syndrome, in medicine and psychology, is the collection of signs and symptoms that are observed in, and characteristic of, a single condition.   In medical genetics, a syndrome refers specifically to medical condition where the underlying genetic cause has been identified, and the collection of symptoms is pathogenetically related.  Examples of syndromes in medical genetics include: Down syndrome, Stickler syndrome, and Williams syndrome.  Conditions such as Toxic shock syndrome and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome are examples of non-genetic syndromes.  If the underlying genetic cause is not known, the condition is referred to as an "association".  By definition, an association shows that the collection of signs and symptoms occurs in combination more frequently than would be likely by chance alone.[tpl]cite book|title = Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary | page = 167 | edition = 32 | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | location = USA | ISBN = 978-1-4160-6257-8[/tpl] Syndromes are often named after the physician or group of physicians that discovered them or initially described the full clinical picture.  Recently, there has been a shift towards naming conditions descriptively or according to their underlying cause, however the "eponymous" syndromes often persist in common usage.

The main interest in Dynkin diagrams are as a means to classify semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields. This gives rise to Weyl groups, i.e. to many (although not all) finite reflection groups. Dynkin diagrams may also arise in other contexts.

[[Tangible investment]]

CATEGORIES: Investment, Financial terminology

A tangible investment is something physical that you can touch. It is an investment in a tangible, hard or real asset or personal property. This contrasts with financial investments such as stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments.S. Ferris and A. Makhija, "Tangible Assets as Investments: A Risk and Return Analysis,", Akron Business and Economic Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, Fall 1987, pp. 115-128
Some assets are held purely for their ability to appreciate, such as collectibles, while others are held for the income they generate while they depreciate, such as equipment held for lease. Others exhibit a combination of properties, appreciating in market value while depreciating in book value, such as rental real estate. Timberland exhibits depletion of timber combined with appreciation of land. Other assets’ values fluctuate with supply and demand, such as commodities, which are liquid investments unlike most other tangible investments. 
These various properties, together with the lack of correlation to traditional asset class values, make tangible investments a means of reducing overall investment risk through diversification.

[[Person from Porlock]]
CATEGORIES: English poetry, Clichés, People whose existence is disputed, Unidentified people

The Person from Porlock was an unwelcome visitor to Samuel Taylor Coleridge during his composition of the poem Kubla Khan in 1797. Coleridge claimed to have perceived the entire course of the poem in a dream (possibly an opium-induced haze), but was interrupted by this visitor from Porlock (a village in the South West of England, near Exmoor) while in the process of writing it. Kubla Khan, only 54 lines long, was never completed. Thus "Person from Porlock", "Man from Porlock", or just "Porlock" are literary allusions to unwanted intruders who disrupt inspired creativity.
Coleridge was living at Nether Stowey (a village in the foothills of the Quantocks). It is unclear whether the interruption took place at Culbone Parsonage or at Ash Farm. He described the incident in his first publication of the poem:
English poet and essayist Thomas De Quincey speculated, in his own Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, that the mysterious figure was Coleridge's physician, Dr. P. Aaron Potter, who regularly supplied the poet with laudanum.
This story is by no means universally accepted by scholars.  It has been suggested by Elisabeth Schneider (in Coleridge, Opium and "Kubla Khan", University of Chicago Press, 1953) among others, that this prologue, as well as the Person from Porlock, was fictional and intended as a credible explanation of the poem's seemingly fragmentary state as published. [tpl]Wayback|http://core.ecu.edu/engl/hecimovichg/studyabroad/lyricalballads/comp3d.htm|The 1816 Preface and Kubla Khan as a "Fragment"[/tpl] The poet  Stevie Smith also suggested this view in one of her own poems, saying "the truth I think, he was already stuck".Stevie Smith, "Thoughts about the Person from Porlock"
If the Porlock interruption was a fiction, it would parallel the famous "letter from a friend" that interrupts Chapter XIII of Coleridge's Biographia Literaria just as he was beginning a hundred-page exposition of the nature of the imagination. It was admitted much later that the "friend" was the author himself. In that case, the invented letter solved the problem that Coleridge found little receptiveness for his philosophy in the England of that time.

Rubin "Hurricane" Carter (May 6, 1937 – April 20, 2014) was an American middleweight boxer who was wrongly convicted of murder[tpl]cite news|title=Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter dead at 76|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/rubin-hurricane-carter-dead-at-76-1.2616026|accessdate=April 21, 2014|newspaper=CBC News|date=April 20, 2014[/tpl] and later freed via a petition of habeas corpus after spending almost 20 years in prison. 
In 1966, police arrested both Carter and friend John Artis for a triple-homicide committed in the Lafayette Bar and Grill in Paterson, New Jersey. Police stopped Carter's car and brought him and Artis, also in the car, to the scene of the crime. On searching the car, the police found ammunition that fit the weapons used in the murder. [tpl]cite web|title=Jury discounted testimony of witnesses who identified Carter, Artis|url=http://www.graphicwitness.com/carter/jury.html|accessdate=April 22, 2014|newspaper= Herald-News, Passaic-Clifton, N.J.|date=1975|author=Maravel, Harry|author2=Johnson, Ed[/tpl] Police took no fingerprints at the crime scene and lacked the facilities to conduct a paraffin test for gunshot residue. Carter and Artis were tried and convicted twice (1967 and 1976) for the murders, but after the second conviction was overturned in 1985, prosecutors chose not to try the case for a third time.
Carter's autobiography, titled The Sixteenth Round, was published in 1975 by Warner Books. The story inspired the 1975 Bob Dylan song "Hurricane" and the 1999 film The Hurricane (with Denzel Washington playing Carter).  From 1993 to 2005, Carter served as executive director of the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted.

[[Predictive dialer]]
CATEGORIES: Telemarketing, Telephony

A predictive dialer dials a list of telephone numbers and connects answered dials to people making calls, often referred to as agents. Predictive dialers use statistical algorithms to minimize the time that agents spend waiting between conversations, while minimizing the occurrence of someone answering when no agent is available.Predictive Dialing for Outbound Telephone Call Centers, Douglas A. Samuelson, Interfaces, 29:5 September-October, 1999 (pp. 66-81).
When dialing numbers one at a time, there are two sources of delay. First, only some fraction of dials are answered. So, for example, if 1 out of 3 dials are answered, a predictive dialer might dial 3 lines every time an agent becomes available. Second, even dials that are answered take some time before being picked up. If it typically takes 10 seconds for someone to pick up, and conversations typically last 90 seconds, a predictive dialer might start dialing at 80 seconds.
Dialing one number at a time, only when an agent is available, typically keeps agents utilized for 40 minutes per hour (33% idle time). Predictive dialing can increase utilization to 57 minutes per hour (5% idle time).
Predictive dialers may be standalone hardware devices, or they may be integrated in software with call center or contact center platforms. When integrated, the dialer often also performs less aggressive dialing modes, such as power, progressive, or preview dialing.[tpl]cn|date=August 2013[/tpl]

[[Weight (representation theory)]]
CATEGORIES: Lie algebras, Representation theory of Lie algebras, Representation theory of Lie groups

In the mathematical field of representation theory, a weight of an algebra A over a field F is an algebra homomorphism from A to F, or equivalently, a one-dimensional representation of A over F. It is the algebra analogue of a multiplicative character of a group. The importance of the concept, however, stems from its application to representations of Lie algebras and hence also to representations of algebraic and Lie groups. In this context, a weight of a representation is a generalization of the notion of an eigenvalue, and the corresponding eigenspace is called a weight space.

They are gregarious and often colonial seed-eaters with short, thick, but pointed bills. They are all similar in structure and habits, but vary widely in plumage colours and patterns.
All the estrildids build large, domed nests and lay 5–10 white eggs. Many species build roost nests. Some of the fire-finches and pytilias are hosts to the brood-parasitic indigobirds and whydahs, respectively.
Most are sensitive to cold and require warm, usually tropical, habitats, although a few have  adapted to the cooler climates of southern Australia.

Freethought or free thought is a philosophical viewpoint which holds that positions regarding truth should be formed on the basis of logic, reason, and empiricism, rather than authority, tradition, or other dogmas.http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinkerhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/free+thoughthttp://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf The cognitive application of freethought is known as "freethinking", and practitioners of freethought are known as "freethinkers".http://archive.is/20120804135530/http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php
Freethought holds that individuals should not accept ideas proposed as truth without recourse to knowledge and reason. Thus, freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of facts, scientific inquiry, and logical principles, independent of any logical fallacies or the intellectually limiting effects of authority, confirmation bias, cognitive bias, conventional wisdom, popular culture, prejudice, sectarianism, tradition, urban legend, and all other dogmas. Regarding religion, freethinkers hold that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of supernatural phenomena.[tpl]cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC[/tpl]
A line from "Clifford's Credo" by the 19th-century British mathematician and philosopher William Kingdon Clifford perhaps best describes the premise of freethought: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."

Schrödinger, Der stetige Übergang von der Mikro- zur Makromechanik, Naturwissenschaften 14 (1926) 664-666. The quantum harmonic oscillator and hence, the coherent states, arises in the quantum theory of a wide range of physical systemsJ.R. Klauder and B. Skagerstam, Coherent States, World Scientific, Singapore, 1985. 
For instance, a coherent state describes the oscillating motion of the particle in a quadratic potential well (for an early reference, see e.g.
Schiff's textbookL.I. Schiff, Quantum Mechanics, McGraw Hill, New York, 1955.). 
These states, defined as eigenvectors  of the lowering operator and forming an overcomplete family, were introduced in the early papers of John R. Klauder, e.g. 
.J. R. Klauder, The action option and a Feynman quantization of spinor fields in terms of ordinary c-numbers, Ann. Physics 11 (1960) 123–168. 
In the quantum theory of light (quantum electrodynamics) and other bosonic quantum field theories, coherent states were introduced by the work of Roy J. Glauber in 1963. Here the coherent state of a field describes an oscillating field, the closest quantum state to a classical sinusoidal wave such as a continuous laser wave.
However, the concept of coherent states has been considerably generalized, to the extent that it has become a major topic in mathematical physics and in applied mathematics, with applications ranging from  quantization to signal processing and image processing (see Coherent states in mathematical physics). For that reason, the coherent states associated to the quantum harmonic oscillator are usually called
canonical coherent states (CCS) or standard coherent states or Gaussian states in the literature.

The flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) is a small wild cat patchily distributed in the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra. Since 2008, it has been listed as endangered by the IUCN due to destruction of wetlands in their habitat. It is suspected that the effective population size could be fewer than 2,500 mature individuals, with no subpopulation having an effective population size larger than 250 adult individuals.[tpl]IUCN |assessors=Wilting, A., Hearn, A., Sanderson, J., Ross, J. and Sunarto, S. |year=2010 |id=18148 |taxon=Prionailurus planiceps |version=2010.4[/tpl]

Buñol (Valencian: Bunyol) is a town and municipality in the province of Valencia, Spain. The municipality has an area of some  112 km², and is situated approximately 38 km west of the provincial and autonomous community capital city, Valencia.  It lies along the Buñol River and is surrounded by the mountain ranges La Sierra de Las Cabrillas, la Sierra de Dos Aguas and la Sierra de Malacara y Martés.
The municipal local economic base is a mixture of the industrial and the agricultural (carob trees, almond trees, fruit trees, olive trees and grapes.)
Archaeological evidence indicates civilization in Buñol going back 50,000 years.[tpl]Fact|date=February 2007[/tpl] Buñol's population is about 9,000 people but is visited by over 30,000 for La Tomatina: a tomato throwing event in the Plaza del Pueblo.  On the last Wednesday of every August, thousands of people gather in the Plaza and throw metric tons of over ripe tomatoes at each other.
Buñol has regional rail passenger service to Valencia via the RENFE system.  
Every year upwards of 40,000 people gather in the town to throw over 115,000 kilograms of tomatoes at each other in the yearly Tomatina festival. The festival is a popular sight and tourists from across Europe flock to the town to join in the fun.youtube.co.yk, Throwing Tomatoes at La Tomatina Festival, Bunol, Spain

Hippeastrum [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɪ|p|iː|ˈ|æ|s|t|r|ə|m[/tpl] is a genus of about 90 species and over 600 hybrids and cultivars of perennial herbaceous bulbous plants. They generally have large fleshy bulbs and tall broad leaves, generally evergreen, and large red or purple flowers.
Hippeastrum is a genus in the family Amaryllidaceae (subfamily Amaryllidoideae, tribe Hippeastreae, and subtribe Hippeastrineae)  The name Hippeastrum, given to it by William Herbert, means "Knight's-star-lily", although precisely what Herbert meant by the name is not certain. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of this genus, often sold as indoor flowering bulbs particularly at Christmas in the northern hemisphere. By contrast the generic name Amaryllis applies to bulbs from South Africa, usually grown outdoors. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas from Argentina north to Mexico and the Caribbean.
Reproduction is generally by allogamy (cross-pollination) and Hippeastrum may be propagated by seed or offset bulbils (bulblets), although commercial ventures use in vitro techniques, or splitting of the bulb into sections. The genus has been intensely bred and cultivated since the early nineteenth century to produce large colourful showy flowers. In temperate climes these can be placed outside in the summer, and after a dormancy period, be induced to rebloom inside in the winter.

[[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]]

CATEGORIES: Dams, Energy storage, Pumped storage power stations, Water conservation

Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH) is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by some power plants for load balancing.  The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost off-peak electric power is used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power. Although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall, the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand, when electricity prices are highest.
Pumped storage is the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available, and, as of March 2012, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) reports that PSH accounts for more than 99% of bulk storage capacity worldwide, representing around 127,000 MW.

[[Blind experiment]]

CATEGORIES: Design of experiments, Pharmacology, Clinical research, Scientific method

A blind or blinded experiment is an experiment in which information about the test that might lead to bias in the results is concealed from the tester, the subject, or both until after the test.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. Bias may be intentional or unconscious. If both tester and subject are blinded, the trial is a double-blind trial.
Blind testing is used wherever items are to be compared without influences from testers' preferences or expectations, for example in clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of medicinal drugs and procedures without placebo or nocebo effect, observer bias, or conscious deception; and comparative testing of commercial products to objectively assess user preferences without being influenced by branding and other properties not being tested.
Blinding can be imposed on researchers, technicians, subjects, and funders. The opposite of a blind trial is an open trial. Blind experiments are an important tool of the scientific method, in many fields of research—medicine, psychology and the social sciences, natural sciences such as physics and biology, applied sciences such as market research, and many others.  In some disciplines, such as medicinal drug testing, blind experiments are considered essential.
In some cases, while blind experiments would be useful, they are impractical or unethical; an example is in the field of developmental psychology: although it would be informative to raise children under arbitrary experimental conditions, such as on a remote island with a fabricated enculturation, it is obviously a violation of ethics and human rights.
The terms blind (adjective) or to blind (transitive verb) when used in this sense are figurative extensions of the literal idea of blindfolding someone.  The terms masked or to mask may be used for the same concept; this is commonly the case in ophthalmology, where the word 'blind' is often used in the literal sense.

[[Stored procedure]]
CATEGORIES: Database management systems, Subroutines

A stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications that access a relational database system. A stored procedure (sometimes called a proc, sproc, StoPro, StoredProc, sp or SP) is actually stored in the database data dictionary.
Typical use for stored procedures include data validation (integrated into the database) or access control mechanisms.  Furthermore, stored procedures can consolidate and centralize logic that was originally implemented in applications.  Extensive or complex processing that requires execution of several SQL statements is moved into stored procedures, and all applications call the procedures. One can use nested stored procedures by executing one stored procedure from within another.
Stored procedures are similar to user-defined functions (UDFs). The major difference is that UDFs can be used like any other expression within SQL statements, whereas stored procedures must be invoked using the CALL statement.Call Procedure
 CALL procedure(...)
or
 EXECUTE procedure(...)
Stored procedures may return result sets, i.e. the results of a SELECT statement.  Such result sets can be processed using cursors, by other stored procedures, by associating a result set locator, or by applications. Stored procedures may also contain declared variables for processing data and cursors that allow it to loop through multiple rows in a table. Stored procedure flow control statements typically include IF, WHILE, LOOP, REPEAT, and CASE statements, and more. Stored procedures can receive variables, return results or modify variables and return them, depending on how and where the variable is declared.

School prayer in its common usage refers to  state-sanctioned and/or mandatory prayer by students in public schools. Depending on the country and the type of school, state-sponsored prayer may be required, permitted, or prohibited. Countries which prohibit school prayer often differ in their reasons for doing so: In the United States, school prayer is proscribed in accordance with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (which provides the foundation for the separation of church and state). In Canada, school prayer is disallowed under the concept of Freedom of conscience as outlined in the Canadian Charter on Rights & Fundamental Freedoms. Simultaneously, school prayer is disallowed in France as a byproduct of its status as a laïcist (religiously neutral) nation. Countries that allow school and/or state-sponsored prayer include Greece, Iran, Australia, Italy and the United Kingdom.

Grey Owl (or Wa-sha-quon-asin, from the Ojibwe wenjiganoozhiinh, meaning "great horned owl" or "great grey owl") was the name Archibald Belaney (September 18, 1888 – April 13, 1938) adopted when he took on a First Nations identity as an adult. Born in England as Archibald Stansfeld Belaney, and migrating to Canada in the first decade of the 20th century, he rose to prominence as a notable author, lecturer, and one of the "most effective apostles of the wilderness".John Sugden, review of Donald B. Smith, From the Land of Shadows: The Making of Grey Owl, American Indian Quarterly, Summer 1991, accessed 4 Feb 2010 In his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians, Belaney learned the Aboriginal harvesting techniques, trapping, and Ojibwe culture. The pivotal moment of departure for Grey Owl's early conservation work was when he began his relationship with a young Iroquois girl named Gertrude Bernard, who assisted in his transition from trapper to conservationist.Grey Owl, Pilgrims of the Wild, (Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2010), 15.
In working with the National Parks Branch, Grey Owl gained recognition and fame in his early career as a conservationist, becoming the subject of many films, and being established as the “‘caretaker of park animals’ at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba” in 1931.Donald B. Smith, From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl, (Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990), 92 Together with his numerous articles, books, films and lectures, his views on conservation reached audiences beyond the borders of Canada, challenging people to re-evaluate their relationship with nature. His conservation views largely focused on humans' negative impact on nature through their commodification of nature's resources for profits, and a need for humans to develop a respect for the natural world.Tina Loo, States of Nature: Conserving Canada's Wildlife in the Twentieth Century, (Vancouver: UBC Press ,2006), 113.
Revelation of his British origins after his death adversely affected Grey Owl's reputation for some time. Since the 1970s and, with the centennial of his birth, there has been renewed public appreciation for his conservation efforts. Recognition has included biographies, a historic plaque at his birthplace, and a 1999 biopic about his life by the director Richard Attenborough.

[[George Dupre]]

George Dupre is a Canadian man who falsely claimed to have been an Special Operations Executive operative during World War II.
In 1953 Quentin Reynolds, an ex-war correspondent, had written a book The Man Who Wouldn't Talk about George Dupre's alleged wartime experiences. Dupre claimed that he had been working for Special Operations Executive and the French Resistance during World War II. He had masqueraded as a village idiot and had been captured and tortured by the Gestapo. He had been telling his story in Canadian service clubs and Boy Scout meetings for years. Any loopholes in his story he (and his listeners) attributed to wartime trauma and still existing security restrictions.
Random House published the book and it appeared in November 1953. There was also a Reader's Digest condensation. Dupre himself said he wanted no money, that only the message to trust in God was important. He gave the money to Scouts Canada. The book was a sensation.
The hoax began to unravel when a retired Royal Canadian Air Force officer appeared at the offices of the Calgary Herald. He had served with Dupre in Winnipeg in 1943, when Dupre claimed he was working undercover in France. Three other officers admitted that they had sailed with him to Britain at the same time.
Calgary Herald reporter Douglas Collins, himself a former intelligence man, tricked Dupre by dropping fictitious names Dupre claimed to recognize. Eventually Dupre confessed. Reynolds was rather disappointed and Reader's Digest published a three-page retraction.  Unfazed, Random House representative Bennett Cerf recommended that stores move the book to the fiction section.  The book continued to sell well.

[[Harry Domela]]
CATEGORIES: 1905 births, Year of death missing, Impostor pretenders

Harry Domela (1905 - after 1978) was a Latvian-born impostor who pretended to be a deposed German crown prince.
Harry Domela was born to German parents in 1905 in Kurland, Latvia (at the time part of the Russian Empire). At the age of fifteen he fought in the first Freikorps against Baltic rebels. He moved to Germany after the World War I. His brothers and his father had died in the war.
Domela was too young to join the army corp after the war and thus held numerous menial jobs. At this same time he was imprisoned several times for his experimenting with impostures of various titles including Baron Korff.
His big break came when he went to Heidelberg and impressed himself on the members of German nobility who had been stripped of their official titles by the Weimar Republic. He presented himself as "Prince Lieven of Latvia" but managed to create an impression that this was only part of the truth. Aristocrats noticed his resemblance to Prince Wilhelm of Hohenzollern, grandson of deposed Kaiser. In no time, upper class circles were rife with rumors that he was in fact the heir of the German throne who was traveling incognito.
As a result when he traveled in Thuringia and Prussia local pro-monarchy dignitaries and businessmen entertained him at their own expense. He never asked for or received money from them. Soon however he began to attract the attention of the press and thus suspected that his imposture would soon be over. Eventually he decided to leave for France to try to join the French Foreign Legion. He was arrested when he was boarding the train.
For the next seven months he was in prison in Cologne, waiting for his trial. He used this time to write the narrative of his experiences, A Sham Prince: The Life and Adventures of Harry Domela as Written by Himself in Prison at Cologne, January to June 1927. In the trial, the court ruled that his imposture had been harmless and he was acquitted of the charges. 
Domela's book sold well, and soon he had sold the movie rights to it. There were two plays about his life; in one he played himself (he sued the actor who played him in the other one, but lost the lawsuit). In 1927 he starred in a film The False Prince based on his own experiences. However, by 1930 he had disappeared from the public life. 
Domela left Germany for the Netherlands in 1933 and lived with false papers as "Victor Zsajka". He befriended Dutch author Jef Last who acquainted him with André Gide. Domela served with Last in Spanish Republican forces during the Spanish Civil War. Afterwards he stayed in Belgium until he moved to France where he was interned by Vichy France regime. Gide helped him to leave for Mexico.
Domela later resurfaced as a teacher in Venezuela and contacted Jef Last in 1965. The last sign of him was in 1978.

After his second escape in 1942, some of the Vichy ministers tried to send him back to Germany and probable execution. But Eisenhower secretly asked him to take command of French troops in North Africa during Operation Torch and direct them to join the Allies. Only after François Darlan's assassination was he able to attain this post, and he took part in the Casablanca Conference with De Gaulle, Churchill and Roosevelt. He decided to take retirement in 1944 after continual disagreements with De Gaulle.

Barry Jay Minkow (born March 17, 1967) is a former businessman, pastor and convicted felon.  While still in high school, he founded ZZZZ Best (pronounced Zee Best), which appeared to be an immensely successful carpet-cleaning and restoration company.  However, it was actually a front to attract investment for a massive Ponzi scheme.  It collapsed in 1987, costing investors and lenders $100 million—one of the largest investment frauds ever perpetrated by a single person, as well as one of the largest accounting frauds in history.  The scheme is often used as a case study of accounting fraud.
After being released from jail, Minkow became a preacher and a fraud investigator, and spoke at schools about ethics. This all came to an end in 2011, when he admitted to helping deliberately drive down the stock price of homebuilder Lennar and was ordered back to prison.

The Adventures of Robin Hood is a British television series comprising 143 half-hour, black and white episodes broadcast weekly between 1955 and 1959Series at the BFI retrieved 28 February 2011. on ITV. It stars Richard Greene as the outlaw Robin Hood and Alan Wheatley as his nemesis, the Sheriff of Nottingham. The show followed the legendary character Robin Hood and his band of merry men in Sherwood Forest and the surrounding vicinity. While some episodes dramatised the traditional Robin Hood tales, most episodes were original dramas created by the show's writers and producers.
The programme was produced by Sapphire Films Ltd for ITC Entertainment, was filmed at Nettlefold Studios with some location work, and was the first of many pre-filmed shows commissioned by Lew Grade. In 1954, Grade was approached by American producer Hannah Weinstein to finance a series of 39 half hour episodes, at a budget of £10,000 an episode, of a series she wished to make called 'The Adventures of Robin Hood', for which she had already signed Richard Greene to the project as Robin Hood and been given the backing of US distribution company, Official Films Inc, who were confident of selling it to the US market.

The Méduse was a 40-gun Pallas-class frigate of the French Navy, launched in 1810. She took part in the Napoleonic wars, namely in the late stages of the Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811 and in raids in the Caribbean.
After the Bourbon Restoration, she was armed en flûte to ferry French officials to Saint-Louis, in Senegal, for the handover of the colony. Through inept navigation of her captain, an émigré given command for political reasons but incompetent as a naval officer, Méduse struck the Bank of Arguin and became a total loss. In the immediate aftermath of the wreckage, passengers and crew attempted to evacuate the ship on an improvised raft and became helpless when the frigate's launches gave up towing them. Only a handful of the shipwrecked survived the ordeal.
The scenes on the raft instilled considerable public emotion, making Méduse one of the most infamous shipwrecks of the Age of Sail. It was definitively immortalised when Théodore Géricault painted his Raft of the Medusa, which became an icon of French Romanticism.

[[Spirit duplicator]]
CATEGORIES: Printing devices

A spirit duplicator (also referred to as a Ditto machine  in North America, Banda machine in the UK or Roneo in France and Australia) was a printing method invented in 1923 by Wilhelm Ritzerfeld and commonly used for much of the rest of the 20th century. The term "spirit duplicator" refers to the alcohols which were a major component of the solvents used as "inks" in these machines. The device coexisted alongside the mimeograph.
Spirit duplicators were used mainly by schools, churches, clubs, and other small organizations, such as in the production of fanzines, because of the limited number of copies one could make from an original, along with the low cost and correspondingly low quality of copying.

[[Wind power]]

CATEGORIES: Wind power, Renewable energy

Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as using wind turbines to make electrical power, windmills for mechanical power, windpumps for water pumping or drainage, or sails to propel ships.
Large wind farms consist of hundreds of individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network. For new constructions, onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electricity, competitive with or in many places cheaper than fossil fuel plants.Robert Gasch, Jochen Twele (ed.): Windkraftanlagen. Grundlagen, Entwurf, Planung und Betrieb. Springer, Wiesbaden 2013, p 569 (German).  Small onshore wind farms provide electricity to isolated locations. Utility companies increasingly buy surplus electricity produced by small domestic wind turbines.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gipe|first=Paul|title=The Wind Industry's Experience with Aesthetic Criticism|journal=Leonardo|jstor=1575818|volume= 26|issue=3 |year=1993|pages=243–248|doi=10.2307/1575818[/tpl] Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher.
Wind power, as an alternative to fossil fuels, is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation and uses little land.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.rser.2008.09.017[/tpl] The effects on the environment are generally less problematic than those from other power sources. As of 2011, Denmark is generating more than a quarter of its electricity from wind and 83 countries around the world are using wind power to supply the electricity grid.  In 2010 wind energy production was over 2.5% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing rapidly at more than 25% per annum.
Wind power is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales. As the proportion of windpower in a region increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur. Power management techniques such as having excess capacity storage, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable backing sources, storage such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity, exporting and importing power to neighboring areas or reducing demand when wind production is low, can greatly mitigate these problems. In addition, weather forecasting permits the electricity network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur.Platt, Reg (21 January 2013) Wind power delivers too much to ignore, New Scientist.Platt, Reg; Fitch-Roy, Oscar and Gardner, Paul (August 2012) Beyond the Bluster why Wind Power is an Effective Technology.

The book may be called the "green dragon book" to distinguish it from its successor, Aho, Sethi & Ullman's Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, which is the "red dragon book".  The second edition of Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools added a fourth author, Monica S. Lam, and the dragon became purple; hence becoming the "purple dragon book." The book also contains the entire code for making a compiler.
The back cover offers a different viewpoint on the problem - the dragon is replaced by windmills, and the knight is Don Quixote.
The book was published by Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-00022-9. The acknowledgments mention that the book was entirely typeset at Bell Labs using troff on the Unix operating system, which at that time had been little seen outside the Labs.

The bicycle business of the Wright brothers, the Wright Cycle Company (originally the Wright Cycle Exchange) successively occupied five different locations in Dayton, Ohio. Orville and Wilbur Wright began their bicycle repair, rental and sales business in 1892, while continuing to operate a print shop (they ended their local newspaper business in 1890).[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11373/ |title = Wilbur Wright Working in the Bicycle Shop |website = World Digital Library |date = 1897 |accessdate = 2013-07-22 [/tpl] In 1896 they began manufacturing and selling bicycles of their own design, the Van Cleve and St. Claire, named after their ancestors.  They invented the self-oiling hub and the innovation of machining the crankarm and pedal on the left side of the bike with left-hand threads to prevent the pedal from coming unscrewed while cycling. The brick building at 22 South Williams St., where the Wrights worked from 1895 to 1897, is the only extant building on its original foundation and in its original location that housed a Wright bicycle shop. They ran their printing shop on the second-floor. The 22 South Williams Street building is part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park and the National Aviation Heritage Area.[tpl]cite web|title=Home of the Wright Brothers|url=http://www.aviationheritagearea.org/|publisher=National Aviation Heritage Area|accessdate=16 March 2012[/tpl]
The Wrights used the profits from the Wright Cycle Company to finance their aviation experiments.  In 1901 they fitted a third bicycle wheel horizontally above the front wheel of one of their St. Claire bicycles and used the apparatus as a test platform to study airfoil design. They built a six-foot wind tunnel on the second floor of their bicycle shop at 1127 West Third St., the last location of their bicycle business, and from October to December they conducted pioneering tests in the tunnel of over 200 shapes of scale-model wings. 
In that same building they designed and constructed their gliders and first airplane, the Wright Flyer, which cost under $1,000 to build. The shop closed in 1909 and they started their aviation company. In 1937, with Orville's cooperation, the building at 1127 West Third St. was moved to Greenfield Village, Dearborn, Michigan by Henry Ford.

Kate Jackson (born October 29, 1948) is an American actress, director, and producer, best known for her role as Sabrina Duncan in the popular 1970s television series Charlie's Angels. She is a three-time Emmy Award nominee and four-time Golden Globe Award nominee.  
Jackson began her career in the late 1960s in summer stock before landing her first major TV roles in Dark Shadows (1970-1971) and The Rookies (1972-1976). She also appeared in the film Night of Dark Shadows in 1971.
On March 21, 1976, Jackson first played Sabrina Duncan in Charlie's Angels, alongside Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith. The show aired as a movie of the week before debuting as a series on September 22, 1976. The huge success of the show saw the three actresses appear on the front cover of Time magazine. Jackson received two Emmy nominations for her role, before leaving in 1979 after three seasons.
Jackson then starred for four years in the TV series Scarecrow and Mrs. King (1983-1987). For this role, she won three Bravo Golden Otto awards in Germany for Best Female TV star from 1986-1988.

Plastic Man (real name Patrick "Eel" O'Brian) is a fictional comic-book superhero originally published by Quality Comics and later acquired by DC Comics. Created by writer-artist Jack Cole, he first appeared in Police Comics #1 (August 1941).
One of Quality Comics' signature characters during the Golden Age of Comic Books, Plastic Man can stretch his body into any imaginable form. His adventures were known for their quirky, offbeat structure and surreal slapstick humor. When Quality Comics was shut down in 1956, DC Comics acquired many of its characters, integrating Plastic Man into the mainstream DC Universe. The character has starred in several short-lived DC series, as well as a Saturday morning cartoon series in the early 1980s, and as a recurring character on Batman: The Brave and the Bold.
Although the character's revival has never been a commercial hit, Plastic Man has been a favorite character of many modern comic book creators, including writer Grant Morrison, who included him in his 1990s revival of the Justice League; Art Spiegelman, who profiled Cole for The New Yorker magazine; painter Alex Ross, who has frequently included him in covers and stories depicting the Justice League; writer-artist Kyle Baker, who wrote and illustrated an award winning Plastic Man series; artist Ethan Van Sciver has an affinity for the character as he always toys with the idea of launching a regular monthly Plastic Man series and often draws him for fun, and Frank Miller, who included him in the Justice League in the comics All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder and Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again.

[[Pier]]

CATEGORIES: Piers, Coastal construction, Marine architecture

A pier is a raised structure, including bridge and building supports and walkways, typically supported by widely spread piles or pillars. The lighter structure of a pier allows tides and currents to flow almost unhindered, whereas the more solid foundations of a quay or the closely spaced piles of a wharf can act as a breakwater, and are consequently more liable to silting. Piers can range in size and complexity from a simple lightweight wooden structure to major structures extended over 1600 metres. In American English, pier may be synonymous with dock.
Piers have been built for several purposes, and because these different purposes have distinct regional variances, the term pier tends to have different nuances of meaning in different parts of the world. Thus in North America and Australia, where many ports were, until recently, built on the multiple pier model, the term tends to imply a current or former cargo-handling facility. In Europe in contrast, where ports more often use basins and river-side quays than piers, the term is principally associated with the image of a Victorian cast iron pleasure pier. However, the earliest piers pre-date the Victorian age.

[[Margin of error]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical deviation and dispersion, Error, Measurement, Sampling (statistics)

The margin of error is a statistic expressing the amount of random sampling error in a survey's results.  The larger the margin of error, the less confidence one should have that the poll's reported results are close to the "true" figures; that is, the figures for the whole population.  Margin of error occurs whenever a population is incompletely sampled.
Margin of error is often used in non-survey contexts to indicate observational error in reporting measured quantities.  In astronomy, for example, the convention is to report the margin of error as, for example, 4.2421(16) light-years (the distance to Proxima Centauri), with the number in parentheses indicating the expected range of values in the matching digits preceding; in this case, 4.2421(16) is equivalent to 4.2421 ± 0.0016.[tpl]cite web | url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/Errors | title=Errors | publisher=Swinburne University of Technology | work=COSMOS - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy | accessdate=30 December 2013[/tpl]  The latter notation, with the "±", is more commonly seen in most other science and engineering fields.

Kāne[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohe Bay, at 45 km², is the largest sheltered body of water in the main Hawaiian Islands. This reef-dominated embayment constitutes a significant scenic and recreational feature along the windward (northeast) coast of the Island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu. The largest population center on Kāne[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohe Bay is the town of Kāne[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohe.
The Bay is approximately 8 mi (12.8 km) long and 2.7 mi (4.3 km) broad, with a mouth opening of about 4.6 mi (7.4 km) and maximum depth of 40 ft (12 m) in the dredged channel. Features unique in the main Hawaiian Islands include one of only two barrier reefs (the other being the 27 mile barrier reef of Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i island) and extensive development of shoaling coral reefs within a large lagoon. Two navigable channels cut across the northern and southern ends of the barrier reef.  The deeper, northern channel, located off Kualoa Regional Park, provides entrance from the North Pacific Ocean to a ship channel dredged the length of the lagoon between 1939 and 1945. The lagoon contains extensive patch and fringing reefs and its southern end is partly enclosed by the Mokapu Peninsula. This peninsula is occupied by Marine Corps Base Hawaii. 
The bay is located at coordinates [tpl]coord |21|27|35|N| 157|48|15|W| type:waterbody_region:US-HI |display=inline, title[/tpl].[tpl]gnis|360392|Kāne‘ohe Bay[/tpl]
There are fived named islands or islets within Kāne[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohe Bay. A sand bar (Ahu o Laka), Kapapa, and Kekepa (Turtleback Rock) are all exposed features (islets) on the barrier reef. Two islands within Kāne[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohe Bay are prominent: Mokoli[tpl]okina[/tpl]i (Chinaman's Hat) and Moku o Lo[tpl]okina[/tpl]e (Coconut Island), the largest of the five.  Mokoli[tpl]okina[/tpl]i is a volcanic remnant at the very north end of the Bay, site of former Kualoa Airfield. The community on the northern side is called Waikane, or North Ko[tpl]okina[/tpl]olaupoko.

An era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in China,Graham, A.C., Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China (Open Court 1993). ISBN 0-8126-9087-7 it was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, but it was also known as the Golden Age of Chinese philosophy because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely. This phenomenon has been called the Contention of a Hundred Schools of Thought (百家爭鳴/百家争鸣; bǎijiā zhēngmíng; pai-chia cheng-ming; "hundred schools contend"). The thoughts and ideas discussed refined during this period have profoundly influenced lifestyles and social consciousness up to the present day in East Asian countries and the East Asian diaspora around the world. The intellectual society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government, war, and diplomacy. 
This period ended with the rise of the imperial Qin Dynasty and the subsequent purge of dissent.

[[Commerce Clause]]
CATEGORIES: Legal history of the United States, Legislative branch of the United States government, Clauses of the United States Constitution

The Commerce Clause describes an enumerated power listed in the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3).  The clause states that the United States Congress shall have power "To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." Courts and commentators have tended to discuss each of these three areas of commerce as a separate power granted to Congress.Miller and Cross. "The Legal Environment Today" Fifth Edition. (2007)  It is common to see the individual components of the Commerce Clause referred to under specific terms: The Foreign Commerce Clause, the Interstate Commerce Clause,United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995) and the Indian Commerce Clause.
Dispute exists within the courts as to the range of powers granted to Congress by the Commerce Clause. As noted below, the clause is often paired with the Necessary and Proper Clause, the combination used to take a broad, expansive perspective of these powers. However, the effect of the Commerce Clause has varied significantly depending on the Supreme Court's interpretation. During the Marshall Court era, Commerce Clause interpretation empowered Congress to gain jurisdiction over numerous aspects of intrastate and interstate commerce as well as non-commerce. During the post-1937 era, the use of the Commerce Clause by Congress to authorize federal control of economic matters became effectively unlimited. Since the latter half of the Rehnquist Court era, Congressional use of the Commerce Clause has become slightly restricted again, being limited only to matters of trade (whether interstate or not) and production (whether commercial or not).

[[Two-body problem]]

CATEGORIES: Concepts in physics, Orbits, Classical mechanics

In classical mechanics, the two-body problem is to determine the motion of two point particles that interact only with each other.  Common examples include a satellite orbiting a planet, a planet orbiting a star, two stars orbiting each other (a binary star), and a classical electron orbiting an atomic nucleus (although to solve the electron/nucleus 2-body system correctly a quantum mechanical approach must be used).
The two-body problem can be re-formulated as two one-body problems, a trivial one and one that involves solving for the motion of one particle in an external potential.  Since many one-body problems can be solved exactly, the corresponding two-body problem can also be solved.  By contrast, the three-body problem (and, more generally, the n-body problem for n ≥ 3) cannot be solved in terms of first integrals, except in special cases.

A collective trademark, collective trade mark, or collective mark is a trademark owned by an organization (such as an association), used by its members them to identify themselves with a level of quality or accuracy, geographical origin, or other characteristics set by the organization. 
Collective trademarks are exceptions to the underlying principle of trademarks in that most trademarks serve as "badges of origin"; they indicate the individual source of the goods or services. A collective trademark, however, can be used by a variety of traders, rather than just one individual concern, provided that the trader belongs to the association.
Collective trademarks differ from certification marks. The main difference is that collective trademarks may be used by particular members of the organization which owns them, while certification marks may be used by anybody who complies with the standards defined by the owner of the particular certification mark.

Lothar Fischer (November 8, 1933 – June 15, 2004) was a German sculptor.
He was born in Germersheim, Palatinate. Between 1952 and 1958 he studied under Professor Heinrich Kirchner at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Munich. http://www.lothar-fischer.com In 1958, he received a three-month scholarship to the Villa Massimo in Rome from the Arnold’sche Stiftung (Arnold’sche Foundation).http://www.museum-lothar-fischer.de/life-and-work.html
After this he joined the painters Heimrad Prem, Helmut Sturm and Hans-Peter Zimmer in founding the group SPUR, which in 1959 entered the Situationist International. That year he participated in the Junge Kunst (Young Art) exhibition in Ulm. 
By 1962 the SPUR group had been expelled from the Situationist International. He participated in their exhibition at the Galerie van de Loo. The next year he was involved in Visione e Colore (Visions and Colours) in the Palazzo Grassi, Venice before joining other SPUR colleagues in the Nouveaux Espaces exhibition in Paris.

[[Yig]]
CATEGORIES: Cthulhu Mythos deities, Fictional characters introduced in 1929

Yig (the Father of Serpents) is a deity in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. He appears as a serpent man, serpent with bat-like wings, or as a giant snake.
Yig first appeared in the story "The Curse of Yig", which was created by Zealia Bishop and almost completely rewritten by Lovecraft. Although Yig is easy to anger, he is easy to please as well. Yig often sends his serpent minions, the children of Yig, to destroy or transform his enemies.
To Native Americans in Lovecraft's story, Yig is regarded as "bad medicine". He is also alluded to in western American folklore. He is identified with the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl, and may be a prototype for that god and other serpentine gods worldwide. Some authors identify him as the Stygian serpent god Set from Robert E. Howard's Conan stories, and also with the Great Serpent worshiped by the Serpent Men of Valusia from Howard's Kull stories.
Yig is the subject of a song by the shock rock band GWAR entitled "Horror of Yig", which appears on their album Scumdogs of the Universe. Yig also appears in an often-used version of GWAR's logo, as well as appearing on-stage as a monster the band battles. The band The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets, famous for their Lovecraft references, also refers to Yig in a song titled "Yig Snake Daddy". The death metal band Nile also references the deity, as well as Father Set in their song "SSS Haa Set Yoth," drawing references between the two as serpent gods, postulating a mythological Lovecraftian interpretation of the Reptilian conspiracy proposed by David Icke, namely that the Reptilians are in fact the children of Yig and Set.
Yig is also the name of a deity in the Arcanis Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting. Yig was once (and may still) be worshipped by the Ssethregorean Empire, a group dominated by various lizard and snake-like beings. Yig in this mythos is a female deity, but still strongly associated with serpents, suggesting the name is not a coincidence.
Despite being spoken of on only a few occasions in Lovecraft's work, Yig is one of the Ancient Ones included in the Arkham Horror board game, appearing alongside Great Old Ones such as Cthulhu and Nyarlathotep.
Yig appears as a deity in Green Ronin's role-playing game Mutants & Masterminds, alongside references to The King in Yellow, as described in the Book of Magic sourcebook. the book gives three spells that can be invoked in his name, one of which is called The Curse of Yig (mimicking the title of Bishop/Lovecraft's novel), which conjures snakes depending on the character's magic rank. The magic item, The Serpent Scepter, may also be linked to Yig, but the sourcebook doesn't explicitly describe this.

[[Economic geology]]
CATEGORIES: Geology, Economic geology

Economic geology is concerned with earth materials that can be used for economic and/or industrial purposes. These materials include precious and base metals, nonmetallic minerals, construction-grade stone, petroleum minerals, coal, and water. The term commonly refers to metallic mineral deposits and mineral resources. The techniques employed by other earth science disciplines (such as geochemistry, mineralogy, geophysics, petrology and structural geology) might all be used to understand, describe, and exploit an ore deposit.
Economic geology is studied and practiced by geologists. However it is of prime interest to investment bankers, stock analysts and other professions such as engineers, environmental scientists, and conservationists because of the far-reaching impact that extractive industries have on society, the economy, and the environment.

Hans-Peter Zimmer (23 October 1936 in Berlin - 5 September 1992 in Soltau) was a German painter and sculptor. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.
He formed Gruppe SPUR in 1957 with the painters Heimrad Prem, Helmut Sturm and the sculptor Lothar Fischer. After a joint exhibition at the Pavillon im Alten Botanischen Garten in Munich, they met the Danish artist and philosopher Asger Jorn, who linked them up with the Galerie Van de Loo which exhibited them. 
In 1959 the group joined the Situationist International. In 1961 they were banned from the Haus der Kunst (House of Art) by the Bavarian Minister of Culture. In 1962 they were indicted for pornography and blasphemy. They were expelled from the Situationist International that year. 
The group SPUR broke up in 1966. In the same year, Zimmer and Helmut Sturm founded Gruppe Geflecht, but Zimmer lost interest in the group activities soon and started a solo career. He completed studies in Hamburg and München. In 1982, he began work as a professor for painting at the HBK Braunschweig.

Robert ("Bob") Morton Newburgh Tisdall (16 May 1907 in Nuwara Eliya, Ceylon now Sri Lanka – 27 July 2004 in Nambour, Queensland, Australia) was an Irish athlete who won a gold medal in the 400 metre hurdles at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.http://www.achilles.org/ftp/tisdall.pdf
Tisdall was raised in Nenagh, County Tipperary. He had run only six 400 m hurdles when he won the gold medal at the 1932 Olympic Games in a world record time of 51.7 seconds, which was not recognised under the rules of time because he had a hit a hurdle. Later, because of the notoriety of this incident, the rules were changed and the President of the IOC, Juan Antonio Samaranch, presented Tisdall with a Waterford crystal rose bowl with the image of him knocking over the last hurdle etched into the glass.  Though the IAAF did not recognize the record at the time, they now recognize the mark, giving Tisdall credit for setting the milestone of being the first man under 52 seconds.http://www2.iaaf.org/TheSport/sport/400h/MenLandmarks.html

CATEGORIES: Royal anthems, Historical national anthems, National symbols of China, Qing dynasty, Chinese patriotic songs

Gong Jin'ou ([tpl]zh|t=鞏金甌|p=gǒng jīn'ōu[/tpl], lit. "Cup of Solid Gold") was the first official national anthem of China, created during the late Qing Dynasty; though it was used only for a short time due to the Republic of China overthrowing the Qing Dynasty.
The song was composed by Bo Tong ([tpl]lang|zh-t|溥侗[/tpl]), a high-ranking officer of the Imperial Guard. The lyrics, in Classical Chinese, were penned by Yan Fu, commander of the Qing Navy. Guo Cengxin ([tpl]lang|zh-t|郭曾炘[/tpl]), Master of Ceremonies, made some minor adjustments and arranged the music. Gong Jin'ou was adopted by the Qing government on the 13th Day and 8th Month of the 3rd Year of the Xuantong Emperor's reign (October 4, 1911).  However, only six days later was the Wuchang Uprising, which effectively led to the end of the Qing Dynasty with the declaration of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912 and the abdication of the emperor on February 12, 1912. As a result, the anthem never gained any notability. Since it praises the Qing dynasty specifically, it is also a Royal anthem.

Wei or Cao Wei (220–265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220–280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. Its name originated as such: In 213, Cao Cao's feudal holdings were given the name "Wei" by the Eastern Han government. Historians often add the prefix "Cao" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as "Wei", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty.

The old Mediterranean port of Kotor is surrounded by fortifications built during the Venetian period. It is located on the Bay of Kotor (Boka Kotorska), one of the most indented parts of the Adriatic Sea. Some have called the southern-most fjord in Europe, but it is a ria, a submerged river canyon. Together with the nearly overhanging limestone cliffs of Orjen and Lovćen, Kotor and its surrounding area form an impressive and picturesque Mediterranean landscape.
In recent years, Kotor has seen a steady increase in tourists, many of them coming by cruise ship. Visitors are attracted both by the natural beauty of the Gulf of Kotor and by the old town of Kotor.
Kotor is part of the World Heritage Site dubbed the Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor.

Chinese painting is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world.
Painting in the traditional style is known today in Chinese as guóhuà (国画), meaning 'national' or 'native painting', as opposed to Western styles of art which became popular in China in the 20th century. Traditional painting involves essentially the same techniques as calligraphy and is done with a brush dipped in black or colored ink; oils are not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings are made are paper and silk. The finished work can be mounted on scrolls, such as hanging scrolls or handscrolls. Traditional painting can also be done on album sheets, walls, lacquerware, folding screens, and other media.
The two main techniques in Chinese painting are:
Landscape painting was regarded as the highest form of Chinese painting, and generally still is.Rawson, 112  The time from the Five Dynasties period to the Northern Song period (907–1127) is known as the "Great age of Chinese landscape".  In the north, artists such as Jing Hao, Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, and Guo Xi painted pictures of towering mountains, using strong black lines, ink wash, and sharp, dotted brushstrokes to suggest rough stone.  In the south, Dong Yuan, Juran, and other artists painted the rolling hills and rivers of their native countryside in peaceful scenes done with softer, rubbed brushwork.  These two kinds of scenes and techniques became the classical styles of Chinese landscape painting.

[[Common Ringed Plover]]

CATEGORIES: Charadrius, Birds of Asia, Birds of Pakistan, Birds of Palestine, Birds of Europe, Birds of Turkey, British Isles coastal fauna, Birds of Western Sahara, Birds of Cameroon, Birds of Ukraine

The Common Ringed Plover or Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula) is a small plover.
Adults are 17-19.5 cm in length with a 35–41 cm wingspan. They have a grey-brown back and wings, a white belly, and a white breast with one black neckband. They have a brown cap, a white forehead, a black mask around the eyes and a short orange and black bill. The legs are orange and only the outer two toes are slightly webbed, unlike the slightly smaller but otherwise very similar Semipalmated Plover, which has all three toes slightly webbed, and also a marginally narrower breast band; it was in former times included in the present species. Juvenile Ringed Plovers are duller than the adults in colour, with an often incomplete grey-brown breast band, a dark bill and dull yellowish-grey legs.
This species differs from the smaller Little Ringed Plover in leg colour, the head pattern, and the lack of an obvious yellow eye-ring.
The Common Ringed Plover's breeding habitat is open ground on beaches or flats across northern Eurasia and in Arctic northeast Canada. Some birds breed inland, and in western Europe they nest as far south as northern France. They nest on the ground in an open area with little or no plant growth.
If a potential predator approaches the nest, the adult will walk away from the scrape, calling to attract the intruder and feigning a broken wing. Of course, once the intruder is far enough from the nest, the plover flies off.
Common Ringed Plovers are migratory and winter in coastal areas south to Africa. Many birds in Great Britain and northern France are resident throughout the year.
These birds forage for food on beaches, tidal flats and fields, usually by sight. They eat insects, crustaceans and worms.

The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers.
Bull sharks can thrive in both saltwater and freshwater and can travel far up rivers. They have even been known to travel as far up the Mississippi River as Illinois,Sharks In Illinois. In-Fisherman (16 July 2012). Retrieved on 30 November 2013. although there have been few recorded freshwater attacks.

[[Ploceidae]]

CATEGORIES: Ploceidae

The Ploceidae, or weavers, are small passerine birds related to the finches. 
These are seed-eating birds with rounded conical bills, most of which are from Sub-Saharan Africa, with fewer species in tropical Asia. A few species have been introduced outside their native range.[tpl]cite book|last=Craig|first=Adrian|year= 2010|chapter= Family Ploceidae (Weavers)|pages=74–197 |editors=del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; and Christie, D. A.|title= Handbook of the Birds of the World|volume=15|publisher= Lynx Edicions|location= Barcelona[/tpl] The weaver group is divided into the buffalo, sparrow, typical, and widow weavers. The males of many species are  brightly coloured, usually in red or yellow and black, some species show variation in colour only in the breeding season. 
Weaver birds, also known as weaver finches, get their name because of their elaborately woven nests (the most elaborate of any birds'), though some are notable for their selective parasitic nesting habits. The nests vary in size, shape, material used, and construction techniques from species to species. Materials used for building nests include fine leaf-fibers, grass, and twigs. Many species weave very fine nests using thin strands of leaf fiber, though some, like the buffalo-weavers, form massive untidy stick nests in their colonies, which may have spherical woven nests within. The sparrow weavers of Africa build apartment-house nests, in which 100 to 300 pairs have separate flask-shaped chambers entered by tubes at the bottom. Most species weave nests that have narrow entrances, facing downward. 
Many weaver species are gregarious and breed colonially. The birds build their nests together for protection, often several to a branch. Usually the male birds weave the nests and use them as a form of display to lure prospective females. The weaver bird colonies may be found close to water bodies. They sometimes cause crop damage, notably the Red-billed Quelea, reputed to be the world's most numerous bird.Fry, C.H. & Keith, S. (2004) The birds of Africa vol. VII.

[[Strength of materials]]

CATEGORIES: Solid mechanics, Materials science, Building engineering, Deformation

Mechanics of materials, also called strength of materials, is a subject which deals with the behavior of solid objects subject to stresses and strains. The complete theory began with the consideration of the behavior of one and two dimensional members of structures, whose states of stress can be approximated as two dimensional, and was then generalized to three dimensions to develop a more complete theory of the elastic and plastic behavior of materials. An important founding pioneer in mechanics of materials was Stephen Timoshenko.
The study of strength of materials often refers to various methods of calculating the stresses and strains in structural members, such as beams, columns, and shafts. The methods employed to predict the response of a structure under loading and its susceptibility to various failure modes takes into account the properties of the materials such as its yield strength, ultimate strength, Young's Modulus, and Poisson's ratio; in addition the mechanical element's macroscopic properties (geometric properties), such as it length, width, thickness, boundary constraints and abrupt changes in geometry such as holes are considered.

[[Sainte-Laguë method]]

The Sainte-Laguë method ([tpl]IPA-fr|sɛ̃t.la.ɡy[/tpl]) is a highest quotient method for allocating seats in party-list proportional representation used in many voting systems. It is named after the French mathematician André Sainte-Laguë. The Sainte-Laguë method is quite similar to the D'Hondt method, but uses different divisors. In most cases the largest remainder method delivers almost identical results. The D'Hondt method gives similar results too, but favors larger parties compared to the Sainte-Laguë method.[tpl]citation|contribution=Degrees of proportionality of proportional representation formulas|first=Arend|last=Lijphart|authorlink=Arend Lijphart|pages=170–179|title=Electoral Laws and Their Political Consequences|volume=1|series=Agathon series on representation|editor1-first=Bernard|editor1-last=Grofman|editor2-first=Arend|editor2-last=Lijphart|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2003|isbn=9780875862675[/tpl]. See in particular the section "Sainte-Lague", pp. 174–175.
The Sainte-Laguë method is used in Iraq, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Latvia, Kosovo, and Germany (on federal level for the Bundestag, on state level for the legislatures of Baden-Württemberg, Hamburg, Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein and Rhineland-Palatinate). It was also used in Bolivia in 1993, in Poland in 2001, and in the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006. A variant of this method, the modified Sainte-Laguë method, was used to allocate the proportional representation (PR) seats in the Constituent Assembly poll of Nepal in 2008. It has been proposed by the Green Party in Ireland as a reform for use in Dáil Éireann elections,Ireland's Green Party website; and by the United Kingdom Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2011 as the method for calculating the distribution of seats in elections to the country's upper house of parliament.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/house-of-lords-reform-draft-bill.pdf |format=PDF |date=May 2011 |title=House of Lords Reform Draft Bill |publisher=Cabinet Office |page=16[/tpl]

[[Aharonov–Bohm effect]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Physical phenomena, Mesoscopic physics

The Aharonov–Bohm effect, sometimes called the Ehrenberg–Siday–Aharonov–Bohm effect, is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which an electrically charged particle is affected by an electromagnetic field (E, B), despite being confined to a region in which both the magnetic field B and electric field E are zero. The underlying mechanism is the coupling of the electromagnetic potential with the complex phase of a charged particle's wavefunction, and the Aharonov–Bohm effect is accordingly illustrated by interference experiments.
The most commonly described case, sometimes called the Aharonov–Bohm solenoid effect, takes place when the wave function of a charged particle passing around a long solenoid experiences a phase shift as a result of the enclosed magnetic field, despite the magnetic field being negligible in the region through which the particle passes and the particle's wavefunction being negligible inside the solenoid. This phase shift has been observed experimentally.[tpl]cite journal |first=A. |last=Batelaan |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=A. |last2=Tonomura |title=The Aharonov–Bohm effects: Variations on a Subtle Theme |journal=Physics Today |date=Sep 2009|volume=62|issue=9|pages=38–43 |doi=10.1063/1.3226854[/tpl] There are also magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effects on bound energies and scattering cross sections, but these cases have not been experimentally tested. An electric Aharonov–Bohm phenomenon was also predicted, in which a charged particle is affected by regions with different electrical potentials but zero electric field, but this has no experimental confirmation yet. A separate "molecular" Aharonov–Bohm effect was proposed for nuclear motion in multiply connected regions, but this has been argued to be a different kind of geometric phase as it is "neither nonlocal nor topological", depending only on local quantities along the nuclear path.
Werner Ehrenberg and Raymond E. Siday first predicted the effect in 1949, and similar effects were later published by Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm in 1959. After publication of the 1959 paper, Bohm was informed of Ehrenberg and Siday's work, which was acknowledged and credited in Bohm and Aharonov's subsequent 1961 paper. 
Subsequently, the effect was confirmed experimentally by several authors; a general review can be found in Peshkin and Tonomura (1989).

Scary Movie is a 2000 horror comedy spoof film directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. It was intended to be released with the title Slasher 911.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] It is an American dark comedy that heavily parodies the horror, slasher, and mystery genres. Several mid- and late-90s films and TV shows are spoofed, especially Scream, along with I Know What You Did Last Summer, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix, The Blair Witch Project, and Dawson's Creek.
The tagline reads "No mercy. No shame. No sequel.", the last reference being an ironic nod towards the tendency of popular horror movies becoming cash cow franchises. 2001 saw the release of Scary Movie 2, with the appropriate tagline "We lied". Later video covers of the first film frequently drop the tagline's third statement. The film was originally titled "Last Summer I Screamed Because Halloween Fell on Friday the 13th".  Scary Movie was followed by four more sequels Scary Movie 2 (2001), Scary Movie 3 (2003), Scary Movie 4 (2006) and Scary Movie 5 (2013).http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=87145 Its title serves as a homage to the production title of Scream, which was also released through Dimension Films.

[[Graf]]

CATEGORIES: Austrian noble titles, Counts, German feudalism, German words and phrases, German noble titles

Graf (male) or Gräfin (female) is a historical title of the German nobility, usually translated as count. Considered intermediate among noble ranks, the title is often treated as equivalent to the British "earl" (whose female version and consort is a countess).
The comital title Graf is common to various European territories where German was or is the official or vernacular tongue, e.g., Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Alsace, the Baltic states and other Habsburg crown lands. Since August 1919, in Germany,  all legal privileges of the nobility have been officially abolished, and Graf, like any other hereditary title, is treated as part of the legal surname.Weimar Constitution Article 109, sentence 2 In Austria its use, as with all hereditary titles and nobiliary particles, is banned by law; whereas in Switzerland the title is not acknowledged in law; while in Luxembourg and Liechtenstein (as in Belgium) the title continues to be recognised, used and, occasionally, granted by the national fons honorum, the reigning monarch.
From the medieval era, a Graf usually ruled a territory known as a Grafschaft (county). In the Holy Roman Empire, many Imperial counts (Reichsgrafen) retained near-sovereign authority in their lands until the Congress of Vienna subordinated them to larger, neighboring monarchs through the German mediatisation process of 1815, preserving their precedence, allocating familial representation in  local  legislatures, some jurisdictional immunities and the prestigious privilege of Ebenbürtigkeit. In regions of Europe where nobles did not actually exercise Landeshoheit, or sovereignty over the populace, the Graf long retained specific feudal privileges over the land and in the villages in his county, such as rights to peasant service, to periodic fees for use of common infrastructure such as timber, mills, wells and pastures. These rights gradually eroded and were largely eliminated before or during the 19th century, leaving the Graf with few legal privileges beyond land ownership, although comital estates in German-speaking lands were often substantial.
Many Continental counts in Germany and Austria were titled Graf without any additional qualification. Except in the Kingdom of Prussia from the 19th century, the title of Graf was not restricted by primogeniture: it was inherited by all legitimate descendants in the male line of the original titleholder, the males also inheriting an approximately equal share of the family's wealth and estates. Usually a hyphenated suffix indicated which of the familial lands a particular line of counts held, e.g. Castell-Rudenhausen.
In the medieval Holy Roman Empire, some counts took or were granted unique variations of the gräfliche title, often relating to a specific domain or jurisdiction of responsibility, e.g. Landgraf, Markgraf, Pfalzgraf (Count Palatine), Burggraf, Wildgraf, Waldgraf, Altgraf, Raugraf, etc. Although as a title Graf ranked, officially, below those of Herzog (duke) and Furst (prince), the Holy Roman Emperor could and did recognise unique concessions of authority or rank to some of these nobles, raising them to the status of gefurstete Graf or "princely count". But a grafliche title with such a prefix did not always signify a higher than comital rank or membership in the Hochadel. Only the more important of these titles, historically associated with degrees of sovereignty, remained in use by the 19th century, i.e. Margraf and Landgraf. 
For a list of the titles of the rank of Count etymologically related to Graf (and for other equivalents) see article Count.

[[Electron diffraction]]

CATEGORIES: Diffraction, Electron, Quantum mechanics

Electron diffraction refers to the wave nature of electrons. However, from a technical or practical point of view, it may be regarded as a technique used to study matter by firing electrons at a sample and observing the resulting interference pattern. This phenomenon is commonly known as the wave–particle duality, which states that the behavior  of a particle of matter (in this case the incident electron) can be described by a wave. For this reason, an electron can be regarded as a wave much like sound or water waves. This technique is similar to X-ray and neutron diffraction.
Electron diffraction is most frequently used in solid state physics and chemistry to study the crystal structure of solids. Experiments are usually performed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), or a scanning electron microscope (SEM) as electron backscatter diffraction. In these instruments, electrons are accelerated by an electrostatic potential in order to gain the desired energy and determine their wavelength before they interact with the sample to be studied.
The periodic structure of a crystalline solid acts as a diffraction grating, scattering the electrons in a predictable manner. Working back from the observed diffraction pattern, it may be possible to deduce the structure of the crystal producing the diffraction pattern. However, the technique is limited by the phase problem.
Apart from the study of crystals i.e. electron crystallography, electron diffraction is also a useful technique to study the short range order of amorphous solids, and the geometry of gaseous molecules.

The electric power industry provides the production and delivery of electric energy, often known as power, or electricity, in sufficient quantities to areas that need electricity through a grid connection. The grid distributes electrical energy to customers. Electric power is generated by central power stations or by distributed generation.
Many households and businesses need access to electricity, especially in developed nations, the demand being scarcer in developing nations. Demand for electricity is derived from the requirement for electricity in order to operate domestic appliances, office equipment, industrial machinery and provide sufficient energy for both domestic and commercial lighting, heating, cooking and industrial processes. Because of this aspect of the industry, it is viewed as a public utility as infrastructure.

Vitiges or Witiges (died 540) was king of the Ostrogoths in Italy from 536 to 540.
He succeeded to the throne of Italy in the early stages of the Gothic War, as Belisarius had quickly captured Sicily the previous year and was currently in southern Italy at the head of the forces of Justinian I, the Eastern Roman Emperor.
Vitiges was the husband of Amalasuntha's only surviving child, Matasuntha, a marriage designed to bolster his claim to kingship. The panegyric upon the wedding in 536 was delivered by Cassiodorus, the praetorian prefect, and survives, a traditionally Roman form of rhetoric that set the Gothic dynasty in a flatteringly Roman light.
Soon after he was made king, Witiges had his predecessor Theodahad murdered. Theodahad had enraged the Goths because he failed to send any assistance to Naples when it was besieged by the Byzantines, led by Belisarius.
Justinian's general Belisarius took both Witiges and Matasuntha as captives to Constantinople, and Witiges died there, without any children. After his death, Matasuntha married the patrician Germanus Justinus, a nephew of Justinian I by his sister Vigilantia.

The Carnation Revolution ([tpl]lang-pt|Revolução dos Cravos[/tpl]), also referred to as the 25 April ([tpl]lang-pt|25 de Abril|links=no[/tpl]), was a military coup in Lisbon, Portugal on 25 April 1974 which overthrew the regime of the Estado Novo.[tpl]citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/25/newsid_4754000/4754581.stm | title = 1974: Rebels seize control of Portugal | publisher = BBC | work = On This Day, 25 April | date=25 April 1974 | accessdate=2 January 2010[/tpl] The revolution started as a military coup organized by the Movimento das Forças Armadas (Armed Forces Movement, MFA), composed of military officers who opposed the regime, but the movement was soon coupled with an unanticipated and popular campaign of civil resistance. This movement would lead to the fall of the Estado Novo and the withdrawal of Portugal from its African colonies.
The name "Carnation Revolution" comes from the fact that almost no shots were fired and when the population took to the streets to celebrate the end of the dictatorship and war in the colonies, carnation flowers were put into the muzzles of rifles and on the uniforms of the army. The Portuguese celebrate the national holiday of Freedom Day on 25 April every year to celebrate the revolution.

France thus broke both with the Act of Algeciras that had ended the First Moroccan Crisis, and the Franco-German Accord of 1909.For the latter, cf. E. W.

It is used by combat engineers to clear obstacles that would otherwise require them to approach directly, possibly under fire. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a Bangalore mine, bangers or simply Bangalore.

[tpl]Italic title[/tpl][tpl]unreferenced|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The Newgate Calendar, subtitled The Malefactors' Bloody Register, was a popular work of improving literature in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Originally a monthly bulletin of executions, produced by the Keeper of Newgate Prison in London, the Calendar's title was appropriated by other publishers, who put out biographical chapbooks about notorious criminals such as Sawney Bean, Dick Turpin, John Wilkes and Moll Cutpurse.
Collected editions of these stories began to appear in the mid-18th century, and in 1774 a five-volume bound edition became the standard version. While many of its accounts are highly embellished and/or drawn uncritically from other sources, they are lively and full of incident, and often refer to contemporary events and social issues.  Along with the Bible and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, the Calendar was famously in the top three works most likely to be found in the average home.
The entries editorialise strongly against their subjects, Catholicism, The Protectorate and Commonwealth, any political enemies of Britain (such as the French), drunkenness, prostitution ("Women of abandoned character"), gambling, "dissipation" in general and other "vices" generally while eulogising Protestantism, the Church of England, the English monarchy and legal system, the Common Law and Bloody Code, with some rare exceptions. One edition contained an introduction suggesting that swindling be made (another) capital offence.
A new edition was published in 1824 by Andrew Knapp and William Baldwin, two lawyers, and a further edition in  1826, under the title, The New Newgate Calendar.

[[President of Liberia]]

CATEGORIES: Liberia-related lists, Lists of presidents, Presidents of Liberia

The President of the Republic of Liberia is the head of state and government of Liberia. The president serves as the leader of the executive branch and as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia.
Prior to the independence of Liberia in 1847, executive power in the Commonwealth of Liberia was held by the Governor of Liberia, who was appointed by the American Colonization Society. The 1847 Constitution transferred the executive powers of the governorship to the presidency, which was largely modeled on the presidency of the United States.
Between 1847 and 1980, the presidency was exclusively held by Americo-Liberians, the original American settlers of Liberia and their descendants. The original two-party system, with the Republican Party and the True Whig Party, ended in 1878, when the election of Anthony W. Gardiner marked the beginning of 102 years of single-party rule by the True Whigs. Following a coup d'état by disgruntled army officers led by Samuel Doe in 1980, the presidency was vacated until the election of Doe in the 1985 general election. After the overthrow of Doe in 1990, the presidency was again vacated for seven years during the First Liberian Civil War and again for two years following the conclusion of the Second Liberian Civil War in 2003.
Under the 1986 Constitution, the president is directly elected by eligible voters to a six-year term, which may be renewed once. Overall, 22 individuals have served as president. On January 16, 2006, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was sworn in as the twenty-fourth and current president, making her the first elected female president in Africa.

[[Trace metal]]

CATEGORIES: Biology

Trace metals are metals in extremely small quantities that are present in animal and plant cells and tissue.  They are a necessary part of nutrition and physiology. Ingestion of, or exposure to, excess quantities is often toxic. However, insufficient plasma or tissue levels of certain trace metals can cause pathology as well; as is the case with iron. 
Trace metals include iron, magnesium, lithium, zinc, copper, chromium, nickel, cobalt, vanadium, arsenic, molybdenum, manganese, selenium and others.[tpl]cite book |title=Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York |url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=5229785 |edition=28th ed |author1=Bender DA |author2=Mayes PA |author3=Murray RK |author4=Botham KM |author5=Kennelly PJ |author6=Rodwell VW |author7=Weil PA |chapter=Chapter 44.

Trace metals are depleted through the expenditure of energy by various metabolic processes living organisms. They are replenished in animals through diet as well as environmental exposure, and in plants through the uptake of nutrients from the soil in which the plant grows.
Human vitamin pills and plant fertilizers both contain trace metals as additional sources for trace metals.  
Trace metals are sometimes referred to as trace elements, though the latter is a broader category. See also Dietary mineral.
Trace elements though required in smaller quantities are to be taken in diet as they are required by the body for specific functions but taking them in excess causes various problems. For example fluorine is required for the formation of bones and enamel on teeth.However, when taken in more quantities due to its excessive content in ground water by people in some areas causes a disease called "Fluorosis', in which bone deformations and yellowing of teeth are seen.
The harder you work to expend energy, the more trace metals you will lose. These metals need to be replaced so that your body can properly function. Things such as vitamins and sports drinks can help with this along with fresh fruits and vegetables. 
Some metals are naturally found in the body and are necessary for proper human health. Iron can help to prevent anemia, and zinc is a cofactor in over 100 enzyme reactions. All though trace metals are good for humans, in high doses they may be toxic to the body.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.becomehealthynow.com/article/hairchiro/123 |title=The Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis / The Trace Metals |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 October 2013[/tpl]
Copper is one of the most important trace metals. It has many uses in the body. Copper helps to oxidize glucose which gives the body more energy. Copper also carries oxygen through the blood, that is how you are able to get oxygen to your muscles. Copper also has a lot more important uses.

[[Tarantism]]

CATEGORIES: Toxicology, Mass hysteria, Ailments of unknown etiology, Spiders

Tarantism is a form of hysteric behaviour, popularly believed to result from the bite of a kind of wolf spider called a "tarantula" (Lycosa tarantula). (These spiders are different from the broad class of spiders called "Tarantulas".)
A better candidate (as the bite of Lycosa tarantula is not in fact capable of producing significant ill effects), is Latrodectus tredecimguttatus, commonly known as the Mediterranean black widow or steppe spider, although no link between such bites and the behaviour of tarantism has ever been demonstrated.Anon (1968), p. 175. However, the term historically is used to refer to a dancing mania characteristic of Southern Italy and which likely had little to do with spider bites.

Hysteria is the fourth studio album by English rock band Def Leppard, released on 3 August 1987 through Mercury Records and reissued on 1 January 2000. It is the band's best-selling album to date, selling over 20 million copies worldwide, including 12 million in the US, and spawning seven hit singles. The album charted at #1 on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4062|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Allmusic (Def Leppard charts and awards) Billboard albums |publisher= [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=398 |title=Def Leppard chart stats |publisher= |archiveurl=http://archive.is/DGLN|archivedate=2012-05-27[/tpl]
Hysteria was produced by Robert John "Mutt" Lange. The title of the album was thought up by drummer Rick Allen, referring to his 1984 auto accident and the ensuing worldwide media coverage surrounding it. It is also the last album to feature guitarist Steve Clark before his death, although songs co-written by him would appear in the band's next album, Adrenalize.
The album is the follow-up to the band's 1983 breakthrough Pyromania. Hysteria's creation took over three years and was plagued by delays, including the aftermath of the 31 December 1984 car accident that cost Allen his left arm. Subsequent to the album's release, Def Leppard published a book entitled Animal Instinct: The Def Leppard Story, written by Rolling Stone magazine Senior Editor David Fricke, on the three-year recording process of Hysteria and the tough times the band endured through the mid-1980s.
Hysteria has earned critical acclaim from a number of sources. In 1988 Q magazine readers voted it as the 98th Greatest Album of All Time, while in 2004, the album was ranked at #472 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Hysteria - Def Leppard Rolling Stone.

The Papillon (from the French word for butterfly, [tpl]IPA-fr|papiˈjɔ̃|pron[/tpl]), also called the Continental Toy Spaniel, is a breed of dog of the Spaniel type. One of the oldest of the toy spaniels, it derives its name from its characteristic butterfly-like look of the long and fringed hair on the ears. A Papillon with dropped ears is called a Phalène (French for moth). The small head is slightly rounded between the ears with a well defined stop. The muzzle is somewhat short, thin tapering to the nose. The dark, medium sized, round eyes have thin black rims, often extending at the junction of the eyelids towards the ears. The large ears can either be erect or dropped with rounded tips. The teeth meet in a scissors bite. The long tail is set high carried over the body, and covered with long, fine hair. Dewclaws are sometimes removed. The straight, long, fine, single coat has extra frill on the chest, ears, back of the legs and the tail. Coat color is white with patches of any color.

[[China–United States relations]]

CATEGORIES: China–United States relations, Bilateral relations of the United States, Bilateral relations of China

Chinese-U.S. relations (or Sino-American relations) refers to international relations between the United States of America (U.S.A.) and the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.)  Most analysts characterize present Chinese-American relations as being complex and multifaceted. The United States and China are usually neither allies nor enemies; the U.S. government does not regard China as an adversary but as a competitor in some areas and a partner in others.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The Qing Dynasty opened the first modern official diplomatic relations in late 19th century, After Xinhai revolution, newly formed Republic of China maintained diplomatic ties with the USA. During the Second World War, China was a close ally of the United States. At the founding of the communist-ruled People's Republic of China in 1949, the USA did not immediately recognize the newly established government of China. Until January 1979, the United States recognized the Republic of China on Taiwan as the legitimate government of China, and did not maintain diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on the mainland. In the midst of the Cold War, the Sino-Soviet split provided an opening for the US to establish ties with mainland China and use it as a counter to the Soviet Union and its influence. It was after January 1979 that the USA government switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing, as well as the diplomatic relations.
As of 2014, the United States has the world's largest economy and China the second largest. China has the world's largest population and the United States has the third largest after India. The two countries are the two largest consumers of motor vehicles and oil,[tpl]cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=1531 |title=talking points, june 24 - july 8, 2009 |publisher=China.usc.edu |accessdate=2010-12-02[/tpl] and the two greatest emitters of greenhouse gases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=1543 |title=talking points, July 15–29, 2009 |publisher=China.usc.edu |accessdate=2010-12-02[/tpl]
Relations between China and the United States have been generally stable with some periods of tension, most notably after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which removed a common enemy and ushered in a world characterized by American dominance. There are also concerns relating to human rights in the People's Republic of China and the political status of Taiwan. There are constant tides and strides in the Sino-U.S. relations, and diplomatic efforts were taken to maintain the positive direction in this international relationship, such as James R. Lilley around the 1990s.http://books.google.com.tw/books/about/China_Hands.html?id=OS9k16FyksYC&redir_esc=y
While there are some tensions in American-Chinese relations, there are also many stabilizing factors. The PRC and the United States are major trade partners and have common interests in the prevention and suppression of terrorism and nuclear proliferation. The U.S.-China trade relationship is the second largest in the world,Top Trading Partners - Total Trade, Exports, Imports, November 2012, U.S. Census website. behind the United States' trade relationship with Canada.
China is also the largest foreign creditor for the United States. China's challenges and difficulties are mainly internal, and there is a desire to maintain stable relations with the United States. The American-Chinese relationship has been described by top leaders and academics as the world's most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7891511.stm | work=BBC News | title=Clinton seeks stronger Asia ties | date=February 16, 2009 | accessdate=April 7, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=1021&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |title=US-China Institute :: news & features :: Ambassador Clark Randt on "The Crucial Relationship" |publisher=China.usc.edu |accessdate=2010-12-02[/tpl] As the countries become more and more intertwined, greater numbers of Chinese and Americans have experience visiting, studying, working, and living in the others' country. Still, the role played by the media in shaping views remains large.See the USC U.S.-China Institute's Assignment: China series, for example, how American journalists have reported from China since the 1940s.Documentary videos. In recent years, public opinion polling and other scholarship has sharpened our understanding of how images and attitudes in the two countries are formed and how those influence policies.USC U.S.-China Institute, "Through Tinted Lenses?

The Royal Opera House is an opera house and major performing arts venue in Covent Garden, central London. The large building is often referred to as simply "Covent Garden", after a previous use of the site of the opera house's original construction in 1732.  It is the home of The Royal Opera, The Royal Ballet, and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House. Originally called the Theatre Royal, it served primarily as a playhouse for the first hundred years of its history. In 1734, the first ballet was presented. A year later, Handel's first season of operas began. Many of his operas and oratorios were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premieres there.
The current building is the third theatre on the site following disastrous fires in 1808 and 1857. The façade, foyer, and auditorium date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive reconstruction in the 1990s. The Royal Opera House seats 2,256 people and consists of four tiers of boxes and balconies and the amphitheatre gallery. The proscenium is 12.20 m wide and 14.80 m high. The main auditorium is a Grade 1 listed building as noted by Theatres Trust."Royal Opera House (London)" description on theatrestrust.org.uk Retrieved 10 May 2013

Benjamin Schumacher is a U.S. theoretical physicist, working mostly in the field of quantum information theory.
He discovered a way of interpreting quantum states as information. He came up with a way of compressing the information in a state, and storing the information in a smaller number of states. This is now known as Schumacher compression. This was the quantum analog of Shannon's noiseless coding theorem, and it helped to start the field known as quantum information theory.
Schumacher is also credited with inventing the term qubit along with William Wootters of Williams College, which is to quantum computation as a bit is to traditional computation.
He is the author of Physics in Spacetime, a textbook on Special Relativity, and is also a professor at Kenyon College, a small liberal arts college in rural Ohio. Also he holds the lecture on Quantum Mechanics: The Physics of the Microscopic World in The Teaching Company program.Quantum Mechanics: The Physics of the Microscopic World
Schumacher earned his bachelors degree at Hendrix College and his Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin.

Feta ([tpl]lang-el|φέτα[/tpl], féta, "slice") is a white-brined curd cheese made in Greece, the Balkans, and Turkey. It is a crumbly aged cheese, commonly produced in blocks, and has a slightly grainy texture. Feta is used as a table cheese, as well as in salads (e.g. the Greek salad) and pastries. Most notable is its use in the popular phyllo-based dishes spanakopita ("spinach pie") and tyropita ("cheese pie"), or served with some olive oil or olives and sprinkled with aromatic herbs such as oregano. It can also be served cooked or grilled, as part of a sandwich, in omelettes, or as a salty alternative to other cheeses in a variety of dishes.
Since 2002, "feta" has been a protected designation of origin product in the European Union. According to the relevant EU legislation, only those cheeses produced in a traditional way in some areas of Greece (mainland and the island of Lesbos), and made from sheep's milk, or from a mixture of sheep and goat's milk (up to 30%) of the same area, may bear the name "feta".[tpl]cite web|last=Gooch|first=Ellen|title=Truth, Lies, and Feta: The Cheese that Launched a (Trade) War|issue=2|date=Spring–Summer 2006|magazine=Epikouria: Fine Foods and Drinks of Greece|publisher=Triaina Publishing|url=http://www.epikouria.com/issue2/truth-lies-and-feta.php[/tpl] However, similar white-brined cheeses (often called "white cheese" in various languages) are found in the Eastern Mediterranean and around the Black Sea. Similar white-brined cheeses produced outside the European Union are often made partly or wholly of cow's milk, and they are sometimes called "feta".

[[List of cheeses]]

CATEGORIES:  Cheeses by country, Lists of cheeses, World cuisine

This is a list of cheeses by place of origin. Cheese is a milk-based food that is produced in wide-ranging flavors, textures, and forms. Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging.
Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester, is normally formed from adding annatto. While most current varieties of cheese may be traced to a particular locale, or culture, within a single country, some have a more diffuse origin, and cannot be considered to have originated in a particular place, but are associated with a whole region, such as queso blanco in Latin America.
Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, either in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into existence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/main/cheese/cheese2/history.asp|title=The History Of Cheese: From An Ancient Nomad's Horseback To Today's Luxury Cheese Cart|work=The Nibble|publisher=Lifestyle Direct, Inc.|accessdate=2009-10-08[/tpl]

[[Caerphilly cheese]]

CATEGORIES: Welsh cheeses, Cow's-milk cheeses

Caerphilly is a hard, white cheese that originates in the area around the town of Caerphilly in Wales, although it is now also made in England, particularly in the South West and on the English border with Wales. It was not originally made in Caerphilly, but was sold at the market there, hence taking the town's name.
Caerphilly is a light-coloured (almost white), crumbly cheese made from cow's milk, and generally has a fat content of around 48%. It has a mild taste, with its most noticeable feature being a not unpleasant slightly sour tang.
It is rumoured that the cheese was developed over time to provide the coal miners of the area with a convenient way of replenishing the salt lost through hard work over ten hour shifts underground and so was a staple of the diet of the coal-miners.
Farmhouse Caerphilly production died out during World War II as all milk had to go to the Cheddar factories to help the war effort. After the war these factories started making their version of Caerphilly (initially to help their cash flow as Caerphilly matures more quickly than Cheddar), which is how it is mostly known today, dry and crumbly. However, there are now two or three farms making original Caerphilly which is dry in the middle and creamy around the edges.
The town of Caerphilly holds a three day festival annually to celebrate the cheese entitled The Big Cheese ([tpl]lang-cy|Y Caws Mawr[/tpl]). Also in Caerphilly, there is a sculpture of a cheese.

[[Gōjū-ryū]]

CATEGORIES: Gōjū-ryū

[tpl]Nihongo|Gōjū-ryū|剛柔流[/tpl], (Japanese for "hard-soft style") is one of the main traditional Okinawan styles of karate, featuring a combination of hard and soft techniques. Both principles, hard and soft, come from the famous martial arts book used by Okinawan masters during the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bubiji ([tpl]zh|c=武備志|p=Wǔbèi Zhì[/tpl]). Gō, which means hard, refers to closed hand techniques or straight linear attacks; jū, which means soft, refers to open hand techniques and circular movements. Gōjū-ryū incorporates both circular and linear movements into its curriculum, combining hard striking attacks such as kicks and close hand punches with softer open hand circular techniques for attacking, blocking, and controlling the opponent, including locks, grappling, takedowns and throws.
Major emphasis is given to breathing correctly in all of the katas but particularly in the Sanchin kata which is one of two core katas of this style.  The second kata is called Tensho, meant to teach the student about the soft style of the system. Gōjū-ryū practices methods that include body strengthening and conditioning, its basic approach to fighting (distance, stickiness, power generation, etc.), and partner drills.

Brie is a historic region of France most famous for its dairy products, especially Brie cheese.  It was once divided into three sections ruled by different feudal lords: the western Brie française, corresponding roughly to the modern department of Seine-et-Marne in the Île-de-France region; the eastern Brie champenoise, forming a portion of the modern department of Marne in the historic region of Champagne (part of modern-day Champagne-Ardenne); and the northern Brie pouilleuse, forming part of the modern department of Aisne in Picardy.
The Brie forms a plateau with few eminences, varying in altitude between 300 and 500 feet in the west, and between 500 and 650 feet in the east. Its scenery is varied by forests of some size—the chief being the Forêt de Senart, the Forêt de Crécy, and the Forêt d'Armainvilliers. The surface soil is clay in which are embedded fragments of siliceous sandstone, used for millstones and constructional purposes; the subsoil is limestone. The Marne and its tributaries the Grand Morin and the Petit Morin are the chief rivers, but the region is not abundantly watered and the rainfall is only between 20 and 24 inches.

Cuomo was known for his liberal views and public speeches, particularly his keynote speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, California, where he attacked President Reagan's record. The speech brought him to national attention, and he was widely considered a front-runner for the Democratic nomination for President in both 1988 and 1992, but he declined to seek the nomination in both instances. His legacy as a reluctant standard-bearer for the Democrats in presidential elections led to him being dubbed "Hamlet on the Hudson".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57501477/best-and-worst-convention-addresses-how-will-gov-chris-christie-measure-up/|title=Best and worst convention addresses: How will Gov.

Twyford Down is an area of chalk downland lying directly to the southeast of Winchester, Hampshire, England. It is situated near the South Downs National Park, next to St. Catherine's Hill. The down has been used as a settlement since pre-Roman times, and has hosted a fort and a chapel, as well as being a popular 17th and 18th century coaching route.
In 1991, the down became the site of a major road protest against the completion of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester since the 1970s, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic due to the lack of available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public enquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over the down, ultimately in a cutting. Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction,[tpl]cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1994/dec/02/twyford-down|title=Twyford Down|author=John Denham|publisher=Hansard|date=2 December 1994|accessdate=18 January 2013[/tpl] attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from onsite security officers.
The motorway was completed as planned, and provided an important link of continuous motorway between Greater London and the South Coast ports. Nevertheless, the protests attracted interest from the national media, and drew attention to this form of campaigning. Subsequent road schemes were altered to take greater account of the environment or cancelled altogether. Several protesters at Twyford Down subsequently went on to form campaign groups such as the Campaign for Better Transport.

[[Black Madonna]]

CATEGORIES: Virgin Mary in art, Roman Catholic Church paintings, Roman Catholic Church sculpture

A Black Madonna or Black Virgin is a statue or painting of Mary in which she is depicted with dark skin, especially those created in Europe in the medieval period or earlier. The Black Madonnas are generally found in Catholic areas. The term refers to a type of Marian statue or painting of mainly medieval origin (12C-15C), with dark or black features whose exact origins are not always easy to determine.Duricy, Michael P., "Black Madonnas", Marian Library, Univ of Dayton The statues are mostly wooden but occasionally stone, often painted and up to [tpl]convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall. They fall into two main groups: free-standing upright figures and seated figures on a throne. The pictures are usually icons which are Byzantine in style, often made in 13th or 14th century Italy. There are about 450–500 Black Madonnas in Europe, depending on how they are classified. There are at least 180 Vierges Noires in France, and there are hundreds of non-medieval copies as well. Some are in museums, but most are in churches or shrines and are venerated by devotees. A few are associated with miracles and attract substantial numbers of pilgrims.
Important early studies of dark images in France were done by Marie Durand-Lefebvre (1937), Emile Saillens (1945), and Jacques Huynen (1972).  The first notable study of the origin and meaning of the so-called Black Madonnas in English appears to have been presented by Leonard Moss at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on Dec. 28, 1952. Moss broke the images into three categories: 1) dark brown or black madonnas with physiognomy and skin pigmentation matching that of the indigenous population; 2) various art forms that have turned black as a result of certain physical factors such as deterioration of lead-based pigments, accumulated smoke from the use of votive candles, and accumulation of grime over the ages, and 3) residual category with no ready explanation.

Swan Lake ([tpl]lang-ru|Лебединое озеро[/tpl] / Lebedinoye ozero), Op. 20, is a ballet composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1875–1876. The scenario, initially in four acts, was fashioned from Russian folk talessuch as The White Duck collected by Alexander Afanasyev in Narodnye russkie skazki and tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse.

CATEGORIES: Creator gods, Deities in the Hebrew Bible, Hebrew Bible topics, Hebrew words and phrases in the Hebrew Bible, Names of God in Judaism, Names of God in Christianity, Christian terms, Latter Day Saint doctrines regarding deity

Elohim ([tpl]Hebrew|אֱלֹהִים[/tpl]) is a grammatically singular or plural noun for "god" or "gods" in both modern and ancient Hebrew language.
When used with singular verbs and adjectives elohim is usually singular, "god" or especially, the God. When used with plural verbs and adjectives elohim is usually plural, "gods" or "powers".Glinert Modern Hebrew: An Essential Grammar Routledge p14 section 13 "(b) Agreement of verbs Verbs agree with their subject, and not only in gender and number but also in person. Present tense verbs distinguish masculine from feminine and singular from plural:"Gesenius A Grammar of the Hebrew Language It is generally thought that Elohim is a formation from eloah, the latter being an expanded form of the Northwest Semitic noun il ([tpl]lang|he|אֵל[/tpl], ʾēlK. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst (eds), Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible (revised 2nd edition, Brill, 1999) ISBN 90-04-11119-0, p. 274, 352-3). It is usually translated as "God" in the Hebrew Bible, referring with singular verbs both to the one God of Israel, and also in a few examples to other singular pagan deities. With plural verbs the word is also used as a true plural with the meaning "gods". The related nouns eloah ([tpl]lang|he|אלוה[/tpl]) and el ([tpl]lang|he|אֵל[/tpl]) are used as proper names or as generics, in which case they are interchangeable with elohim.
Mark S. Smith said that the notion of divinity underwent radical changes throughout the period of early Israelite identity. Smith said that the ambiguity of the term Elohim is the result of such changes, cast in terms of "vertical translatability" by Smith (2008); i.e. the re-interpretation of the gods of the earliest recalled period as the national god of the monolatrism as it emerged in the 7th to 6th century BCE in the Kingdom of Judah and during the Babylonian captivity, and further in terms of monotheism by the emergence of Rabbinical Judaism in the 2nd century CE.Mark S. Smith, God in translation: deities in cross-cultural discourse in the biblical world, vol. 57 of "Forschungen zum Alten Testament", Mohr Siebeck, 2008, ISBN 978-3-16-149543-4, p. 19.; Smith, Mark S. (2002), "The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel" (Biblical Resource Series) A different version was produced by Morton Smith. Despite the -im ending common to many plural masculine nouns in Hebrew, the word when referring to the Name of God is grammatically singular, and takes a singular verb in the Hebrew Bible.
The word is identical to the usual plural of el meaning gods or magistrates, and is cognate to the 'l-h-m found in Ugaritic, where it is used for the pantheon of Canaanite gods, the children of El and conventionally vocalized as "Elohim". Most use of the term Elohim in the later Hebrew text imply a view that is at least monolatrist at the time of writing, and such usage (in the singular), as a proper title for the supreme deity, is generally not considered to be synonymous with the term elohim, "gods" (plural, simple noun). Hebrew grammar allows for this nominally-plural form to mean "He is the Power (singular) over powers (plural)", or roughly, "God of gods". Rabbinic scholar Maimonides wrote that the various other usages are commonly understood to be homonyms. The plural form ending in -im can also be understood as denoting abstraction, as in the Hebrew words chayyim ("life") or betulim ("virginity"). If understood this way, Elohim means "divinity" or "deity".[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

Man o' War was sired by the prominent Fair Play. His dam, Mahubah, was sired by U.K. Triple Crown Champion Rock Sand.

[[Pragmaticism]]
CATEGORIES: Philosophical schools and traditions, Philosophical theories, Pragmatism, Charles Sanders Peirce

Pragmaticism is a term used by Charles Sanders Peirce for his pragmatic philosophy starting in 1905, in order to distance himself and it from pragmatism, the original name, which had been used in a manner he did not approve of in the "literary journals". Peirce in 1905 announced his coinage "pragmaticism", saying that it was "ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers" (Collected Papers (CP) 5.414). Today, outside of philosophy, "pragmatism" is often taken to refer to a compromise of aims or principles, even a ruthless search for mercenary advantage. Peirce gave other or more specific reasons for the distinction in a surviving draft letter that year and in later writings. Peirce's pragmatism, that is, pragmaticism, differed in Peirce's view from other pragmatisms by its commitments to the spirit of strict logic, the immutability of truth, the reality of infinity, and the difference between (1) actively willing to control thought, to doubt, to weigh reasons, and (2) willing not to exert the will, willing to believe.Peirce (1908), "A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God", Hibbert Journal v. 7, CP 6.452-485, EP 2:434-450, and elsewhere. See the discussion of pragmatism toward the end. Depending on the edition, it may appear in Section V or in an "additament" afterward. In his view his pragmatism is, strictly speaking, not itself a whole philosophy, but instead a general method for the clarification of ideas. He first publicly formulated his pragmatism as an aspect of scientific logic along with principles of statistics and modes of inference in his "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" series of articles in 1877-8.

Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game is the all-star game of the MLL. 
The inaugural 2001 All-Star Game, was not called the "All-Star Game"; instead it was titled the Major League Lacrosse LacrosseStar Game. From 2001–2003, the All-Star Game had the National Division playing the American Division. The league did not schedule an All Star Game in 2004. 
The 2005 game took place in Denver, Colorado on Saturday, July 2, 2005. The format for the 2005 game was "Old School" vs. "Young Guns". The rosters were determined by both fan and MLL team voting. Team "Old School" was composed of players who began their MLL careers in the league’s inaugural 2001 season. Members of the ‘Young Guns’ team began their playing careers in 2002 through the present.
The 2006 Major League Lacrosse All-Star game took place on July 6, 2006 at Boston University’s Nickerson Field. The MLL and US Lacrosse partnered to create the format for this All-Star game, pitting the MLL All-Stars against the United States National Team. The game was a final tune-up for the U.S. Team before they played in the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship.
The 2007 game was played on July 8 in Boston for the second year in row, but this time at Harvard Stadium. The format for the 2007 game was the Western Conference All-Stars against the Eastern Conference All-Stars.
The 2008 game was played in Denver, Colorado, in front of 10,124 people, with the Western Conference defeating the Eastern Conference 31–15, setting a league record for most points scored by an all-star team. Game MVP Ryan Powell scored a record six goals, and also had one assist.
The 2009 game used the "Young Guns vs Old School" format. The “Young Guns” squad was composed of players from the 2007–2009 classes, while the “Old School” squad was made up by those players from the classes prior to and including 2006.
The 2010 game was Team USA vs MLL All-Stars.
The 2011 game, the teams were selected by a pair of honorary captains, who earned the privilege after winning the “Ultimate MLL Fan Fantasy” Contest. "Team Warrior" by Nathan Solomon, a 14-year-old Chesapeake Bayhawks fan from Alpharetta, Georgia and "Team Authority" by Michael Hatala, a 13-year-old Long Island Lizards fan of Glen Cove, New York, selected the teams on the Friday night before the game.

Enlightenment broadly means wisdom or understanding enabling clarity of perception. However, the English word covers two concepts which can be quite distinct: religious and spiritual enlightenment ([tpl]lang-de|Erleuchtung[/tpl]) and secular or intellectual enlightenment (German: Aufklärung).
In religious use, enlightenment is most closely associated with South and East Asian religious experience, being used to translate words such as (in Buddhism) bodhi or satori, or (in Hinduism) moksha. The concept has parallels in the Abrahamic religions (in the Kabbalah tradition in Judaism, in Christian mysticism, and in the Sufi tradition of Islam).
In secular use, the concept refers mainly to the European intellectual movement known as the Age of Enlightenment, also called the Age of Reason, referring to philosophical developments related to scientific rationality in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Charles Henry Holden, Litt. D., FRIBA, MRTPI, RDI (12 May 1875 – 1 May 1960) was a Bolton-born English architect best known for designing many London Underground stations during the 1920s and 1930s, for Bristol Central Library, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London's headquarters at 55 Broadway and for the University of London's Senate House. He also created many war cemeteries in Belgium and northern France for the Imperial War Graves Commission.
After working and training in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, but for most of his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing.[tpl]#tag:ref|In architecture, "form" refers to the geometric shapes from which a building's basic design is composed; "massing" refers to the size of the shapes, their bulk and the way in which they are grouped together.|group="note"[/tpl] He  believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by the intended functions of buildings. After the First World War he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture. Holden was a member of the Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers' Guild. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.
Although not without its critics, his architecture is widely appreciated. He was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA's) Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1943. His station designs for London Underground became the corporation's standard design influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s. Many of his buildings have been granted listed building status, protecting them from unapproved alteration. Modestly believing that architecture was a collaborative effort, he twice declined the offer of a knighthood.

PSK31 or "Phase Shift Keying, 31 Baud" is a popular computer-soundcard-generated radioteletype mode, used primarily by amateur radio operators to conduct real-time keyboard-to-keyboard chat, most often using frequencies in the high frequency amateur radio bands (near-shortwave).  PSK31 is distinguished from other digital modes in that it is specifically tuned to have a data rate close to typing speed, and has an extremely narrow bandwidth, allowing many conversations in the same bandwidth as a single voice channel. This narrow bandwidth also concentrates the RF energy in a very narrow bandwidth, allowing relatively low-power equipment (25 watts) to communicate globally using the same skywave propagation used by shortwave radio stations.

It is the featured event of NBA All-Star Weekend. The All-Star game was first staged at the Boston Garden on March 2, 1951.
The starting lineup for each squad is selected by a fan ballot, while the reserves are chosen by a vote among the head coaches from each squad's respective conference.[tpl]cite news|publisher=espn.com|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2751331&type=story|title=Anthony snubbed when All-Star reserves announced|agency=Associated Press|date=February 1, 2007|accessdate=February 2, 2007[/tpl] Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players.

The head coach of the team with the best record in each conference is chosen as the coach of their respective conference in the All-Star Game. However, regardless of record, a head coach cannot serve as an All-Star head coach in two consecutive seasons. Known as the "Riley Rule," it is due to the fact that former head coach Pat Riley's Los Angeles Lakers teams of the 1980s won so often that Riley ended up earning the right to coach the Western Conference team eight times in nine seasons (1982 to 1990). In the event a coach's team repeats as the best record holder, the head coach from the team with the second-best record will serve as All-Star coach for that conference.

[[Zip drive]]
CATEGORIES: Computer storage media, Iomega storage devices, Floppy disk drives, 1994 introductions

The Zip drive is a medium-capacity removable floppy disk storage system that was introduced by Iomega in late 1994. Originally, Zip disks launched with capacities of 100 MB, but later versions increased this to first 250 MB and then 750 MB.
The format became the most popular of the superfloppy products which filled a niche in the late 1990s portable storage market. However, it was never popular enough to replace the 3.5-inch floppy disk nor could ever match the storage size available on rewritable CDs and later rewritable DVDs. USB flash drives ultimately proved to be the better rewritable storage medium among the general public due to the near-ubiquity of USB ports on personal computers and soon after because of the far greater storage sizes offered. Zip drives fell out of favor for mass portable storage during the early 2000s. The Zip brand later covered internal and external CD writers known as Zip-650 or Zip-CD, which had no relation to the Zip drive.

The Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – 750 BC) was a late Bronze Age culture of central Europe. The name comes from the custom of cremating the dead and placing their ashes in urns which were then buried in fields. The Urnfield culture followed the Tumulus culture and was succeeded by the Hallstatt culture. Linguistic evidence and continuity with the following Hallstatt culture suggests that the people of this culture spoke an early form of Celtic even proto-Celtic originally.

Tres Hombres (Spanish for "three men", meaning the three members of the band) is the third album by the American blues rock band ZZ Top. It was released in 1973. The album was the first of many times the band worked with Terry Manning as engineer. It was a successful combination as the release was the band's first commercial breakthrough. In the US, the album entered the top ten while the single "La Grange" reached number 41 on the singles chart.
At the height of ZZ Top's success in the mid-1980s a digitally remixed version of the recording was released on CD and the original 1973 mix version was discontinued. The remix version created controversy among fans because it significantly changed the sound of the instruments, especially drums. The remix version was used on all early CD copies and was the only version available for over 20 years. A remastered and expanded edition of the album was released on February 28, 2006, which contains three bonus live tracks. The 2006 edition is the first CD version to use Manning's original 1973 mix.

Wu (229–280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220–280). Its name was derived from the place it was based in — the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta) region, which was also historically known as "Wu". It was referred to as "Eastern Wu" or "Sun Wu" by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region, such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn Period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was called "Eastern Wu" because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and "Sun Wu" because the family name of its rulers was "Sun". During its existence, Wu's capital was at Jianye ([tpl]zh|t=建業[/tpl]; present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), but at times it was also at Wuchang ([tpl]lang|zh-hant|武昌[/tpl]; present-day Ezhou, Hubei).[tpl]Harvnb|Crespigny|2004|loc=3[/tpl].

[[Quasi-contract]]

CATEGORIES: Contract law, Law of obligations, Legal fictions

A quasi-contract (or implied-in-law contract or constructive contract) is a fictional contract created by courts for equitable, not contractual, purposes.  A quasi-contract is not an actual contract, but is a legal substitute formed to impose equity between two parties.  The concept of a quasi-contract is that of a contract that should have been formed, even though in actuality it was not. It is used when a court finds it appropriate to create an obligation upon a non-contracting party to avoid injustice and to ensure fairness.  It is invoked in circumstances of and is connected with the concept of restitution.
Generally the existence of an actual or implied-in-fact contract is required for the defendant to be liable for services rendered, and a person who provides a service uninvited is an officious intermeddler who is not entitled to compensation.  "Would-be plaintiffs cannot deliver unordered goods or services and demand payment for the benefit....A corollary is that one who does have an enforceable contract is bound by the contract's terms: subject to a few controversial exceptions, she cannot sue for restitution of the value of benefits conferred..." Douglas Laycock, Modern American Remedies, 3rd edition (2002) pg. 566 However, in many jurisdictions under certain circumstances plaintiffs may be entitled to restitution under quasi-contract (as in the example of Louisiana or Oklahoma below). They are used as remedies for unjust enrichment, management of another's affairs (negotiorum gestio), or payment of a thing not due (indebiti solutio). 
Quasi-contracts are defined to be "the lawful and purely voluntary acts of a man, from which there results any obligation whatever to a third person, and sometime a reciprocal obligation between the parties."[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Quasi-contracts are stipulated in the 3rd Book, Title IV, Chapter 1 of the French Civil Code (articles 1371-1381).Chapitre Ier : Des quasi-contrats Code civil Legifrance.gouv.fr Retrieved 31 March 2013; One authority defines a quasi-contract as "A licit and voluntary act from which derives obligations subject to a regime close to the contractual one imposing on the author of the act and a third party, not-bound by a contract"."Quasi-contrat", Lexique des Termes Juridiques, Dalloz, 2013, pg. 745

The Andalusian varieties of Spanish (Spanish: andaluz, [tpl]IPA-es|andaˈluθ|IPA[/tpl]; western pronunciation:[tpl]IPA-es|andaˈluh|IPA[/tpl]). are spoken in Andalusia, Ceuta, Melilla and Gibraltar. They include perhaps the most distinct of the southern variants of peninsular Spanish, differing in many respects from northern varieties, and also from Standard Spanish. Due to the large population of Andalusia, the Andalusian dialect is the second most spoken dialect in Spain, after the transitional variants between Castilian and Andalusian (for example the one from Madrid). 
Due to massive emigration from Andalusia to the Spanish colonies in the Americas and elsewhere, most American Spanish dialects share some fundamental characteristics with Western Andalusian Spanish, such as the use of ustedes instead of vosotros for the second person plural, and seseo. Many varieties of Spanish, such as Canarian Spanish, Caribbean Spanish and other Latin American Spanish dialects, including their standard dialects, are considered[tpl]by whom|date=October 2013[/tpl] as being based on Andalusian Spanish.

Joachim Zachris Duncker (November 12, 1774 – July 6, 1809)  was a Swedish soldier born in Ristiina in Savonia.
In 1789 Duncker obtained the rank of 2:nd Lieutenant in the Savonia ranger regiment. He fought in the 1790 war against Russia and proved his valor at the Battle of Perttimäki May 19. In 1804 Duncker was promoted to Captain.
During the Finnish War of 1808-1809 he distinguished himself as a brave and prominent officer. When Cronstedt's army retreated from Mikkeli to Iisalmi and Oulu through Leppävirta (March 1808), Duncker commanded the army's rearguard. During the Battle of Pulkkila (May 2, 1808) he distinguished himself so well that Johan August Sandels gave him the honorary assignment to bring the news of the victory to the Swedish king. Shortly after, he was promoted to Major.  In June 1808 he captured a large transport of supplies to the Russians. During the Battle of Koljonvirta (October 27, 1808), Duncker together with Colonel Fahlander and Major Malm and only 600 men helped Sandels to utterly defeated a superior Russian force. In 1809 Duncker fought the Russians in the Swedish province of Västerbotten, and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. During the Battle of Hörnefors (July 5, 1809) Duncker commanded the Swedish rearguard and received fatal wounds and died in the Russian encampment the day after.
Duncker was buried next to Umeå church by the Russians that gave him a full honour guard. He lies buried together with a Russian cossack chief. In 1897 a memorial was erected on the spot where the grave was assumed to be.

[[State of nature]]

CATEGORIES: Political philosophy, Philosophical concepts, Enlightenment philosophy, John Locke

The state of nature is a concept in moral and political philosophy used in religion, social contract theories and international lawEmer de VATTEL, The Law of Nations, Preliminaries. Idea and General Principles. §4. to denote the hypothetical conditions of what the lives of people might have been like before societies came into existence. There must have been a time before organized societies existed, and this presumption raises questions such as: "What was life like before civil society?"; "How did government first emerge from such a starting position?," and; "What are the hypothetical reasons for entering a state of society by establishing a Nation-state?".
In some versions of social contract theory, there are no rights in the state of nature, only freedoms, and it is the contract that creates rights and obligations. In other versions the opposite occurs: the contract imposes restrictions upon individuals that curtail their natural rights.
The time-period before the establishment of government, which political philosophers call the "state of nature," however, is regarded in the modern scientific era not only as hypothetical but actual. Societies existing before or without a political state are currently studied in such diverse fields as paleolithic history, archaeology, cultural anthropology, social anthropology, and ethnology, which investigate the social and power-related structures of indigenous and uncontacted peoples living in tribal communities.

[[Moment (physics)]]
CATEGORIES: Physical quantities, Length

In physics, moment relates to the perpendicular distance from a point to a line or a surface, and is derived from the mathematical concept of moments.Robertson, D.G.E.; Caldwell, G.E.; Hamill, J.; Kamen, G.; and Whittlesey, S.N. (2004) Research Methods in Biomechanics. Champaign, IL:Human Kinetics Publ., p. 285. It is frequently used in combination with other physical quantities as in moment of inertia, moment of force, moment of momentum, magnetic moment and so on.
Moment is also used colloquially for different physical quantities that depend upon distance. For example, in engineering and kinesiology the term moment is often used instead of the more complete term moment of force. A moment of force is the product of the distance of a force from an axis times the magnitude of the force, i.e., F × d, where F is the magnitude of the force and d is the moment of the force. See torque for a more complete description of moments of force or couple for the related concept free moment of force also known as a force couple.

[[El Loco]]

CATEGORIES: ZZ Top albums, 1981 albums, Terry Manning albums, Albums produced by Bill Ham, Warner Bros. Records albums

El Loco is the seventh studio album by the American blues rock band ZZ Top, released in 1981. The title means "The Crazy One" in Spanish. The band's guitarist/singer Billy Gibbons has said that the recording of this album was the first time the three members of the band were isolated from one another in the studio, rather than recording simultaneously in the same room. It also foreshadowed ZZ Top's New Wave direction later in the decade, with early experimentations in synthesizer backing on certain tracks.
El Loco was produced by Bill Ham and recorded and originally mixed by Terry Manning. The biographer David Blayney explains in his book Sharp Dressed Men that the recording engineer Linden Hudson was involved as a pre-producer on this album.Blayney, David (1994). Sharp Dressed Men. New York: Hyperion. pp. 196–202. ISBN 0-7868-8005-8. Hudson did not receive credit for engineering the tracks on "Groovy Little Hippie Pad" which were used on the final album mix. In 1987, most of the band's back catalog received a controversial "digitally enhanced" remix treatment for CD release; however, El Loco did not receive this remix treatment and the original mix of the album has been available on CD since 1987.
On June 3, 2013, Gibbons told Joe Bosso of MusicRadar.com that the album was "a really interesting turning point", explaining that the band had "befriended somebody who would become an influential associate, a guy named Linden Hudson. He was a gifted songwriter and had production skills that were leading the pack at times. He brought some elements to the forefront that helped reshape what ZZ Top were doing, starting in the studio and eventually to the live stage. He had no fear and was eager to experiment in ways that would frighten most bands. But we followed suit, and the synthesizers started to show up on record. Manufacturers were looking for ways to stimulate sales, and these instruments started appearing on the market. One of our favorite tracks was "Groovy Little Hippie Pad". Right at the very opening, there it is – the heavy sound of a synthesizer. For us, there was no turning back."

The history of the United States from 1964 through 1980 includes the climax  and victory of the African American Civil Rights Movement; the escalation and ending of the Vietnam War; the drama of a generational revolt with its sexual freedoms and use of drugs; and the continuation of the Cold War, with its Space Race to put a man on the Moon.  The economy was prosperous until the early 1970s, then faltered under new foreign competition and high oil prices. By 1980 and the seizure of the American Embassy in Iran, there was a growing sense of national malaise. This period is closed by the victory of conservative Republican Ronald Reagan, opening the "Age of Reagan" with a dramatic change in national direction.
Memories of the 1960s shaped the political landscape for the next half-century. As Bill Clinton explained in 1990, "If you look back on the Sixties and think there was more good than bad, you're probably a Democrat. If you think there was more harm than good, you're probably a Republican."Quoted in M. J.

The history of the United States from 1980 until 1991 includes the last year of the Jimmy Carter presidency, eight years of the Ronald Reagan administration, and the first two years of the George H. W. Bush presidency, up to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Plagued by the Iran hostage crisis and mounting domestic opposition, Carter lost the 1980 presidential election to Republican Reagan. In his first term, Reagan introduced expansionary fiscal policies aimed at stimulating the American economy after a recession in 1981 and 1982, including oil deregulation policies which led to the 1980s oil glut. He met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in four summit conferences, culminating with the signing of the INF Treaty. These actions accelerated the end of the Cold War, which occurred during the early part of the Bush presidency, and the removal of the Berlin Wall. The second largest stock market crash (percentage-wise) in United States history occurred in 1987, preceding another recession. The largest scandal of the years was the Iran-Contra affair, wherein weapons had been sold to Iran, and the proceeds used by the CIA to aid Contras in Nicaragua.

[[Power vacuum]]

CATEGORIES: Politics by issue, Political science terms, Changes in political power

In political science and political history, the term power vacuum is an analogy between a physical vacuum, to the political condition "when someone has lost control of something and no one has replaced them."http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/power-vacuum The situation can occur when a government has no identifiable central power or authority. The physical analogy suggests that in a power vacuum, other forces will tend to "rush in" to fill the vacuum as soon as it is created, perhaps in the form of an armed militia or insurgents, military coup, warlord or dictator.
During or following a civil war there is often a power vacuum of some sort. A power vacuum can also occur following a constitutional crisis in which large portions of the government resign or are removed, creating unclear issues regarding succession to positions of power.

Baywatch is an American action drama series about the Los Angeles County Lifeguards who patrol the beaches of Los Angeles County, California, starring David Hasselhoff.  The show was canceled after its first season on NBC, but survived and later became one of the most watched television shows in the world. The show ran in its original title and format from 1989 to 1999, except for the 1990–1991 season, during which it was not in production. From 1999 to 2001, with a setting change and large cast overhaul, it was known as Baywatch Hawaii.
Baywatch premiered on NBC in 1989, but was canceled after only one season when it placed 73rd out of 103 shows in the seasonal ratings and also because the studio, GTG, went out of business. Feeling the series still had potential, Hasselhoff along with creators and Executive Producers Michael Berk, Douglas Schwartz and Greg Bonann revived it for the first-run syndication market in 1991.  Hasselhoff was given the title of Executive Producer for his work on bringing the show back.  The series was hugely successful, especially internationally.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-20/entertainment/ca-919_1_london-weekend | title=Baywatch Has a Cow, Man, London Style | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=November 20, 1996 | accessdate=2010-10-15 | author=Gritten, David[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-28/entertainment/ca-207_1_baywatch-production | title=Surf's Up Again for Baywatch | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=November 28, 1991 | accessdate=2010-10-15 | author=McDougal, Dennis[/tpl] The show led to a spin-off: Baywatch Nights, and a reunion movie, Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding.
In 1999, with production costs rising in Los Angeles, and the syndication market shrinking, the plan was to move the show to Australia and launch Baywatch Down Under. A pilot was filmed but the series was stopped when residents of Avalon put forth strong objections, including potential damage to a fragile ecosystem. Pittwater Council permanently barred all future filming.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-03-01/lifestyle/9903010281_1_baywatch-show-avalon | title=Aussie Town Boos Baywatch | work=Sun Sentinel | date=March 1, 1999 | accessdate=2010-10-16 | author=Huff, Richard[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/286274.stm | title=Wave of protest over Baywatch move | work=BBC | date=February 26, 1999 | accessdate=2010-10-15[/tpl] This pilot finally aired as a two-part episode of Baywatch.
As an alternative to Australia, Hawaii offered the producers large financial incentives to move the show to the islands instead, and in Season 10, Baywatch Hawaii was launched.
Baywatch filmed for two seasons in Hawaii, from 1999 until 2001.[tpl]cite web|title=Film and television in Hawaii|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_and_television_in_Hawaii|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=April 17, 2012[/tpl] The proposal to relocate Baywatch to Hawaii rather than Australia was initiated by April Masini in a telephone call to Executive Producer Greg Bonann. The deal to provide the incentives necessary to secure the series was presented to Governor Ben Cayetano by Al Masini and April Masini; Tony Vericella, president of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau; and Cayetano's executive assistant, Joe Blanco. The agreement required the production to change its name from Baywatch to Baywatch Hawaii, hire local leads, and film in the state for at least two years, guaranteeing 44 episodes, each at a cost of about $870,000, 60 percent of which was to be spent in Hawaii.[tpl]cite news|last=Ryan|first=Tim|title='Baywatch' May Relocate to Hawaii|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/03/04/news/story1.html|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=March 4, 1999[/tpl]

Morris "Moe" Berg (March 2, 1902 – May 29, 1972) was an American catcher and coach in Major League Baseball who later served as a spy for the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. Although he played 15 seasons in the major leagues, almost entirely for four American League teams, Berg was never more than an average player, usually used as a backup catcher, and was better known for being "the brainiest guy in baseball"Davidoff, p.17 than for anything he accomplished in the game.  Casey Stengel once described Berg as "the strangest man ever to play baseball".[tpl]cite web | last =Berger | first =Ralph | title =Moe Berg | work =The Baseball Biography Project | publisher =The Society for American Baseball Research | url =http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=756&pid=962 | accessdate =March 11, 2007 [/tpl]
A graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School, Berg spoke several languages and regularly read 10 newspapers a day. His reputation was fueled by his successful appearances as a contestant on the radio quiz show Information, Please in which he answered questions about the derivation of words and names from Greek and Latin, historical events in Europe and the Far East, and ongoing international conferences.Dawidoff, 15–16.
As a spy working for the government of the United States, Berg traveled to Yugoslavia to gather intelligence on resistance groups the U.S. government was considering supporting. He was then sent on a mission to Italy, where he interviewed various physicists concerning the German nuclear program. After the war, Berg was occasionally employed by the OSS's successor, the Central Intelligence Agency, but, by the mid-1950s, was unemployed. He spent the last two decades of his life without work, living with various siblings.

Narrative of the Chinese Embassy to the Khan of the Tourgouth Tartars, in the years 1712, 13, 14, and 15 is a record of the travel to Kalmykia,  written by Tulišen, a Manchu official of the Qing Dynasty.
The book, which was originally written in Manchu, was later translated into Chinese. The title is:
The English title Narrative of the Chinese Embassy to the Khan of the Tourgouth Tartars, in the years 1712, 13, 14, and 15, by the Chinese Ambassador, and published by the Emperor's Authority, at Peking. is of Sir George Thomas Staunton's translation in 1821. Although the Chinese version is more popular, the Manchu version offers higher quality information.
In 1712 Kangxi Emperor sent Tulišen and other emissaries to the Kalmyk Khanate to convey an imperial edict to Ayuka Khan of the Torghuts. They left Beijing, crossed Mongolia and then entered Russia. In order to avoid Dzungaria, they travelled through the Russia Empire to Saratov and entered into Ayuki's Torghut state (Turgūt gurun in Manchu). Having accomplished the mission, they returned to Beijing in 1715. Tulišen reported to the Emperor in both Manchu and Chinese. With the Emperor's permission, he published the book by editing these reports and private notes.
The formal purpose of this mission was to negotiate over the return of Ayuki's nephew Arabjur to Kalmykia. As a Buddhist, he made a pilgrimage to Tibet but was unable to return to Kalmykia because of the Dzungars' obstruction. Another purpose was to reconnoiter expanding Russia. In fact, the book is mostly devoted to the description of Russia. Some Russians suspected that the emissaries secretly encouraged the Torghuud to return to their homeland as Ayuki's great-grandson Ubashi did later.

Victor D’HondtD'Hondt's last name is often misspelled as d’Hondt.  Confusion may arrive when reading articles on D'Hondt from the Netherlands, since in that country when using the full name one should write: Victor d'Hondt (with a small d), while the surname all by itself would be D'Hondt (with a capital D). However, in Belgium it is always capitalized, hence: Victor D'Hondt. (20 November 1841 - 30 May 1901) was a Belgian lawyer, salesman, jurist of civil law at Ghent University, and mathematician. He devised a procedure, the D'Hondt method, which he first described in 1878, for allocating seats to candidates in party-list proportional representation elections. The method has been adopted by a number of countries, including Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia,  Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Paraguay, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovenia, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Iceland, Uruguay and Wales.

Hurricane Hugo was a powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane that caused widespread damage and loss of life in the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Southeast United States. Hurricane Hugo formed over the eastern Atlantic near the Cape Verde Islands on September 9, 1989. Hugo moved thousands of miles across the Atlantic, rapidly strengthening to briefly attain category 5 hurricane strength on its journey. It later crossed over Guadeloupe and St. Croix on September 17 and 18 as a category 4 hurricane. Weakening slightly more, Hurricane Hugo passed over Puerto Rico as a strong category 3 hurricane. Further weakening occurred several hours after re-emerging into the Atlantic, becoming downgraded to a category 2 hurricane. However, Hugo re-strengthened into a category 4 hurricane before making landfall at Charleston Harbor, South Carolina on September 21. Hugo had devolved to a remnant low near Lake Erie by the next day.[tpl]cite report|last=Lawrence|first=Miles|date=November 15, 1989|title=Preliminary Report: Hurricane Hugo|url=http://www.ecu.edu/renci/StormsToLife/Hugo/images/NOAA-Hugo-Report.pdf|publisher=National Hurricane Center|format=PDF|pages=1-2, 7|accessdate=August 26, 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Spaniels, Sporting dogs, Dog breeds originating in England, Vulnerable Native Breeds

The Clumber Spaniel is a breed of dog of the spaniel type, developed in the United Kingdom. It is the largest of the spaniels, and comes in predominantly one colour. The name of the breed is taken from Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. It is a gundog that specialises in hunting in heavy cover. They are gentle and loyal, and can act aloof with strangers. They have several habits which could be considered disadvantages, including a constant shedding of its coat, snoring and the production of excessive drool.
The history of the breed is uncertain prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent. Clumber Spaniels have been kept and bred by various British Monarchs, including Prince Albert, King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced into Canada in 1844, and in 1884 became one of the first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club. The breed can suffer from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary lameness due to bone growth whilst young to hip dysplasia or spinal disc herniation.

The Roosevelt Corollary is a corollary to the Monroe Doctrine that was articulated by President Theodore Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address in 1904 after the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03. The corollary states that the United States will intervene in conflicts between European countries and Latin American countries to enforce legitimate claims of the European powers, rather than having the Europeans press their claims directly.
Roosevelt tied his policy to the Monroe Doctrine, and it was also consistent with his foreign policy of “talk softly, but carry a big stick”. Roosevelt stated that in keeping with the Monroe Doctrine, the United States was justified in exercising "international police power" to put an end to chronic unrest or wrongdoing in the Western Hemisphere. Ironically, the Roosevelt Corollary justified American intervention throughout the hemisphere while the Monroe Doctrine had sought to prevent European intervention. In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt renounced interventionism and established his Good Neighbor policy within the Western Hemisphere.

[[National Anthem of Honduras]]
CATEGORIES: National anthems, Honduran culture, Spanish-language songs, 1915 in Honduras

The "National Anthem of Honduras" (Spanish Himno Nacional de Honduras) was adopted under presidential decree 42 in 1915.Honduras Universal Himnos del Pais The lyrics were written by Augusto Constancio Coello and the music composed by Carlos Hartling. In its entirety, the anthem is a brief chronology of Honduran history. The anthem consists of the chorus and seven verses. But, for official acts, only the chorus and the seventh are sung. The chorus, which is sung before and after the seventh verse, is a description of Honduras' chief national symbols, the flag and the coat of arms. The eighth verse, is a patriotic call to duty to Hondurans to defend the flag and the nation. By the time Hondurans complete their sixth year of elementary education, they will have memorized and been taught the meaning of all eight verses. Unofficially, the anthem is sometimes called "Tu bandera es un lampo de cielo" (Spanish for "Your flag is a splendor of sky") which is also the first line of the chorus.

The Good Neighbor policy was the foreign policy of the administration of United States President Franklin Roosevelt toward the countries of Latin America. While its rule became effective during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency, 19th-century politician Henry Clay paved the way for it and coined the term "Good Neighbor".
The policy's main principle was that of non-intervention and non-interference in the domestic affairs of Latin America. It also reinforced the idea that the United States would be a “good neighbor” and engage in reciprocal exchanges with Latin American countries.[tpl]cite journal |last=Rabe |first=Stephen G |authorlink=Stephen G.

At least four record labels with the name Bullet Records have existed.
The earliest one was a record label based in Nashville, USA, which was started in 1946 by Jim Bulliet and C.V. Hitchcock.[tpl]cite book|last=Kingsbury|first=Paul|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music: The Ultimate Guide to the Music|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517608-7|pages=65[/tpl]  Bulleit was an early partner in Sun Records. Its only national hits were by orchestra leader Francis Craig.  The pop hit "Near You" made in early 1947[tpl]cite journal|journal=Billboard|date=1 April 1967|volume=13|issue=79|issn=0006-2510[/tpl] was a monster, topping the charts for seventeen weeks and having a chart run of twenty-five weeks.

ISBN 0-89820-083-0  Despite these hits, the label was known for country music artists such as Boots Woodall's Radio Wranglers, who also recorded for Capitol Records, and Southern Gospel artists such as the Rangers Quartet and Speer Family. In 1949 they released B. B. King's first commercial single, "Miss Martha King".[tpl]cite book|last=Kostelanetz|first=Richard|title=The B.B.

The third known label with this name was based in England in the early 1980s, and released NWOBHM artists. Among known releases is the self-titled 1983 debut EP from Danish Pretty Maids.  Bullet Records UK was an offshoot of Bullet Mail Order. Because of its close ties with the British heavy metal scene at that time, it seemed a logical progression to form a label to promote little-known unsigned bands. Amongst the bands on the label were Wrathchild, Pretty Maids, Black Rose N.E.England, Le Griffe, Crisis (from Salt Lake City, USA), Silverwing, Chrome Molly and Taipan Australia. Whilst many of the releases were critically acclaimed, the company suffered from a lack of experience and through various reasons, cash-flow being one, was forced to cease trading in 1984

In black hole theory, the black hole membrane paradigm is a useful "toy model" method or "engineering approach" for visualising and calculating the effects predicted by quantum mechanics for the exterior physics of black holes, without using quantum-mechanical principles or calculations. It models a black hole as a thin classically-radiating surface (or membrane) at or vanishingly close to the black hole's event horizon. This approach to the theory of black holes was created by Kip S. Thorne, R. H. Price and D. A. Macdonald. 
The results of the membrane paradigm are generally considered to be "safe".

[[Electric vehicle]]
CATEGORIES: Electric vehicles, Sustainable transport

An electric vehicle (EV), also referred to as an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. Three main types of electric vehicles exist, those that are directly powered from an external power station, those that are powered by stored electricity originally from an external power source, and those that are powered by an on-board electrical generator, such as an internal combustion engine (hybrid electric vehicles) or a hydrogen fuel cell.Air pollution from motor vehicles EVs include plug-in electric cars, hybrid electric cars, hydrogen vehicles, electric trains, electric lorries, electric airplanes, electric boats, electric motorcycles and scooters and electric spacecraft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=141347 |title=Electric car boom - Fiji Times Online |publisher=Fijitimes.com |date=2010-03-04 |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl] Diesel submarines operating on battery power are, for the duration of the battery run, electric submarines, and some of the lighter UAVs are electrically-powered. Proposals exist for electric tanks.
EVs first came into existence in the mid-19th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. The internal combustion engine (ICE) has been the dominant propulsion method for motor vehicles for almost 100 years, but electric power has remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as trains and smaller vehicles of all types.
During the last few decades, environmental impact of the petroleum-based transportation infrastructure, along with the peak oil, has led to renewed interest in an electric transportation infrastructure.[tpl]cite web |title=Sustainable transportation based on EV concepts: a brief overview |url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224880220_Sustainable_transportation_based_on_electric_vehicle_concepts_a_brief_overview|last1=Eberle|first1=Ulrich|first2=Rittmar|last2=von Helmolt |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |date=2010-05-14| accessdate=2010-06-08[/tpl] EVs differ from fossil fuel-powered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated from a wide range of sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable sources such as tidal power, solar power, and wind power or any combination of those. The carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles varies depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. The electricity may then be stored on board the vehicle using a battery, flywheel, or supercapacitors. Vehicles making use of engines working on the principle of combustion can usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources, usually non-renewable fossil fuels. A key advantage of hybrid or plug-in electric vehicles is regenerative braking due to their capability to recover energy normally lost during braking as electricity is stored in the on-board battery.

The Nippon Sei Ko Kai (Japanese: 日本聖公会, Nippon Seikōkai, "Japanese Holy Catholic Church"), abbreviated as NSKK, or sometimes referred to in English as the Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan, is the national Christian church representing the Province of Japan (日本管区, Nippon Kanku) within the Anglican Communion.
As a member of the Anglican Communion the Nippon Sei Ko Kai shares many of the historic doctrinal and liturgical practices of the Church of England, but is a fully autonomous national church governed by its own Synod and led by its own Primate. The Nippon Sei Ko Kai, in common with other churches in the Anglican Communion, considers itself to be a part of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church and to be both Catholic and Reformed.
With an estimated 80 million members worldwide, the Anglican Communion is the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches.  The Nippon Sei Ko Kai has approximately 60,000 members organised into eleven dioceses and found in local church congregations throughout Japan.

A scone is a single-serving cake or quick bread. They are usually made of wheat, barley or oatmeal, with baking powder as a leavening agent, and are baked on sheet pans. They are often lightly sweetened and are occasionally glazed. The scone is a basic component of the cream tea or Devonshire tea. It differs from a teacake and other sweet buns, which are made with yeast. A scone is in some senses a type of pastry since it is made with essentially the same ingredients as shortcrust, though with different proportions of fat to flour.

[[Epipactis]]
CATEGORIES: Orchid genera, Epipactis, Terrestrial orchids

Epipactis, or Helleborine, is a genus of terrestrial orchids consisting of approximately 70 species. This genus is abbreviated as Epcts in horticultural trade.
They occur in temperate and subtropical climates of America, Asia, and Europe. These orchids grow in open spaces in forests, in undergrowth, on calcareous soils and are often found in wet dune-slacks near the sea. The only original American species is Giant Helleborine (Epipactis gigantea). One species from Europe, Broad-leaved Helleborine (Epipactis helleborine), is invasive in North America. Most species are protected.
Most of these hardy orchids grow in a wet environment, but there are exceptions. The Marsh helleborine (Epipactis palustris) is the only European orchid able to survive in a flooded habitat. Epipactis gigantea is a species found in the American west, and into southern Canada, in wet areas and even streams. It can grow to a height of 1 m. However, Epipactis helleborine grows in more diverse habitats, from sheltered sandy beaches to open spaces in deciduous or coniferous forests, on roadsides, in meadows, and on moist soils.  It is sometimes called the Weed Orchid. 
As characteristic of all orchids, Epipactis spp. are dependent on a mycorrhizal symbiosis (see also Orchid mycorrhiza). This allows some species to have reduced leaves and need little chlorophyll. Violet Helleborine (Epipactis viridiflora) can even do without chlorophyll. These forms can be recognized by their purple instead of violet flowers.
Their creeping, fleshy  rhizomes grow offshoots, from which then emerge the 20–70 cm long stems during the next spring. 
There are four to eight alternate, lanceolate leaves, that grow progressively shorter near the top. The margins are entire, the top is acute. Species with less chlorophyll have blue-purple leaves.
Their bilaterally symmetrical colorful flowers grow from a terminal raceme. The three sepals and the two lateral petals are ovate and acuminate. Their color can vary from greenish-white to violet and purple. 
The lip is divided in a bowl-shaped hypochile, with the outer surface greenish-white and threaded with dark veins. The wavy, snow-white epichile is fan-shaped. 
The ovary is inferior. It produces a dry capsule with countless minute seeds.

Clotted cream (sometimes called scalded, clouted, Devonshire or Cornish cream) is a thick cream made by indirectly heating full-cream cow's milk using steam or a water bath and then leaving it in shallow pans to cool slowly. During this time, the cream content rises to the surface and forms 'clots' or 'clouts'.BBC Devon: article on clotted, or clouted, cream It forms an essential part of a cream tea.
Although its  origin is uncertain, the cream's production is commonly associated with dairy farms in South West England and in particular the counties of Cornwall and Devon. The current largest commercial producer in the UK is Rodda's in Redruth, Cornwall, which can produce up to 25 tons (25,000 kg; 55,000 lb) of clotted cream a day. In 1998 the term Cornish clotted cream became a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) by European Union directive, as long as the milk is produced in Cornwall and the minimum fat content is 55%.

[[Oneness Pentecostalism]]

CATEGORIES: Christian fundamentalism, Oneness Pentecostalism, Nontrinitarianism

Oneness Pentecostalism (also known as Apostolic or Jesus' Name Pentecostalism) refers to a grouping of denominations and believers within Pentecostal Christianity, all of whom subscribe to the nontrinitarian theological doctrine of Oneness. This movement first emerged around 1914 as the result of doctrinal disputes within the nascent Pentecostal movement and claims an estimated 24 million adherents today.[tpl]cite book| last =Patterson| first =Eric| last2 =Rybarczyk| first2 =Edmund| title =The Future of Pentecostalism in the United States| publisher =Lexington Books| year =2007| location =New York| page =124| isbn = 978-0-7391-2102-3[/tpl] For a list of denominations in this movement, see List of Christian denominations.
Oneness Pentecostalism derives its distinctive name from its teaching on the Godhead, which is popularly referred to as the Oneness doctrine.[tpl]cite book| last =Patterson| first =Eric| last2 =Rybarczyk| first2 =Edmund| title =The Future of Pentecostalism in the United States| publisher =Lexington Books| year =2007| location =New York| page =123| isbn = 978-0-7391-2102-3[/tpl] This doctrine states that there is one God, a singular divine person, who manifests himself in many different ways, including as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This stands in sharp contrast to the doctrine of three distinct and eternal "persons" posited by Trinitarian theology. Oneness believers baptize in the name of Jesus Christ, commonly referred to as Jesus-name baptism, rather than using the Trinitarian formula.
Besides their beliefs about the Godhead, Oneness Pentecostals differ significantly from most other Pentecostal and evangelical Christians in matters of soteriology. Whereas most Pentecostals and evangelicals believe that only faith in Jesus Christ and repentance from sin are essential elements for salvation, Oneness Pentecostalism defines salvation as repentance, baptism (in Jesus' name) and receipt of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in other tongues. They also tend to emphasize strict "holiness standards" in dress, grooming and other areas of personal conduct that are not necessarily shared by other Pentecostal groups, at least not to the degree that is generally found in Oneness churches.

He was privately tutored at Wimbledon, gazetted to the 12th Lancers in 1865, and stationed in Cahir in County Tipperary. He rode his first Winning Race in 1867 at Cork Park. He joined the Lord Lieutenant's staff as an extra Aide de Camp in 1870, where he was based at the Viceregal Lodge in Dublin, was promoted to Captain and left services. Middleton was one of the best and most popular riders in the United Kingdom. When the Empress of Austria hunted in Ireland, he was her pilot. He repeatedly rode the winners over the stiffest steeplechase courses, including the Punchestown (Ireland) Grand National. Besides being distinguished as a horseman, he was a good cricketer, belonging to the Jockey Cricket Club.
His nickname "Bay" was either a reference to his reddish-brown hair, or derived from the name of the winner of the Epsom Derby winner in 1836.

María Corazón Sumulong "Cory" Cojuangco Aquino (January 25, 1933 – August 1, 2009) was a Filipina politician who served as the 11th President of the Philippines, the first woman to hold that office, and the first female president in Asia. Regarded as the "Icon of Philippine Democracy", Aquino was the most prominent figure of the 1986 People Power Revolution, which toppled the 21-year authoritarian rule of President Ferdinand Marcos and restored democracy to the Philippines. She was named Time magazine's "Woman of the Year" in 1986. She is the first President without any political experience as she had not held any other elective office.

She emerged as leader of the opposition after her husband was assassinated on August 21, 1983 upon returning to the Philippines from exile in the United States. In late 1985, Marcos called for snap elections, and Aquino ran for president with former senator Salvador Laurel as her Vice-President. After the elections were held on February 7, 1986, the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his running mate, Arturo Tolentino, as the winners amidst allegations of electoral fraud, with Aquino calling for massive civil disobedience actions. Defections from the Armed Forces and the support of the local Catholic Church led to the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and secured Aquino's accession on February 25, 1986.
As President, Aquino oversaw the promulgation of the 1987 Constitution, which limited the powers of the Presidency and re-established the bicameral Congress. Her administration gave strong emphasis and concern for civil liberties and human rights, and on peace talks to resolve the ongoing Communist insurgency and Islamist secession movements. Her economic policies centred on restoring economic health and confidence and focused on creating a market-oriented and socially responsible economy.
Aquino faced several coup attempts against her government and various natural calamities until the end of her term in 1992. She was succeeded as President by Fidel V. Ramos, and returned to civilian life while remaining public about her opinions on political issues.
In 2008, Aquino was diagnosed with colon cancer from which she died on August 1, 2009. Her son, Benigno Aquino III, has been President of the Philippines since June 30, 2010. Throughout her life, Aquino was known to be a devout Roman Catholic, and was fluent in French and  English besides her native Tagalog and Kapampangan.

In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija of their own.

For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming.Suomalaisten runojen uskonto, Kaarle Krohn. p.165.

[[Magnetic flux quantum]]

CATEGORIES: Superconductivity, Quantum magnetism, Metrology, Physical constants

The magnetic flux [tpl]math|Φ[/tpl] threading some contour or loop is defined as the magnetic inductance [tpl]math|B[/tpl] multiplied by the loop area [tpl]math|A[/tpl], i.e. [tpl]math|Φ[tpl]=[/tpl]B×A[/tpl]. Obviously, both [tpl]math|B[/tpl] and [tpl]math|A[/tpl] can be arbitrary and so is [tpl]math|Φ[/tpl]. However, if one deals with the superconducting loop or a hole in a bulk superconductor, it turns out that the magnetic flux threading such a hole/loop is quantized'''.
The single magnetic flux quantum 
[tpl]math|Φ0[tpl]=[/tpl]h/(2e)≈[tpl]val|fmt=commas|2.067833758|(46)|e=-15|u=Wb[/tpl][/tpl] is a combination of fundamental physical constants: the Planck constant [tpl]math|h[/tpl] and the electron charge [tpl]math|e[/tpl]. Its value is, therefore, the same for any superconductor.
The phenomenon of flux quantization was discovered experimentally by B. S. Deaver and W. M. Fairbank and, independently, by R. Doll and M. Nabauer, in 1961. The quantization of magnetic flux is closely related to the Little–Parks effect, but was predicted earlier by Fritz London in 1948 using a phenomenological model.
The inverse of the flux quantum, 1/Φ0, is called the Josephson constant, and is denoted KJ. It is the constant of proportionality of the Josephson effect, relating the potential difference across a Josephson junction to the frequency of the irradiation. The Josephson effect is very widely used to provide a standard for high-precision measurements of potential difference, which (since 1990) have been related to a fixed, "conventional" value of the Josephson constant, denoted KJ–90.

Joseph "Erap" Ejército Estrada (born José Marcelo Ejército; April 19, 1937) is a Filipino politician who served as the thirteenth President of the Philippines from 1998 until 2001. Estrada was the first person in the present Fifth Republican period to be elected both President and Vice-President. He is currently the Mayor of the City of Manila, the country's capital, after the 2013 mid-term elections.http://www.philstar.com/election-2013/2013/05/14/942004/erap-wins-manila-mayoralty-race
Estrada gained popularity as a film actor, playing the lead role in over a hundred films in an acting career spanning some three decades. He used his popularity as an actor to make gains in politics, serving as mayor of San Juan for sixteen years, as Senator for one term, then as Vice-President under President Fidel V. Ramos.
Estrada was elected President in 1998 with a wide margin of votes separating him from the other challengers, and was sworn into the presidency on June 30, 1998. In 2000 he declared an "all-out-war" against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and captured its headquarters and other camps.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200007/10/eng20000710_45067.html |title=Philippine Military Takes Moro Headquarters |work=People's Daily |date=July 10, 2000 |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://hdn.org.ph/speech-of-former-president-estrada-on-the-grp-moro-conflict/ |title=Speech of Former President Estrada on the GRP-MORO Conflict – Philippine Human Development Network |publisher=Hdn.org.ph |accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl] However, allegations of corruption spawned an impeachment trial in the Senate, and in 2001 Estrada was ousted by "People Power 2" after the prosecution walked out of the impeachment court when the Senator Judges voted no in the opening of the second envelope.

[[Crash (computing)]]
CATEGORIES: Computer jargon, Computer errors, Software anomalies

A crash (or system crash) in computing is when a computer or a program (such as a software application or an operating system) stops functioning properly. Oftentimes, it will then exit after encountering these errors. The program responsible may appear to freeze until a  crash reporting service documents the details of the crash. If the program is a critical part of the operating system kernel, the entire computer may crash, often resulting in a fatal system error.
Many crashes are the result of the execution of single or multiple machine instructions. Typical causes are when the program counter is set to an incorrect address or a buffer overflow overwrites a portion of program code due to an earlier bug. In either case, it is common for the CPU to attempt to execute data or random memory values. Since all data values are possible but only some values are valid instructions, this often results in an illegal instruction exception. By chance, such data or random values could be valid (though unplanned) instructions. The original program problem (software bug) is considered as what "caused" the crash, but the actual fault was an illegal instruction. The art of debugging such crashes is connecting the actual cause of the crash with the code that set off the chain of events. This is often very far from obvious; the original bug is usually perfectly valid code to the processor.
In earlier personal computers, it was possible to cause hardware damage through attempting to write to hardware addresses outside of the system's main memory.
The execution of arbitrary data on a system will result in a breakup of screen display. This is widely considered a severe system crash.

[[Bus error]]

CATEGORIES: Memory management, Computer errors, Articles with example C code, Computer buses

In computing, a bus error is a fault raised by hardware, notifying an operating system (OS) that a process is trying to access memory that the CPU cannot physically address: an invalid address for the address bus, hence the name. In modern use on most architectures these are much rarer than segmentation faults, which occur primarily due to memory access violations: problems in the logical address or permissions.
On POSIX-compliant platforms, bus errors usually result in the SIGBUS signal being sent to the process that caused the error. SIGBUS can also be caused by any general device fault that the computer detects, though a bus error rarely means that the computer hardware is physically broken—it is normally caused by a bug in a program's source code.[tpl]citation-needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] Bus errors may also be raised for certain other paging errors; see below.

[[Truncated tetrahedron]]

CATEGORIES: Archimedean solids

In geometry, the truncated tetrahedron is an Archimedean solid. It has 4 regular hexagonal faces, 4 equilateral triangle faces, 12 vertices and 18 edges (of two types). It can be constructed by truncating all 4 vertices of a regular tetrahedron at one third of the original edge length.
A deeper truncation, removing a tetrahedron of half the original edge length from each vertex, is called rectification. The rectification of a tetrahedron produces an octahedron.[tpl]cite web |url=https://theory.org/geotopo/tt/html/truncatering.html |title=Truncated Trickery: Truncatering |first=Matt |last=Chisholm |first2=Jeremy |last2=Avnet |work=theory.org |year=1997 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl]

Henry William Bunbury (1750 – 7 May 1811) was an English caricaturist.
The second son of Sir William Bunbury, 5th Baronet (see Bunbury baronets), of Mildenhall, Suffolk, he came of an old Norman family.  He was educated at Westminster School and St Catharine's College, Cambridge, and soon showed a talent for drawing, especially for humorous subjects.[tpl]acad|id=BNBY768HW|name=Bunbury, Henry [/tpl]
His more serious efforts were no great success, but his caricatures are as famous as those of his contemporaries Thomas Rowlandson and James Gillray, good examples being his Country Club (1788), Barber's Shop (1803) and A Long Story (1782). He was a popular character, and the friend of most of the notabilities of his day, whom he never offended by attempting political satire; his easy circumstances and social position (he was colonel of the West Suffolk Militia, and was appointed equerry to the Duke of York in 1787) allowed him leisure to practise his talents.
His son Henry succeeded to the baronetcy.

[[Homeowner association]]
CATEGORIES: Housing, Types of organization, Neighborhood organizations, Community development, Community-based organizations

In the United States, a homeowner association is a corporation formed by a real estate developer for the purpose of marketing, managing, and selling of homes and lots in a residential subdivision.  It grants the developer privileged voting rights in governing the association, while allowing the developer to exit financial and legal responsibility of the organization, typically by transferring ownership of the association to the homeowners after selling off a predetermined number of lots. Membership in the homeowners association by a residential buyer is typically a condition of purchase; a buyer isn't given an option to reject it. Most homeowner associations are incorporated, and are subject to state statutes that govern non-profit corporations and homeowner associations. State oversight of homeowner associations is minimal, and varies from state to state. Some states, such as Florida and California, have a large body of homeowner association law, and some states, such as Massachusetts, have virtually no homeowner association law.
The fastest growing form of housing in the United States today is Common-interest development (CIDs), a category that includes planned-unit developments of single-family homes, condominiums, and cooperative apartments.[tpl]Cite book| first=Evan| last= McKenzie| title=Privatopia: Homeowner Associations and the Rise of Residential Private Governments| publisher= Yale University Press| isbn= 0-300-06638-4| pages= 7[/tpl] Since 1964, homeowner associations have become increasingly common in the USA.

George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney, KB (bap. 13 February 1718 – 24 May 1792) was a British naval officer.  He is best known for his commands in the American War of Independence, particularly his victory over the French at the Battle of the Saintes in 1782. It is often claimed that he was the commander to have pioneered the tactic of "breaking the line".
Rodney came from a distinguished but poor background, and went to sea at the age of fourteen. His first major action was the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747. He made a large amount of prize money during the 1740s, allowing him to purchase a large country estate and a seat in the House of Commons of Great Britain. During the Seven Years' War, Rodney was involved in a number of amphibious operations such as the raids on Rochefort and Le Havre and the Siege of Louisbourg. He became well known for his role in the capture of Martinique in 1762. Following the Peace of Paris, Rodney's financial situation stagnated. He spent large sums of money pursuing his political ambitions. By 1774 he had run up large debts and was forced to flee Britain to avoid his creditors. He ended up imprisoned in a French Jail, where he was when war was declared in 1778. Thanks to a benefactor, Rodney was able to secure his release and returned to Britain where he was appointed to a new command.
Rodney successfully relieved Gibraltar during the Great Siege and defeated a Spanish fleet during the 1780 Battle of Cape St. Vincent, known as the "Moonlight Battle" because it took place at night. He then was posted to the West Indies, where he became involved in the controversial 1781 capture of Sint Eustatius. Later that year he briefly returned home suffering from ill health. During his absence the British lost the crucial Battle of the Chesapeake leading to the surrender at Yorktown.
To some Rodney was a controversial figure, accused of an obsession with prize money and nepotism. This was brought to a head in the wake of his taking of Sint Eustatius for which he was heavily criticised in Britain. Orders for his recall had been sent when Rodney won a decisive victory at the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782, ending the French threat to Jamaica. On his return to Britain, Rodney was made a peer and was awarded an annual pension of £2,000. He lived in retirement until his death in 1792.
The use of Rodney as a first name originates with the admiral. It became a popular name for boys at the end of the eighteenth century.

(The French word comes from Latin caput and is a doublet with English "chief".) In English, the title "chef" in the culinary profession originated in the haute cuisine of the 19th century, that introduced many French words into the English language. Today a chef is any professional cook, regardless of rank. In non-English European languages, a "chef" is the head chef; others are "cooks."[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

[[Pattern matching]]
CATEGORIES: Pattern matching, Conditional constructs, Articles with example Haskell code, Functional programming

In computer science, pattern matching is the act of checking a perceived sequence of tokens for the presence of the constituents of some pattern. In contrast to pattern recognition, the match usually has to be exact.  The patterns generally have the form of either sequences or tree structures. Uses of pattern matching include outputting the locations (if any) of a pattern within a token sequence, to output some component of the matched pattern, and to substitute the matching pattern with some other token sequence (i.e., search and replace).
Sequence patterns (e.g., a text string) are often described using regular expressions and matched using techniques such as backtracking.
Tree patterns are used in some programming languages as a general tool to process data based on its structure, e.g., Haskell, ML and the symbolic mathematics language Mathematica have special syntax for expressing tree patterns and a language construct for conditional execution and value retrieval based on it. For simplicity and efficiency reasons, these tree patterns lack some features that are available in regular expressions.
Often it is possible to give alternative patterns that are tried one by one, which yields a powerful conditional programming construct.  Pattern matching sometimes include support for guards.
Term rewriting and graph rewriting languages rely on pattern matching for the fundamental way a program evaluates into a result.

[[Type inference]]

CATEGORIES: Type systems, Type theory, Inference, Type inference

Type inference refers to the automatic deduction of the type of an expression in a programming language. If some, but not all, type annotations are already present it is referred to as type reconstruction. The opposite operation of type inference is called type erasure.
It is a feature present in some strongly statically typed languages. It is often characteristic of, but not limited to, functional programming languages in general. Some languages that include type inference are ML, OCaml, F#, Haskell, Scala, D, Clean, and Opa. It has lately been added (to some extent) to Visual Basic (starting with version 9.0), C# (starting with version 3.0) and  C++11. It is also planned for Perl 6. The ability to infer types automatically makes many programming tasks easier, leaving the programmer free to omit type annotations while still permitting type checking.

Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orléans (13 April 1747 – 6 November 1793) commonly known as Philippe, was a member of a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, the ruling dynasty of France. He actively supported the French Revolution and adopted the name Philippe Égalité, but was nonetheless guillotined during the Reign of Terror. His son Louis-Philippe became King of the French after the July Revolution of 1830. Following his career, the term Orléanist came to be attached to the movement in France that favoured constitutional monarchy.

[[Type variable]]

CATEGORIES: Functional programming

In type theory and programming languages, a type variable is a mathematical variable ranging over types. Even in programming languages that allow mutable variables, a type variable remains an abstraction, in the sense that it does not correspond to some memory locations.
Programming languages that support parametric polymorphism make use of universally quantified type variables. Languages that support existential types make use of existentially quantified type variables. For example, the following OCaml code defines a polymorphic identity function that has a universally quantified type, which is printed by the interpreter on the 2nd line:
 # let id x = x ;;
 val id : 'a -> 'a = <fun>

It promotes the game in Oceania and allows the member nations to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.
Of the six worldwide confederations, the OFC is by far the smallest and is predominantly made up of island nations where football is not the most popular sport. Consequently, the OFC has little influence in the wider football world, either in terms of international competition or as a source of players for high-profile club competitions. In 2006, the OFC's largest and most successful nation, Australia, left to join the Asian Football Confederation, leaving New Zealand as the largest federation within the OFC.

Alexandre-Théodore-Victor, comte de Lameth (20 October 1760 – 18 March 1829) was a French soldier and politician.
He was born in Paris.  Having served in the American War of Independence under Rochambeau, he was sent in 1789 as deputy to the States-General by the nobles of the bailliage of Péronne, Somme. In the Constituent Assembly he formed with Barnave and Adrien Duport a "Triumvirate," which controlled a group of about forty deputies forming the advanced left of the Assembly. He presented a famous report in the Constituent Assembly on the organization of the army, but is better known by his eloquent speech on 28 February 1791, at the Jacobin Club, against Honoré Mirabeau, whose relations with the court were beginning to be suspected, and who was a personal enemy of Lameth. However, after the flight of Louis XVI to Varennes, Lameth became reconciled with the court. With Barnave and Duport he became a leader of the Feuillant faction, supporting the Constitution of 1791 and the continuation of the monarchy. He served in the army as maréchal-de-camp under Nicolas Luckner and the Marquis de la Fayette, but was accused of treason on 15 August 1792, fled the country, and was imprisoned by the Austrians.
After his release he went into business at Hamburg with his brother Charles and the duc d'Aiguillon, and did not return to France until the Consulate. Under the Empire he was made prefect successively in several departments, and in 1810 was created a baron. In 1814 he attached himself to the Bourbons, and under the Restoration was appointed prefect of Somme, deputy for Seine-Inférieure and finally deputy for Seine-et-Oise, in which capacity he was a leader of the Liberal opposition. He was the author of an important History of the Constituent Assembly (Paris, 2 vols., 1828–1829).
He had two brothers, Théodore Lameth (1756–1854) who served in the American war, sat in the Legislative Assembly as deputy from the department of Jura, and became maréchal-de-camp; and Charles Malo François Lameth.

[[Cokernel]]

CATEGORIES: Abstract algebra, Category theory, Isomorphism theorems

In mathematics, the cokernel of a linear mapping of vector spaces f : X → Y is the quotient space Y/im(f) of the codomain of f by the image of f. The dimension of the cokernel is called the corank of f.
Cokernels are dual to the kernels of category theory, hence the name: the kernel is a subobject of the domain (it maps to the domain), while the cokernel is a quotient object of the codomain (it maps from the codomain).
the cokernel measures the constraints that y must satisfy for this equation to have a solution – the obstructions to a solution – while the kernel measures the degrees of freedom in a solution, if one exists. This is elaborated in intuition, below.
More generally, the cokernel of a morphism f : X → Y in some category (e.g. a homomorphism between groups or a bounded linear operator between Hilbert spaces) is an object Q and a morphism q : Y → Q such that the composition q f is the zero morphism of the category, and furthermore q is universal with respect to this property. Often the map q is understood, and Q itself is called the cokernel of f.
In many situations in abstract algebra, such as for abelian groups, vector spaces or modules, the cokernel of the homomorphism f : X → Y is the quotient of Y by the image of f. In topological settings, such as with bounded linear operators between Hilbert spaces, one typically has to take the closure of the image before passing to the quotient.

Malays ([tpl]lang-ms|Melayu[/tpl] Jawi: ملايو) are an ethnic group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula, eastern Sumatra,  southernmost parts of Thailand, south coast Burma, island of Singapore, coastal Borneo including  Brunei, West Kalimantan, and coastal Sarawak and Sabah, and the smaller islands which lie between these locations - that collectively known as the Alam Melayu. These locations today are part of the modern nations of Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Burma and Thailand.
There is considerable genetic, linguistic, cultural, and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups, mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within Maritime Southeast Asia. Historically, the Malays population is descended primarily from the earlier Malayic-speaking tribes that settled in the region, who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms, notably Brunei, Old Kedah, Langkasuka, Gangga Negara, Old Kelantan, Negara Sri Dharmaraja, Malayu and Srivijaya,[tpl]harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=24, 33[/tpl] and the later Cham and Mon-Khmer settlers.[tpl]harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=7&60[/tpl]
The advent of the Melaka Sultanate in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history, the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy. Common definitive markers of a Malay identity - the religion of Islam, the Malay language and traditions - are thought to have been promulgated during this era, resulting in the ethnogenesis of the Malay as a major  ethnoreligious group in the region.[tpl]harvnb|Melayu Online|2005[/tpl] In literature, architecture, culinary traditions, traditional dress, performing arts, martial arts, and royal court traditions, Melaka set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated. The golden age of the Malay sultanates in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo saw many of their inhabitants, particularly from various tribal communities like the Batak, Dayak, Orang Asli and the Orang laut become subject to Islamisation and Malayisation.[tpl]harvnb|Milner|2010|p=200&232[/tpl] Today, some Malays have recent forbears from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, termed as anak dagang ("traders") and who predominantly consist of Javanese, Bugis,  Minangkabau and Acehnese peoples, while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other countries.[tpl]harvnb|Milner|2010|p=10 & 185[/tpl]
Throughout their history, the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics.[tpl]harvnb|Milner|2010|p=131[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Barnard|2004|pp=7, 32, 33 & 43[/tpl] They absorbed numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups, such as those of Minang, Acehnese, and to some degree Javanese culture; however Malay culture differs by being more overtly Islamic than the multi-religious Javanese culture. Ethnic Malays are also the major source of the ethnocultural development of the related Betawi, Banjar and Peranakan cultures, as well as the development of Malay trade and creole languages like Ambonese Malay, Baba Malay, Betawi Malay and Manado Malay.

In mathematics, a Fredholm operator is an operator that arises in the Fredholm theory of integral equations. It is named in honour of Erik Ivar Fredholm.
A Fredholm operator is a bounded linear operator between two Banach spaces whose kernel and cokernel are finite-dimensional and whose range is closed. (The last condition is actually redundant.Yuri A. Abramovich and Charalambos D. Aliprantis, "An Invitation to Operator Theory", p.156) Equivalently, an operator T : X → Y is Fredholm if it is invertible modulo compact operators, i.e., if there exists a bounded linear operator

Antoine de Rivarol (26 June 1753 – 11 April 1801) was a Royalist French writer during the Revolutionary era.
Rivarol was born in Bagnols, Languedoc. It appears that his father, an innkeeper, was a cultivated man. The son assumed the title of comte de Rivarol, asserting a connection with a noble Italian family, but his enemies said his name was really Riverot and that he was not of a noble family. After various vicissitudes, he went to Paris in 1777 and won some academic prizes. In 1784, his Discours sur l'universalité de la langue française and his translation of Dante's Inferno were favourably noted. The year before the French Revolution broke out, he and a certain Champcenetz published a lampoon, titled Petit Almanach de nos grands hommes pour 1788, that ridiculed without pity a number of writers of proven or future talent, along with a great many nobodies."Antoine de Rivarol," Nation 32.834 (23 June 1881): 438–439.
Rivarol was the foremost journalist, commentator and epigrammatist among that faction of aristocrats which was most uncompromisingly reactionary: he heaped scorn upon republicanism and defended the Ancien Régime.[tpl]Cite book |title=The French Revolution |last=Lefebvre |first=Georges |year=1962 |volume=1 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn= |page=141 |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl]
Rivarol's writing was published in the Journal politique of Antoine Sabatier de Castres and the Actes des Apotres of Jean Gabriel Peltier. He left France in 1792, first settling in Brussels, then moving successively to London, Hamburg, and Berlin, where he died .
Rivarol's rivals in France – in sharp conversational sayings – included Alexis Piron and Nicolas Chamfort.
His brother, Claude François (1762–1848), was also an author. His works include a novel, Isman, ou le fatalisme (1795); a comedy, Le Véridique (1827); and the history Essai sur les causes de la révolution française (1827).

United Torah Judaism ([tpl]lang-he-n|יַהֲדוּת הַתּוֹרָה הַמְאוּחֶדֶת[/tpl], Yahadut HaTorah HaMeukhedet; UTJ) is an alliance of Degel HaTorah and Agudat Israel, two small Israeli Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) political parties in the Knesset. It was first formed in 1992.
The two parties have not always agreed with each other about policy matters. However, over the years they have cooperated and united as a voting bloc in order to win the maximum number of seats in the Knesset, since many extra votes can be wasted if election thresholds are not attained under Israel's proportional representation parliamentary system.
When UTJ joined Ariel Sharon's coalition in 2004 it split into its two constituent factions of Degel HaTorah and Agudat Israel. Before the 2006 election, Degel HaTorah and Agudat Israel agreed to revive their alliance under the banner of United Torah Judaism to not waste votes and achieve maximum representation in the 17th Knesset.
The party won 5 seats in the 18th Knesset elections in 2009 and 7 seats in the 19th Knesset elections in 2013.

Pa Hin Ngam ([tpl]lang-th|ป่าหินงาม[/tpl]) is a National Park in Chaiyaphum province in Thailand. The name Hin Ngam means beautiful stone, where Pa means forest.
In 1985, the Tep Satit Forestry Department first surveyed the area, long popular with the locals, and recommended its protection. In October 1986, the Pa Hin Ngam Park was created, covering 10 km² around the strange rock formations which gave the park its name. In 1993, the Forestry Department of Thailand conducted a more thorough survey including the surrounding area, and recommended that it become a national park. The national park covering 112 km² was created on September 19, 1994, which was officially gazetted in 2007.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=124|issue=26 ก|pages=26–29|title=พระราชกฤษฎีกากำหนดบริเวณที่ดินป่านายางกลัก ในท้องที่ตำบลโป่งนก ตำบลนายางกลัก ตำบลบ้านไร่ ตำบลวะตะแบก อำเภอเทพสถิต และตำบลซับใหญ่ กิ่งอำเภอซับใหญ่ อำเภอจัตุรัส จังหวัดชัยภูมิ ให้เป็นอุทยานแห่งชาติ พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๐|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2550/A/026/26.PDF|format=PDF|date=June 6, 2007|language=Thai[/tpl]
The park is located at the boundary of the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains and the Khorat Plateau. The steep cliff at the 846 m high Sut Phan Din viewpoint allows a great view into a valley of the Sonthi River and the Sap Langka Wildlife Sanctuary. The name Sut Phan Din (สุดแผ่นดิน) means end of land, reflecting the steepness of the cliff. This cliff also marks the watershed between the Chao Phraya and the Mekong rivers.
Near the viewpoint is one of the fields of the Siam Tulip (Curcuma alismatifolia), called Dok Kra Jiao (ดอกกระเจียว) in Thai. The dipterocarp forests bloom with the purple flowers at the beginning of the raining season in July.
The park got its name from the strange rock formations in the Hin Ngam Rock Ground, located at the western end of the park. Erosion has carved several large rocks into striking and unusual shapes.

[[W Ursae Majoris]]

CATEGORIES: W Ursae Majoris variables, Ursa Major (constellation), F-type main-sequence stars, Objects named with variable star designations, Henry Draper Catalogue objects

W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) is the variable star designation for a binary star system in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It has an apparent visual magnitude of about 7.9, which is too faint to be seen with the naked eye. However, it can be viewed with a small telescope. Parallax measurements place it at a distance of roughly 170 light years (53 parsecs) from the Earth.
In 1903, the luminosity of this system was found to vary by the German astronomers Gustav Müller and Paul Kempf. It has since become the prototype and eponym for a class of variable stars called W Ursae Majoris variables. This system consists of a pair of stars in a tight, circular orbit with a period of 0.3336 days, or eight hours and 23 seconds. During every orbital cycle, each star eclipses the other, resulting in a decrease in magnitude. The maximum magnitude of the pair is 7.75. During the eclipse of the primary, the net magnitude drops by 0.73, while the eclipse of the secondary causes a magnitude decrease of 0.68. Unlike normal eclipsing binaries, the contact nature makes it impossible to precisely tell when an eclipse of one component by the other starts or ends.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
The two stars in W Ursae Majoris are so close together that their outer envelopes are in direct contact. Hence they have the same stellar classification of F8Vp, which matches the spectrum of a main sequence star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen. However, the primary component has a larger mass and radius than the secondary, with 1.19 times the Sun's mass and 1.08 times the Sun's radius. The secondary has 0.57 solar masses and 0.78 solar radii.
The orbital period of the system has changed since 1903, which may be the result of mass transfer or the braking effects of magnetic fields. Star spots have been observed on the surface of the stars and strong X-ray emissions have been detected, indicating a high level of magnetic activity that is common to W Uma variables. This magnetic activity may play a role in regulating the timing and magnitude of mass transfer occurs.
W Ursae Majoris has a 12th magnitude companion star with the designation ADS 7494B. They may be moving together through space.

Ibrahim Pasha (1789 – November 10, 1848) was the eldest son of Muhammad Ali, the Wāli and unrecognised Khedive of Egypt and Sudan. He served as a general in the Egyptian army that his father established during his reign, taking his first command of Egyptian forces was when he was merely a teenager. In the final year of his life, he succeeded his still living father as ruler of Egypt and Sudan, due to the latter's ill health. His rule also extended over the other dominions that his father had brought under Egyptian rule, namely Syria, Hejaz, Morea, Thasos, and Crete. Ibrahim pre-deceased his father, dying 10 November 1848, only four months after acceding to the throne. Upon his father's death the following year, the Egyptian throne passed to Ibrahim's nephew (son of Muhammad Ali's second oldest son), Abbas.
Ibrahim remains one of the most celebrated members of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, particularly for his impressive military victories, including several crushing defeats of the Ottoman Empire. Among Egyptian historians, he, along with his father, Muhammad Ali, his son, Ismail the Magnificent, and his great-grandson Abbas II, is held in far higher esteem than other rulers from the dynasty, who were largely viewed as indolent and corrupt. Today, a statue of Ibrahim occupies a prominent position in Egypt's capital, Cairo.

James Sayers (or Sayer) (1748 - April 20, 1823) was an English caricaturist.
He was born at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the son of a merchant captain.  He began as clerk in an attorney's office, and was for a time a member of the borough council. In 1780 his father's death provided him with a small fortune, and he went to London. As a political caricaturist he supported William Pitt the Younger. His plate of "Carlo Khan's triumphal entry into Leadenhall Street" was admitted by Charles James Fox, against whom it was directed, to have damaged his public image. Sayer was always at his best when attacking Fox, whose strong features he portrayed with remarkable power, always so as to make them convey expressions of defiant impudence or anger. Pitt, not known as a patron of the arts, provided Sayer with a place as marshal of the Exchequer court. He died in Curzon Street, Mayfair. 
Sayer's "Carlo Khan" has been frequently reproduced. But he can only be judged with confidence after examining the collection in the British Museum, or other public libraries. His drawings, made originally with pencil on oil paper, were etched for him by the Brethertons. They were then sold in collections of the size of a large octavo copybook, under such titles as Illustrious Heads (1794) or Outlines of the Opposition (1795).  Sayer left a complete gallery of small full-length pictures of the public men of his time, slightly caricatured. In his large plates he is inferior to James Gillray, and he never has the grace of Thomas Rowlandson, but he was closer to the truth than either.

Stanley Frank "Stan" Musial ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|juː|z|i|ə|l[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|juː|ʒ|əl[/tpl]; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013) was an American professional baseball player and Navy veteran of World War II. He was a Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman on the St. Louis Cardinals for 22 seasons, from 1941 through 1963. Nicknamed "Stan the Man", Musial is widely considered to be one of the greatest hitters in baseball history."Stan Musial: An American Life", Amazon.com, review of George Vecsey's "Stan Musial: An American Life" (ESPN: May 10, 2011). Retrieved May 18, 2011 He compiled 3,630 career hits, ranking fourth all-time and first in a career spent with only one team. With 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 on the road, he also is considered to be the most consistent hitter of his era. He hit 475 home runs during his career, was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times, and won three World Series championship titles. He shares the MLB record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.Sportsdata. Midsummer Classics: Celebrating MLB's All-Star Game.

Retrieved July 21, 2013 http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rb_asm.shtml Musial was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969.  He was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball, whether informally or in organized settings, eventually playing on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star roster for the first time; he would appear in every All-Star game (MLB had two games from 1959 to 1962) in every subsequent season he played. Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving with the United States Navy.
On his return to baseball in 1946, Musial resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run shy of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

The Viceroyalty of Peru ([tpl]lang-es|Virreinato del Perú|links=no[/tpl]) was a Spanish colonial administrative district, created in 1542, that originally contained most of Spanish-ruled South America, governed from the capital of Lima. The Viceroyalty of Peru was one of the two Spanish Viceroyalties in the Americas from the sixteenth to the eighteenth  centuries.  
However, the Spanish did not resist the Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian. The Treaty of Tordesillas was rendered meaningless between 1580 and 1640 while Spain controlled Portugal. The creation of Viceroyalties of New Granada and Rio de la Plata (at the expense of Peru's territory) reduced the importance of Lima and shifted the lucrative Andean trade to Buenos Aires, while the fall of the mining and textile production accelerated the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Eventually, the viceroyalty would dissolve, as with much of the Spanish empire, when challenged by national independence movements at the beginning of the nineteenth century. These movements led to the formation of the modern-day countries of Peru, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago in the territories that at one point or another had constituted the Viceroyalty of Peru.

), formerly Glasgow Abbotsinch Airport, is an international airport in Scotland, located [tpl]convert|6|NM|lk=in[/tpl] west of Glasgow city centre, near the towns of Paisley and Renfrew in Renfrewshire. In 2013 the airport handled nearly 7.4 million passengers, a 2.9% annual increase, making it the second busiest in Scotland, after Edinburgh Airport, and the eighth busiest airport in the United Kingdom.  It is the primary airport serving the Greater Glasgow conurbation and is the principal transatlantic and direct longhaul entry airport into Scotland.
The airport is owned and operated by Heathrow Airport Holdings (formerly BAA), which also owns and operates three other UK airports,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.baa.com/about-baa/who-we-are | title = Who we are | publisher = Heathrow Airport Holdings | year = 2013 | accessdate = 28 January 2013[/tpl] and is itself owned by FGP TopCo Limited, an international consortium, which includes Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and GIC Special Investments, that is led by the Spanish Ferrovial Group.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.baa.com/about-baa/who-we-are/who-owns-us | title = Who owns us | publisher = Heathrow Airport Holdings | year = 2013 | accessdate = 28 January 2013[/tpl] The airport's largest tenants are British Airways and Loganair (currently franchising using Flybe), the latter using it as a hub. Other major airlines using GLA as a base include Flybe,  EasyJet, Jet2, Thomas Cook Airlines and Thomson Airways.
Glasgow Airport was first opened in 1966 and originally only facilitated flights to other places in the United Kingdom and Europe. The British Airports Authority (BAA) took control of the airport in 1975 and when BAA was privatised in the 1980s, Glasgow Airport began to offer flights to other places around the world, flights which previously were facilitated by Glasgow Prestwick Airport, which was subsequently relegated as the city's secondary airport catering for low cost airlines and charter operators.

White-eyes inhabit most tropical islands in the Indian Ocean, the western Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of Guinea. Discounting some widespread members of the genus Zosterops, most species are endemic to single islands or archipelagos. The Silvereye, Zosterops lateralis, naturally colonised New Zealand, where it is known as the "Wax-eye" or Tauhau ("stranger"), from 1855. The Silvereye has also been introduced to the Society Islands in French Polynesia, while the Japanese White-eye has been introduced to Hawaii.

CATEGORIES: R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company brands, 1988 introductions

Premier was a smokeless cigarette released in the United States in 1988 by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. It worked by heating and aerosolizing tobacco flavour and was intended to reduce or eliminate the unhealthy side effects associated with smoking, both to the smoker and to the people around the smoker.[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl]
The project took several years to develop at a cost of more than $325 million.[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl]
While RJR itself questioned whether the device functioned adequately as a nicotine delivery device, activists derided it for its potential for use in delivery of other drugs.[tpl]cn|date=July 2012[/tpl] It never achieved popularity, as smokers complained about a charcoal-like aftertaste, and although it looked like a conventional cigarette, special instructions were required to teach smokers how to light it. RJR estimated that it would take two or three packs for a smoker to acquire a taste for Premier, but in practice many smokers only smoked one cigarette and shared the rest of the pack. It was withdrawn from the market in 1989, less than a year after its introduction.
R.J. Reynolds reintroduced the concept behind the Premier cigarette as the Eclipse brand in the 1990s.

 Palden Thondup Namgyal (May 23, 1923 – January 29, 1982) was the 12th and last Chogyal (king) of Sikkim.
At six, Namgyal became a student at St. Joseph's Convent in Kalimpong, but had to terminate his studies due to attacks of malaria. From age eight to eleven he studied under his uncle, Rimpoche Lhatsun, in order to be ordained a Buddhist monk; he was subsequently recognised as the reincarnated leader of both Phodong and Rumtek monasteries.  He later continued his studies at Saint Joseph's College in Darjeeling and finally graduated from Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, in 1941.
Namgyal served as adviser for internal affairs for his father, Sir Tashi Namgyal, the 11th Chogyal, and led the negotiating team which established Sikkim's relationship to India after independence in 1949.

[[Vote pairing]]

CATEGORIES: Elections

Vote pairing occurs when two people commit to voting in a mutually agreed upon manner. Vote swapping is a common example of vote pairing, where a voter in one district agrees to vote tactically for a less-preferred candidate or party who has a greater chance of winning in their district, in exchange for a voter from another district voting tactically for the candidate the first voter prefers, because that candidate has a greater possibility of winning in that district.
Vote pairing occurs informally (i.e., without binding contracts) but sometimes with great sophistication in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and other places.
In the UK and Australia, pairing is the mechanism by which two members of parliament of opposing parties agree, with the consent of their party whips, to abstain from voting if the other one is unable to vote. Thus maintaining the balance, of votes if one or the other is unable to attend. A Three line whip would  usually be  excepted from this agreement. For MPs who are not paired a bisque, a rota system allowing absence is used.
Using UK elections as an example, tactical voting is often between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. There may be one constituency in which the Labour Party and the Conservative Party candidates are running in a tight race, with the Liberal Democrat far behind. In another constituency, the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates may be in a tight race, with the Labour candidate far behind. A Liberal Democrat voter in the first constituency would agree to vote for the Labour candidate in exchange for a Labour voter from the second constituency voting for the Liberal Democrat candidate.
Tactical voting has been used since 2000 as a strategy for the U.S. presidential election, with voters from "safe" states, or nonswing states, voting for third-party candidates, and voters from states with contested races, or swing state, voting for the second-preference candidate of the voters from the third party. By the United States Electoral College for presidential elections, all of a state's votes go to the winning candidate for that state, no matter how close the margin was (Maine and Nebraska excepted). Often third-party candidates for president are unable to garner any Electoral College votes, but they can call attention to their causes by the total popular vote that they garner. In vote-pairing agreements, third-party supporters in swing states vote strategically with major-party supporters in nonswing states, so that the third party candidate can hopefully get more of the popular vote, while the major-party candidate can get more of the Electoral College vote.

[[Fire hydrant]]

CATEGORIES: Firefighting equipment, Water industry, Street furniture

A fire hydrant is an active fire protection measure, and a source of water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire.
The concept of fire plugs dates to at least the 17th century. This was a time when firefighters responding to a call would dig down to the wooden water mains and hastily bore a hole to secure water to fight fires. The water would fill the hole creating a temporary well, and be transported from the well to the fire by bucket brigades or, later, by hand-pumped fire engines. The holes were then plugged with stoppers, normally redwood, which over time came to be known as fire plugs. The location of the plug would often be recorded or marked so that it could be reused in future fires. This is the source of the colloquial term fire plug still used for fire hydrants today. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, the city installed water mains with holes drilled at intervals, equipped with risers, allowing an access point to the wooden fire plugs from street level.Shaw, Eyre Massey Fire Protection, a Complete Manual of the Organization, Machinery, Discipline, and General Workings of the Fire Brigade of London 1876.

The invention of a post- or pillar-type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr., Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801. It had a combination hose/faucet outlet and was of "wet barrel" design with the valve in the top. It is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant, but this cannot be verified because the patent office in Washington D.C. caught on fire in 1836 destroying many patent records from that period in the process.[tpl]cite web |title=A Brief History of the Hydrant |work=Fire Hydrant.org |url=http://www.firehydrant.org/pictures/hydrant_history.html [/tpl]

Jean Baptiste Charles Henri Hector, comte  d'Estaing (24 November 1729 – 28 April 1794) was a French general, and admiral. He began his service as a soldier in the War of the Austrian Succession, briefly spending time as a prisoner of war of the British during the Seven Years' War.  Naval exploits during the latter war prompted him to change branches of service, and he transferred to the French Navy.
Following France's entry into the American War of Independence in 1778, he led a fleet to aid the American rebels. He participated in a failed Franco-American siege of Newport, Rhode Island in 1778 and the equally unsuccessful 1779 Siege of Savannah before returning to France in 1780.  His difficulties working with American counterparts are cited among the reasons these operations failed.
Although he sympathized with revolutionaries during the French Revolution, he held a personal loyalty to the French royal family.  Because of this he came under suspicion, and was executed by guillotine in the Reign of Terror.

[[Numerical digit]]

CATEGORIES: Numeral systems

A digit is a type of symbol (a numeral symbol, such as "2" or "5") used in combinations (such as "25") to represent numbers (such as the number 25) in positional numeral systems. The name "digit" comes from the fact that the 10 digits (ancient Latin digiti meaning fingers) of the hands correspond to the 10 symbols of the common base 10 number system, i.e. the decimal (ancient Latin adjective dec. meaning ten) digits.
In a given number system, if the base is an integer, the number of digits required is always equal to the absolute value of the base. For example, the decimal system (base 10) has ten digits (0 through to 9), whereas binary (base 2) has two digits (0 and 1).

The Office was instituted by the Instrument of Government of 1634, which divided Sweden into Counties and the Over-Governorship of Stockholm. The Stockholm County was established in 1714 but the actual City was not integrated until 1967 when the Over-Governor's Office was abolished.

[[Program music]]
CATEGORIES: Musical terminology, Musical form

Program music or programme music is a type of art music that attempts to musically render an extra-musical narrative. The narrative itself might be offered to the audience in the form of program notes, inviting imaginative correlations with the music.  A paradigmatic example is Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, which relates a drug-induced series of morbid fantasies concerning the unrequited love of a sensitive poet involving murder, execution, and the torments of Hell. The genre culminates in the symphonic works of Richard Strauss that include narrations of the adventures of Don Quixote, Till Eulenspiegel, the composer's domestic life, and an interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy of the Superman. Following Strauss, the genre declined and new works with explicitly narrative content are rare. Nevertheless the genre continues to exert an influence on film music, especially where this draws upon the techniques of late romantic music.
The term is almost exclusively applied to works in the European classical music tradition, particularly those from the Romantic music period of the 19th century, during which the concept was popular, but pieces which fit the description have long been a part of music. The term is usually reserved for purely instrumental works (pieces without singers and lyrics), and not used, for example for Opera or Lieder. Single movement orchestral pieces of program music are often called symphonic poems.
Absolute music, in contrast, is intended to be appreciated without any particular reference to the outside world.

CATEGORIES: Romanization of Korean

McCune–Reischauer romanization is one of the two most widely used Korean language romanization systems, along with the Revised Romanization of Korean, which replaced (a modified) McCune–Reischauer as the official romanization system in South Korea in 2000. A variant of McCune–Reischauer is used as the official system in North Korea.
The system was created in 1937 by two European-descended Americans, George M. McCune and Edwin O. Reischauer. With a few exceptions, it does not attempt to transliterate Korean text but rather to represent the phonetic pronunciation.  McCune–Reischauer is widely used outside of Korea.  A variant of it was used as the official romanization system in South Korea from 1984 to 2000.  A third system — the Yale Romanization system, which is a transliteration system — exists, but is used only in academic literature, especially in linguistics. During the period of Russian interest in Korea at the beginning of the 20th century, attempts were also made at representing Korean in Cyrillic.

[[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Elizabeth II flags, Personal flags of the United Kingdom, British monarchy

The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is the flag used by Elizabeth II in her capacity as Sovereign of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. Different standards are used in the Queen's other realms, and the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is varied for use in Scotland.
Although almost universally called a standard, such flags when used in the United Kingdom are banners of arms, as they comprise the shield of the Royal Arms. Outside the United Kingdom, the Royal Standard is usually a nation's banner of arms with a blue disc containing a wreath of gold roses encircling the crowned letter 'E', (for 'Elizabeth'), superimposed upon it (the Personal Flag of Queen Elizabeth II).
The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is flown when the Queen is in residence in one of the royal palaces and on her car during official journeys.  It may be flown on any building, official or private, during a visit by the Queen, if the owner or proprietor so requests. The Royal Standard was flown aboard the royal yacht when it was in service and the Queen was on board. The only church that may fly a Royal Standard, even without the presence of the Sovereign, is Westminster Abbey, a Royal Peculiar.
The Royal Standard is flown at royal residences only when the sovereign is present. If the Union Flag flies above Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle it signals that the Queen is not in residence. In 1934, King George V permitted his subjects in Scotland to display the ancient Royal Standard of Scotland as part of his silver jubilee.  Today, it flies above Holyrood Palace and Balmoral Castle when the Queen is not in residence.
When the Queen attends the Parliament at the Palace of Westminster, the Royal Standard flies from Victoria Tower.
Unlike the Union Flag, the Royal Standard is never flown at half–mast, even after the demise of the Crown, as there is always a sovereign on the throne.[tpl]cite web| title=Royal Standard| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/RoyalStandard.aspx| publisher=The Royal Household| accessdate=2013-12-27[/tpl] 
Controversy arose regarding the lack of a flag at half–mast over Buckingham Palace following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.  The Queen was then in summer residence at Balmoral; and according to established custom, no flag was displayed over Buckingham Palace, as the monarch was not present.  The Queen proposed a compromise whereby the Union Flag would be flown at half–mast on the day of Diana's funeral.[tpl]cite news| title=Blair Defends Royal Family Against Criticism| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/diana/royal1.html| date=4 September 1997| work=BBC News| publisher=bbc.co.uk| accessdate=2013-12-27[/tpl]   Since then, the Union Flag has flown regularly in the Queen's absence and has been lowered to half–mast to mark several occasions such as the death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,[tpl]cite news| title=Crowds Grieve for Queen Mother| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1902781.stm| work=BBC News| publisher=bbc.co.uk| accessdate=2013-12-27[/tpl]  the September 11 attacks and the 7 July 2005 London bombings.[tpl]cite news| title=London bombings toll rises to 37| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4661059.stm| work=BBC News| publisher=bbc.co.uk| accessdate=2013-12-27[/tpl]  The Union Flag was also flown at half–mast over Buckingham Palace as a mark of respect on the first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on Bank Holiday, Monday, 31 August 1998.

John Ford (February 1, 1894 – August 31, 1973) was an Irish-American film director. He was famous for both his Westerns such as Stagecoach, The Searchers, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and adaptations of such classic 20th-century American novels as The Grapes of Wrath. His four Academy Awards for Best Director (1935, 1940, 1941, 1952) are a record, and one of those films, How Green Was My Valley, also won Best Picture.
In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Ford directed more than 140 films (although nearly all of his silent films are now lost) and he is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential film-makers of his generation.Gallagher, Tag John Ford: The Man and his Films (University of California Press, 1984), 'Preface' Ford's films and personality were held in high regard by his colleagues, with Orson Welles and Ingmar Bergman among those who have named him as one of the greatest directors of all time.

[tpl]Audio|sv-Tage_Erlander.ogg|Tage Fritiof Erlander[/tpl] (13 June 1901 – 21 June 1985) was a Swedish politician who served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1946 to 1969. He was the leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and led the government for an uninterrupted tenure of 23 years, one of the longest in any democracy. This led to the popular expression "Sweden's longest Prime Minister" referring to both his physical stature and tenure (the Swedish word lång meaning both long and tall).Wilsford, David. Political Leaders of Contemporary Western Europe: A Biographical Dictionary. Greenwood, 1995, p. 125.
Ascending to the World War II coalition government in 1944, Erlander rose unexpectedly to leadership upon the death of Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson in October 1946, maintaining the position of the Social Democratic Party as the dominant party in the country. Known for his moderation, pragmatism and self-irony, Erlander often sought approval from the liberal-conservative opposition for his policies, de facto dropping all pretences of wide-scale nationalizations whilst introducing reforms such as universal health insurance, pension additions and a growing public sector while stopping short of raising tax levels above the average OECD levels at the time. Until the 1960s, income taxes were lower in Sweden than in the United States.[tpl]cite web|author=BY JONATHAN COHN @citizencohn |url=http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/88856/sweden-denmark-us-high-taxes-welfare# |title=More evidence from Europe, particularly Scandinavia, suggests that U.S. taxes can rise without hurting the economy. |publisher=New Republic |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2013-11-23[/tpl]
For most of his time in power, Erlander ran a minority government of the Social Democrats. From 1951 to 1957, he instead ran a coalition with the Farmers' League.[tpl]cite web|author=Dick Erixon |url=http://web.comhem.se/dier/Swedish%20Prime%20Ministers.htm |title=Swedish Prime Ministers in history |publisher=Web.comhem.se |date=2006-09-20 |accessdate=2013-11-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ne.se/lang/tage-erlander |title=Tage Erlander |publisher=Nationalencyklopedin |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23 |language=[tpl]se icon[/tpl][/tpl] The Social Democrats held a majority of seats in the upper house for most of this time and this allowed Erlander to remain in power after the 1956 general election, when the right-wing parties won a majority. A snap election in 1958 then reversed this result.
In foreign policy, he initially sought an alliance of Nordic countries, but without success, instead maintaining strict neutrality while building up among the most impressive armed forces in the world (surpassed only by the United States, the Soviet Union and Israel in terms of per-capita spending), making the Swedish Air Force the third largest in the world, while ultimately rejecting nuclear capability, signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1968. Erlander's mandate coincided with the post-World War II economic expansion, in Sweden known as the record years, in which Sweden saw its economy grow to one of the ten strongest in the world, and subsequently joined of the G10.
In the 1968 general election, he won his seventh and most successful victory, with the Social Democrats winning an absolute majority of the popular vote and seats in the lower chamber. Erlander resigned the following year during a process of major constitutional reform and was succeeded by his long-time protégé and friend Olof Palme.

International Women's Day (IWD), also called International Working Women's Day, is celebrated on March 8 every year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html | title=UN WomenWatch: International Women's Day – History | publisher=UN.org | accessdate=2013-02-21[/tpl] In different regions the focus of the celebrations ranges from general celebration of respect, appreciation and love towards women to a celebration for women's economic, political, and social achievements. Started as a Socialist political event, the holiday blended in the culture of many countries, primarily in Europe, including Russia. In some regions, the day lost its political flavor, and became simply an occasion for men to express their love for women in a way somewhat similar to a mixture of Mother's Day and Valentine's Day. In other regions, however, the political and human rights theme designated by the United Nations runs strong, and political and social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide are brought out and examined in a hopeful manner. This is a day which some people celebrate by wearing purple ribbons.

The Stonewall Book Award are a set of three literary awards that annually recognize "exceptional merit relating to the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender experience" in English-language books published in the U.S. They are sponsored by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table (GLBTRT) of the American Library Association (ALA) and have been part of the American Library Association awards program, now termed ALA Book, Print & Media Awards, since 1986 as the single Gay Book Award.
The three award categories are fiction and nonfiction in books for adults, distinguished in 1990, and books for children or young adults, from 2010. The awards are named for Barbara Gittings, Israel Fishman, and (jointly) Mike Morgan and Larry Romans. In full they are the Stonewall Book Award-Barbara Gittings Literature Award, the Stonewall Book Award-Israel Fishman Non-Fiction Award, and the Stonewall Book Awards – Mike Morgan & Larry Romans Children's & Young Adult Literature Award.
Finalists or have been designated from 1990, termed "Honor Books" from 2001. Currently a panel of librarians selects five finalists in each award category and subsequently selects one winner. The winners are announced in January and each receives a plaque and $1000 cash prize during the ALA Annual Conference in June or July. Winners are expected to attend and to give acceptance speeches.
The ALA solicits book suggestions each to be accompanied by a brief statement in favor of the book. Those are recommendations or "applications" to the Awards Committee from the public by email, which are not accepted from publishers, agents, authors, and others with vested interests.
Eligible books should be original works published in the U.S. during the preceding year, including "substantially changed new editions" and "English-language translations of foreign-language books".

[[Helpmate]]

CATEGORIES: Chess checkmates, Chess problems

A helpmate is a type of chess problem in which both sides cooperate in order to achieve the goal of checkmating Black.  In a helpmate in n moves, Black moves first, then White, each side moving n times, to culminate in White's nth move checkmating Black. (In a helpmate in two for example, sometimes abbreviated h#2, the solution consists of a Black move, a White move, a second Black move, then a second White move, giving checkmate.) Although the two sides cooperate, all moves must be legal according to the rules of chess.
The example problem to the right is a helpmate in eight (or h#8) by Z. Maslar, published in Die Schwalbe in 1981. The solution is (recall that in helpmate solutions, Black's move is given first): 1. Kf3 Kd3 2. Bb3 Kc3 3. Ke4+ Kd2 4. Kd4 Ke2 5. Kc3 Nb4 6. Kb2 Kd2 7. Ka1 Kc1 8. Ba2 Nc2#

The  “Bolivarian Revolution” refers to a leftist social movement and political process in Venezuela led by late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, the founder of the Fifth Republic Movement (founded the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007).  The "Bolivarian Revolution" is named after Simón Bolívar, an early 19th-century Venezuelan and Latin American revolutionary leader, prominent in the Spanish American wars of independence in achieving the independence of most of northern South America from Spanish rule. According to Chávez and other supporters, the "Bolivarian Revolution" seeks to build a mass movement to implement Bolivarianism - popular democracy, economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption - in Venezuela. They interpret Bolívar's ideas from a socialist perspective.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
On his 57th birthday, while announcing that he was being treated for cancer, Chavez announced that he had changed the slogan of the Bolivarian Revolution from “Motherland, socialism, or death” to “Socialist motherland and victory, we will live, and we will come out victorious.”[tpl]cite journal|last=Aponte-Moreno|first=Marco|author2=Lance Lattig|title=Chavez: Rhetoric Made in Havana|journal=World Policy Journal|issue=Spring 2012|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/spring2012/ch%C3%A1vez-rhetoric-made-havana|accessdate=31 May 2012[/tpl]

[[Nicolas Catinat]]
CATEGORIES: 1637 births, 1712 deaths, People from Paris, Marshals of France, French army commanders in the War of the Spanish Succession

Nicolas Catinat (1 September 1637 – 22 February 1712) was a French military commander and Marshal of France under Louis XIV. The son of a magistrate, Catinat was born in Paris on 1 September 1637. He entered the Gardes Françaises at an early age and distinguished himself at the Siege of Lille in 1667.
He became a brigadier ten years later, maréchal de camp in 1680, and lieutenant-general 1688. He served with great credit in the campaigns of 1676–1678 in Flanders during the Franco-Dutch War, and was later employed in the persecution of the Vaudois in 1686. After taking part in the Siege of Philippsburg at the opening of the Nine Years War, he was appointed to command the French troops in the south-eastern theatre of war. In 1691 he crossed into the County of Nice, and captured the towns Nice and Villefranche.
His victories against the Duke of Savoy at the Battle of Staffarda in 1690, and the Battle of Marsaglia in 1693, were amongst his greatest achievements, (the Duke of Savoy later abandoned the Allied coalition and concluded peace with King Louis by signing the Treaty of Turin on 29 August 1696). In 1693 Catinat was made a marshal of France.
At the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, Catinat was placed in charge of operations in northern Italy, but he was much hampered by the orders of the French court and the weakness of his forces. Outmanoeuvred by Prince Eugene of Savoy, Catinat suffered a reverse at Carpi and was soon afterwards superseded by Marshal Villeroi. Acting as Villeroi's second-in-command, French forces were again defeated by Eugene's Imperialists at the Battle of Chieri. Catinat died at Saint-Gratien in 1712. His memoirs were published in 1819.
The British historian Geoffrey Treasure sums up Catinat:
 Catinat was not the typical soldier of this period.  He had begun life as a lawyer, with no advantage of birth, and made his way by sheer merit.  He was a careful general, thorough and sparing of the lives of his men, unambitious and something of a philosopher.  After his failure in the Italian campaign of the next war the War of the Spanish Succession, he retired to the country to cultivate his garden.

Mark Herron (8 July 1928 – 13 January 1996) was an American actor best known as the fourth husband of singer and actress Judy Garland. They were married on 14 November 1965 in Las Vegas, but they separated after 5 months of marriage apparently due to his homosexuality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodsgoldenage.com/actors/garland.html|title=Judy Garland, The Greatest Entertainer (1922-1969)|publisher=Hollywood's Golden Age[/tpl], Retrieved 2013-05-29. Seventeen months later, Garland was granted a divorce after testifying that Herron had beaten her. He said he had "only hit her in self defense."  He appeared in films such as Federico Fellini's 8½ and Eye of the Cat.
Fans of the cable TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 may recall his performance in the film Girl in Gold Boots, in which he portrayed the greasy nightclub owner Leo McCabe.
Gerald Clarke, in his biography of Garland, Get Happy (2000) and in an interview about the book, reported that Herron had an affair with Tallulah Bankhead prior to meeting Garland. Biographies of Garland by David Shipman and Garland's daughter Lorna Luft -- Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir (1998)
Garland put Herron to work as producer of her two London Palladium concerts with her daughter Liza Minnelli in 1964 as well as some personal appearances in Canada in 1965.
Aside from providing biographer Gerold Frank information for his biography titled Judy (1975), Herron remained silent on the topic of Garland.  He continued acting, often appearing in summer stock productions.
Herron died of cancer in 1996, aged 67.

[[Confidence interval]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical inference, Statistical terminology, Econometrics, Market research, Psephology, Biostatistics, Measurement, Statistical intervals

In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate of a population parameter and is used to indicate the reliability of an estimate. It is an observed interval (i.e. it is calculated from the observations), in principle different from sample to sample, that frequently includes the parameter of interest if the experiment is repeated. How frequently the observed interval contains the parameter is determined by the confidence level or confidence coefficient. More specifically, the meaning of the term "confidence level" is that, if confidence intervals are constructed across many separate data analyses of repeated (and possibly different) experiments, the proportion of such intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will match the confidence level; this is guaranteed by the reasoning underlying the construction of confidence intervals. Whereas two-sided confidence limits form a confidence interval, their one-sided counterparts are referred to as lower or upper confidence bounds.
Confidence intervals consist of a range of values (interval) that act as good estimates of the unknown population parameter. However, in infrequent cases, none of these values may cover the value of the parameter. The level of confidence of the confidence interval would indicate the probability that the confidence range captures this true population parameter given a distribution of samples. It does not describe any single sample. This value is represented by a percentage, so when we say, "we are 99% confident that the true value of the parameter is in our confidence interval", we express that 99%  of the observed confidence intervals will hold the true value of the parameter. After a sample is taken, the population parameter is either in the interval made or not; it is not a matter of chance. The desired level of confidence is set by the researcher (not determined by data). If a corresponding hypothesis test is performed, the confidence level is the complement of respective level of significance, i.e. a 95% confidence interval reflects a significance level of 0.05.[tpl]cite book|last=Field|first=Andy|title=Discovering statistics using SPSS|year=2013|publisher=SAGE|location=London[/tpl] The confidence interval contains the parameter values that, when tested, should not be rejected with the same sample. Greater levels of variance yield larger confidence intervals, and hence less precise estimates of the parameter. Confidence intervals of difference parameters not containing 0 imply that there is a statistically significant difference between the populations.
In applied practice, confidence intervals are typically stated at the 95% confidence level.Zar, J.H. (1984) Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice Hall International, New Jersey. pp 43–45 However, when presented graphically, confidence intervals can be shown at several confidence levels, for example 50%, 95% and 99%.
Certain factors may affect the confidence interval size including size of sample, level of confidence, and population variability. A larger sample size normally will lead to a better estimate of the population parameter.
A confidence interval does not predict that the true value of the parameter has a particular probability of being in the confidence interval given the data actually obtained. Intervals with this property, called credible intervals, exist only in the paradigm of Bayesian statistics, as they require postulation of a prior distribution for the parameter of interest.

The PEN/Faulkner Foundation is an outgrowth of William Faulkner's generosity in using his 1949 Nobel Prize winnings to create the William Faulkner Foundation; among the charitable goals of the foundation was "to establish a fund to support and encourage new fiction writers." The foundation's first award for a "notable first novel," called the William Faulkner Foundation Award, was granted to John Knowles's A Separate Peace in 1961. The foundation was dissolved after 1970.
Mary Lee Settle was one of the founders of the PEN/Faulkner award after controversy at the 1979 National Book Award, when PEN voted a boycott on the ground that they were too commercial.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/28/AR2005092802519.html?nav=rss_metro/obituaries| title=Novelist Mary Lee Settle; Founded PEN/Faulkner Award| author=Matt Schudel| work=Washington Post | date=September 29, 2005 [/tpl] It is affiliated with the writers' organization International PEN.

Fernand Braudel ([tpl]IPA-fr|bʁodɛl|lang[/tpl]; 24 August 1902 – 27 November 1985) was a French historian  and a leader of the Annales School.  His scholarship focused on three main projects: The Mediterranean (1923–49, then 1949–66), Civilization and Capitalism (1955–79), and the unfinished Identity of France (1970–85). His reputation stems in part from his writings, but even more from his success in making the Annales School the most important engine of historical research in France and much of the world after 1950. As the dominant leader of the Annales School of historiography in the 1950s and 1960s, he exerted enormous influence on historical writing in France and other countries.
Braudel has been considered one of the greatest of the modern historians who have emphasized the role of large-scale socioeconomic factors in the making and writing of history.i.e. Fernand Braudel, "The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II" (Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1996) He can also be considered as one of the precursors of world-systems theory.

[[Hobgoblin]]
CATEGORIES: English legendary creatures, Goblins

Hobgoblin is a term typically applied in folktales to describe a friendly but troublesome creature of the Seelie Court. 
The most commonly known hobgoblin is the character Puck in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Hobgoblins seem to be small, hairy little men who—like their close relative, brownies—are often found within human dwellings, doing odd jobs around the house while the family is lost in sleep.  Such chores are typically small deeds, like dusting and ironing. Often, the only compensation necessary in return for these was food.  Attempts to give them clothing would often banish them forever, though whether they take offense to such gifts or are simply too proud to work in new clothes differs from teller to teller.  It is possible that the "hob" in their name comes from the hob, a part of the hearth meant for holding food or utensils.
While brownies are more peaceful creatures, hobgoblins are more fond of practical jokes. They also seem to be able to shape-shift, as seen in one of Puck's monologues in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Robin Goodfellow is perhaps the most mischievous and most infamous of all his kind, but many are less antagonizing. However, like all of the fae folk, hobgoblins are easily annoyed. When teased or misused excessively, brownies become boggarts—creatures whose sole existence is to play tricks and cause trouble for people. They can be mischievous, frightening, and even dangerous, and they are very difficult to get rid of.Briggs (1979) p.32 p.100
In John Bunyan's hymn "To be a Pilgrim", the hobgoblin is coupled with "a foul fiend" as two monstrous beings who try but fail to "daunt the Pilgrim's spirit". 
The term "hobgoblin" has grown to mean a superficial object that is a source of (often imagined) fear or trouble. Probably the best-known example of this usage is Ralph Waldo Emerson's line, "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds," from the essay Self-Reliance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm |title=Self-Reliance |publisher=Emersoncentral.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09[/tpl]

[[Fast Food Song]]

CATEGORIES: 2003 singles, Debut singles

"Fast Food Song" is a song made famous by the British-based band the Fast Food Rockers, although it existed long before they recorded it. It was released in June 2003 as the lead single from their album It's Never Easy Being Cheesy. The song was highly successful on the UK Singles Chart, reaching number two in the official charts. The song also achieved chart success worldwide and reached number fifty-six on the Australian ARIA Charts. The song was co-written and produced by Mike Stock. The lyrics were mildly controversial for supposedly promoting the excessive consumption of fast food by children, which is why some UK-based radio stations will not play the song when it is requested.
Most recently, Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio ranked the song at number 87 on the list of the 100 Worst Songs Ever, commenting, "We'd like to see Morgan Spurlock spend 30 days listening to nothing but this song. He'd never survive."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aolradioblog.com/2010/09/11/worst-songs/?icid=main[tpl]![/tpl]main[tpl]![/tpl]dl2[tpl]![/tpl]sec1_lnk1[tpl]![/tpl]169800|title=100 Worst Songs Ever|author=Wilkening, Matthew|date=September 11, 2010|publisher=AOL Radio|accessdate=December 19, 2010[/tpl] Another version, "De Pizzadans", recorded by Dynamite, had been a hit in Belgium.Bubblegum Dancer: Fast Food Rockers This song has also been used in many advertising campaigns in the UK, for fast food shops, especially around the time of the release.

The band are widely considered to be one-hit wonders, though their two follow up singles "Smile Please" and "I Love Christmas" both achieved mild success in the UK Singles Chart reaching number 10 and 25 respectively.

Martin I of Sicily (c. 1374/1376 – 25 July 1409), called  "The Younger", was King of Sicily from 1390 to 1409.
Martin's father was the future King Martin I of Aragon, and his grandparents were King Peter IV of Aragon and Eleanor of Sicily. In 1389/1390/February, 1392 he married Maria of Sicily, born in 1362/1363. In 1392 he returned with Maria to Sicily with a military force and defeated a group of opposing barons. In 1394 the couple had their only son Peter, crown prince of Sicily, who died in 1400. He ruled Sicily jointly with Maria until her death at Lentini on May 25, 1401/1402. At that time, he repudiated the Treaty of 1372 and ruled Sicily alone. After his death in 1409 in Cagliari, Sardinia, his father, by then king of Aragon, ruled Sicily as Martin II.
After Maria's death Martin I the Younger married at Catania on May 21, 1402 by proxy and on December 26, 1402 in person Blanche of Navarre, who was heiress of the Evreux family and the future queen of Navarre, by whom he had an only son Martin in 1403, who died in Valencia in 1407. No offspring of his two marriages survived childhood; the only issue he left was a bastard son by Sicilian-born Tarsia Rizzari, Fadrique of Aragon, Count of Luna and Ejerica and Lord of Segorbe, born in 1400/1403, whom Martin II tried to make his successor in the Aragonese Empire. But the effort failed, and Fadrique was denied the succession by the Pact of Caspe. He married Yolande Louise (Violante Luisa) de Mur and died at Urena in 1438 without issue. He also left a bastard daughter by Sicilian-born Agathe de Pesce, named Violante of Aragon, who died c. 1428 and was married twice: firstly in 1405 as his second wife (some say she was his mistress) to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla (1371–1436), and secondly to his cousin Martín de Guzmán.
Martin the Younger led the troops in the conquest of Sardinia in 1409, decisively defeating the ruler of Arborea at the Battle of Sanluri just before his own death.

Rhinoplasty ([tpl]lang-el|ῥίς rhis[/tpl], nose + [tpl]lang|el|πλάσσειν plassein[/tpl], to shape), a nose job, is a plastic surgery procedure for correcting and reconstructing the form, restoring the functions, and aesthetically enhancing the nose, by resolving nasal trauma (blunt, penetrating, blast), congenital defect, respiratory impediment, and a failed primary rhinoplasty. In the surgeries — closed rhinoplasty and open rhinoplasty — an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist), a maxillofacial surgeon (jaw, face, and neck specialist), or a plastic surgeon, creates a functional, aesthetic, and facially proportionate nose by separating the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseo-cartilaginous nasal framework, correcting them as required for form and function, suturing the incisions, and applying either a package or a stent, or both, to immobilize the corrected nose to ensure the proper healing of the surgical incision.Open Rhinoplasty Definition
The non-surgical rhinoplasty procedure corrects and modifies slight defects of the nose by means of subcutaneous injections of biologically inert fillers; the results tend to be relatively transitory, in comparison with the results of nose surgery.

[[Gastric distension]]

CATEGORIES: Symptoms and signs: Digestive system and abdomen

Gastric distension is bloating of the stomach when air is pumped into it. This may be done when someone is performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and blowing air into the mouth of someone who is not breathing spontaneously.  The primary reason this occurs is too much air is delivered during rescue breathing.
It may also occur when more advanced medical procedures are performed by emergency or hospital personnel, and air leaks past the opening of the lungs and into the stomach. However this problem can be prevented  by inserting a gastric tube and suctioning the air and other stomach contents.
Gastric distension is potentially dangerous since it can cause the contents of the stomach to come up the esophagus (gullet) and spill back down into the lungs.  This can cause drowning, by filling the lungs with fluid, if there has been enough material in the stomach.  With lesser material, gastric distension can cause stomach acids to damage the lungs and create a condition known as "aspiration pneumonia". The other problem  this causes is that the expanded stomach will push against the lungs decreasing the amount of air that can be placed into the lungs.
CPR standards issued by the American Heart Association suggest that people suffering gastric distension be turned on their sides and the stomach be compressed gently to push out the air bloating the stomach.  By turning the individual on their side into what is known as the recovery position, the stomach contents will often continue past the opening of the lungs and drain out the mouth, thus sparing the victim lung damage or the internal drowning which can be caused by large volumes of stomach material getting into the lungs.

[[Essential oil]]

CATEGORIES: Essential oils, Oils

An essential oil is a concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile aroma compounds from plants. Essential oils are also known as volatile oils, ethereal oils,  aetherolea, or simply as the "oil of" the plant from which they were extracted, such as oil of clove. An oil is "essential" in the sense that it carries a distinctive scent, or essence, of the plant.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] Essential oils do not form a distinctive category for any medical, pharmacological, or culinary purpose. They are not essential for health.
Essential oils are generally extracted by distillation, often by using steam. Other processes include expression or solvent extraction. They are used in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps and other products, for flavoring food and drink, and for adding scents to incense and household cleaning products.
Essential oils have been used medicinally in history. Medical applications proposed by those who sell medicinal oils range from skin treatments to remedies for cancer and often are based solely on historical accounts of use of essential oils for these purposes. Claims for the efficacy of medical treatments, and treatment of cancers in particular, are now subject to regulation in most countries.
As the use of essential oils has declined in evidence-based medicine, one must consult older textbooks for much information on their use.Sapeika, Norman. Actions and uses of Drugs, Pub: A.A. Balkema, 1963Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry, vol. 8, 4th ed. Pub: Longmans Green. 1947 Modern works are less inclined to generalize; rather than refer to "essential oils" as a class at all, they prefer to discuss specific compounds, such as methyl salicylate, rather than "oil of wintergreen".[tpl]cite book |author=Gilman, Alfred; Goodman, Louis Sanford |title=Goodman and Gilman's The pharmacological basis of therapeutics |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-08-040296-8 |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Klaassen, Curtis D.; Amdur, Mary O.; Casarett, Louis J.; Doull, John |title=Casarett and Doull's toxicology: the basic science of poisons |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=0-07-105239-9 |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]
Interest in essential oils has revived in recent decades with the popularity of aromatherapy, a branch of alternative medicine that claims that essential oils and other aromatic compounds have curative effects. Oils are volatilized or diluted in a carrier oil and used in massage, diffused in the air by a nebulizer, heated over a candle flame, or burned as incense.
The earliest recorded mention of the techniques and methods used to produce essential oils is believed to be that of Ibn al-Baitar (1188–1248), an Andalusian physician, pharmacist and chemist.[tpl]cite book|author=M.

[[Frederick the Simple]]
CATEGORIES: 1341 births, 1377 deaths, People from Catania, Dukes of Athens, Kings of Sicily, House of Aragon, Burials at Catania Cathedral, Sicily

Frederick III (or IV) (1 September 1341 – 27 January 1377), called the Simple, was King of Sicily  from 1355 to 1377. He was the second son of Peter II of Sicily and Elisabeth of Carinthia. He succeeded his brother Louis. The documents of his era call him the "infante Frederick, ruler of the kingdom of Sicily", without any regnal number.
"Frederick the Simple" is often confused with an earlier Sicilian monarch, Frederick II, who chose to call himself "Frederick III", even though he was actually only the second King Frederick to occupy the Sicilian throne, as also this Frederick has been dubbed by later generations of genealogists and historians as Frederick III.
Frederick III was born in Catania, and succeeded to his brother Louis in 1355 under the regency of his sister, Euphemia of Sicily. In his youth the reign was under the control of powerful Sicialian barons, in particular of Artale I Alagona. The beginning of Frederick III's reign was also plagued by intermittent wars with the Kingdom of Naples (see War of the Sicilian Vespers) and also by the Black Death, to which his elder brother and predecessor had succumbed. In 1372 he was able to come to peace terms with Naples and Pope Gregory XI, obtaining the title of tributary King of "Trinacria".
He appointed his uncle, Roland, to act on his behalf in the Duchy of Athens and Neopatria.
On 11 April 1361, Frederick married his first wife Constance of Aragon, daughter of King Peter IV of Aragon. They had only one daughter, Maria. On December 25, 1369 Frederick ordered all Jews to wear a badge indicating their heritage. The badge consisted of a piece of red material, not smaller than the largest royal seal; men were required to wear it under the chin, and women on the chest.http://old.chabad.org/calendar/view/day.asp?id=1085240&tDate=12/29/2013 On 17 January 1372, Frederick married secondly Antonia of Balzo. There were no children from this marriage. Frederick was betrothed again to Antonia Visconti, but he died before the wedding and was succeeded by his only child, Queen Maria.

[[Madrasi chess]]
CATEGORIES: Chess variants, Fairy chess, 1979 in chess, Board games introduced in 1979

Madrasi chess is a chess variant invented in 1979 by Abdul Jabbar Karwatkar which uses the conventional rules of chess with the addition that when a piece is attacked by a piece of the same type but opposite colour (for example, a black queen attacking a white queen) it is paralysed and becomes unable to move, capture or give check. Most of the time, two like pieces attack each other mutually, meaning they are both paralysed (en passant pawn captures are an exception to this, since the attack is not mutual.  (The status of an en passant capture is open to debate, according to Pritchard.)
This paralysis rule is not usually extended to the kings, meaning that as in orthodox chess, the two kings cannot move to adjacent squares; when it is extended to kings, the variant is called Madrasi rex inclusive (sometimes shortened to Madrasi RI). Although it is possible to play complete games of both Madrasi chess and Madrasi RI, they have mainly been used as a condition in chess problems.

The position to the right demonstrates some of the peculiarities of Madrasi. The black king is not in check from the rook on c5 (see algebraic chess notation), because it (the rook) is attacked by the black rook on g5, meaning it is paralysed. In its turn, the c5 rook attacks the g5 rook, paralysing it. Likewise, the white rook on g2, also attacked by the g5 rook, is paralysed. The black rook on h4, however, is not paralysed, and is free to move. The knights on d8 and f7 also attack each other, as do the pawns on c2 and d3, so these pieces are also paralysed. Note that the bishop on d1 is not paralysed by knight on f2 attacking it - units have to be of a similar type (both knights, both bishops and so on) for paralysis to happen.
There are two ways in which a paralysis may be released. The first is for a non-paralysed pieces to make a capture. In the example, white cannot play cxd3 because his pawn is paralysed, but he can play Nxd3, thus unparalysing his c2 pawn. The second way to unparalyse a piece is to cut off the line of attack from the paralysing unit by interposing a third piece. For example, 1.Be5 in the diagram cuts the line of attack from the g5 rook to the c5 rook and so unparalyses it. As a result, the white rook on c5 is now giving check. The only way for black to escape the check in this instance is to re-paralyse the checking rook, which can be done by 1...Rc4. White then has the reply 2.bxc4 which is checkmate: black has no safe squares for his king, he cannot capture the checking unit, he cannot interpose a piece between the checking unit and the king, and he cannot paralyse the checking unit (note that ...Rxe5 paralysing the c5 rook is not possible, because the g5 rook is paralysed by its counterpart on g2).
Isardam ("Madrasi" spelled backwards) is a variant of Madrasi in which only moves that do not lead to a Madrasi paralysis are legal.

Minute Maid Park (also The Ballpark at Union Station, Enron Field, and Astros Field) is a ballpark in Downtown Houston, Texas, United States that opened in 2000 to house the Houston Astros Major League Baseball team.
The ballpark was Houston's first retractable-roofed stadium, protecting fans and athletes from Houston's notoriously humid weather as did its predecessor, the Astrodome, but also allowing fans to enjoy outdoor baseball during favorable weather. The ballpark also features a grass field, compared to the Astrodome's artificial AstroTurf, which was generally disliked by professional baseball players. The largest entrance to the park is inside what was once Houston's Union Station, and the left-field side of the stadium features a railway as homage to the site's history. The train moves along a track on top of the length of the exterior wall beyond left field whenever an Astros player hits a home run, and/or when the Astros win a game. The engine's tender, traditionally used to carry coal, is filled with giant oranges in tribute to Coca Cola subsidiary Minute Maid's most famous product, orange juice. The ballpark has 5,095 club seats and 63 luxury suites.

William P. "Bill" Melchionni (born October 19, 1944) is a former National Basketball Association and American Basketball Association player.
Melchionni was a wispy guard from Bishop Eustace Prep (Pennsauken, New Jersey) who was a collegiate star in the mid-1960s at Villanova University and was the Most Valuable Player in the 1966 NIT, when Villanova finished in third place in the tournament. Upon graduation from Villanova, Melchionni joined the famous Phillips 66ers AAU Elite team, where he starred for a season before returning to his hometown to join the Philadelphia 76ers.
Melchionni was a key reserve on what is, statistically speaking, the greatest 76ers team ever, the NBA Champions led by Wilt Chamberlain, Luke Jackson, Hal Greer, Wali Jones, and Chet Walker in 1967. The team was coached by another AAU Elite alum, Alex Hannum.
Melchionni then jumped to the upstart ABA, becoming a key cog with the New York Nets.  He played alongside Rick Barry, and later mentored a young Julius Erving. Melchionni was a key player in the 1974 ABA Championship, led by Erving, Larry Kenon, John Williamson, and Billy Paultz.
Melchionni played in three ABA All-Star Games, and was named to the All-ABA First Team in 1972.  Melchionni led the ABA in assists per game in both 1971 and 1972.
Melchionni's #25 jersey was retired by both the Nets and Villanova.
Melchionni's brother, Gary Melchionni, was a two-year captain for Duke University and was an All-ACC performer. Gary's son and Bill's nephew, Lee Melchionni, played for the Duke Blue Devil's from 2002-2006.

Hurricane Mitch was the most powerful hurricane and the most destructive of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph (285 km/h). The storm was the thirteenth tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the season. Along with Hurricane Georges, Mitch was the most notable hurricane in the season. At the time, Hurricane Mitch was the strongest Atlantic hurricane observed in the month of October, though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma of the 2005 season. The hurricane matched the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record (it has since dropped to seventh).
Mitch formed in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22, 1998, and after drifting through extremely favorable conditions, it rapidly strengthened to peak at Category 5 status, the highest possible rating on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After drifting southwestward and weakening, the hurricane hit Honduras as a minimal hurricane. It drifted through Central America, reformed in the Bay of Campeche, and ultimately struck Florida as a strong tropical storm.
Due to its slow motion from October 29 to November 3, Hurricane Mitch dropped historic amounts of rainfall in Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, with unofficial reports of up to [tpl]convert|75|in|mm|sigfig=2[/tpl]. Deaths due to catastrophic flooding made it the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in history; nearly 11,000 people were killed with over 11,000 left missing by the end of 1998. Additionally, roughly 2.7 million were left homeless as a result of the hurricane. The flooding caused extreme damage, estimated at over $6 billion (1998 USD).

Hurricane Floyd was a very powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane which struck the east coast of the United States. It was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Floyd triggered the third largest evacuation in US history (behind Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Rita, respectively) when 2.6 million coastal residents of five states were ordered from their homes as it approached. The Cape Verde-type hurricane formed off the coast of Africa and lasted from September 7 to September 19, peaking in strength as a very strong Category 4 hurricane—just 2 mph short of the highest possible rating on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. It was among the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its strength ever recorded.
Floyd was once forecast to strike Florida, but turned away. Instead, Floyd struck The Bahamas at peak strength, causing heavy damage. It then paralleled the East Coast of the United States, causing massive evacuations and costly preparations from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm weakened significantly, however, before striking Cape Fear, North Carolina as a very strong Category 2 hurricane, and caused further damage as it traveled up the Mid-Atlantic region and into New England.
The hurricane produced torrential rainfall in Eastern North Carolina, adding more rain to an area hit by Hurricane Dennis just weeks earlier. The rains caused widespread flooding over a period of several weeks; nearly every river basin in the eastern part of the state exceeded 500-year flood levels. In total, Floyd was responsible for 57 fatalities and $4.5 billion (1999 USD; $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|4500000000|1999[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD) in damage. Due to the destruction, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Floyd.

Hurricane Alicia of August 1983 was the costliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Alicia was the third depression, the first tropical storm, and the only major hurricane of the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season. It struck Galveston and Houston, Texas directly, causing $2.6 billion (1983 USD; $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|2600000000|1983[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD) in damage and killing 21 people; this made it the worst Texas hurricane since Hurricane Carla in 1961.

Alicia was the first storm for which the National Hurricane Center issued landfall probabilities.
Hurricane Alicia was notable for the delayed post storm evacuation of Galveston Island (since the eye of the storm traveled the evacuation route up Interstate 45 from Galveston to Houston). The hurricane was also notable for the shattering of many windows in downtown Houston by loose gravel from the roofs of new skyscrapers and by other debris, prompting changes to rooftop construction codes.

[[Resource-based relative value scale]]

CATEGORIES: Medicare and Medicaid (United States)

Resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) is a schema used to determine how much money medical providers should be paid. It is partially used by Medicare in the United States and by nearly all health maintenance organizations (HMOs).
RBRVS assigns procedures performed by a physician or other medical provider a relative value which is adjusted by geographic region (so a procedure performed in Manhattan is worth more than a procedure performed in Dallas). This value is then multiplied by a fixed conversion factor, which changes annually, to determine the amount of payment.
RBRVS determines prices based on three separate factors: physician work (54%), practice expense (41%), and malpractice expense (5%).Percentages are average percentage contributions of each factor, as computed by the Government Accountability Office in 2005, as per reference.Medicare physician fees geographic adjustment indices are valid in design, but data and methods need refinement.

The colonial history of the United States covers the history of European settlements from the start of colonization of America until their incorporation into the United States.  In the late 16th century, England, France, Spain and the Netherlands launched major colonization programs in eastern North America. Small early attempts—such as the English Lost Colony of Roanoke—often disappeared; everywhere the death rate of the first arrivals was very high. Nevertheless successful colonies were established. European settlers came from a variety of social and religious groups. No aristocrats settled permanently, but a number of adventurers, soldiers, farmers, and tradesmen arrived. Diversity was an American characteristic as the Dutch of New Netherland, the Swedes and Finns of New Sweden, the English Quakers of Pennsylvania, the English Puritans of New England, the English settlers of Jamestown, and the "worthy poor" of Georgia, came to the new continent and built colonies with distinctive social, religious, political and economic styles.  Non-British colonies were taken over and the inhabitants were all assimilated, unlike in Nova Scotia, where the British expelled the French "Acadian" inhabitants. There were no major civil wars among the 13 colonies, and the two chief armed rebellions (in Virginia in 1676 and in New York in 1689–91) were short-lived failures.  Wars between the French and the British—the French and Indian Wars and Father Rale's War—were recurrent, and involved French support for Wabanaki Confederacy attacks on the frontiers. By 1760 France was defeated and the British seized its colonies.
The four distinct regions were: New England, the Middle Colonies, the Chesapeake Bay Colonies (Upper South) and the Lower South. Some historians add a fifth region, the Frontier, which was never separately organized.Cooke, ed. North America in Colonial Times (1998) By the time European settlers arrived around 1600–1650, the majority of the Native Americans living in the eastern United States had been decimated by new diseases, introduced to them decades before by explorers and sailors.Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, Colonial America: A History to 1763 (4th ed. 2011) p. 23

The Golden Age of Grotesque is the fifth full-length studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson, and the last as a band. It was released on May 13, 2003 in the US through Nothing and Interscope Records.

Limited edition units included a DVD titled Doppelherz (Double-heart), a surrealist short film directed by Manson.
It was revealed in a 2007 edition of the British rock magazine Kerrang! that The Golden Age of Grotesque was intended to be Marilyn Manson's departure from music. The album has received mixed to positive reviews from mainstream music critics.
The album was certified gold in Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland and the UK. It spawned two singles ("This Is the New Shit" and "mOBSCENE"). The band supported the album with the Grotesk Burlesk Tour, and the album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

The Dana Girls was a series of young adult mystery novels produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate. The title heroines, Jean and Louise Dana, are teenage sisters and amateur detectives who solve mysteries while at boarding school. The series was created in 1934 in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of both the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories and the Hardy Boys series, but was less successful than either. The series was written by a number of ghostwriters and, despite going out-of-print twice, lasted from 1934 to 1979; the books have also been translated into a number of other languages. While subject to less critical attention than either Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys, a number of critics have written about the series, most arguing that the Dana Girls' relative lack of success was due to the more dated nature of the series.

The Celtic Catholic Church is a church in the United States. It claims Apostolic Succession from the Archbishop of Canterbury William Sancroft's associates, the non-jurors, specifically those who fled to Wales in the 17th century. It also traces its tradition back to Celtic Christianity and the mission that, according to medieval legend, Saint Joseph of Arimathea took to Glastonbury and the Celts in 36 AD.  The modern church using this name, however, is unable to demonstrate any existence before the 1960s and was incorporated in 1974.  As of 2006, it claims to be "tiny", with one bishop and five congregations (in southern California, Washington state, and Hawaiʻi).
The Celtic Catholic Church emphasizes the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds, omitting the filioque clause from the Nicene Creed. Mass is celebrated in English. The canons provide for the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood.

During the course of 1919 and 1920 the Allied powers signed the treaties of Versailles, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Trianon, and Sèvres bringing the war to an official end.
The aftermath of World War I saw drastic political, cultural, and social change across Europe, Asia, Africa, and even in areas outside those that were directly involved. Four empires collapsed due to the war, old countries were abolished, new ones were formed, boundaries were redrawn, international organizations were established, and many new and old ideologies took a firm hold in people's minds.
World War I also had the effect of bringing political transformation to Germany and the United Kingdom by bringing near-universal suffrage to these two European powers, turning them into mass electoral democracies for the first time in history (see United Kingdom general election, 1918 and German federal election, 1919).

[/ref] for tank guns firing kinetic energy penetrator ammunition. The velocity of a projectile is highest at the muzzle and drops off steadily because of air resistance.
In conventional guns, muzzle velocity is determined by the quality (burn speed, expansion) and quantity of the propellant, the mass of the projectile, and the length of the barrel. A slower burning propellant needs a longer barrel to burn completely, but can on the other hand use a heavier projectile.[ref][tpl] cite web | url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/rifle_barrel.htm | title=The Rifle Barrel | accessdate=9 June 2011 [/tpl]
[/ref] A faster burning propellant may accelerate a lighter projectile to higher speeds if the same amount of propellant is used. In a gun, the pressure resulting from the combustion process is a limiting factor on projectile velocity.  A balance between propellant quality and quantity, projectile mass, and barrel length must be found if both safety and optimal performance is to be achieved.
Longer barrels give the propellant force more time to work on propelling the bullet.  For this reason longer barrels generally provide higher velocities, everything else being equal.  As the bullet moves down the bore, however, the propellant's gas pressure behind it diminishes.  Given a long enough barrel, there would eventually be a point at which friction between the bullet and the barrel, and air resistance, would equal the force of the gas pressure behind it, and from that point, the velocity of the bullet would decrease.
Large naval guns will have length to diameter ratios of 38:1 to 50:1. This length ratio maximizes the projectile velocity.  There is much interest in modernizing naval weaponry by using electrically driven railguns, which overcome the limitations noted above. With railguns, a constant acceleration is provided along the entire length of the device, greatly increasing the muzzle velocity. There is also a significant advantage in not having to carry explosive propellant, and even the projectile internal charges may be eliminated due to the high velocity – the projectile becomes a strictly kinetic weapon.

CATEGORIES: Religious organizations established in 1951, Evangelicalism, Evangelical parachurch organisations, International bodies of Protestant denominations

The World Evangelical Alliance (WEA) is a global ministry working with local churches around the world to join in common concern to live and proclaim the "Good News of Jesus" in their communities. WEA is a network of churches in 128 nations that have each formed an Evangelical alliance and over 100 international organizations joining together to give a worldwide identity, voice and platform to more than 600 million evangelical Christians. Seeking holiness, justice and renewal at every level of society - individual, family, community and culture - its aim is uniting to transform the nations so that God is glorified.
Christians from ten countries met in London in 1846 for the purpose of launching, in their own words, "a new thing in church history, a definite organization for the expression of unity amongst Christian individuals belonging to different churches." This was the beginning of a vision that was fulfilled in 1951 when believers from 21 countries officially formed the World Evangelical Fellowship. Today, WEA is a dynamic global structure for unity and action that embraces 600 million evangelicals in 128 countries. It is a unity based on the historic Christian faith expressed in the evangelical tradition. And it looks to the future with vision to accomplish God's purposes in discipling the nations for Jesus Christ.
Today, WEA seeks to strengthen local churches through national alliances, supporting and coordinating grassroots leadership and seeking practical ways of showing the unity of the body of Christ.

The S60 Platform (formerly Series 60 User Interface) is a software platform for smartphones that runs on the Symbian operating system. It was created by Nokia in 2001, and was first released in 2002 with the Nokia 7650 smartphone. The OS platform has since seen 5 updated editions. In 2010, S60 was replaced by the new Symbian^3.
S60 consists of a suite of libraries and standard applications, such as telephony, personal information manager (PIM) tools, and Helix-based multimedia players. It is intended to power fully featured modern phones with large colour screens, which are commonly known as smartphones.
The S60 software is a multivendor standard for smartphones that supports application development in Java MIDP, C++, Python[tpl]citation | url = http://www.forum.nokia.com/Resources_and_Information/Tools/Runtimes/Python_for_S60/ | publisher = Nokia | title = Python for S60[/tpl] and Adobe Flash. Originally, the most distinguishing feature of S60 phones was that they allowed users to install new applications after purchase. Unlike a standard desktop platform, however, the built-in apps are rarely upgraded by the vendor beyond bug fixes. New features are only added to phones while they are being developed rather than after public release. Certain buttons are standardized, such as a menu key, a four way joystick or d-pad, left and right soft keys and a clear key.
S60 is mainly used by Nokia but has also been used by a few other manufacturers, including Lenovo, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Samsung,[tpl]citation | url = http://www.s60.com/life/thisiss60/S60forbusiness/licensees | title = Licensees | publisher = S60[/tpl] Sendo,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.golem.de/0310/28067.html|language=German|publisher=Golem.de|title=Symbian-Smartphone von Sendo mit Digitalkamera samt Blitz|accessdate=15 January 2011|date=21 October 2003|first=Ingo|last=Pakalski[/tpl] and Siemens Mobile.

A hygrometer [tpl]IPAc-en|UK|h|aɪ|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɒ|m|ɪ|t|ə[/tpl] is an instrument used for measuring the moisture content in the atmosphere. Humidity measurement instruments usually rely on measurements of some other quantity such as temperature, pressure, mass or a mechanical or electrical change in a substance as moisture is absorbed. By calibration and calculation, these measured quantities can lead to a measurement of humidity. Modern electronic devices use temperature of condensation (the dew point), or changes in electrical capacitance or resistance to measure humidity differences.

Nikolay Ivanovich Bobrikov ([tpl]lang-ru|Никола́й Ива́нович Бо́бриков[/tpl]); [tpl]OldStyleDate|January 27|1839|January 15[/tpl] in St. Petersburg – June 17, 1904 in Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland) was a Russian soldier and politician.[tpl]cite journal | first1 = George B. | last1 = Kauffman | first2 = Lauri | last2 =  Niinistö | authorlink1 = George B.

Bobrikov became an officer in the Russian army in 1858 after which he served in the Kazan military district and as divisional chief-of-staff in Novgorod. He became a colonel in 1869. A year later he was transferred to Saint Petersburg for special duties in the Imperial guard. This gave Bobrikov access to the Imperial court. In 1878 he became a Major General.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
In 1898, Tsar Nicholas II appointed Bobrikov as the Governor-General of Finland. Bobrikov was both hated and feared by the Finnish population as he thought that Finland was still a foreign country that threatened Russia. In 1899,  Nicholas II signed the "February Manifesto" which marks the beginning of the first "Years of Oppression" ([tpl]lang|fi|sortovuodet[/tpl]). In this manifesto the Tsar decreed that the laws of the Empire take higher order of precedence than the laws of Finland. Half a million Finns signed a petition to Nicholas II requesting to revoke the manifesto. The Tsar didn't even receive the delegation bringing the petition.
In 1900, Bobrikov issued orders that all correspondence between government offices was to be conducted in Russian and that education in the Russian language was to be increased in schools. The Finnish army was abolished in 1901, and Finnish conscripts could now be forced to serve with Russian troops anywhere in the Russian empire. To the first call up in 1902, only 42% of the conscripts showed up. In 1905, conscription in Finland was abolished since Finns were seen as unreliable.
In 1903, Bobrikov was given dictatorial powers by the Tsar so that he could fire government officials and abolish newspapers. On June 16, 1904 Bobrikov was assassinated by Eugen Schauman in Helsinki. Schaumann shot Bobrikov thrice and himself twice. Schauman died instantly and Bobrikov died later that night in the hospital.
Bobrikov's assassination took place on the same day that is described in James Joyce's novel Ulysses. It is briefly mentioned in this book and also alluded to in Joyce's last work, Finnegans Wake.

[[Anvil]]
CATEGORIES: Metalworking tools, Lithics, Workbenches

An anvil is a basic tool, a block with a hard surface on which another object is struck. The block is as massive as it is practical, because the higher the inertia of the anvil, the more efficiently it causes the energy of the striking tool to be transferred to the work piece.  In most cases the anvil is used as a forging tool.  Before the advent of modern welding technology, it was a primary tool of metal workers.Hahn, Robert. Archaeology and the Origins of Philosophy. Publisher: State University of New York Press  2010. ISBN 978-1438431659King James Version ISAIAH 41:7
The great majority of modern anvils are made from steel, as well as cast iron or a combination of iron and steel.  
Because anvils are very ancient tools and were at one time very commonplace, they have acquired symbolic meaning beyond their use as utilitarian objects.
The principle of the anvil also is of particular interest in biology and in ethology; the anvil being in principle one of the most basic forms of tool, its application occurs particularly widely in living organisms.

Stories of him as a fighter and frontiersman, both real and fictitious, have made him a legendary figure in Texas history and a folk hero of American culture.
Born in Kentucky, Bowie spent most of his life in Louisiana, where he was raised and where he later worked as a land speculator. His rise to fame began in 1827 on reports of the Sandbar Fight. What began as a duel between two other men deteriorated into a melée in which Bowie, having been shot and stabbed, killed the sheriff of Rapides Parish with a large knife. This, and other stories of Bowie's prowess with a knife, led to the widespread popularity of the Bowie knife.
Bowie's reputation was cemented by his role in the Texas Revolution.  After moving to Texas in 1830, Bowie became a Mexican citizen and married Ursula Veramendi, the daughter of the Mexican vice governor of the province. His fame in Texas grew following his failed expedition to find the lost San Saba mine, during which his small party repelled an attack by a large Indian raiding party. At the outbreak of the Texas Revolution, Bowie joined the Texas militia, leading forces at the Battle of Concepción and the Grass Fight. In January 1836, he arrived at the Alamo, where he commanded the volunteer forces until an illness left him bedridden. Bowie died with the other Alamo defenders on March 6. Despite conflicting accounts of the manner of his death, the "most popular, and probably the most accurate" accounts maintain that he died in his bed after emptying his pistols into several Mexican soldiers.

The drongos are a family of small passerine birds of the Old World tropics, the Dicruridae. This family was sometimes[tpl]clarify|date=January 2011[/tpl] much enlarged to include a number of largely Australasian groups, such as the Australasian fantails, monarchs and paradise flycatchers. The name is originally from the indigenous language of Madagascar, where it refers to local species, but is now used to refer to all members of the family.[tpl]cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Lindsey, Terence|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 223–224|isbn= 1-85391-186-0[/tpl] The family is usually treated as having two genera, Chaetorhynchus and Dicrurus. The genus Chaetorhynchus contains a single species, the New Guinea endemic Pygmy Drongo. The placement of this species in the family is highly dubious due to both morphological and genetic differences, and it has recently been placed, along with the closely related Silktail of Fiji, with the fantails (Rhipiduridae).[tpl]cite journal|last=Irested|first=Martin|year=2009|title=The systematic affinity of the enigmatic Lamprolia victoriae (Aves: Passeriformes)—An example of avian dispersal between New Guinea and Fiji over Miocene intermittent land bridges? |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|coauthors=Fuchs J; Jønsson KA; Ohlson JI; Pasquet E & Per G.P.

The family Dicruridae is believed to be most likely of Indo Malayan origin, with a colonization of Africa about 15 million years ago. Dispersal across the Wallace Line into Australasia is estimated to have been more recent, around 6 mya.Eric Pasquet, Jean-Marc Pons, Jerome Fuchs, Corinne Cruaud, Vincent Bretagnolle (2007) Evolutionary history and biogeography of the drongos (Dicruridae), a tropical Old World clade of corvoid passerines. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 45:158–167
These insectivorous birds are usually found in open forests or bush. Most are black or dark grey in colour, sometimes with metallic tints. They have long forked tails; some Asian species have elaborate tail decorations. They have short legs and sit very upright whilst perched, like a shrike. They flycatch or take prey from the ground. Some Drongos, especially the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo, are noted for their ability to mimic other birds and even mammals.
Two to four eggs are laid in a nest high in a tree. Despite their small size, they are aggressive and fearless, and will attack much larger species if their nest or young are threatened.
The word drongo is used in Australia as a mild form of insult tantamount to the term "idiot". This term derives from a racehorse in the 1920's that did not win in 47 starts.Urbandictionary.com

Second generation 2G cellular telecom networks were commercially launched on the GSM standard in Finland by Radiolinja (now part of Elisa Oyj) in 1991.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.elisa.com/english/index.cfm?t=6&o=6532.50 |title=Radiolinja's History |date=April 20, 2004 |accessdate=December 23, 2009[/tpl] Three primary benefits of 2G networks over their predecessors were that phone conversations were digitally encrypted; 2G systems were significantly more efficient on the spectrum allowing for far greater mobile phone penetration levels; and 2G introduced data services for mobile, starting with SMS text messages. 2G technologies enabled the various mobile phone networks to provide the services such as text messages, picture messages and MMS (multi media messages). All text messages sent over 2G are digitally encrypted, allowing for the transfer of data in such a way that only the intended receiver can receive and read it.
After 2G was launched, the previous mobile telephone systems were retrospectively dubbed 1G. While radio signals on 1G networks are analog, radio signals on 2G networks are digital. Both systems use digital signaling to connect the radio towers (which listen to the handsets) to the rest of the telephone system.
2G has been superseded by newer technologies such as 2.5G, 2.75G, 3G, and 4G; however, 2G networks are still used in many parts of the world.

[[Manganese nodule]]
CATEGORIES: Underwater mining, Manganese minerals

Polymetallic nodules, also called manganese nodules, are rock concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core.  The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by crystallization.  When visible to the naked eye, it can be a small test (shell) of a microfossil (radiolarian or foraminifer), a phosphatized shark tooth, basalt debris or even fragments of earlier nodules.
Nodules vary in size from tiny particles visible only under a microscope to large pellets more than [tpl]convert|20|cm|in|0[/tpl] across.  However, most nodules are between [tpl]convert|5|and|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter, about the size of potatoes.  Their surface is generally smooth, sometimes rough, mammilated (knobby) or otherwise irregular.  The bottom, buried in sediment, is generally rougher than the top.

Donald Lamont Jack (6 December 1924 – 2 June 2003) was a Canadian novelist and playwright. 
He was born in Radcliffe, Bury, England and grew up in Britain, attending the well regarded Bury Grammar School and Marr College and later serving in the RAF in World War II (1943–47).
After the war he emigrated to Canada in 1951, and became a Canadian citizen in 1964. From 1955-57 he was a scriptwriter for Crawley Films. After 1957 he became a full-time freelance writer.
He wrote for the stage, radio, and for television programs such as General Motors Theatre, The Unforeseen, Playdate, Hatch's Mill, The Forest Rangers, and On Camera, but he is most famous for his novels, the Bandy Papers, which recount the humorous adventures of Bartholomew Bandy, a World War I fighter pilot. His play The Canvas Barricade was the first Canadian play produced at the Stratford Festival of Canada. Other stage plays included Exit Muttering, Crash, and Minuet for Brass Band. He had 39 TV plays produced, 22 radio plays, and numerous documentaries. Most of Jack's book-length works are being re-published, or published for the first time, by Sybertooth.

CATEGORIES: Edible fungi, Cantharellus

Cantharellus is a genus of popular edible mushrooms, commonly known as chanterelles[tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|ʃ|æ|n|t|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|l[/tpl]. They are mycorrhizal fungi, meaning they form symbiotic associations with plants, making them very difficult to cultivate. Caution must be used when identifying chanterelles for consumption due to lookalikes, such as the Jack-O-Lantern species (Omphalotus olearius and others), which can make a person very ill. Despite this, chanterelles are one of the most recognized and harvested groups of edible mushrooms.
Many species of chanterelles contain antioxidant carotenoids, such as beta-carotene in C. cibarius and C. minor, and canthaxanthin in C. cinnabarinus and C. friesii.  They also contain significant amounts of vitamin D.
The name comes from the Greek kantharos meaning "tankard" or "cup".chanterelle at dictionary.com

"Article 35 .- The denominations successively adopted from 1810 to the present, namely: United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Argentine Republic, Argentine Confederation, shall henceforth be interchangeably official names to describe the Government and territory of the provinces, using the words "Argentine Nation" for the making and the enactment of laws." It was the name of the country from 1831 to 1852, when the provinces organized themselves as a confederation, without a head of state. The governor of Buenos Aires Province (Juan Manuel de Rosas during most of the period) managed the foreign relation during the time. Under his rule, the Argentine Confederation resisted wars from Bolivia, Uruguay, France and Britain, as well as attacks of other Argentine factions during the Argentine Civil Wars. 
Rosas was ousted from power in 1852 by Justo José de Urquiza, after the battle of Caseros. Urquiza convened the 1853 Constituent Assembly to write a national constitution. Buenos Aires resisted Urquiza and seceded from the Confederation in 1852, becoming the State of Buenos Aires; the province would return to Argentina in 1861.Galasso, pp. 335-360

Middle management is the intermediate management of a hierarchical organization, being subordinate to the senior management but above the lowest levels of operational staff.  Operational supervisors may be considered middle management or may be categorized as non-management staff, depending upon the policy of the particular organization.[tpl]citation | title=Middle Managers | author=Peter Aucoin | publisher=Institute of Public Administration of Canada | year=1989 | page=191 | isbn=9780920715024[/tpl]
Middle management may be reduced in organizations as a result of reorganization.  Such changes include downsizing, delayering and outsourcing.  The changes may be made in order to reduce costs, as middle management is commonly paid more than junior staff, or the changes may be made to make the organization flatter — empowering the employees and making the organization more innovative and flexible.

Hiawatha National Forest is a [tpl]convert|894836|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] National Forest in the Upper Peninsula of the state of Michigan in the United States.  Commercial logging is conducted in some areas.  The United States Forest Service administers this National Forest; it is physically divided into two subunits, commonly called the Eastside [tpl]coord|46|14|N|84|50|W|display=inline[/tpl] and Westside [tpl]coord|46|08|N|86|40|W|display=inline[/tpl]. In descending order of land area it lies in parts of Chippewa, Delta, Mackinac, Alger, Schoolcraft, and Marquette counties. Chippewa and Mackinac counties are in the Eastside, whereas the rest are in the Westside. The smaller Eastside contains about 44% of the forest's area, whereas the larger Westside has about 56%. Forest headquarters are located in Escanaba, Michigan. Eastside ranger district offices are located in Sault Ste. Marie and St. Ignace, while Westside offices are in Manistique, Munising, and Rapid River.USFS Ranger Districts by State
Eastside was a large infertile sandy area that was never homesteaded or developed. It was designated Marquette National Forest by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909. This land was administered with Huron National Forest as the Michigan National Forest from 1918 intil 1962, when it was transferred to Hiawatha. The forest was authorized to buy an additional [tpl]convert|307000|acre|ha|-2[/tpl] in 1925 and [tpl]convert|50000|acre|ha|-1[/tpl] in 1935. Westside began being purchased in 1928 and was designated Hiawatha National Forest in 1931. This unit was extensively replanted by the Civilian Conservation Corps.
The forest has over [tpl]convert|100|mi|km[/tpl] of shoreline. Both east and west units have shoreline on both Lake Superior and Lake Michigan; the east unit also has shoreline on Lake Huron and includes Round Island and its lighthouse. The west unit borders Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, which is administered by the National Park Service, and the Grand Island National Recreation Area, which is separately administered by the U.S. Forest Service. 
Several lighthouses are located along the shores.  The Point Iroquois Light is operated as a museum.National Park Service, Hiawatha National Forest, Iroquois Light and Museum The segment of the 4,600-mile-long North Country Trail passes through the forest.
The Hiawatha National Forest contains six designated wilderness areas:
There are five National Wild and Scenic Rivers in the Forest: Carp River, Indian River, Sturgeon River, Tahquamenon River (East Branch), Whitefish River.
According to the forest service, it was "Named after the Mohawk chief, Hiawatha, who brought about the confederation known as the Five Nations of the Iroquois.

[[Program management]]

CATEGORIES: Project management, Programs

Program management or programme management is the process of managing several related projects, often with the intention of improving an organization's performance. In practice and in its aims it is often closely related to systems engineering and industrial engineering.
The Program Manager has oversight of the purpose and status of all projects in a Program and can use this oversight to support project-level activity to ensure the overall program goals are likely to be met, possibly by providing a decision-making capacity that cannot be achieved at project level or by providing the Project Manager with a program perspective when required, or as a sounding board for ideas and approaches to solving project issues that have program impacts. Typically in a program there is a need to identify and manage cross-project dependencies and often the PMO (Program or Project Management Office) may not have sufficient insight of the risk, issues, requirements, design or solution to be able to usefully manage these. The Program manager may be well placed to provide this insight by actively seeking out such information from the Project Managers although in large and/or complex projects, a specific role may be required.  However this insight arises, the Program Manager needs this in order to be comfortable that the overall program goals are achievable.
There are two different views of how programmes differ from projects.
On one view, projects deliver outputs, discrete parcels or "chunks" of change;All Change Eddie Obeng Financial Times Publishing 1994 programs create outcomes.The Gower Handbook of Programme Management On this view, a project might deliver a new factory, hospital or IT system. By combining these projects with other deliverables and changes, their programs might deliver increased income from a new product, shorter waiting lists at the hospital or reduced operating costs due to improved technology.
The other viewThe Definitive Guide to Project Management. Nokes, Sebastian. London (Financial Times / Prentice Hall): 2007 is that a program is nothing more than either a large project or a set (or portfolio) of projects. On this second view, the point of having a program is to exploit economies of scale and to reduce coordination costs and risks. The project manager's job is to ensure that their project succeeds. The program manager, on the other hand, may not care about individual projects, but is concerned with the aggregate result or end-state. For example, in a financial institution a program may include one project that is designed to take advantage of a rising market, and another to protect against the downside of a falling market. These projects are opposites with respect to their success conditions, but they fit together in the same program.
According to the view that programs deliver outcomes but projects deliver outputs, program management is concerned with doing the right projects.  The program manager has been described as 'playing chess' and keeping the overview in mind, with the pieces to be used or sacrificed being the projects.Putting Strategy to Work Eddie Obeng Financial Times Publishing 1996  In contrast, project management is about doing projects right. And also according to this view, successful projects deliver on time, to budget and to specification, whereas successful programs deliver long term improvements to an organization. Improvements are usually identified through benefits. An organization should select the group of programs that most take it towards its strategic aims while remaining within its capacity to deliver the changes. On the other hand, the view that programs are simply large projects or a set of projects allows that a program may need to deliver tangible benefits quickly.
Consider the following set of projects:
One view has it that these are different projects within a program. But in practice they can just as well be managed as sub-projects within a single project. Which approach to choose? Program and project management are both practical disciplines, and the answer to such a question must be "whatever works." What works depends very much on the nature of the organization in which the project or program is run. Typically a program is broken down into projects that reflect the organization's structure. The design project will be run by the design team, the factory will manage the modifications to the production line, and so on. Organizational structure and organizational culture are key factors in how to structure a program.
The distinction between the terms "outcome" and "output" is far from clear, except in a trivial sense. Each of the projects listed in the example above is designed to deliver some 'thing', known as a 'deliverable' or an 'output', and together they improve the organization. Where one draws the line between the complete single benefit that causes the improvement and its component parts is partly a matter of preference and partly a matter of the culture and structure of the organization.  Either way, benefits will normally be enjoyed long after the end of the program and all of its component projects. The point is that to achieve maximum benefits, there must be an integration of parts into a whole. Whether this integration is managed in something that is called a project or a program is of secondary importance to understanding the benefits and managing the process of integration well.
Many programs are concerned with delivering a capability to change. Only when that capability is transferred to the line management and utilized by the host organization will the benefits actually be delivered. On this view, a program team cannot, on their own, deliver benefits. Benefits can only be delivered through the utilization of a new capability.
Programs are normally designed to deliver the organization's strategy, such as an ambition to be the fourth biggest supermarket in a region by 2015 or reduce wastage by 5% in two year's time.
According to Project Management Institute (PMI), The Standard for Program Management, 2nd Ed., "A Program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits and control NOT available from managing them individually.  Programs may include elements of related work outside of the scope of the discreet projects in the program...  Some projects within a program can deliver useful incremental benefits to the organization before the program itself has completed."
Program management also emphasizes the coordinating and prioritizing of resources across projects, managing links between the projects and the overall costs and risks of the program.
Program management may provide a layer above the management of projects and focuses on selecting the best group of projects, defining them in terms of their objectives and providing an environment where projects can be run successfully. Program managers should not micromanage, but should leave project management to the project managers.
In public sector work in  Europe, the term normally refers to multiple change projects: projects that are designed to deliver benefits to the host organization. For example, the Office of Government Commerce for the UK government. An alternative to the Office of Government Commerce's methodology for program management is that of the private sector Project Management Institute.
Many organizations only run one program at a time, a program containing all their projects. In Project Management Institute terminology, this is more likely to be a project portfolio than a program.   Some larger organizations may have multiple programs each designed to deliver a range of improvements. Some organizations use the concept of Systems Engineering where others use program management.
Types of Projects according to aggregate project plan (Wheelwright & Clark - 1992):
1. Derivative Projects
2. Platform Projects
3. Breakthrough Projects
4. R&D Projects

[[Management consulting]]
CATEGORIES: Consulting occupations, Strategic management, Management consulting

Management consulting, the practice of helping organizations to improve their performance, operates primarily through the analysis of existing organizational problems and the development of plans for improvement. Organizations may draw upon the services of management consultants for a number of reasons, including gaining external (and presumably objective) advice and access to the consultants' specialized expertise.
As a result of their exposure to and relationships with numerous organizations, consulting firms are also said[tpl]by whom|date=February 2014[/tpl] to be aware of industry "best practices", although the specific nature of situations under consideration may limit the transferability of such practices from one organization to another.
Consultancies may also provide organizational change management assistance, development of coaching skills, process analysis, technology implementation, strategy development, or operational improvement services.  Management consultants often bring their own proprietary methodologies or frameworks to guide the identification of problems and to serve as the basis for recommendations for more effective or efficient ways of performing work tasks.

[[Senior management]]
CATEGORIES: Management, Management occupations, Human resource management

Senior management, executive management, or management team is generally a team of individuals at the highest level of organizational management who have the day-to-day responsibilities of managing a company or corporation. They hold specific executive powers conferred onto them with and by authority of the board of directors and/or the shareholders. There are most often higher levels of responsibility, such as a board of directors and those who own the company (shareholders), but they focus on managing the senior or executive management instead of the day-to-day activities of the business. The executive management typically consists of the heads of the firm's product and/or geographic units and of functional executives such as the chief financial officer, the chief operating officer, and the chief strategy officer.Menz, M. 2012.

[[History of rail transport in Great Britain]]

CATEGORIES: Rail transport in Great Britain, History of rail transport in Great Britain

The railway system of Great Britain, the principal territory of the United Kingdom, is the oldest in the world. The system was originally built as a patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies. These isolated links developed during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network, although still run by dozens of competing companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see railway mania). The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed. However, the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network. In 1923, almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the "big four", the Great Western Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway. The "Big Four" were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.
From the start of 1948, the "big four" were nationalised to form British Railways. Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Declining passenger numbers and financial losses in the late 1950s and early 1960s prompted the closure of many branch and main lines, and small stations, under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services experienced a renaissance with the introduction of high-speed inter-city trains in the 1970s. The 1980s saw severe cuts in government funding and above-inflation increases in fares and the service became more cost-effective [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]. Railway operations were privatised during 1994-1997. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to Railtrack, whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the freight services sold outright. Passenger levels have since increased to above the level they had been at in the late-1940s. The Hatfield accident set in motion the series of events that resulted in the ultimate collapse of Railtrack and its replacement with Network Rail, a state-owned, not-for-dividend company.

[[The Topper (comics)]]
CATEGORIES: DC Thomson Comics titles, British comics, Defunct British comics, Comics anthologies, British humour comics

The Topper was a UK comic published by D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd that ran from 7 February 1953 to 15 September 1990, when it merged with The Beezer.
A strip named "Mickey the Monkey" originally graced the front cover. In the  early 1970s, it was replaced by "Send for Kelly". That strip was replaced with "Danny's Tranny" in 1975, and then "Tricky Dicky" in 1979. "Beryl the Peril" took over on 24 May 1986, and remained there until the merger with The Beezer.
Unlike most other comics at the time, which were half tabloid size, the Topper was for many years full tabloid. It changed to A4 in 1980, one year before The Beezer.
Two comics were merged into The Topper during its run: these were Buzz in 1975 and Sparky in 1977.
The Topper also produced an annual collection (see The Topper Book).

Airplane inventors Wilbur and Orville Wright are famed for making the first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flights on 17 December 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Lesser-known are other flights of theirs which played an important role at the dawn of aviation history. In 1909 Wilbur was invited by the Hudson-Fulton Celebration Committee to make paid exhibition flights to help mark 300 years of New York history, including Henry Hudson discovering Manhattan and Robert Fulton starting a successful commercial steamboat service on the Hudson River. The committee wanted the Wrights to demonstrate flights over the water around New York City. Orville was making flights for customers in Germany, so Wilbur, who had just finished training U.S. Army pilots, accepted the job.

Stephen Thomas Ward (19 October 1912 – 3 August 1963) was an English osteopath and artist who was one of the central figures in the 1963 Profumo affair, a British political scandal which brought about the resignation of John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and contributed to the defeat of the Conservative government a year later. 
In 1945 Ward began practising osteopathy in London,   and rapidly became successful and fashionable, with many distinguished clients. In his spare time he also studied at the Slade School, and developed a talent for sketching portraits which provided a profitable sideline. His practice and his art brought considerable social success, and he made  many important friends. Among these was Lord Astor, at whose country house, Cliveden, in the summer of 1961, Ward introduced Profumo to a 19-year-old showgirl and night-club model, Christine Keeler. Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson,  embarked on a brief affair with Keeler, most of their assignations taking place in Ward's home in Wimpole Mews.
Ward's friendship with the Russian military attaché Eugene Ivanov, known by MI5 to be an intelligence officer, drew him to the attention of British intelligence, who sought to use him in an attempt to secure Ivanov's defection. The matter became complicated when, through Ward, Ivanov met Keeler, raising the possibility of a Profumo-Keeler Ivanov triangle. Profumo ended the relationship with Keeler, which remained largely unsuspected until early in 1963, when the  disintegration of Keeler's private life brought matters to public and press attention. Profumo denied any impropriety in a statement to the House of Commons, but a few weeks later admits his affair. He resigned his ministerial office and his parliamentary seat. Amid a range of rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society. the police began to investigate Ward. In June 1963 he was charged with immorality offences and committed to trial.  
In the trial that followed, in July 1963, Ward was abandoned by his society friends and exposed to the contempt and hostility of prosecuting counsel and judge. Despite the relative paucity of evidence and the dismissal of most of the charges against him, he was convicted on two counts of living off immoral earnings. However, before the verdict was announced, Ward took an overdose of sleeping pills and died three days later. The death was accepted as suicide at the time, though later theories have raised a suggestion that he could have been killed on the orders of MI5. The trial has been disparaged as a travesty of justice, an act of Establishment revenge for the fall of Profumo and the government's embarrassment. In 2014 the verdict was under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, with a view to a possible appeal.

[[Terentianus]]

CATEGORIES: Grammarians of Latin, Moroccan writers, Moroccan linguists

Terentianus, surnamed Maurus (a native of Mauretania) was Latin grammarian and writer on prosody who flourished probably at the end of the 2nd century AD.
His references to Septimius Serenus and Alphius Avitus, who belonged to the school of "new poets" (poetae neoterici or novelli) of the reign of Hadrian and later, seem to show that he was a near contemporary of those writers. He was the author of a treatise (incomplete) in four books (written chiefly in hexameters), on letters, syllables, feet and metres, of which considerable use was made by later writers on similar subjects. The most important part of it is that which deals with metres, based on the work of Caesius Bassus, the friend of Persius.
By some authorities Terentianus has been identified with the prefect of Syene mentioned in Martial (i. 86), which would make his date about a century earlier; others, again, who placed Petronius at the end of the 3rd century (a date no longer held), assigned Terentianus to the same period, from his frequent references to that author.

HMS ''Splendid was a Royal Navy nuclear-powered fleet submarine of the Swiftsure class. HMS Splendid'' was launched at Barrow on 5 October 1979, by Lady Eberle, wife of Admiral Sir James Eberle, then Commander-in-Chief Fleet. The boat was built by Vickers Shipbuilding Groups and was under the command of Commander R C Lane-Nott.
Since her launch in 1979, she has taken part in many conflicts involving British forces around the globe.
Her first major conflict came in 1982 when Argentinian forces invaded the British held Falkland Islands. Splendid was one of the first submarines to reach the islands, arriving mid April, after sailing from Faslane. Unlike HMS Conqueror, Splendid did not directly engage Argentinian forces, she did however provide valuable reconnaissance to the British Task Force on Argentine aircraft movements. Splendid[tpl]'[/tpl]s presence along with HMS Conqueror effectively restricted the freedom of action of the Argentine Navy which spent most of the war confined to port.
In the late 1990s, Splendid became the first British ship to be armed with American-built Tomahawk cruise missiles. In 1999 the BBC were allowed on board to record her firing Tomahawks in battle against Yugoslav targets in Belgrade during the Kosovo War, becoming the first British submarine in the conflict to do so. She again fired these weapons against Iraqi targets in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Hero's welcome for sub crew
In July 2003, HMS Splendid returned to her home at Faslane Naval Base on the River Clyde in Scotland. She was decommissioned in HMNB Devonport, Plymouth in 2004 due to defence cuts. Commander Burke was later awarded the OBE for his leadership of HMS Splendid in the Gulf.

The dish is prized for the thin, crisp skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Ducks bred specially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven. The meat is eaten with scallion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the fillings. Sometimes pickled raddish is also inside, and other sauces (like hoisin sauce) can be used.
Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names. The two both have their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.[ref]"Now the owners of the 148-year-old restaurant plan to diversify into a multi-brand catering service provider that taps both high-end and mass markets."

The Commodore 1540 (also known as the VIC-1540) introduced in 1982[tpl]cite web|title=Chronology of Personal Computers (1982) |url=http://pctimeline.info/comp1982.htm |date=2013-05-18|accessdate=2013-06-18|publisher=pctimeline.info|quote=Commodore International releases the 1540 Single-Drive Floppy for the VIC-20. 804.17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Commodore VIC-20 computer |url=http://oldcomputers.net/vic20.html |date=2010-11-08|accessdate=2013-06-18|publisher=oldcomputers.net|quote=1982: Commodore releases the 1540 Single-Drive Floppy for the VIC-20.[/tpl] was the companion floppy disk drive for the Commodore VIC-20 home computer. It used single-sided 5¼" floppy disks, on which it stored roughly [tpl]nowrap|170 kB[/tpl] of data utilizing Commodore's GCR data encoding scheme.  The launch price in Germany was [tpl]nowrap|1898 DM[/tpl] (approximate [tpl]nowrap|970 EUR).[/tpl]  The American version is named [tpl]nowrap|VIC 1540[/tpl] and the German version [tpl]nowrap|VC 1540.[/tpl]
Because of the low price of both the VIC-20 and the 1540, this combination was the first computer with a disk drive to be offered on the US market for less than [tpl]nowrap|1000 USD,[/tpl] although the combination of the Commodore 64 and 1541 would prove more enduring.  The 1540 was an "intelligent peripheral" in that it had its own MOS Technology 6502 CPU (just like its VIC-20 host) and the resident Commodore DOS on board in ROM – contrary to almost all other home computer systems of the time, where the DOS was loaded from a boot floppy¹ and was executed on the computer's CPU.
Due to a timing conflict with the C64's video chip, the C64 did not work properly with the 1540. The better-known 1541 was mechanically and electronically identical to the 1540 but had a revised ROM that permitted it to work with the C64 by slowing the drive down slightly. However, it was possible to revert the 1541 into 1540 mode with a Commodore BASIC software command (OPEN 15,8,15, "UI-" : CLOSE 15) to permit better speed when used with a VIC-20.
The 1540 is relatively rare. While cheaper than most other drives of the day, it was more expensive than the VIC computer itself, and the disk media were also still relatively pricey. Also, the relatively small memory of the VIC meant that the faster program loading times of the drive did not gain more than a few seconds compared to tape media. Thirdly, almost all commercial software for the VIC-20 was sold on cartridge or cassette tape media, giving low incentive to buy a floppy drive. The C64 followed close on the heels of the VIC-20, quickly discontinuing the 1540. Most 1540s still in existence were modified with a 1541 ROM so it would work with a C64. Unmodified 1540s are now considered collector's items.

[[Ironstone]]
CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

Ironstone is a sedimentary rock, either deposited directly as a ferruginous sediment or created by chemical replacement, that contains a substantial proportion of an iron compound from which iron either can be or once was smelted commercially. This term is customarily restricted to hard coarsely banded, nonbanded, and noncherty sedimentary rocks of post-Precambrian age. The Precambrian deposits, which have a different origin, are generally known as banded iron formations. The iron minerals comprising ironstones can consist either of oxides, i.e. limonite, hematite, and magnetite; carbonates, i.e. siderite; silicates, i.e. chamosite; or some combination of these minerals.U.S. Bureau of Mines Staff (1996) Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, & Related Terms.

Stephen Decatur, Sr. (June 1751 – November 11, 1808) was an American naval captain in the Revolutionary War and later in the Quasi-War.  He was the father of Stephen Decatur, Jr.
Born in Newport, Rhode Island, Decatur was a merchant captain before the Revolution. He married Ann Pine; in addition to their famous son, they had two other children, Lieutenant James Decatur, who was killed in action in 1804 during the Barbary Wars, and Ann Decatur McKnight.
During the American Revolution he commanded the Royal Louis, the Comet, the Retaliation, the Rising Sun, and the Fair American.MacKenzie, 1846 p.9
With the outbreak of the Quasi War with France, Decatur was commissioned as a captain in the United States Navy on May 11, 1798.
He commanded the ship USS Delaware and sailed in the first American Navy fleet to cross the Atlantic along with his son Stephen Decatur Jr.MacKenzie, 1846 p.22
In 1800, Decatur commissioned Philadelphia, the very vessel that his son later burned several months after it ran aground and was captured near Tripoli harbor in 1803.
In accordance with the Peace Establishment Act of 1801, which greatly reduced the United States Army and Navy, Decatur was discharged from the Navy on October 22, 1801.
He died in 1808, at his country home "Millsdale" in Frankford, Pennsylvania.  He is interred next to his famous son at St. Peter's Church in Philadelphia.

Joseph Roberts "Joey" Smallwood, PC, CC (December 24, 1900 – December 17, 1991) was a politician from Newfoundland, Canada.  He was the main force that brought the then Dominion of Newfoundland into the Canadian confederation in 1949, becoming the first Premier of Newfoundland, serving until 1972. As premier, he vigorously promoted economic development, championed the welfare state, and emphasized modernization of education and transportation. Smallwood abandoned his youthful socialism and collaborated with bankers, turning against the militant unions that sponsored numerous strikes. The results of his efforts to promote industrialization were mixed, with the most favourable results in hydroelectricity, iron mining and paper mills.
Smallwood was charismatic and controversial. Never shy, he dubbed himself "the last Father of Confederation." While many Canadians today remember Smallwood as the man who brought Newfoundland into the Canadian Confederation, the opinion held by Newfoundlanders and their diaspora remains sharply divided as to his legacy.

[[AC Propulsion tzero]]

CATEGORIES: Automotive technologies, Electric sports cars, Proposed electric vehicles, Sports cars

The tzero is a handmade electric sports car that was produced in limited numbers by the U.S. company AC Propulsion. The tzero is based on the Piontek Sportech kit car, which consists of a fiberglass body built over a reinforced steel space frame with double wishbone independent suspension and rack and pinion steering. AC Propulsion added the AC-150 drivetrain, a single-speed electric system with an overall gear ratio of 9:1. Launched in January 1997, only three prototypes were built and plans for commercial production were dropped in mid-2003. The name comes from t0, the mathematical symbol for a starting point in time.
The original version of the roadster runs on 28 Optima Yellow Top Lead Acid batteries which produce 150 kW (200 horsepower) and 177 lbs·ft (240 N·m) of torque at 336 volts (this 28 * 12 V battery-equivalent) which rockets the 1040 kg car from 0 to 60 mph in 4.07 seconds. The single gear ratio limits the car's maximum speed to [tpl]convert|90|mph|km/h[/tpl] at 12,000 rpm, although it is said that early prototypes fitted with multiple gear ratios could hit [tpl]convert|155|mph|km/h[/tpl]. Even with the single ratio, lead-acid models are capable of completing a quarter mile (400 m) drag race in 13.24 seconds. The expected range per charge of the tzero with the lead-acid batteries is [tpl]convert|80|to|100|mi|km[/tpl] as a result of consuming only 180 watt hours per mile (895 J/km) (DC) on the highway and due to regenerative braking. Within a single hour, the car can be charged from 0-95%. The base price of this version was to have been USD $80,000.
A second prototype was built in August 2003, powered by 6,800 lightweight lithium-ion cells, similar to those that make up the battery packs of laptop computers, giving it a [tpl]convert|300|mi|km[/tpl] range. Lighter than the original version by [tpl]convert|700|lb|kg[/tpl], the 2003 edition goes from 0-60 mph in 3.6 seconds. The single gear ratio limits the car's maximum speed to just over [tpl]convert|140|mph|km/h[/tpl] at 13,000 rpm with proper gearing, though it has never been tested at greater than [tpl]convert|105|mph|km/h[/tpl]. The base price of the car was USD $220,000.
Because the car recharges its batteries when the throttle is released — slowing sharply as energy is recaptured — it can be driven hard using only the accelerator pedal. Also, if the car detects a turn with more than half a g-force (5 m/s²), it eases the rear-wheel regenerative braking to prevent slides.
AC Propulsion also produced a portable internal combustion powered generator mounted on a trailer known as the Long Ranger that could be towed behind the car and feed power to the batteries during travel. The trailer used a 500 cc Kawasaki engine with a 9.5 U.S. gallon (40 liter) fuel tank and achieved 30 to 35 mpg over at least 20,000 highway miles. It is rated at 20 kW DC output and can maintain 60 to 80 mph. Video footage of the backtracking feature, which allows drivers to easily back a trailer through a set of slalom cones.
Due to high production costs, however, AC Propulsion ceased to produce the tzero. Only three still exist, one of which is owned by the company itself and the other two privately. The drivetrain was also used in the Wrightspeed X1.

Parcheesi is a brand name American adaptation of the Indian Cross and Circle game Pachisi.

[[Prism]]

CATEGORIES: Optical devices, Prisms

In optics, a prism is a transparent optical element with flat, polished surfaces that refract light. At least two of the flat surfaces must have an angle between them. The exact angles between the surfaces depend on the application. The traditional geometrical shape is that of a triangular prism with a triangular base and rectangular sides, and in colloquial use "prism" usually refers to this type. Some types of optical prism are not in fact in the shape of geometric prisms. Prisms can be made from any material that is transparent to the wavelengths for which they are designed. Typical materials include glass, plastic and fluorite.
A dispersive prism can be used to break light up into its constituent spectral colors (the colors of the rainbow).  Furthermore, prisms can be used to reflect light, or to split light into components with different polarizations.

CATEGORIES: Prismatoid polyhedra, Uniform polyhedra

In geometry, a prism is a polyhedron with an n-sided polygonal base, a translated copy (not in the same plane as the first), and n other faces (necessarily all parallelograms) joining corresponding sides of the two bases. All cross-sections parallel to the base faces are the same. Prisms are named for their base, so a prism with a pentagonal base is called a pentagonal prism. The prisms are a subclass of the prismatoids.

[[Parchís]]

CATEGORIES: Cross and circle games

Parchís ([tpl]lang-ca|parxís[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-eu|partxis[/tpl]) is a Spanish board game of the Cross and Circle family.  It is an adaptation of the Indian game Pachisi. 
Parchís was a very popular game in Spain at one point, and it is still popular specially among grown and senior people. Since it uses dice, Parchís is not usually regarded as an abstract strategy game like checkers or chess. It does not depend entirely on luck either, since the four pawns under a player's command demand some sort of strategy. 
Parchís is license-free in Spain, so in stores it is just as easy to find as a deck of cards, and is usually cheaper. Although the original game allows up to four players (that is, the board counts four colors: yellow, blue, red and green), six-player versions are not hard to find (adding orange and purple, in that order), and eight-player boards can be found in big toy stores.
Traditionally, each player has a cubilete (dice cup) to shake and toss the dice. This does not affect the course of the game itself, but most habitual players find it imperative. 
On the reverse of the board it is usual to find a board for the Game of the Goose.

The term anti-Americanism, or anti-American sentiment, refers to opposition or hostility to the policies, culture, society, economics, international, or superpower role of the United States. Common contemporary negative stereotypes of Americans include that Americans are: aggressive, arrogant, ignorant,  overweight, poorly dressed, materialistic, obsessed with making money, too moralistic, and generally obnoxious.William Russell Melton. The new American expat: thriving and surviving overseas in the post-9/11 world. Intercultural Press, 2005. p. XIX.
Political scientist Brendan O'Connor suggests that Anti-Americanism cannot be isolated as a consistent phenomenon and that the term originated as a rough composite of stereotypes, prejudices and criticisms towards Americans or the United States, evolving to more politically based criticism.  French scholar Marie-France Toinet says use of the term "is only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition – a sort of allergic reaction – to America as a whole".O'Connor, Brendan: "A Brief History of Anti-Americanism from Cultural Criticism to Terrorism", Australasian Journal of American Studies, July 2004, pp. 77–92
Discussions on anti-Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise definition of what the sentiment entails (other than a general disfavor), which has led to the term being used broadly and in an impressionistic manner, resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti-American.O'Connor, Brendan, p 89.

Lotus Organizer was a personal information manager (PIM). It was initially developed by Threadz, a small British software house, reaching version 3.0. Organizer was subsequently acquired by Lotus Development Corporation, for whom the package was a Windows-based replacement for Lotus Agenda. For several years it was the unquestioned market leader until it was gradually overtaken by Microsoft Outlook.
Organizer is notable for using the ″leather-bound personal organizer″ graphical metaphor for its user interface. It is often bundled within Lotus SmartSuite.

CATEGORIES: Personal information managers, Human–computer interaction, Information science

Personal information management (PIM) refers to the practice and the study of the activities people perform in order to acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use personal information items such as documents (paper-based and digital), web pages and email messages for everyday use to complete tasks (work-related or not) and fulfill a person’s various roles (as parent, employee, friend, member of community, etc.). There are six ways in which information can be personal:  
One ideal of PIM is that people should always have the right information in the right place, in the right form, and of sufficient completeness and quality to meet their current need. Technologies and tools such as personal information managers  help people spend less time with time-consuming and error-prone activities of PIM (such as looking for information). They then have more time to make creative, intelligent use of the information at hand in order to get things done, or to simply enjoy the information itself.

The Richmond District is a neighborhood in the northwest corner of San Francisco, California, developed initially in the late 19th century.  It is sandwiched between Presidio of San Francisco (north) and Golden Gate Park (south).  It is sometimes confused with Richmond, a city [tpl]convert|20|mi[/tpl] north of San Francisco.
With the Pacific Ocean  on its west, the Richmond is known for its foggy weather and colder climate due to the wind chills blowing from the ocean.  It is also home to a vast affluent Chinese population and its commercial strips on Geary Blvd. and Clement Street are commonly referred to as the second Chinatown and boasts more highly rated Chinese restaurants than Chinatown itself.
The Richmond also has deep Irish and Russian roots and has many Catholic and Orthodox churches.

The Fashoda Incident or Crisis was the climax of imperial territorial disputes between Britain and France in Eastern Africa, occurring in 1898. A French expedition to Fashoda on the White Nile sought to gain control of the Upper Nile and thereby exclude Britain from the Sudan, and possibly force the British out of Egypt as well.  The British held firm as Britain and France were on the verge of war. It ended in a diplomatic victory for the British. It gave rise to the 'Fashoda syndrome' in French foreign policy, or seeking to assert French influence in areas which might be becoming susceptible to British influence.

A juicer is a tool for separating juice from fruits, herbs, leafy greens and other types of vegetables from its pulp in a process called juicing. In separating the pulp, juicers concentrate the nutrition naturally present in fruits and vegetables which allows the body to more easily absorb the nutrition than digesting the solid produce. The use of juicers also makes it easier to consume more raw produce. Some juicers of the masticating or twin gear variety perform extra functions too, such as crushing herbs and spices, and extruding pasta.

Prince Ali Salman Aga Khan (June 13, 1911 – May 12, 1960), known as Aly Khan was a son of Aga Khan III, the head of the Nizārī Ismā'īlī Muslims, and the father of Aga Khan IV. A socialite, racehorse owner and jockey, he was the third husband of actress Rita Hayworth. After being passed over for succession as Aga Khan, he served as Pakistan's representative to the United Nations, where he became a vice president of the General Assembly.
His first name was typically spelled Aly in the press. The titles of prince and princess, which are claimed by children of the Aga Khan by virtue of their descent from the Qajar king Fath Ali Shah of the Persian Qajar dynasty, were recognized as courtesy titles by the British government in 1938.Edwards, Anne (1996).

[[Deep structure]]

CATEGORIES: Syntactic transformation, Generative linguistics

In linguistics, specifically in the study of syntax in the tradition of generative grammar (also known as transformational grammar), the deep structure of a linguistic expression is a theoretical construct that seeks to unify several related structures.  For example, the sentences "Pat loves Chris" and "Chris is loved by Pat" mean roughly the same thing and use similar words.  Some linguists, in particular Noam Chomsky, have tried to account for this similarity by positing that these two sentences are distinct surface forms that derive from a common deep structure.
In the first formulations of transformational grammar, active and passive pairs had identical deep structures. As the theory developed, it became necessary to mark whether a sentence was active or passive in the deep structure itself, with the result that active/passive pairs had almost-but-not-quite identical deep structures.
The concept of deep structure plays an important role in transformational grammar. In early transformational syntax, deep structures are derivation trees of a context free language.  These trees are then transformed by a sequence of tree rewriting operations ("transformations") into surface structures.  The terminal yield of a surface structure tree, the surface form, is then predicted to be a grammatical sentence of the language being studied. The role and significance of deep structure changed a great deal as Chomsky developed his theories, and since the mid-1990s deep structure no longer features at all (see minimalist program).
It is tempting to regard deep structures as representing meanings and surface structures as representing sentences that express those meanings, but this is not the concept of deep structure favoured by Chomsky. Rather, a sentence more closely corresponds to a deep structure paired with the surface structure derived from it, with an additional phonetic form obtained from processing of the surface structure. It has been variously suggested that the interpretation of a sentence is determined by its deep structure alone, by a combination of its deep and surface structures, or by some other level of representation altogether (logical form), as argued in 1977 by Chomsky's student Robert May. Chomsky may have tentatively entertained the first of these ideas in the early 1960s, but quickly moved away from it to the second, and finally the third. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the generative semantics movement put up a vigorous defence of the first option, sparking an acrimonious debate, the "Linguistics Wars".Harris, Randy Allen. (1995). The linguistics wars. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-509834-X.
Chomsky noted in his early years that by dividing deep structures from surface structures, one could understand "slip of the tongue" moments (where someone says something that he did not intend) as instances where deep structures do not translate into the intended surface structure. Carlson al., Neil R. (2005). Psychology: The Science of Behaviour 3rd Canadian Edition. Pearson. pp. 310-311. ISBN 0-205-45769-X.
The "surface" appeal of the deep structure concept soon led people from unrelated fields (architecture, music, politics, and even ritual studies) to use the term to express various concepts in their own work. In common usage, the term is often used as a synonym for universal grammar—the constraints which Chomsky claims govern the overall forms of linguistic expression available to the human species. This is probably due to the importance of deep structure in Chomsky's earlier work on universal grammar, though his concept of universal grammar is logically independent of any particular theoretical construct, including deep structure.
According to Middleton (1990), Schenkerian analysis of music corresponds to the Chomskyan notion of deep structure, applying to a two-level generative structure for melody, harmony, and rhythm, of which the analysis by Lee (1985) of rhythmical structure is an instance. See also Chord progression.

Greek: Θούλη, Thoúlē), also spelled Thula, Thila, or Thyïlea, is, in classical European literature and maps, a region in the far north. Though often considered to be an island in antiquity, modern interpretations of what was meant by Thule often identify it as Norway,[ref]Bostock & Riley (1893) page 352 (on "Chapter 30 (16) – Britannia") assert: "Opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been numerous in the extreme." The notes on Book IV of Pliny in an 1829 translation into French by Ajasson de Grandsagne mention six, which are taken word-for-word in translation by Bostock & Riley (their words in quotes): ―
Bostock and Riley continue: "It is by no means impossible that under the name of Thule two or more of these localities may have been meant, by different authors writing at distant periods and under different states of geographical knowledge. It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as Parisot remarks, that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with Thylemark in Norway."[/ref] an identification supported by modern calculations. Other interpretations include Orkney, Shetland, and Scandinavia. In the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, Thule was often identified as Iceland or Greenland.

or proto-Inuit were the ancestors of all modern Inuit. They developed in coastal Alaska by AD 1000 and expanded eastwards across Canada, reaching Greenland by the 13th century.Canadian Encyclopedia article on the Thule In the process, they replaced people of the earlier Dorset culture that had previously inhabited the region. The appellation "Thule" originates from the location of Thule (relocated and renamed Qaanaaq in 1953) in northwest Greenland, facing Canada, where the archaeological remains of the people were first found at Comer's Midden. The links between the Thule and the Inuit are biological, cultural, and linguistic.
Evidence supports the idea that the Thule (and also the Dorset, but to a lesser degree) were in contact with the Vikings, who had reached the shores of Canada in the 11th century. In Viking sources, these peoples are called the Skræling. Some Thule migrated southward, in the "Second Expansion" or "Second Phase". By the 13th or 14th century, the Thule had occupied an area currently inhabited by the Central Inuit, and by the 15th century, the Thule replaced the Dorset culture.  Intensified contacts with Europeans began in the 18th century. Compounded by the already disruptive effects of the "Little Ice Age" (1650–1850), the Thule communities broke apart, and the people were henceforward known as the Eskimo and, later, Inuit.

The tourism industry of India is economically important and grows rapidly. The World Travel & Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated INR6.4 trillion or 6.6% of the nation's GDP in 2012. It supported 39.5 million jobs, 7.7% of its total employment. The sector is predicted to grow at an average annual rate of 7.9% from 2013 to 2023. This gives India the third rank among countries with the fastest growing tourism industries over the next decade. India has a large medical tourism sector which is expected to grow at an estimated rate of 30% annually to reach about ₹ 95 billion by 2015.
According to provisional statistics 6.29 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2011, an increase of 8.9% from 5.78 million in 2010. This ranks India as the 38th country in the world in terms of foreign tourist arrivals.

Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and Agra have been the four most visited cities of India by foreign tourists during the year 2011. Worldwide, Chennai is ranked 41 by the number of foreign tourists, while Delhi is ranked at 50, Mumbai at 57 and Agra at 65 and Kolkata at 99.
The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013 ranks India 65th out of 144 countries overall. The report ranks the price competitiveness of India's tourism sector 20th out of 144 countries. It mentions that India has quite good air transport (ranked 39th), particularly given the country’s stage of development, and reasonable ground transport infrastructure (ranked 42nd). Some other aspects of its tourism infrastructure remain somewhat underdeveloped however. The nation has very few hotel rooms per capita by international comparison and low ATM penetration. As per the UNWTO World Tourism Barometer, December 2013, India’s rank in the World Tourism Receipts during 2012 was 16th and rank in international tourist arrivals was 41.

[[Canoe polo]]
CATEGORIES: Canoe polo

Canoe Polo also known as Kayak Polo is one of the competitive disciplines of canoeing, known simply as “polo” by its aficionados. Polo combines canoeing and ball handling skills with an exciting contact team game, where tactics and positional play are as important as the speed and fitness of the individual athletes.
The game requires excellent teamwork and promotes both general canoeing skills and a range of other techniques unique to the sport. Each team has five players on the pitch (and up to three substitutes), who compete to score in their opponents goal which is suspended two metres above the water. The ball can be thrown by hand, or flicked with the paddle to pass between players and shoot at the goal. Pitches can be set up in swimming pools or any stretch of flat water.
The canoes are specifically designed for Polo and are faster and lighter than typical kayaks which give them fantastic manoeuvrability. Paddles are very lightweight and designed with both pulling power and ball control in mind. Nose and tail boat bumpers, body protection, helmets and face-guards are all compulsory.

[[Lotto South]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct lottery games, 2001 establishments in the United States, 2006 disestablishments in the United States

Lotto South was a lottery game in Georgia, Kentucky, and Virginia. It resulted from the September 2001 merger of three smaller jackpot games, one from each of the three lotteries. This was done in an attempt to create larger jackpots; oddly, the 6/49 matrix of Virginia's game was not expanded. 
Drawings took place at WTVR-TV studios in Richmond, Virginia, on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 11:00PM EST/EDT. Jackpots began at $2 million (annuitized); top-prize winners could choose to be paid either in 30 annual payments, or the cash option. The game was jointly administered by the Georgia Lottery, Kentucky Lottery, and Virginia Lottery corporations.
Sales of the game began on September 9, 2001. 
Its record jackpot was $27 million, won on December 31, 2005.
The three lotteries hoped that others in the Southeast would join the game; in fact, South Carolina almost joined, which would have resulted in numbers added to the game's field of 49. [tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] However, South Carolina was unsuccessful in having the drawing nights moved, as, at the time, the SCEL offered only Powerball, which also was drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays. [tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
The game had four prize levels; players needed to match at least three numbers to win. All prizes were paid on a parimutuel basis. The jackpot was paid either in cash or 30 annual payments, according to the winners' wishes.  
In January 2006, it was announced that the game would be retired; its final drawing took place on February 25. That jackpot was not won; the lower-tier prizes doubled (instead of rolling down the entire prize pool, which lotteries often do when a jackpot game is retired.) The three lotteries kept the rest of the money. 
There were plans to revive Lotto South in 2010, in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, as well as in Georgia, Kentucky, Virginia, and possibly Arkansas [tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]; however, plans were put on hold because of the cross-sell expansion of Mega Millions and Powerball on January 31, 2010 (each of the seven lotteries offered either game before then, joining the other on the expansion date.)
Georgia, Kentucky, and Virginia began sales of Decades of Dollars on January 30, 2011. (Arkansas joined on May 3.) Decades of Dollars is drawn on Mondays and Thursdays. Each game costs $2; players choose 6 numbers out of 47, winning by matching at least 2 numbers. The top prize is $250,000 yearly paid in 30 installments; a cash option ($4,000,000) is available. Other  US lotteries may join Decades of Dollars.

The fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875), the philosophical essays of Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), the short stories of Karen Blixen, penname Isak Dinesen, (1885–1962), the plays of Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754), the modern authors such as Herman Bang and Nobel laureate Henrik Pontoppidan and the dense, aphoristic poetry of Piet Hein (1905–1996), have earned international recognition, as have the symphonies of Carl Nielsen (1865–1931). From the mid-1990s, Danish films have attracted international attention, especially those associated with Dogme 95 like those of Lars Von Trier. Indeed, the country has always had a strong tradition of movie making and Carl Theodor Dreyer is recognised as having been one of the world's greatest film directors.

[[Mass spectrometry]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical pathology, Mass spectrometry, Measuring instruments, Scientific instruments, Scientific techniques, Clinical pathology

Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that produces spectra (singular spectrum) of the masses of the atoms or molecules comprising a sample of material.
The spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical structures of molecules, such as peptides and other chemical compounds.  Mass spectrometry works by ionizing chemical compounds to generate charged molecules or molecule fragments and measuring their mass-to-charge ratios.
In a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gas, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break into charged  fragments. These ions are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, typically by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection.[tpl]cite book |author=Sparkman, O. David |title=Mass spectrometry desk reference |publisher=Global View Pub |location=Pittsburgh |year=2000 |isbn=0-9660813-2-3[/tpl] The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio.
